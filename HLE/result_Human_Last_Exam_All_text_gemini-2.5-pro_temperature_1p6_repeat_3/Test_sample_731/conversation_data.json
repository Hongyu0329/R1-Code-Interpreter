    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined for $n \\ge 3$. The question specifies a group of size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$. Let's call this group $G$.\n\nThe standard presentation for $SD_{2^n}$ is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$.\n\nFor our specific group, $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$, we have $n=9$.\nSo the presentation is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{-1+2^{9-2}} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256, which is a maximal subgroup of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements of $G$. This is denoted as $H = G^k$.\n$G^k = \\langle \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} \\rangle$.\nOur goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Note that $G^k = G^{-k}$, so we only need to consider non-negative integers $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. The elements are of two types: $r^i$ and $r^i s$.\n\n1.  **Powers of elements of the form $r^i$**:\n    The $k$-th power is $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. The subgroup generated by all these powers, $\\{r^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$, is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Powers of elements of the form $r^i s$**:\n    We first compute $(r^i s)^2$:\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (srs)^i = r^i (r^{127})^i = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n    (A more direct way: $sr^i = r^{127i}s$, so $(r^is)(r^is) = r^i(sr^i)s = r^i(r^{127i}s)s = r^{i+127i}s^2 = r^{128i}$)\n    Now we can compute $(r^i s)^k$ depending on the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case A: $k$ is odd**\n\nLet $k=2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n- The subgroup generated by $\\{ (r^i)^k \\}$ is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. So, this part generates $\\langle r^1 \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$.\n- Let's look at the powers of elements like $r^i s$:\n  $(r^i s)^k = (r^i s)^{2m+1} = ((r^i s)^2)^m (r^i s) = (r^{128i})^m (r^i s) = r^{128im} r^i s = r^{i(128m+1)}s$.\n- So, $G^k = \\langle \\langle r \\rangle, \\{r^{i(128m+1)}s \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\rangle$.\n- By taking $i=1$, we see that $G^k$ contains the element $r^{128m+1}s$. This element is not in $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n- Since $G^k$ contains the maximal subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and at least one element not in it, $G^k$ must be the whole group $G$.\n- Therefore, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n**Case B: $k$ is even**\n\nLet $k=2m$ for some integer $m$.\n- The subgroup generated by $\\{ (r^i)^k \\}$ is $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$.\n- Let's look at the powers of elements like $r^i s$:\n  $(r^i s)^k = (r^i s)^{2m} = ((r^i s)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\n- The subgroup generated by these elements is $\\langle \\{ r^{128im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\rangle = \\langle r^{128m} \\rangle$. Since $k=2m$, this is $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\n- Combining the generators, $G^k = \\langle r^d, r^{64k} \\rangle$.\n- Let's analyze the relationship between these two generators. We know that $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$, so $d$ divides $k$. Therefore, $d$ must also divide $64k$.\n- This means that $r^{64k}$ is a power of $r^d$, so the subgroup $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^d \\rangle$.\n- Consequently, for any even integer $k$, $G^k = \\langle r^d \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nFrom Case A, we have one power subgroup: $G$.\nFrom Case B, we have power subgroups of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ for some even integer $k$.\n\n- What are the possible values for $d$? Since $k$ is even, $k=2m$. Thus $d = \\gcd(2m, 256)$ must be an even number.\n- The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n- The even divisors of 256 are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. There are 8 such divisors.\n- For each of these even divisors $d'$, we can find an even integer $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 256) = d'$. For instance, we can simply choose $k = d'$.\n- This gives us 8 distinct subgroups:\n  1. $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n  2. $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n  3. $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n  4. $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n  5. $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n  6. $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n  7. $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n  8. $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese 8 subgroups are all cyclic. The subgroup $G$ (from the odd $k$ case) is non-abelian and therefore not cyclic. Thus, $G$ is distinct from these 8 subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of $G = SD_{512}$ is:\n$\\{ G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nCounting these subgroups, we have 1 (from the odd case) + 8 (from the even case) = 9 subgroups.\n\nThis result can be generalized: for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, the number of power subgroups is $n$. In our case, the group is $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$, so $n=9$."
