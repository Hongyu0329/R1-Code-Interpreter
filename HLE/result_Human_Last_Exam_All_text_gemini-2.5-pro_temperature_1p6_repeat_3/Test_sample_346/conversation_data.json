    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the integer `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the fundamental combinators and their meaning as Church numerals.\n\nChurch numerals are a representation of natural numbers using higher-order functions. A numeral `n` is a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` `n` times. We denote the Church numeral `n` as `c_n`.\n\n*   **`I` Combinator**: `I x = x`. When representing Church numerals, `I` acts as `c_1`.\n    `c_1 f x = f(x)`. `I f x = f x`. So, `I` is equivalent to `c_1`.\n\n*   **`S(I)(I)`**: Let's analyze this expression. It's a function that takes two arguments, let's call them `f` and `x`.\n    `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x` (by definition of `S`, where S A B C = A C (B C))\n    `= f (I f x)` (by definition of `I`)\n    `= f (f x)` (by definition of `I`)\n    This is the definition of the Church numeral `c_2`. So, `S(I)(I) = c_2`.\n\n*   **`S(S(K(S))(K))`**: Let's analyze this combinator. We first need to understand the inner part `B = S(K(S))(K)`. Note that `K(S)` and `KS` are equivalent (`K S f = S`). So we can write this as `B = S(KS)K`. Let's see how `B` acts on three arguments `f, g, x`.\n    `B f g x = (S(KS)K f) g x`\n    The term `(S(KS)K f)` reduces to `S(Kf)`.\n    So, we have `(S(Kf) g) x`.\n    Applying `S` again, `S(Kf) g x = (Kf) x (g x) = f (g x)`.\n    This is the function composition combinator, `B`. `B f g = f . g`.\n\n    Now let's analyze `SUCC = S(B) = S(S(KS)K)`. Let's see how it acts on a Church numeral `c_n`.\n    `SUCC c_n f x = (S B c_n) f x`\n    `= (B c_n (f c_n)) x` This is an error in reduction. `S B c_n` is a function. We apply it to `f`.\n    `S B c_n f = B f (c_n f)`.\n    This is a new function which we apply to `x`.\n    `(B f (c_n f)) x = f ( (c_n f) x )`.\n    We know that `(c_n f) x = f^n(x)`.\n    So, `f ( f^n(x) ) = f^{n+1}(x)`.\n    This means `SUCC c_n` is the Church numeral `c_{n+1}`. Therefore, `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the **successor** function (`succ`), which adds one to a Church numeral.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the main expression.\n\nThe full expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n\nThis expression has the structure `S(I) (A) (B)`, where:\n*   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n*   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the parts `A` and `B`.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate `B`:\n`B = SUCC (S(I)(I))`\nUsing our findings from Step 1, `S(I)(I) = c_2`.\nSo, `B = SUCC(c_2) = c_3`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the expression `S(I) (A) (B)`.\nLet `x=I`, `y=A`, `z=B`. The `S` combinator rule is `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\nSo, `S I A B = I B (A B) = B (A B)`.\nSubstituting `B = c_3`, the whole expression `E` reduces to `c_3 (A c_3)`.\n\nTo find the final value, we need to evaluate `A c_3`.\n`A = S(I)(S(I)(K(SUCC(I))))`\nFirst, `SUCC(I) = SUCC(c_1) = c_2`.\nSo, `K(SUCC(I)) = K(c_2)`.\nLet's call `D = S(I)(K(c_2))`.\nThen `A = S(I)(D)`.\n\nNow we evaluate `A c_3`:\n`A c_3 = S(I)(D) c_3`\n`= I c_3 (D c_3)` (using the S-rule as before)\n`= c_3 (D c_3)`\n\nNow we need to evaluate `D c_3`:\n`D c_3 = (S(I)(K(c_2))) c_3`\n`= I c_3 ((K c_2) c_3)`\n`= c_3 (K c_2 c_3)`\nBy definition of `K`, `K x y = x`. So, `K c_2 c_3 = c_2`.\nThus, `D c_3 = c_3 (c_2)`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the application of one Church numeral to another.\n\nLet's determine what `c_m c_n` represents.\n`(c_m c_n) f x = c_m (c_n f) x`\nThis means the function `(c_n f)` is applied `m` times to `x`.\nThe function `(c_n f)` is `λy.f^n(y)`. Let's call it `g`.\n`g(x) = f^n(x)`\n`g(g(x)) = g(f^n(x)) = f^n(f^n(x)) = f^{2n}(x)`\nBy induction, applying `g` `m` times to `x` gives `f^{m*n}(x)`.\nTherefore, `c_m c_n = c_{m*n}`. The application of Church numerals is equivalent to multiplication.\n\nUsing this rule:\n`D c_3 = c_3 (c_2) = c_{3*2} = c_6`.\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `A c_3`:\n`A c_3 = c_3 (D c_3) = c_3 (c_6) = c_{3*6} = c_{18}`.\n\n### Step 5: Final calculation of n.\n\nNow substitute `A c_3` back into the expression for `E`:\n`E = n = c_3 (A c_3) = c_3 (c_{18}) = c_{3*18} = c_{54}`.\n\nThe church integer `n` is 54.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate log_2(n).\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(54)`\nWe know that `2^5 = 32` and `2^6 = 64`.\nSo, `5 < log_2(54) < 6`.\nUsing a calculator: `log_2(54) ≈ 5.7548875`\n\n<<<5.7548875>>>"
