    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the author and the source:** The question mentions Andrei Voznesensky, a prominent Soviet/Russian poet. This immediately places the context within Russian culture and history. The quotes \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are from Voznesensky's work. A search reveals they are from the libretto of the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»).\n\n2.  **Identify the subject of the work:** \"Juno and Avos\" tells the story of the real-life Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov and his voyage to California in 1806. The \"Juno\" and \"Avos\" were the names of his ships. This identifies him as the \"sailor\" in the poem. The phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" poetically refers to his mission of exploration and his famous, albeit tragic, romance with Concepción Argüello.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"lost grave\" clue:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" directly states that at the time Voznesensky wrote the poem (the rock opera premiered in 1981), the location of the subject's grave was unknown. Historically, Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried there, but over the centuries, the original cemetery was neglected and eventually built over, and the exact location of his grave was lost.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"late 1980s\" clue:** The question states that the answer to \"Where is your grave?\" emerged in the late 1980s. Following the massive success of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was a surge of public interest in Rezanov's story. This led to historical investigations and efforts to locate his final resting place. While the *exact* spot remains uncertain, a ceremonial grave and memorial monument were established for him at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk during this period, symbolically \"answering\" the question posed in the poem.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the information:** The man is the central figure of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\" He was a real-life explorer (\"sailor\"). His grave was lost for over a century, a fact lamented in the poem. The renewed interest spurred by the poem led to his grave site being officially recognized and marked with a memorial in the late 1980s. This historical figure is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n6.  **Final answer formulation:** The question asks for the man's last name. The man's name is Nikolai Rezanov. His last name is Rezanov.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **The author:** Recognizing Voznesensky as a Russian poet is the first crucial step.\n*   **The source material:** Connecting the quotes to the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is key to identifying the subject.\n*   **Historical accuracy:** The story of the lost and then ceremonially re-established grave is a real historical event that matches the timeline provided.\n*   **Poetic language:** \"Joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic metaphor, not a literal job title, fitting Rezanov's romantic and adventurous portrayal.\n*   **Specific question:** The request is for the *last name* only.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
