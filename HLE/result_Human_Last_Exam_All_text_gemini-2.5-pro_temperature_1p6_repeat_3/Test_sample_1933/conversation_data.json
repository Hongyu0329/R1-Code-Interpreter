    "An analysis of the question is as follows, breaking it down into methodical steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A model (or structure) $M$ over this schema will have a domain $U$ and interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets of $U$, denoted $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$.\n\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This denotes a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   The formulas are built using only the atomic predicates from $S$.\n    *   The allowed logical symbols are the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), the logical constant true ($\\top$), and the logical constant false ($\\bot$).\n    *   Negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), implication ($\\to$), and the universal quantifier ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension is a measure of the complexity of a hypothesis space (a set of classifiers).\n    *   In this context, the classifiers are defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. For a given model $M$, such a formula defines a subset of the domain $U$: $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n    *   A set of points $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_d\\}$ is said to be **shattered** by a hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}$ if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ that perfectly classifies $X$ according to the partition $(Y, X \\setminus Y)$. That is, for all $x_i \\in X$, $h(x_i)=1$ if $x_i \\in Y$ and $h(x_i)=0$ if $x_i \\notin Y$.\n    *   The VC dimension is the size $d$ of the largest set $X$ that can be shattered.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret \"VC dimension of a logic\"\n\nThe phrase \"VC dimension of a logic\" can be interpreted in a few ways. A common interpretation in contexts like database theory or descriptive complexity, which avoids trivial infinite or overly simple results, is the following:\n*   We fix a model $M$.\n*   We consider the set of all possible classifiers that can be defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ from the logic, interpreted in this fixed model $M$. This set of definable subsets of the domain of $M$ forms our hypothesis space, $\\mathcal{H}_M$.\n*   We calculate the VC dimension of this space, $VC(\\mathcal{H}_M)$.\n*   The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum (supremum) VC dimension achievable over all possible choices of the model $M$. Formally, $VC(\\text{Logic}) = \\sup_M VC(\\mathcal{H}_M)$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of formulas and definable sets\n\nLet's fix a model $M$. We need to understand the hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}_M$, which is the collection of all subsets of the domain $U$ definable by formulas $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic with one free variable $x$ can be analyzed. Any subformula within $\\phi(x)$ that does not contain $x$ as a free variable is a *sentence*. For a fixed model $M$, any sentence is either true or false.\n\nConsider a generic formula $\\phi(x)$. By distributing quantifiers and rearranging conjunctions, it can be shown that any such formula is equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)) \\land \\beta$\nwhere $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and $\\beta$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). The formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$ are also available.\n\nFor the fixed model $M$:\n*   The sentence $\\beta$ is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\not\\models \\beta$, the formula defines the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $M \\models \\beta$, the formula is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This formula defines the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nSo, for any given model $M$, the collection of definable sets, $\\mathcal{H}_M$, is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the predicate interpretations $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$:\n$\\mathcal{H}_M \\subseteq \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n\nBy choosing a model $M$ where every auxiliary sentence we might need is true (e.g., ensuring every $P_i^M$ is non-empty makes any sentence of the form $\\exists y P_i(y)$ true), we can ensure that $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is precisely the set of all intersections of the base predicates. We aim to find the supremum of the VC dimension, so we should consider such a \"rich\" model.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the VC dimension\n\nWe need to find the VC dimension of the hypothesis space $\\mathcal{H}$ consisting of all sets that can be formed by intersecting a selection of four base sets $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$. Let $k=4$ be the number of predicates.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nLet's show that the VC dimension cannot be greater than 4. Let $X$ be any set of 5 points. To shatter $X$, we would need to generate all $2^5 = 32$ subsets of $X$. Our hypotheses are of the form $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. There are only $2^4 = 16$ possible choices for the index set $I$. Thus, we can generate at most 16 distinct subsets of $X$. Since $16 < 32$, we cannot shatter a set of 5 points. Therefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5. So, $VC(\\mathcal{H}) \\le 4$.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nLet's show that the VC dimension is at least 4. To do this, we must demonstrate that there exists a model $M$ and a set of 4 points $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ that can be shattered.\n\nLet's define the model $M$ over the domain $U=X$. We define the predicate interpretations $P_i^M$ as follows:\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let $P_i^M = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\n\nNow we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a hypothesis in our space that selects exactly $Y$. A hypothesis is of the form $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nGiven a target subset $Y \\subseteq X$, define the index set $I_Y$ as follows:\n$I_Y = \\{i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$.\n\nNow consider the hypothesis $C_{I_Y} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M$. Let's identify the elements of this set:\n$C_{I_Y} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$\n\nBy our definition of $I_Y$, $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$ is exactly the set of elements in $X$ that are *not* in $Y$. That is, $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus Y$.\n\nSo, $C_{I_Y} = X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$.\n\nThis construction shows that we can generate any subset $Y$ of $X$. Therefore, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4, it must be exactly 4."
