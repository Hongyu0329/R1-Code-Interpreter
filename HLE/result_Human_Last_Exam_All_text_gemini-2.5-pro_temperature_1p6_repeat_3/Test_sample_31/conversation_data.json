    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, to fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case, we need to determine the permutation of the four corner pieces and four edge pieces of the last layer, given that their top-facing stickers are already correctly oriented.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Pieces and Stickers in Play\n\n*   **Last Layer Pieces:** The last layer consists of 8 pieces: 4 corners and 4 edges.\n*   **Top Face Solved:** The PLL stage begins after OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer), meaning all top-facing stickers (e.g., all yellow stickers) are correctly oriented. We do not need to observe these top stickers.\n*   **Non-Top-Facing Stickers:**\n    *   Each of the 4 corner pieces has 2 non-top-facing stickers (side stickers). Total = 4 * 2 = 8 stickers.\n    *   Each of the 4 edge pieces has 1 non-top-facing sticker (side sticker). Total = 4 * 1 = 4 stickers.\n*   **Total Information:** There are a total of 8 + 4 = 12 non-top-facing stickers on the last layer. Observing all 12 would certainly be enough, but the question asks for the minimum.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Goal and the Constraints\n\n*   **Goal:** To uniquely identify the correct PLL case out of the 21 possibilities (plus the solved state). This means we need enough visual information to eliminate all other 20 cases.\n*   **\"Identifying\" a piece:** To know which piece is which (e.g., to know this is the Front-Right-Top corner), we must see its two non-top-facing stickers (e.g., the front color and the right color). To identify an edge piece, we need to see its single non-top-facing sticker.\n*   **The Parity Constraint:** A crucial rule of the Rubik's Cube is that any legal move results in an even permutation of pieces. You cannot, for example, swap just two pieces (an odd permutation) without some other change. The combined permutation of corners and edges for any valid PLL case must be even. A single swap (a 2-cycle) is an odd permutation. Two swaps make an even permutation. A 3-cycle is an even permutation.\n\n### Step 3: Test Insufficiency for a Low Number of Stickers (e.g., 6)\n\nLet's see if observing 6 stickers is enough. With 6 stickers, we could, for example, fully identify two corner pieces (2*2=4 stickers) and two edge pieces (2*1=2 stickers).\n\n*   **Scenario:** Let's say we observe the four pieces on the back and left sides of the cube: the Back-Left corner (cBL), the Back-Right corner (cBR), the Back edge (eB), and the Left edge (eL). To fully identify them requires seeing all their side stickers. The number of stickers would be (2+2+1+1)=6.\n*   **Observation:** Imagine we look at these four pieces and see that they are all in their correct, solved positions.\n*   **Ambiguity Check:** Is this observation unique to one PLL case?\n    1.  **Possibility 1: The \"Solved\" Case.** If the cube is fully solved, our observation of the back and left pieces being correct is true. This is a valid state.\n    2.  **Possibility 2: The \"T-Permutation\".** A T-Perm swaps the two front corners (cFR, cFL) and the two front edges (eF, uR, depending on orientation). Crucially, a T-perm does not move the back or left pieces at all. Therefore, if the cube was in a T-Perm state, our observation that the back and left pieces are correct would also be true.\n*   **Conclusion for 6 Stickers:** Since our observation (6 stickers showing 4 pieces are solved) is consistent with two different, valid PLL cases (\"Solved\" and \"T-Perm\"), 6 stickers is not enough to guarantee a unique identification.\n\n### Step 4: Test Sufficiency for a Higher Number of Stickers (e.g., 7)\n\nNow let's see if observing 7 stickers is enough. With 7 stickers, we could, for example, fully identify two corner pieces (2*2=4 stickers) and three edge pieces (3*1=3 stickers).\n\n*   **Scenario:** We observe the identities and positions of three edge pieces (e.g., Front, Right, and Back) and two corner pieces (e.g., Front-Right and Front-Left).\n*   **What we know:**\n    *   **Edge Permutation:** By observing 3 out of 4 edges, we can determine the entire edge permutation. If we know where 3 pieces are, the location of the 4th is automatically determined.\n    *   **Corner Permutation (Partial):** We know the identity and position of two corners. The remaining two corners (Back-Left and Back-Right) are unobserved.\n*   **Ambiguity Check:** The only remaining uncertainty is the state of the two unobserved corners (cBL and cBR). There are two possibilities for them:\n    1.  They are in their correct positions.\n    2.  They are swapped with each other.\n*   **Applying the Parity Constraint:** Let's call the complete cube state for the first possibility `P1` and for the second possibility `P2`. `P2` is identical to `P1` except for the single swap of the two unobserved corners. Mathematically, `P2 = P1 * (cBL, cBR)`.\n    *   A single swap is an odd permutation.\n    *   This means that `P1` and `P2` must have opposite parity. If `P1` is an even permutation, `P2` must be odd, and vice versa.\n    *   Since all solvable states on a Rubik's Cube must have even parity, only one of these two possibilities (`P1` or `P2`) can be a valid, reachable PLL case. The other is an impossible state.\n*   **Conclusion for 7 Stickers:** Because the fundamental parity rule of the cube resolves the only possible ambiguity, the information from 7 stickers (in this configuration) is sufficient to uniquely identify the PLL case.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   We have proven by counterexample that 6 stickers are not sufficient.\n*   We have proven by applying the parity rule that 7 stickers are sufficient.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
