    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$)**\nThe primary and most common method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride is through the direct chemical reaction between elemental xenon (Xe) and fluorine ($F_2$) gas.\n\n**Step 2: Write the Chemical Equation**\nThe balanced chemical equation for this synthesis is:\n$Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction Conditions**\nThis reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. However, it does not occur spontaneously at room temperature. A significant amount of energy, known as activation energy, is required to initiate the reaction. This energy is needed primarily to break the strong covalent bond in the fluorine molecules ($F_2$). This activation energy is typically supplied in the form of heat.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Optimal Conditions for Efficient Production**\nThe efficiency of the reaction depends on several factors, including temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants. The choice of these conditions determines not only the rate of reaction but also the specific product formed (e.g., $XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, or $XeF_6$).\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** To produce $XeF_4$, an excess of fluorine is used, typically a xenon-to-fluorine molar ratio of 1:5.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is carried out at elevated pressures, commonly around 6 atmospheres.\n*   **Temperature:** This is the crucial factor for the question. The reaction mixture must be heated to provide sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Role of Temperature and the Meaning of \"Efficiently\"**\n*   \"Efficiently\" means that the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate to produce a good yield of the desired product in a practical amount of time.\n*   If the temperature is too low (e.g., room temperature or below), the reactant molecules will not have enough kinetic energy to react upon collision. The reaction rate will be practically zero, making the process highly inefficient.\n*   As the temperature is increased, the reaction rate increases. Established laboratory and industrial methods have found an optimal temperature range for this synthesis.\n*   According to extensive chemical literature, the standard and most commonly cited condition for the efficient synthesis of $XeF_4$ is to heat the reactant mixture to **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds rapidly to completion within a few hours.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Given Answer Choices**\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is higher than necessary. While it would likely produce $XeF_4$, it could also lead to decomposition or the formation of other products, making it less controlled and potentially less efficient than the optimal temperature.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the textbook temperature for the efficient, controlled synthesis of $XeF_4$. It represents the standard condition where the reaction rate becomes high enough for practical production.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction would be significantly slower than at 400 °C. It would likely take a very long time to get a substantial yield, and thus the process would not be considered \"efficient.\"\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for the thermal reaction. The reaction rate would be negligible, and no significant amount of $XeF_4$ would be produced.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which the production is *still efficient*. Based on the analysis, while some reaction might occur at temperatures slightly below 400 °C, the rate drops off significantly. 400 °C is the recognized benchmark temperature where the synthesis becomes efficient. Therefore, among the choices provided, 400 °C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
