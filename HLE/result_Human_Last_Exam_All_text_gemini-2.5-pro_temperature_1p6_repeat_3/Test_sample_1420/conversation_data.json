    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Theoretical Framework\nThe question is set in the context of the renormalization group (RG) theory and asks for a critical exponent, α, for the specific heat. The method specified is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, which is a powerful technique for calculating critical exponents in dimensions ($d$) below the upper critical dimension ($d_c$).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Model and Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)\nThe problem refers to a general \"system\" undergoing a phase transition. In the context of RG, these systems are categorized into universality classes, most commonly described by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson O(n) vector model. This model has an n-component order parameter.\nFor the O(n) model, the upper critical dimension, above which mean-field theory is correct, is **$d_c = 4$**.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Parameter\nThe epsilon expansion calculates physical quantities as a power series in the parameter $\\epsilon$, which measures the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\nGiven the spatial dimension is $d=3$, we have:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\nThe goal is to find the series expansion for α in terms of $\\epsilon$, and then substitute $\\epsilon=1$ to get an estimate for the $d=3$ case.\n\n### Step 4: Find the General Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$\nIn RG, the critical exponents are related by scaling relations. The hyperscaling relation connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\nRearranging, we get:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\nThe epsilon expansion (to first order, or \"one-loop\") gives the following expression for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ for the O(n) model:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the formula for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nWe expand this expression and keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2n+4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nThis is the general first-order result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for the O(n) model.\n\n### Step 5: Specify the System (Choosing 'n')\nThe problem does not specify the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. The value of α depends on 'n'. However, in such problems where a specific system is not mentioned, it is standard practice to consider the most fundamental and widely studied case: the **Ising model**.\nFor the Ising model, the order parameter is a scalar, so **n=1**.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Value\nWe now have all the pieces to calculate the value of α:\n*   $n=1$ (Ising model)\n*   $\\epsilon=1$ (for d=3)\n*   The first-order formula: $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot 1$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 9}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Approximation:** The epsilon expansion provides an approximation. For $\\epsilon=1$, the expansion is not guaranteed to converge quickly, and the first-order result is an estimate. For the 3D Ising model, the accepted value is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, while our estimate is $1/6 \\approx 0.167$. It gives the right order of magnitude and sign.\n*   **Dependence on 'n':** The critical exponent $\\alpha$ is not fully universal; it depends on the universality class, which is characterized by the dimension $d$ and the symmetry of the order parameter (captured by 'n').\n*   **Assumption of n=1:** The choice of n=1 is an assumption based on the common practices for such physics problems, where the Ising model serves as the canonical example. For other values of n (e.g., n=2 for the XY model or n=3 for the Heisenberg model), the result would be different.\n*   **Hyperscaling:** The validity of the hyperscaling relation $d\\nu=2-\\alpha$ is a key part of this derivation. This relation holds for dimensions $d \\le d_c$.\n\nThe final result of the first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α in a 3-dimensional Ising-like system is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
