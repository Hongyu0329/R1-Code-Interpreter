    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the equations $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$. The value of $b$ depends on the interval of the parameter $t$. We need to analyze the curve in two parts.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    In this interval, $b=1$. The parametric equations are:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = \\sin t$\n    Squaring and adding these equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin (0,0).\n    As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n    *   $y = \\sin t$ is always non-negative, varying from $\\sin(0)=0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\n    So, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle. The range of coordinates for this part is $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    In this interval, $b=5$. The parametric equations are:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = 5 \\sin t$\n    From these equations, we can write $\\cos t = x$ and $\\sin t = y/5$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0) with a horizontal semi-axis of length 1 and a vertical semi-axis of length 5.\n    As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ varies from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n    *   $y = 5\\sin t$ is always negative (or zero at the endpoints, which are not included), varying from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\n    So, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse. The range of coordinates for this part is $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall dimensions of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall range of x and y coordinates, which defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-range (Width):**\n    For the first part, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    For the second part, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    The combined range for $x$ is $[-1, 1]$.\n    The minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$.\n    The maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$.\n    The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-range (Height):**\n    For the first part, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n    For the second part, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n    The combined range for $y$ is the union of these two intervals, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest enclosing square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or encloses this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as both the width and the height of the figure.\n\nLet $S$ be the side length of the square. We must have:\n$S \\ge W = 2$\n$S \\ge H = 6$\n\nTo find the *smallest* possible square, we must choose the smallest value for $S$ that satisfies both conditions. This means we must take the maximum of the width and height.\nSide length of the smallest square, $S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula Area = Side * Side.\nArea = $S^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognize that the parameter `b` is piecewise, creating a composite figure from two different curves (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n2.  Correctly determine the range of x and y values for each part of the curve and then for the entire figure.\n3.  Understand that the side length of the smallest axis-aligned bounding square is determined by the larger dimension (width or height) of the figure.\n4.  The final step is to square the side length to get the area.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Maximum extent in x-direction: $x \\in [-1, 1]$, width = 2.\n*   Maximum extent in y-direction: $y \\in [-5, 1]$, height = 6.\n*   Side of the smallest enclosing square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   Area of the square = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
