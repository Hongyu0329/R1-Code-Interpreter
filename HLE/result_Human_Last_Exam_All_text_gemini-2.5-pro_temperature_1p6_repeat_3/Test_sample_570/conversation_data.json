    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem requires that `D` has a non-empty intersection with every line `L_{p,q}` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's denote the set of coprime integer vectors as `Z_c^2 = {(p,q) ∈ Z² | gcd(p,q) = 1}`.\nThe condition \"D intersects the line `px + qy = 1`\" means that there exists a point `(x₀, y₀) ∈ D` such that `px₀ + qy₀ = 1`.\n\nLet's consider the family of lines. If `(p, q)` is a pair of coprime integers, then `(-p, -q)` is also a pair of coprime integers.\nTherefore, if the line `px + qy = 1` is in the family, the line `(-p)x + (-q)y = 1` (which is `px + qy = -1`) must also be in the family.\n\nSo, for any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the convex domain `D` must intersect both lines:\n1.  `px + qy = 1`\n2.  `px + qy = -1`\n\nFor a given vector `u = (p, q)`, let `f(x, y) = px + qy = u ⋅ (x, y)`. The set of values `f(x, y)` takes for `(x, y) ∈ D` forms a closed interval `[m, M]`, where `m = inf_{(x,y)∈D} (u⋅(x,y))` and `M = sup_{(x,y)∈D} (u⋅(x,y))`.\nThe condition that `D` intersects both lines `u⋅(x,y) = 1` and `u⋅(x,y) = -1` means that the interval `[m, M]` must contain both `1` and `-1`. This implies:\n`m ≤ -1` and `M ≥ 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Using the Support Function\n\nThe support function of a convex set `D`, denoted `h_D(u)`, is defined as `h_D(u) = sup_{(x,y)∈D} (u⋅(x,y))`.\nUsing this definition, we have `M = h_D(u)`.\nAlso, `m = inf_{(x,y)∈D} (u⋅(x,y)) = -sup_{(x,y)∈D} (-u⋅(x,y)) = -h_D(-u)`.\n\nSo, the conditions `m ≤ -1` and `M ≥ 1` translate to:\n1.  `h_D(u) ≥ 1`\n2.  `-h_D(-u) ≤ -1` which is `h_D(-u) ≥ 1`\n\nSince `u = (p, q)` belongs to `Z_c^2` implies that `-u = (-p, -q)` also belongs to `Z_c^2`, these two conditions are redundant. The single condition is:\n`h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ Z_c^2`.\n\nThe problem is now to find the minimum area of a convex set `D` whose support function satisfies `h_D(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Argument by Symmetrization and Duality\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain that satisfies the condition. Let `D_s = (1/2)(D - D)` be its centrally symmetric counterpart (Minkowski difference).\nThe support function of `D_s` is `h_{D_s}(u) = (1/2)(h_D(u) + h_D(-u))`.\nSince `D` is a solution, we have `h_D(u) ≥ 1` and `h_D(-u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ Z_c^2`.\nTherefore, `h_{D_s}(u) ≥ (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1`. This means `D_s` is also a solution.\nBy the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(D_s) ≤ Area(D)`. This means that the minimum area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain. We can therefore assume `D` is centrally symmetric with its center at the origin.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `D`, its polar dual is `D^* = {y | x⋅y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ D}`.\nThe support function of `D` can be related to its dual `D^*`. Specifically, for `u ∈ int(D^*)`, we have `h_D(u) < 1`.\nThe condition `h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ Z_c^2` implies that no vector `u` from `Z_c^2` can be in the interior of `D^*`.\nSo, `int(D^*) ∩ Z_c^2 = ∅`.\n\nAny integer vector `v ∈ Z²` can be written as `v = d * u`, where `d = gcd(v)` and `u ∈ Z_c^2`. Since `D^*` is a convex set containing the origin, if it contains an integer point `v` in its interior, it must also contain `u = (1/d)v` in its interior. Therefore, the condition `int(D^*) ∩ Z_c^2 = ∅` is equivalent to `int(D^*) ∩ Z² = {0}`.\n\nSo, the dual body `D^*` must be a centrally symmetric convex set whose interior contains no non-zero integer lattice points.\n\n### Step 4: Minimizing Area(D) by Maximizing Area(D*)\n\nWe want to find the minimum `Area(D)`. The Mahler volume of a centrally symmetric convex body `D` is `V(D) = Area(D) × Area(D^*)`. By a fundamental result in convex geometry (related to Blaschke-Santaló and Mahler's conjecture), we have `8 ≤ V(D) ≤ π²/2`. The lower bound `Area(D) × Area(D^*) ≥ 8` is crucial here.\n\nTo minimize `Area(D)`, we need to maximize `Area(D^*)`. The problem is now transformed into:\nFind the maximum possible area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K` in the plane such that its interior contains no integer points other than the origin (`int(K) ∩ Z² = {0}`).\n\nBy Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem, if a centrally symmetric convex set `K` has `Area(K) > 4`, it must contain a non-zero integer point. This implies that any such `K` must have `Area(K) ≤ 4`.\nThe maximum area of 4 is achieved. For example, the square `Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` has `Area(Q) = 4` and its interior `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points.\n\nSo, the maximum possible area for `D^*` is 4. Let's set `D^*` to be this extremal set, the square `Q`.\n`D^* = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Minimal Area\n\nThe minimal area domain `D` is the polar dual of the maximal area `D^*`.\n`D = (D^*)^* = Q^* = {y | x⋅y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ Q}`.\n\nLet `y = (y₁, y₂)`. The condition is `x₁y₁ + x₂y₂ ≤ 1` for all `x₁ ∈ [-1, 1]` and `x₂ ∈ [-1, 1]`.\nThe maximum value of `x₁y₁ + x₂y₂` over the square `Q` is attained at one of its vertices. The maximum is `|y₁| + |y₂|`.\nSo, the condition `sup_{x∈Q}(x⋅y) ≤ 1` becomes `|y₁| + |y₂| ≤ 1`.\n\nThe minimal convex domain `D` is therefore `D = {(y₁, y₂) | |y₁| + |y₂| ≤ 1}`.\nThis domain is a square with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`. Its diagonals have length 2.\nThe area of this domain is `(1/2) × (diagonal 1) × (diagonal 2) = (1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe argument shows that any valid domain must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific domain, the square `{|x|+|y|≤1}`, which satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2. Thus, the minimal area is 2.\n\nFinal careful points check:\n1.  **Family of lines:** Correctly interpreted to include `px+qy=±1`.\n2.  **Condition on D:** Correctly formulated in terms of the support function `h_D`.\n3.  **Symmetrization:** Correctly argued that the minimum is achieved for a symmetric body.\n4.  **Duality:** The duality argument transforms the problem correctly.\n5.  **Minkowski's Theorem:** Correctly applied to find the maximum area of the dual body.\n6.  **Polar dual calculation:** The dual of the square is correctly calculated as the diamond.\n7.  **Final area:** The area of the resulting domain is correct.\n\nThe analysis is sound.\n\n<<<2>>>"
