    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the automorphism group.**\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ has order 3. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let the group be $G = \\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$, where $\\sigma$ is an automorphism of order 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the action of the group on the graph.**\nThe group $G$ acts on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$. The size of any orbit of this action must divide the order of the group, which is 3. So, the vertex orbits can have size 1 (fixed points) or 3. Similarly, edge orbits can have size 1 or 3.\nA simple graph cannot have a fixed edge under a non-trivial automorphism (an edge $\\{u,v\\}$ being fixed means either $u,v$ are both fixed, or they are swapped. Swapping gives an automorphism of order 2, which is not in $C_3$). Therefore, all edges must lie in orbits of size 3. This implies that the total number of edges, $e$, must be a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 3: Rule out small values of $e$.**\nWe are looking for the *smallest* such integer $e$. Since $e$ must be a multiple of 3, we can check values $e=3, 6, 9, \\dots$.\n\n*   **Case $e=3$:**\n    The graph must have exactly 3 edges, forming a single edge orbit.\n    The only connected graphs with 3 edges are the path graph $P_4$ and the star graph $K_{1,3}$.\n    - For $P_4$, the automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, with size 2. This is not the required group.\n    - For $K_{1,3}$, the three leaves can be permuted arbitrarily. The automorphism group is the symmetric group $S_3$, with size 6. This is not the required group.\n    - The triangle graph $C_3$ also has 3 edges. Its automorphism group is the dihedral group $D_3$, with size 6.\n    Thus, no graph with $e=3$ satisfies the conditions.\n\n*   **Case $e=6$:**\n    The graph must have 6 edges, consisting of two orbits of 3 edges each. We can try to construct such a graph. Let the automorphism of order 3 be $\\sigma$.\n    A graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ cannot be vertex-transitive. If it were, for $|V|=n$, we would have $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=n \\cdot |\\mathrm{Stab}(v)|$. For $n>3$, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$ would be a multiple of $n$, so it couldn't be 3. For $n=3$, the only connected graphs are $K_3$ ($|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$). So the graph must not be vertex-transitive.\n    This implies that there must be at least two distinct vertex orbits. This can be achieved by having a fixed point, or having multiple 3-vertex orbits with different properties.\n\n    Let's try to construct a graph with a fixed vertex $v_0$. The remaining vertices must be in orbits of size 3. Let's take the minimum, one orbit $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$. Let $\\sigma = (a_1 a_2 a_3)$ and $\\sigma(v_0)=v_0$.\n    To make the graph connected, $v_0$ must connect to the orbit $A$. This implies the edge orbit $\\{\\{v_0,a_1\\}, \\{v_0,a_2\\}, \\{v_0,a_3\\}\\}$ must exist. This is 3 edges.\n    The resulting graph is $K_{1,3}$, which we've already seen has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. We need to add another set of 3 edges to break the extra symmetries (the reflections). The only place to add edges is within the orbit $A$. Adding $\\{\\{a_1, a_2\\}, \\{a_2, a_3\\}, \\{a_3, a_1\\}\\}$ results in the graph $K_4$ (the wheel graph $W_3$), for which $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=S_4$, size 24.\n    \n    Let's try a graph with no fixed points. It must have at least two vertex orbits, say $A=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$. So $n=6$. The automorphism is $\\sigma=(a_1 a_2 a_3)(b_1 b_2 b_3)$. To be connected with 6 edges, we could have a set of edges within an orbit (e.g., a $C_3$ on $A$) and a set of edges connecting $A$ and $B$.\n    Let the edges be $E_A = \\{\\{a_1,a_2\\}, \\{a_2,a_3\\}, \\{a_3,a_1\\}\\}$ and $E_{AB}=\\{\\{a_1,b_1\\}, \\{a_2,b_2\\}, \\{a_3,b_3\\}\\}$. The graph has $e=6$. The vertices in $A$ have degree 3, and vertices in $B$ have degree 1 (they are leaves). An automorphism must map $A \\to A$ and $B \\to B$. However, one can verify that the permutation $\\phi = (a_1 a_2)(b_1 b_2)$ is an automorphism. Since the group contains an element of order 2 ($\\phi$) and order 3 ($\\sigma$), its order is at least 6 (it is $S_3$).\n    \n    All attempts to build a graph with $e=6$ edges lead to a group with order greater than 3, typically 6, because the constructions are not complex enough to eliminate reflectional symmetries.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a candidate for $e=9$.**\nLet's try to build a graph with $e=9$, which would consist of three edge orbits. We need to introduce enough asymmetry (or \"chirality\") to forbid any symmetries other than the powers of $\\sigma$. A successful construction involves a fixed point and two 3-vertex orbits.\n*   **Vertices ($n=7$):**\n    - A fixed vertex $v_0$.\n    - An orbit $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$.\n    - An orbit $B = \\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$.\n    The automorphism of order 3 is $\\sigma=(a_1 a_2 a_3)(b_1 b_2 b_3)$. It fixes $v_0$.\n\n*   **Edges ($e=9$):** We introduce three edge orbits.\n    1.  Connect $v_0$ to orbit $A$: $E_1 = \\{\\{v_0, a_1\\}, \\{v_0, a_2\\}, \\{v_0, a_3\\}\\}$. (3 edges)\n    2.  Connect orbit $A$ to orbit $B$ \"directly\": $E_2 = \\{\\{a_1, b_1\\}, \\{a_2, b_2\\}, \\{a_3, b_3\\}\\}$. (3 edges)\n    3.  Connect orbit $A$ to orbit $B$ with a \"twist\": $E_3 = \\{\\{a_1, b_2\\}, \\{a_2, b_3\\}, \\{a_3, b_1\\}\\}$. (3 edges)\n    The total number of edges is $e=|E_1|+|E_2|+|E_3|=3+3+3=9$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the candidate graph.**\nLet $\\gamma$ be the graph with $V=\\{v_0\\}\\cup A \\cup B$ and $E=E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3$.\n1.  **Connected:** The graph is connected. Any vertex in $B$ is connected to a vertex in $A$. All vertices in $A$ are connected to $v_0$.\n2.  **Automorphism Group:** Let's analyze $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$.\n    *   **Vertex Degrees:**\n        - $\\deg(v_0) = 3$. Its neighbors are $\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$.\n        - $\\deg(a_1) = 3$ (connected to $v_0, b_1, b_2$). All $a_i$ have degree 3.\n        - $\\deg(b_1) = 2$ (connected to $a_1, a_3$). All $b_i$ have degree 2.\n    *   An automorphism $\\phi$ must preserve degrees. So $\\phi$ must map the set of degree-2 vertices $B$ to itself, and the set of degree-3 vertices $\\{v_0\\} \\cup A$ to itself.\n    *   Consider the neighborhoods. $N(v_0)=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$. All neighbors of $v_0$ have degree 3.\n        $N(a_1)=\\{v_0, b_1, b_2\\}$. The neighbors of $a_1$ have degrees $\\{3, 2, 2\\}$.\n        Since the neighborhood degree sequences are different, $v_0$ is not equivalent to any $a_i$. Thus, any automorphism must fix $v_0$: $\\phi(v_0) = v_0$.\n    *   Because $\\phi(v_0)=v_0$, it must map $N(v_0)$ to itself. So, $\\phi(A) = A$.\n    *   Since $\\phi$ maps $V$ to $V$ and maps $A$ to $A$, it must map the remaining vertices $B$ to $B$.\n    *   Let $\\phi$ act on $A$ by the permutation $\\pi \\in S_3$, so $\\phi(a_i) = a_{\\pi(i)}$. Let it act on $B$ by $\\rho \\in S_3$, so $\\phi(b_i) = b_{\\rho(i)}$.\n    *   Adjacency for $E_2$: For $\\{a_i, b_i\\}$ to be an edge, $\\{\\phi(a_i), \\phi(b_i)\\} = \\{a_{\\pi(i)}, b_{\\rho(i)}\\}$ must be an edge. This forces $\\rho(i)=\\pi(i)$, so $\\rho=\\pi$.\n    *   Adjacency for $E_3$: For $\\{a_i, b_{i+1}\\}$ (indices mod 3) to be an edge, $\\{\\phi(a_i), \\phi(b_{i+1})\\} = \\{a_{\\pi(i)}, b_{\\pi(i+1)}\\}$ must be an edge. The edges in $E_3$ are of the form $\\{a_j, b_{j+1}\\}$. This means we must have $\\pi(i+1) \\equiv \\pi(i)+1 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   This condition on the permutation $\\pi$ means that $\\pi$ must be a cyclic shift. The only permutations in $S_3$ that satisfy this are the identity and the two 3-cycles:\n        - $\\pi = id$: $\\pi(i)=i$. This is a valid automorphism (the identity).\n        - $\\pi = (1\\;2\\;3)$: $\\pi(i)=i+1 \\pmod 3$. This corresponds to our generator $\\sigma$.\n        - $\\pi = (1\\;3\\;2)$: $\\pi(i)=i+2 \\pmod 3$. This corresponds to $\\sigma^2$.\n    *   Reflections like $\\pi=(1\\;2)$ do not satisfy the condition: $\\pi(1+1)=\\pi(2)=1$ whereas $\\pi(1)+1 = 2+1=3$. So $1 \\ne 3$.\n    *   Thus, the only automorphisms are the identity, $\\sigma$, and $\\sigma^2$. This forms the cyclic group of order 3.\n\nWe have found a simple, connected graph with 9 edges whose automorphism group has order 3. Since we have demonstrated that $e=3$ and $e=6$ are not possible, the smallest such number of edges is 9.\n\n>>> 9"
