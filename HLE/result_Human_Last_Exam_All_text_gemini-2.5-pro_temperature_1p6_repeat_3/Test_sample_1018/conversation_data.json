    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. We denote the simplicial volume of a manifold $M$ by $\\|M\\|$.\n\n**Step 1: The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume**\n\nThe first key result we need is Gromov's product formula for simplicial volumes. For two closed, connected, orientable manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$$ \\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\| $$\nThis formula holds as an equality if at least one of the factors has non-zero simplicial volume. As we will see, this condition is met.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   $M$ is an oriented closed surface of genus 31, so its dimension is $m=2$.\n*   $N$ is an oriented closed surface of genus 17, so its dimension is $n=2$.\n\nApplying the product formula to our specific problem:\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{2+2}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| $$\n\n**Step 2: The Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface**\n\nThe second key result is the formula for the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$.\n*   If $g=0$, $\\Sigma_0 = S^2$ (the sphere), and $\\|\\Sigma_0\\| = 0$.\n*   If $g \\ge 1$, the surface is hyperbolic. Its simplicial volume is given by a formula related to its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. The formula is:\n    $$ \\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| $$\n    Since $g \\ge 1$, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g \\le 0$, so $|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = -(2-2g) = 2g - 2$.\n    Therefore, for $g \\ge 1$, we have:\n    $$ \\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4 $$\nSince the genera are 31 and 17 (both $\\ge 1$), both surfaces have non-zero simplicial volume, which justifies the use of the equality in the product formula.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Individual Simplicial Volumes**\n\nNow we compute the simplicial volume for each surface.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$.\n    $$ \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120 $$\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$.\n    $$ \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Binomial Coefficient**\n\nNext, we calculate the combinatorial factor from the product formula.\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 $$\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, we substitute all the calculated values back into the product formula from Step 1.\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| $$\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 $$\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\times 64 $$\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 46080 $$\n\n---\n**List of Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Formula:** It's crucial to use the correct product formula for simplicial volumes, including the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m}$. Forgetting this coefficient is a common mistake.\n2.  **Verify Conditions for the Formula:** The product formula is an equality because the simplicial volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are non-zero (since $g \\ge 1$). The manifolds are also closed, connected, and orientable as required.\n3.  **Use the Correct Formula for Surface Volume:** The formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$ is only valid for $g \\ge 1$. For $g=0$, the volume is 0. Here, the genera are 31 and 17, so the formula applies.\n4.  **Accurate Arithmetic:** All calculations, including the genus formula, the binomial coefficient, and the final multiplication, must be performed carefully.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31)-4 = 120$\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17)-4 = 64$\n    *   $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$\n    *   Final product: $6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\nThe analysis follows these points carefully to arrive at the correct result.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
