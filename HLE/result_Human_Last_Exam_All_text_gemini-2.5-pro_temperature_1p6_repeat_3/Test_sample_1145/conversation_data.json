    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, also known as a particle in a box. The box has length 'a', extending from x = 0 to x = a.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy eigenstate, which corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 2.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle in the small interval from x1 = 0.495a to x2 = 0.505a.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    ψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n*   The probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n*   The probability of finding the particle in an interval from x1 to x2 is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    Probability = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx\n\n**3. Set up the Specific Integral for the Problem**\n\n*   Given values:\n    *   n = 2\n    *   x1 = 0.495a\n    *   x2 = 0.505a\n*   The wavefunction for n = 2 is:\n    ψ_2(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n*   The probability density is:\n    |ψ_2(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n*   The probability integral is:\n    Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n**4. Analyze the Integration Interval (A Careful Point)**\n\n*   The interval is [0.495a, 0.505a]. It is centered at x = 0.5a = a/2.\n*   The width of the interval is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a.\n*   Since the interval is very small, one might be tempted to use the approximation:\n    Probability ≈ |ψ_2(x_center)|² * Δx\n*   However, let's evaluate the probability density at the center (x = a/2):\n    |ψ_2(a/2)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * 0² = 0.\n*   This is a critical point: **The center of the interval is a node of the n=2 wavefunction.** Approximating the probability as zero is incorrect because the probability density is non-zero everywhere else in the interval. We must perform the integration carefully.\n\n**5. Solve the Integral**\n\nSince the integration interval is small and centered around a node, we can use a Taylor series approximation of the integrand, which is more accurate and simpler than a full trigonometric integration.\n\n*   **Change of variable:** Let's shift the coordinate system to be centered at the node x = a/2. Let u = x - a/2. Then x = u + a/2.\n    *   When x = 0.495a, u = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a.\n    *   When x = 0.505a, u = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a.\n*   **Rewrite the integrand:**\n    sin(2πx/a) = sin(2π(u + a/2)/a) = sin(2πu/a + π)\n    Using the identity sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ), we get:\n    sin(2πu/a + π) = -sin(2πu/a)\n*   **The probability density in terms of u:**\n    |ψ_2|² = (2/a) * [-sin(2πu/a)]² = (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a)\n*   **Taylor approximation:** For values of u close to 0 (which they are in our interval), the argument of the sine function, z = 2πu/a, is small. We can use the small-angle approximation sin(z) ≈ z.\n    sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² = 4π²u²/a²\n*   **Approximate the integrand:**\n    |ψ_2|² ≈ (2/a) * (4π²u²/a²) = (8π²/a³) * u²\n*   **Perform the simplified integral:**\n    Probability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π²/a³) * u² du\n*   Take the constant factor out of the integral:\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u² du\n*   Integrate u²:\n    ∫ u² du = u³/3\n*   Evaluate the definite integral:\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3] (from -0.005a to +0.005a)\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [((0.005a)³/3) - ((-0.005a)³/3)]\n    Probability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³ / 3]\n*   **Substitute and simplify:**\n    Probability ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³\n    Probability ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Numerical Answer**\n\n*   Probability ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³\n*   Probability ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)\n*   Probability ≈ (52.6379) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)\n*   Probability ≈ 6579.7 * 10⁻⁹\n*   Probability ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
