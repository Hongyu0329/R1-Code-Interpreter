    "Answering this question requires understanding the combinatorial problem of self-avoiding walks and recognizing the computational complexity involved for a walk of length 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is another name for a 2-dimensional square grid. From any point (x, y), a single step can be made to one of the four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A walk of length `n` is a sequence of `n+1` points (vertices), starting from an origin `v_0` and taking `n` successive steps.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk is self-avoiding if it never visits the same vertex more than once.\n*   **a(n):** This function represents the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin, say (0,0).\n\n**Step 2: Enumeration for Small Values of `n`**\n\nLet's count the number of SAWs for the first few values of `n` to understand how the count grows. We assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):** For the first step, there are 4 possible moves (right, left, up, down). All are valid.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):** After the first step, we are at a new vertex. From this vertex, there are 4 possible directions. However, one of them leads back to the origin, which is forbidden in a SAW (as that would be the second step, not just reversing). Therefore, there are only 3 valid choices for the second step. Since there were 4 choices for the first step, the total number of 2-step SAWs is:\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):** For each of the 12 two-step walks, we consider the third step. Let the path be `v_0 -> v_1 -> v_2`. From `v_2`, we cannot move back to `v_1`. This leaves 3 potential moves. We must also check that we don't land on `v_0`.\n    *   Let's analyze a path: `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)`. The possible next moves from (1,1) are to (2,1), (0,1), and (1,2) (the move to (1,0) is excluded). None of these destinations is the origin (0,0). So, all 3 are valid extensions.\n    *   This holds true for any 2-step SAW. The endpoint `v_2` is never a neighbor of the origin `v_0` (the minimum distance is sqrt(2) for a path like `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)`), so the third step cannot land on `v_0`.\n    *   Thus, for each of the 12 paths of length 2, there are 3 valid extensions.\n    *   `a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n**Step 3: Recognizing the Complexity at n=4**\n\nBased on the pattern so far, one might incorrectly assume `a(n) = 4 * 3^(n-1)`. Let's test this for `n=4`. The formula would predict `a(4) = 4 * 3^3 = 108`.\n\nLet's analyze the extensions of a 3-step walk `v_0 -> v_1 -> v_2 -> v_3`. From `v_3`, we can't move to `v_2`. But can we move to `v_0` or `v_1`?\n\n*   Consider the path `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1)`. This is a valid 3-step SAW.\n*   From the endpoint `v_3 = (0,1)`, the possible moves are to `(1,1)`, `(-1,1)`, `(0,2)`, and `(0,0)`.\n*   The move to `(1,1)` is just going backwards to `v_2`, so it's forbidden.\n*   The move to `(0,0)` would land on the origin `v_0`. This is a self-intersection, so this walk is not allowed.\n*   This means for this specific 3-step path, there are only 2 valid extensions (`(-1,1)` and `(0,2)`), not 3.\n\nBecause some 3-step paths have only 2 extensions while others have 3, the simple formula breaks down. We need to count them properly.\n\n*   The total number of 3-step SAWs is 36.\n*   Paths like `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)` have 3 extensions.\n*   Paths like `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)` (a \"U\" shape) have only 2 extensions.\n*   By enumeration, there are 8 such \"U\"-shaped 3-step paths. The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` paths have 3 extensions.\n*   Total number of 4-step walks: `a(4) = (28 * 3) + (8 * 2) = 84 + 16 = 100`.\n\nThis calculation confirms that `a(4)` is 100, not 108.\n\n**Step 4: Method for Finding a(10)**\n\nThe process of manually classifying and counting paths becomes prohibitively complex as `n` increases. The number of possible \"shapes\" or conformations of the walk grows rapidly. There is no known simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`.\n\nTo find `a(10)`, one must use a computational algorithm. A standard method is **backtracking search**:\n1.  Start with a path containing only the origin `[(0,0)]`.\n2.  Recursively try to extend the path by one step in each of the 4 directions.\n3.  For each potential new step, check if the new vertex is already in the current path.\n4.  If it is, discard this path.\n5.  If it is not, add the new vertex to the path and continue the recursion until the path has length `n`.\n6.  Sum up the number of valid paths found.\n\nThis enumeration is feasible for a computer for `n=10`.\n\n**Step 5: The Final Answer**\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` is a well-studied sequence in mathematics and physics. Its values have been computed and are tabulated in scientific literature and online resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. Consulting these known results is the standard approach for such a problem.\n\nThe established values for the sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**"
