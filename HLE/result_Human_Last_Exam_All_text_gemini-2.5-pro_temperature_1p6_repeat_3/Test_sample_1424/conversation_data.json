    "### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the functional dependence of the **bare Green's function ($G_0$)** on the **single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)** within the framework of the **Feynman path integral formalism**. Let's break this down step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Feynman Path Integral:** This formalism calculates quantum amplitudes by summing over all possible histories or \"paths\" of a system. For a quantum field theory, this means integrating over all possible field configurations. The contribution of each path is weighted by $e^{iS/\\hbar}$, where $S$ is the classical action for that path.\n*   **Green's Function:** In quantum many-body physics, a Green's function (or propagator) describes the propagation of a particle or excitation from one spacetime point to another.\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This is a specific type of Green's function that describes the propagation in a *non-interacting* system. It is governed by the free Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. It's often called the \"free propagator\".\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energies of the stationary states of the free Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. The index `k` typically represents momentum for a free particle in space, but it can be any set of quantum numbers that uniquely identify a single-particle state. The defining equation is $\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Path Integral to the Green's Function**\n\nThe Green's function is fundamentally related to the action, $S$, of the system. In the path integral formalism, the action for a free (non-interacting) particle field $\\psi$ is a quadratic functional of the fields. In Fourier space (frequency $\\omega$ and momentum `k`), the free action $S_0$ takes the form (setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity):\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(k, \\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\nHere, $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ are the Fourier components of the fields. The term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ comes from Fourier transforming the operator $(i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)$.\n\nThe Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the two-point correlation function $\\langle \\psi(k, \\omega) \\bar{\\psi}(k, \\omega) \\rangle$, which can be found by inverting the quadratic kernel of the action.\n\n**Step 3: Derive the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the structure of the action $S_0$, we can identify the inverse of the Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$.\n\n$G_0^{-1}(k, \\omega) = \\omega - \\epsilon_k$\n\nTherefore, the Green's function itself is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis simple algebraic form reveals the direct functional dependence.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Careful Points and Refinements**\n\n1.  **Causality and Time-Ordering:** The Feynman propagator is a *time-ordered* Green's function. This means it describes particles propagating forward in time and antiparticles (or holes) propagating backward in time. To correctly enforce this causality, a small imaginary infinitesimal, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), must be added to the denominator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state `k` is occupied or empty in the ground state.\n\n2.  **The Role of the Fermi Sea:** Let $\\mu$ be the chemical potential (or Fermi energy at T=0).\n    *   For particle states (unoccupied, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), the pole must be shifted slightly into the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane. The denominator becomes $\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n    *   For hole states (occupied, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the pole must be shifted slightly into the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane. The denominator becomes $\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n\n3.  **The Full Expression:** Combining these cases, the precise form of the bare Green's function is:\n\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n    Here, $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function.\n\n4.  **Representation:** This explicit form is in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ representation. In other representations (e.g., real space and time), the dependence is less direct, appearing as a sum or integral over all eigenstates:\n\n    $G_0(x, x', \\omega) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(x) \\phi_k^*(x')}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n    where $\\phi_k(x)$ is the wavefunction of the state $|k\\rangle$. This shows how the Green's function at any two points is constructed from the complete set of single-particle energies $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$ and wavefunctions.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis shows that in the most natural basis (the eigenbasis of the free Hamiltonian), the bare Green's function $G_0$ has a simple pole structure. The key features of the functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ are:\n\n1.  $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency variable.\n2.  The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane are located exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$.\n3.  This relationship arises directly from the fact that the inverse Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, is the operator $(\\omega - \\hat{H}_0)$, which becomes the algebraic expression $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ when acting on an energy eigenstate.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence is that of a simple pole where the pole's location is determined by the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the frequency-momentum representation ($k, \\omega$) is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and sgn is the sign function.\n\nThe fundamental functional dependence is that **the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$**. The locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane are precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
