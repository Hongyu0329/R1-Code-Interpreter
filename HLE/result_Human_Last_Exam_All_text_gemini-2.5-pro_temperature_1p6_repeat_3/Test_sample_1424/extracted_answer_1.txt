In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the frequency-momentum representation ($k, \omega$) is given by:

$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$

where $\omega$ is the frequency, $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and sgn is the sign function.

The fundamental functional dependence is that **the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$**. The locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane are precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
