    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph G with a set of vertices V, where |V| = 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size k is denoted as K_k.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices W ⊆ V, the induced subgraph G[W] is the graph whose vertex set is W and whose edge set consists of all edges in the original graph G that have both endpoints in W.\n*   **Clique as an induced subgraph:** The phrase \"a clique of size k appears as an induced subgraph\" means that there exists a subset of vertices W ⊂ V with |W|=k such that the induced subgraph G[W] is a complete graph (K_k). This is equivalent to saying that W is a clique in G.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the set of possible clique sizes**\n\nLet S(G) be the set of all integers k for which G contains an induced clique of size k. We want to find the maximum possible value of |S(G)| over all graphs G on 128 vertices.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the set S(G). Suppose a graph G contains an induced clique of size k, where k > 1. This means there is a set of vertices W with |W| = k such that every pair of vertices in W is connected by an edge.\n\nNow, consider any subset W' of W with size |W'| = k-1. Let's look at the subgraph induced by W', denoted G[W'].\n*   The vertices of G[W'] are the vertices in W'.\n*   The edges of G[W'] are all the edges from G between pairs of vertices in W'.\n\nSince every pair of vertices in W is connected in G, and W' is a subset of W, it follows that every pair of vertices in W' must also be connected in G. Therefore, G[W'] is a complete graph on k-1 vertices, i.e., a K_{k-1}.\n\nThis proves a crucial point: If a graph has an induced clique of size k (for k > 1), it must also have an induced clique of size k-1.\n\nBy applying this reasoning repeatedly, if the largest induced clique in G has size k_max, then G must also have induced cliques of sizes k_max-1, k_max-2, ..., down to 1. (A single vertex is a clique of size 1).\nTherefore, for any graph G, the set of induced clique sizes S(G) is always a set of consecutive integers:\nS(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}\nwhere k_max is the size of the largest clique in G. This value, k_max, is a fundamental graph property known as the **clique number** of G, denoted ω(G).\n\n**Step 3: Reframe the problem**\n\nFrom Step 2, the number of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in G is |S(G)| = k_max = ω(G).\nThe problem is thus equivalent to answering the following question:\n\"What is the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph G on n = 128 vertices?\"\n\n**Step 4: Solve the reframed problem**\n\nLet G be a graph with n vertices. A clique is a set of vertices within the graph. The size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, the clique number ω(G) must satisfy:\nω(G) ≤ n\n\nFor our specific case, n = 128, so for any graph G on 128 vertices, its clique number must be less than or equal to 128:\nω(G) ≤ 128\n\nThe final step is to determine if this upper bound can be achieved. We can construct a graph on 128 vertices that has a clique number of 128. This graph is the **complete graph** K_128, where every pair of the 128 vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nFor the graph G = K_128:\n*   The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128.\n*   Thus, the clique number is ω(K_128) = 128.\n*   Based on our analysis in Step 2, the set of induced clique sizes for K_128 is {1, 2, ..., 128}.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a graph G is equal to its clique number ω(G). The maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. This maximum is achieved by the complete graph K_128. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
