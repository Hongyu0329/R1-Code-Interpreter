    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific source:** The question points to the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\", and more specifically, to the sub-series \"Teen Girl Squad\", episode #15.\n2.  **Determine the setting of the episode:** The plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" revolves around the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior Prom.\n3.  **Focus on the musical performance:** The question asks about the singer who performs at this prom. The cartoon explicitly addresses the musical entertainment for the event.\n4.  **Listen to the narration:** The episode is narrated by the character Strong Bad, who is drawing the cartoon as he describes it. He announces, \"Our musical guest could not be here tonite...\"\n5.  **Identify the substitute performer:** Strong Bad continues his narration by introducing the replacement: \"...so please enjoy this cardboard cutout of... Thompkins!\"\n6.  **Confirm with visual evidence:** As Strong Bad says the name, the cartoon shows a cardboard cutout of a lanky, dark-haired musician on a stage with a drum set. The name \"THOMPKINS\" is written on the bass drum.\n7.  **Verify the nature of the character:** Thompkins is not a real-world singer; he is a fictional character created for this specific joke within the Homestar Runner universe.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The question specifies a **fictional** singer, which Thompkins is.\n*   The performer is not live but is a **cardboard cutout**, another key detail from the question that is confirmed by the episode.\n*   The name is clearly stated both in the dialogue and visually within the cartoon itself.\n*   It is crucial to identify the correct episode (\"#15\") as the setting and events are specific to that installment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the dialogue and visuals in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior Prom is of the fictional singer named Thompkins.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
