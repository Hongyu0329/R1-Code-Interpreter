    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Name**\n    *   The name is \"perfluoronanocar\". This can be broken down into two parts:\n        *   **perfluoro-**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means that all hydrogen (H) atoms attached to the carbon skeleton of the parent molecule are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n        *   **nanocar**: This is the parent molecule. We need to identify its structure and, specifically, the number of hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the Structure of a \"Nanocar\"**\n    *   \"Nanocar\" is not a formal IUPAC name but a common name for a single-molecule vehicle synthesized by the research group of Professor James Tour at Rice University.\n    *   The most representative structure consists of a chassis and four wheels. The \"wheels\" are often C60 fullerene molecules (buckyballs), which are composed entirely of carbon and have no hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The \"perfluoro-\" prefix applies to the part of the molecule that has hydrogen atoms, which is the chassis.\n    *   The hydrocarbon chassis for the original fullerene-wheeled nanocar is a molecule named **1,4-bis(3,5-diethynylphenyl)benzene**.\n\n3.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms in the Nanocar Chassis**\n    *   To find out how many fluorine atoms would be in a \"perfluoronanocar\", we must first count the number of hydrogen atoms in the parent hydrocarbon chassis, `1,4-bis(3,5-diethynylphenyl)benzene`.\n    *   Let's break the structure down into its components and count the hydrogens on each part:\n        *   **Central Benzene Ring**: This is a `1,4-disubstituted` benzene ring (`-C6H4-`). A benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 hydrogens. When substituted at the 1 and 4 positions, 2 hydrogens are removed. This leaves **4 hydrogen atoms** on the central ring.\n        *   **Two Side Phenyl Groups**: Attached to the central ring are two identical `3,5-diethynylphenyl` groups. Let's analyze one. It's a phenyl group (a benzene ring missing one hydrogen for the attachment point). It is substituted at its 3 and 5 positions. This means a total of three positions (1, 3, and 5) on the ring are substituted. This leaves **3 hydrogen atoms** on this ring. Since there are two such groups, they contribute a total of `2 * 3 = 6` hydrogen atoms.\n        *   **Four Terminal Ethynyl Groups**: Each side phenyl group has two ethynyl (`-Câ‰¡CH`) groups attached. An ethynyl group has one terminal hydrogen atom. Since there are a total of four such groups (`2 groups * 2 ethynyls/group`), they contribute a total of `4 * 1 = 4` hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   Summing the hydrogens from all parts of the chassis:\n        *   `4` (from the central ring) + `6` (from the two side rings) + `4` (from the four ethynyl tips) = **14 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   Thus, the chemical formula of the parent hydrocarbon chassis is `C26H14`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms**\n    *   According to the definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix, a \"perfluoronanocar\" would have all 14 hydrogen atoms on its chassis replaced by 14 fluorine atoms.\n    *   The resulting chassis would have the formula `C26F14`. The fullerene wheels have no hydrogens and would be unaffected.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Which Nanocar?**: The term \"nanocar\" can refer to several different molecules. The analysis uses the most common and foundational structure, for which the hydrocarbon chassis is well-defined.\n*   **Scope of \"Perfluoro-\":** This prefix only directs the replacement of hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms. It does not alter the carbon-carbon bonds or other parts of the molecule like the C60 wheels.\n*   **Systematic Counting**: It is crucial to break the complex molecule into simpler, manageable parts (central ring, side groups, terminal groups) to ensure an accurate count of all hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the parent hydrocarbon chassis of a nanocar contains 14 hydrogen atoms. Perfluorination replaces each of these hydrogen atoms with a fluorine atom.\n\n<<<14>>>"
