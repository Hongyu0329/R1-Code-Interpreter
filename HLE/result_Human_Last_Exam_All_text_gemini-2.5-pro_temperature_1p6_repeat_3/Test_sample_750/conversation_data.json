    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Set up the equation**\n\nWe are asked to solve for all complex numbers $z$ in the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nLet's represent the complex number $z$ in its Cartesian form, $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**LHS (Left-Hand Side):**\n$z \\cdot i = (x + iy)i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n\n**RHS (Right-Hand Side):**\nThe term $i^z$ is a complex exponentiation, defined as $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\nSo, $i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$.\n\n**2. Handle the multi-valued complex logarithm**\n\nThe complex logarithm $\\ln(w)$ is a multi-valued function. For a complex number $w = |w|e^{i\\theta}$, its logarithm is $\\ln(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\theta + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer.\n\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i| = 1$ and the principal argument is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, the multi-valued logarithm of $i$ is:\n$\\ln i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for the RHS:\n$i^z = e^{z \\ln i} = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nLet's simplify the exponent:\n$(x+iy)i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = (xi - y)(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = -y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n\nSo, the RHS becomes:\n$i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n$i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\left[ \\cos\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) + i\\sin\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) \\right]$.\n\n**3. Equate the two sides and form a system of equations**\n\nNow we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cos\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right) + i \\cdot e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\sin\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)\\right)$.\n\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal. Let $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nReal part:\n$-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k) \\quad \\text{(Eq. 1)}$\n\nImaginary part:\n$x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k) \\quad \\text{(Eq. 2)}$\n\nWe now need to solve this system of equations for $x$ and $y$ for all possible integer values of $k$.\n\n**4. Solve the system for different cases**\n\n**Case A: Purely real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n$0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0 \\quad \\text{(from Eq. 1)}$\n$x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k) \\quad \\text{(from Eq. 2)}$\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, we must have $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives:\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\n\nSo, we have two sub-cases for $x$:\n- If $n$ is even, $x=1$. We must check for consistency: $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n  $(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$ (where $n=2m$ is an even integer).\n  $2k\\pi = 2m\\pi \\implies k=m$. This is consistent for any integer $k$ (by choosing $n=2k$). Thus, $z=1+0i=1$ is a solution.\n- If $n$ is odd, $x=-1$. We must check for consistency: $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n  $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2m+1)\\pi$ (where $n=2m+1$ is an odd integer).\n  $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi \\implies -1 - 4k = 3 + 4m \\implies 4m = -4k-4 \\implies m = -k-1$. This is consistent for any integer $k$ (by choosing $n=2(-k-1)+1=-2k-1$). Thus, $z=-1+0i=-1$ is a solution.\n\nSo, we have found two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n$-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k} \\quad \\text{(from Eq. 1)}$\n$0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{(from Eq. 2)}$\n\nThe second equation is always satisfied. We need to solve the first equation: $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = y + e^{-yC_k}$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n- If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. The minimum value of $f(y)$ is $\\frac{\\ln(C_k)+1}{C_k}$. For $k \\ge 0$, $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > e^{-1}$, so $\\ln(C_k) > -1$, which means the minimum value is positive. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n- If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi < 0$. Let $A = -C_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yA}$. A graphical analysis (or analysis of $g(y)=y+e^{yA}$) shows there is exactly one solution for $y$, which must be negative.\nWe can express this solution using the Lambert W function. The equation is $y = -e^{yA}$. Let $u=-yA$, so $y=-u/A$. The equation becomes $-u/A = -e^{-u}$, or $ue^u = A$. The solution is $u=W(A)$.\nSo, $y = -u/A = -W(A)/A = -W(-C_k)/(-C_k) = W(-C_k)/C_k$.\nThe solutions are $z = iy = i\\frac{W(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\nWe can write this in a more convenient form by letting $j = -k \\ge 1$.\n$C_k = C_{-j} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2j\\pi = -(2j - \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\nSo, $z_j = i \\frac{W((2j-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi)}{-(2j-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi} = -i \\frac{W((2j-1/2)\\pi)}{(2j-1/2)\\pi}$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\n**Case C: General complex solutions ($x\\neq 0, y\\neq 0$)**\nBy dividing Eq. 2 by Eq. 1, we get $\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k)$, which implies $y = -x\\cot(xC_k)$.\nSubstituting this into Eq. 2 gives: $x = e^{x C_k \\cot(x C_k)} \\sin(x C_k)$.\nLet $u = xC_k$. Then $x=u/C_k$. The equation becomes:\n$\\frac{u}{C_k \\sin u} = e^{u\\cot u}$.\nAn analysis of this transcendental equation shows that solutions only occur at points where $\\cot(u) = 0$, which corresponds to $x=1, y=0$ and $x=-1, y=0$. This confirms that there are no complex solutions with both $x$ and $y$ non-zero.\n\n### List of careful points\n*   The complex exponentiation $i^z$ is multi-valued because the complex logarithm $\\ln i$ is multi-valued. This dependence is captured by the integer parameter $k$.\n*   Solving the system of transcendental equations requires careful case-by-case analysis (real, imaginary, and general complex solutions).\n*   The existence and uniqueness of solutions in the purely imaginary case can be established by analyzing the behavior of the function $f(y) = y + e^{-yC_k}$.\n*   The Lambert W function, defined by the relation $W(x)e^{W(x)}=x$, provides a convenient way to express the purely imaginary solutions, but is not essential for proving their existence.\n*   It's important to check that the potential solutions found are consistent for all integer values of the parameter $k$ or find the specific values of $k$ for which they are valid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of two real solutions and an infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions.\n\nThe solutions are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions given by:\n    $z_j = -i \\frac{W\\left(\\left(2j-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\right)}{\\left(2j-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi}$ for all positive integers $j=1, 2, 3, \\dots$\n    (where $W$ denotes the principal branch of the Lambert W function).\n\n<<<The solutions are $z = 1$, $z = -1$, and $z_j = -i \\frac{W((2j-1/2)\\pi)}{(2j-1/2)\\pi}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.>>>"
