    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**: In StarCraft lore, the Second Great War refers to the galaxy-wide conflict that takes place during the events of the StarCraft II trilogy: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*. The First Great War was the conflict in the original *StarCraft* and its expansion, *Brood War*.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The Second Great War begins at the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. This is marked by the sudden and massive return of the Zerg Swarm to the Koprulu Sector and their invasion of Dominion worlds. According to the official timeline, these events start in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war's main conflict concludes at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* main campaign. This is when the unified forces of the Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss launch a final assault on Aiur, destroy Amon's host body, and banish his spirit back into the Void. This effectively ends the large-scale fighting across the sector. According to the official timeline, this happens in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Consider Potential Ambiguity (The Epilogue)**: The *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, \"Into the Void,\" sees the final destruction of Amon. This campaign takes place two years after the end of the main campaign, in the year 2508. However, this is generally considered a post-war mop-up operation by a small, dedicated force, not a continuation of the \"war\" itself, which involved massive, sector-wide army movements and battles. Therefore, the most accurate end date for the war is 2506.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   Start Year: 2504\n    *   End Year: 2506\n    *   The conflict spans across the years 2504, 2505, and 2506. This means the duration is more than 2 full years but not a full 3 years.\n    *   For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in October 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 7 months.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question requires the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the duration is a value greater than 2 but less than 3 (e.g., ~2.6 years), rounding it up to the next whole number gives 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing Wars**: It is crucial to distinguish the Second Great War (StarCraft II) from the First Great War (StarCraft I & Brood War).\n*   **Defining the End**: The end of the war is the cessation of major hostilities (end of *Legacy of the Void*, 2506), not the final elimination of the ultimate threat (the Epilogue, 2508). This is a common point of confusion.\n*   **Understanding \"Rounding Up\"**: This instruction is key. A duration of 2 years and even 1 day would be rounded up to 3 years as per the question's requirement.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe Second Great War starts in **2504** and the main conflict ends in **2506**. This is a duration of over two years. When rounded up to the nearest whole year, the result is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
