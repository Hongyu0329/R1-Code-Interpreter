    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the programming problem and the submitted code.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\n1.  **Objective**: Calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0.\n2.  **Input**:\n    *   An integer `n` (number of statements), where `1 <= n <= 150`.\n    *   `n` lines, each containing a single statement.\n3.  **Variable**: There is only one variable, `x`.\n4.  **Operations**:\n    *   `++`: Increases `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decreases `x` by 1.\n5.  **Statements**: A statement is a combination of one operation and the variable `X`. Crucially, the problem states, \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This means there are four possible valid statements:\n    *   `++X` (prefix increment)\n    *   `X++` (postfix increment)\n    *   `--X` (prefix decrement)\n    *   `X--` (postfix decrement)\n6.  **Output**: Print the final integer value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n1.  **Initialization**: `int tresult = 0;` correctly initializes the counter variable to 0, which is the initial value of `x`.\n2.  **Looping**: `while (t-- > 0)` correctly reads the number of statements and iterates that many times.\n3.  **Logic**: Inside the loop, the program reads a statement into the `String test`.\n4.  **Conditional Checks**:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`: This correctly identifies the `++X` statement and increments the counter.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`: This correctly identifies the `--X` statement and decrements the counter.\n5.  **Flaw Identification**: The program's logic is incomplete. It only checks for the prefix versions of the operations (`++X` and `--X`). It completely ignores the postfix versions (`X++` and `X--`). If the input contains `X++` or `X--`, the program will not modify `tresult`, leading to an incorrect final answer.\n\n**Conclusion**: The program does not solve the problem correctly for all valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Design an Efficient and Correct C Program\nTo solve the problem correctly and efficiently, we need a program that handles all four statement types while minimizing resource usage.\n\n**Careful Points & Optimization Strategy**:\n1.  **Correctness**: The logic must differentiate between increment (`+`) and decrement (`-`) operations regardless of their position (prefix or postfix).\n2.  **Efficient Check**: Instead of comparing the entire 3-character string, we can find a single character that uniquely determines the operation.\n    *   For `++X` and `X++`, the string contains `+`.\n    *   For `--X` and `X--`, the string contains `-`.\n    *   A more direct approach: notice that for all four valid inputs (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the middle character (at index 1) is always the operator sign.\n        *   `++X` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n        *   `X++` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n        *   `--X` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n        *   `X--` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    *   Therefore, we only need to read the string and check the character at index 1. This is the most efficient comparison possible.\n\n3.  **Minimizing Memory**: To find the smallest memory size, we must choose the smallest C data types that can safely store the required values, according to the problem constraints (`1 <= n <= 150`).\n    *   **Variable for `n`**: The range is [1, 150]. An `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient.\n    *   **Variable for the result**: The final value of `x` will be in the range [-150, 150]. A `signed char` (1 byte, range -128 to 127) is too small. The next smallest type, a `signed short` (2 bytes, range -32,768 to 32,767), is sufficient.\n    *   **Input Buffer**: To read the 3-character statement string (e.g., \"X++\"), we need a character array of size 4 to accommodate the 3 characters plus the null terminator. `char s[4]` requires 4 bytes.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Metrics (x and y)\nWe need to calculate `x` (character comparisons for 100 instructions) and `y` (smallest memory size in bytes) for the proposed efficient C solution.\n\n*   **x (Smallest number of character comparisons)**:\n    *   The logic `if (s[1] == '+')` performs exactly one character comparison for each statement.\n    *   For 100 instructions, `x = 100 * 1 = 100`.\n\n*   **y (Smallest memory size in Bytes)**:\n    *   Memory for `n`: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   Memory for the result: `sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes.\n    *   Memory for the input buffer: `sizeof(char[4])` = 4 bytes.\n    *   Total memory `y = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7` bytes.\n\n### Final Answer Construction\n*   The original program is incorrect, so the answer must start with `N`.\n*   The answer format is `Nx+y`.\n*   Substituting the calculated values: `x = 100` and `y = 7`.\n*   The final result is `N100+7`.\n\n<<<N100+7>>>"
