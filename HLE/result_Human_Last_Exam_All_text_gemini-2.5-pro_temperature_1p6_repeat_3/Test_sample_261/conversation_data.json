Such lists are available in historical encyclopedias, church records, and scholarly articles about the monastery.\n\n4.  **Examine the timeline of leadership:** By reviewing the documented list of archimandrites for the Pskov-Caves Monastery, we can pinpoint who was in charge during the specified period.\n    *   Archimandrite Varlaam (Poletayev) served from 1725 to 1729.\n    *   Archimandrite **Markell (Radyshevsky)** served from 1729 to 1731.\n    *   Archimandrite Varlaam (Poletayev) served again from 1731 to 1742.\n\n5.  **Verify the dates:** The tenure of Archimandrite Markell (Radyshevsky) was from 1729 to 1731.
