    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for a specific individual.\n    *   **Affiliation:** The individual must be a philosopher from the \"Lviv-Warsaw School.\"\n    *   **Contribution:** This philosopher is known for decomposing the notion of a \"hallmark\" (or more broadly, a \"sign\") into two distinct categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy active in Poland from the interwar period until the outbreak of World War II. Founded by Kazimierz Twardowski, its members included prominent figures like Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The school was known for its clarity of thought, logical rigor, and focus on the philosophy of language and science.\n    *   **Hallmark (Sign/Mark):** In this context, a \"hallmark\" or \"sign\" refers to an object, event, or property 'A' that indicates the existence or presence of another object, event, or property 'B'. The central philosophical task is to analyze the different ways this indication can occur.\n    *   **Symptoms vs. Signals:** This is the core distinction.\n        *   A **symptom** (also called an index or natural sign) has a natural, often causal, relationship with what it signifies. The presence of the symptom allows one to infer the existence of its cause or correlate. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a high temperature is a symptom of illness.\n        *   A **signal** (or conventional sign) has an arbitrary or conventional relationship with what it signifies. Its meaning is established by a rule, agreement, or intention to communicate. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"dog\" is a signal that refers to a specific type of animal.\n\n3.  **Identify the Philosopher:**\n    *   The task is to find which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific semiotic distinction a central part of their work.\n    *   While many in the school were concerned with language and meaning, the philosopher most famously associated with this particular analysis is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was a leading figure in the second generation of the school. He worked extensively on epistemology, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of language.\n    *   This distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a cornerstone of his semiotic theory, prominently featured in his works on logic and language, such as his influential book *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*). He used this analysis to clarify the nature of language and differentiate it from other types of signs in the world.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the concepts and a review of the contributions of the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign (hallmark) into symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
