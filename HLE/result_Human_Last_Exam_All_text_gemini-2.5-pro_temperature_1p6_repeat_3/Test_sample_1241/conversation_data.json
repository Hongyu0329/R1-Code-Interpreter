    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    The problem provides a system of linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which describe the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in state $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ at time $t$. We are asked to find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to finding the sum of the steady-state (or stationary) probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Steady-State Equations:**\n    The steady-state probabilities, which we denote by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the limiting probabilities as time $t$ goes to infinity. In the steady state, the probabilities no longer change with time, which means their derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n    By setting the derivatives in the given system to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$:\n    $$\n    0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 \\quad \\text{(4)}\n    $$\n    Additionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1 \\quad \\text{(5)}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Substituting the Given Rate Constants:**\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n    Substituting these values into the equations:\n    $$\n    0 = -0.019\\pi_0 + 0.65\\pi_1 \\quad \\text{(1')}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 = 0.4\\pi_1 - 0.4\\pi_2 \\quad \\text{(3')}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = 0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3 \\quad \\text{(4')}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Solving the System of Equations:**\n    We can solve this system by expressing $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n    *   From equation (3'): $0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\n    *   From equation (4'): $0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n    *   From equation (1'): $0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$.\n\n5.  **Using the Normalization Condition:**\n    Now substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1\n    $$\n    We can solve for $\\pi_1$:\n    $$\n    \\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}\n    $$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Target Quantity:**\n    The quantity we need to find is $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n    Using the expression for $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)\\pi_1\n    $$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\pi_1$ that we found in the previous step:\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}\n    $$\n    To simplify the calculation, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 0.019:\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 1 \\times 0.019}{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}\n    $$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Performing the final division:\n    $$\n    \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...\n    $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Steady-State Assumption:** The core of solving this problem is recognizing that finding the probabilities at $t=+\\infty$ means finding the steady-state solution where all time derivatives are zero.\n*   **System of Equations:** The resulting system of algebraic equations is linearly dependent (the sum of the first four equations is zero). The normalization condition ($\\sum \\pi_i = 1$) is crucial for finding a unique solution.\n*   **Consistency Check:** It is a good practice to check that the derived relationships (e.g., $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$) are consistent with all the equations. We used (1), (3), (4) to find the relations. Let's check with (2):\n    $0 = 0.019\\pi_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_2 + 0.008\\pi_3$.\n    Substitute $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$, $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$:\n    $0 = 0.019(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1) - 1.05\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_1 + 0.008\\pi_1$\n    $0 = 0.65\\pi_1 - 1.05\\pi_1 + (0.392+0.008)\\pi_1$\n    $0 = 0.65\\pi_1 - 1.05\\pi_1 + 0.4\\pi_1$\n    $0 = (0.65 - 1.05 + 0.4)\\pi_1 = (1.05 - 1.05)\\pi_1 = 0$.\n    The relations are consistent.\n*   **Numerical Accuracy:** The final answer is a ratio of two decimal numbers. Care should be taken during the arithmetic operations.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe sum of the steady-state probabilities $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$ is given by the expression $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n$$\n\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768\n$$\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
