    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*. This is a spinosaurid theropod known primarily from a well-preserved skull from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil.\n\n2.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on a specific part of the skull: the **lacrimal recess**. The lacrimal is a bone that forms the front upper corner of the eye socket (orbit). A recess is an indentation or depression on the bone's surface.\n\n3.  **Locate the Authoritative Scientific Source:** To answer a detailed anatomical question about a specific species, we must consult the primary scientific literature that describes it. The key paper for *Irritator challengeri* is:\n    *   Sues, H.-D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri*, a new spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*, 22(3), 535-547.\n    This paper provides the most detailed description of the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they distinguish between the antorbital fossa (a large depression) and a separate, more dorsally located (higher up) lacrimal recess.\n\n5.  **Extract the Specific Detail about the Lacrimal Recess:** The crucial sentence for answering this question is found in the description of the lacrimal bone. The paper states that the lacrimal recess \"is subdivided by a delicate vertical lamina of bone into **two smaller depressions**.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Term:** It is important to distinguish the \"lacrimal recess\" from the larger \"antorbital fossa,\" which is also located on the lacrimal bone. The question specifically asks about the recess.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies entirely on the published scientific description of the only known skull. Interpretations could change with new discoveries, but based on current knowledge, this is the definitive source.\n*   **Anatomical Structure:** The feature is not one single depression but a larger recess that is itself divided internally. The \"two depressions\" are subdivisions within this recess.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe primary scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull explicitly states that the lacrimal recess is divided by a thin wall of bone, resulting in two smaller depressions within it. Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
