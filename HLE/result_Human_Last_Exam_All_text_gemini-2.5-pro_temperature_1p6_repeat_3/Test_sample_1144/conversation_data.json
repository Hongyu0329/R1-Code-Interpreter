    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) while it is in the first Bohr orbit. We are given the uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$).\n\n**2. Identify Necessary Physical Principles and Formulas**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h / 2\\pi$).\n\n*   **Bohr Model for the Hydrogen Atom:** This model provides a value for the momentum of an electron in a specific orbit. For the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) is quantized:\n    $L = mvr = n\\hbar$\n    where $m$ is the mass, $v$ is the velocity, $r$ is the orbital radius, and $n$ is the principal quantum number (the orbit number).\n    The linear momentum is $p = mv$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n*   From the uncertainty principle, we can express $\\Delta p$ in terms of $\\Delta x$:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}$\n*   We are given the uncertainty in position:\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n*   According to the Bohr model's quantization of angular momentum, for the first orbit, $n=1$.\n    $L = mvr_1 = (1)\\hbar = \\hbar$\n*   Since the linear momentum is $p = mv$, we can write the angular momentum as $L = pr_1$.\n    Therefore, $pr_1 = \\hbar$.\n*   Solving for the momentum $p$, we get:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n    where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n\n**5. Form the Required Ratio ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$)**\n*   Now we can create the ratio using the expressions for $\\Delta p$ and $p$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}\\right)}$\n*   The reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, cancels out, greatly simplifying the expression:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2\\Delta x}$\n\n**6. Substitute Values and Compute the Final Answer**\n*   We need the value for the radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1$:\n    $r_1 = 52.9 \\text{ pm} = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   We use the given value for the uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x$:\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   Now substitute these values into our simplified ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n*   The units (m) and the factor of $10^{-11}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Correct Formula for Uncertainty:** Use the standard form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for minimum uncertainty, which is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$, not $h$.\n*   **Consistent Units:** The position uncertainty is given in picometers (pm). It must be converted to meters (m) to be consistent with the standard value of the Bohr radius.\n*   **Bohr Orbit Number:** The problem specifies the *first* Bohr orbit, so we must use $n=1$ in the Bohr model formulas.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Simplifying the ratio expression algebraically before plugging in numerical values (i.e., canceling out $\\hbar$) is a good practice that minimizes calculation errors.\n*   **Conceptual Framework:** Be aware that this problem mixes the semi-classical Bohr model (which assumes a definite orbit) with the fully quantum Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (which denies the possibility of such an orbit). We proceed by applying the formulas from each model as required by the problem.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
