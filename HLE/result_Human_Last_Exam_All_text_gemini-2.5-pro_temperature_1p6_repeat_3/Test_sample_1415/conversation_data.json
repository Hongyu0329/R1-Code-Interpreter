    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the functions.**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined as follows:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral.**\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Recognizing the form of the integrand.**\nThe integrand is of the form f'(x)/f(x). This is a standard integral form.\n\nLet f(x) = F₃(x). Then the integral is ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx.\nThe antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\nSo, ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we compute the value of the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nUsing the property of logarithms (ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)), we can write:\nV = ln(|F₃(1)/F₃(0)|)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1).**\n*   **To find F₃(0):**\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **To find F₃(1):**\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(1)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Careful Point 2: Radian Mode.**\nThe argument of the sine function, x=1, is in radians, not degrees. This is standard in calculus unless specified otherwise.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these values back into the expression for V.**\nV = ln( | [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] | )\n\n**Careful Point 3: Checking the sign of the argument.**\nFor x in the interval [0, 1], sin(x) is non-negative (sin(0)=0, sin(π/2)≈sin(1.57)=1).\n*   Since sin(x) ≥ 0, e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\n*   Then 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2.\n*   Therefore, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2) > 0 for all x in [0, 1].\nThis means that both F₃(1) and F₃(0) are positive, so we can remove the absolute value signs.\nV = ln( (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) )\n\n**Step 6: Numerically evaluate V.**\nWe will use a calculator for this part, keeping a few decimal places for accuracy.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31978\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.31978) = ln(3.31978) ≈ 1.20001\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.69315\n*   The ratio inside the main logarithm is: 1.20001 / 0.69315 ≈ 1.73123\n*   V = ln(1.73123) ≈ 0.54885\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final value and round.**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54885 = 5488.5\n\nUsing a more precise calculation:\n*   V ≈ 0.54885149\n*   10000 * V ≈ 5488.5149\nThe closest integer to 5488.5149 is 5489.\n\nFinal Answer acquisition:\nV = ln(ln(1+e^sin(1))/ln(2)) ≈ 0.548851\n10000 * V ≈ 5488.51\nThe closest integer is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
