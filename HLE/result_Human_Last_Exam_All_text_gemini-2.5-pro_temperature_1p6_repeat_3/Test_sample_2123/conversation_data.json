    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **The Source:** A Russian text, referred to as a \"translation of a certain essay.\" This detail about \"translation\" might be a slight misdirection or simply part of the puzzle's lore. The key is that the context is Russian.\n*   **The Setting:** The description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse.\n*   **The Element to Find:** The surname of an English poet that is mentioned in this specific context.\n*   **The Final Format:** The surname must be provided in English.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Careful Points and Potential Traps**\n*   The question is a piece of literary trivia, not a straightforward factual query. The connection is likely not obvious, such as a \"Byron Street\" in Vienna.\n*   The \"Russian translation\" aspect is crucial. The connection might be a pun, a homophone, or an associative link that works specifically in the Russian language or within Russian literary culture.\n*   The specific essay or author is not named, meaning the connection must be well-known enough to be solvable.\n*   The phrase \"wide boulevards\" is a key descriptor. The link could relate to the concept of width, grandeur, or openness.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  The puzzle hinges on a famous association made in Russian literature. We need to find a Russian writer who wrote about Vienna and made a connection to an English poet.\n2.  The writer in question is the prominent Soviet author Yuri Olesha. In his celebrated autobiographical book \"No Day Without a Line\" (*Ни дня без строчки*), which is composed of diary entries, notes, and essayistic fragments, he reflects on various memories and ideas.\n3.  In one of these fragments, Olesha recalls his impressions of Vienna. He is struck by the grand scale and spaciousness of the city's avenues.\n4.  He creates a powerful metaphorical link based on sound and feeling. He associates the grandeur and romantic sweep of Vienna's boulevards with the spirit of the English Romantic poet, Lord Byron.\n5.  Olesha's famous phrase is \"Венский размах — байронический,\" which translates to \"The Viennese scope/sweep is Byronic.\" He explicitly links the physical characteristic of the city (\"wide boulevards\") to the poet. The name **Byron** (Байрон in Russian) is used to evoke a sense of freedom, grandeur, and romanticism which Olesha felt was embodied by the city's architecture.\n6.  This specific literary association is the solution to the puzzle. The poet whose surname appears in a Russian text describing Vienna's wide boulevards is Byron.\n7.  The final step is to provide the name in English as requested.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
