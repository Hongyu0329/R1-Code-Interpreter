    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and the corresponding protein sequence.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Input:** A nucleotide sequence: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc` (108 bases long).\n2.  **Key Information:** The sequence is from the **middle** of an Open Reading Frame (ORF).\n3.  **Core Principle:** An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome to synthesize a protein. A key feature of an ORF is the absence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) until the very end of the gene. Since this sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, it should not contain any stop codons in its correct reading frame.\n4.  **Task:** Identify which of the three possible reading frames is correct (i.e., lacks stop codons) and translate that frame into its amino acid sequence using the one-letter code.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nWe will test each of the three possible reading frames.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reading Frame 1**\n\n*   This frame starts from the 1st nucleotide. We group the sequence into codons of three bases.\n*   **Codons:** `GGA CAT TGT TGT TAG CGA AGA CTT ...`\n*   **Check for Stop Codons:** The fifth codon is `TAG`, which is a stop codon. This frame also contains other stop codons later on (`TAA` at codon 23, `TAA` at codon 25, and `TGA` at codon 30).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of multiple stop codons means Frame 1 is not the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reading Frame 2**\n\n*   This frame starts from the 2nd nucleotide, ignoring the first `g`.\n*   **Codons:** `GAC ATT GTT GTT AGC GAA GAC TTG AAT GGA ACG GTG AAG TTT TCA AGC TCT TTA CCC TAC CCC AAT AAT CTT AAC AGT GTC CTG GCT GAG CGA CTG GAG AAG TGG`\n    *   (The sequence ends with two bases, `gc`, which do not form a complete codon).\n*   **Check for Stop Codons:** We scan the entire list of 35 codons for any of the stop signals (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). None are found.\n*   **Conclusion:** The absence of any stop codons makes Frame 2 the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reading Frame 3**\n\n*   This frame starts from the 3rd nucleotide, ignoring the first two bases `gg`.\n*   **Codons:** `ACA TTG TTG TTA GCG AAG ACT TGA ATG GAA ...`\n*   **Check for Stop Codons:** The eighth codon is `TGA`, which is a stop codon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a stop codon means Frame 3 is not the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 4: Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2)**\n\nNow we translate the codon sequence from Frame 2 into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid |      | Codon | Amino Acid |      | Codon | Amino Acid |\n| :---- | :--------: | :--- | :---- | :--------: | :--- | :---- | :--------: |\n| GAC   |      D     |      | TCA   |      S     |      | GTC   |      V     |\n| ATT   |      I     |      | AGC   |      S     |      | CTG   |      L     |\n| GTT   |      V     |      | TCT   |      S     |      | GCT   |      A     |\n| GTT   |      V     |      | TTA   |      L     |      | GAG   |      E     |\n| AGC   |      S     |      | CCC   |      P     |      | CGA   |      R     |\n| GAA   |      E     |      | TAC   |      Y     |      | CTG   |      L     |\n| GAC   |      D     |      | CCC   |      P     |      | GAG   |      E     |\n| TTG   |      L     |      | AAT   |      N     |      | AAG   |      K     |\n| AAT   |      N     |      | AAT   |      N     |      | TGG   |      W     |\n| GGA   |      G     |      | CTT   |      L     |\n| ACG   |      T     |      | AAC   |      N     |\n| GTG   |      V     |      | AGT   |      S     |\n| AAG   |      K     |      |       |            |\n| TTT   |      F     |      |       |            |\n\nCombining the one-letter codes gives the final protein sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe correct frame is **Frame 2**. The translated protein sequence is:\n**DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLPTYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW**\n\n<<<Frame: 2, Protein Sequence: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLPTYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
