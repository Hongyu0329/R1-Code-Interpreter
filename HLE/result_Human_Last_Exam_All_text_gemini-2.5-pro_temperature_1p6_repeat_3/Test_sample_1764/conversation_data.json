    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nLet's break down the components:\n*   **A finite ultrametric space $X$**: This is a set $X$ with a finite number of points and a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   **A Banach space $B$**: This is a complete normed vector space over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. The norm is denoted by $\\|\\cdot\\|$, and the induced metric on $B$ is $d_B(u, v) = \\|u - v\\|$.\n*   **Cardinality $K$**: The number of points in the set $B$ is $K$.\n*   **Isometric embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances, i.e., for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$.\n*   **Smallest possible number**: We need to find the minimum number of such embeddings. This minimum is taken over all possible choices of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$, with the only constraint being that at least one such embedding exists for the chosen pair $(X, B)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the number of embeddings for a given pair $(X, B)$\nLet's denote the set of all isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$ as $Emb(X, B)$, and its size (cardinality) as $N(X, B)$. We assume that for the pairs $(X, B)$ we consider, $N(X, B) \\ge 1$. Since the number of embeddings must be an integer, the smallest possible value is at least 1.\n\nLet's assume there exists at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$.\nConsider the action of translation on $B$. For any vector $v \\in B$, we can define a new function $f_v: X \\to B$ by $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$.\n\nLet's check if $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n$\\|f_v(x) - f_v(y)\\| = \\|(f(x) + v) - (f(y) + v)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|$.\nSince $f$ is an isometric embedding, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$. Thus, $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding.\n\nAre these embeddings distinct for different vectors $v$?\nSuppose $f_{v_1} = f_{v_2}$ for $v_1, v_2 \\in B$. This means $f(x) + v_1 = f(x) + v_2$ for all $x \\in X$.\nIf $X$ is not empty, we can pick any $x_0 \\in X$, and we have $f(x_0) + v_1 = f(x_0) + v_2$, which implies $v_1 = v_2$.\nSo, if $X$ is non-empty, there is a distinct embedding for each vector $v \\in B$. The number of these embeddings generated by translation is $|B| = K$.\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: If $X$ is a non-empty finite ultrametric space that can be isometrically embedded in a Banach space $B$, the number of such embeddings is at least $K = |B|$.\n\n### Step 3: Consider trivial but valid cases\nThe question puts no constraints on $X$ and $B$ other than their type (finite ultrametric space, Banach space). To find the \"smallest possible number\", we should examine the simplest, or \"trivial,\" cases, as these often provide the minimums.\n\n**Case 1: The empty ultrametric space**\nLet's consider $X = \\emptyset$. The empty set can be considered a metric space (and thus an ultrametric space) where the axioms hold vacuously.\nAn isometric embedding is a function $f: \\emptyset \\to B$. For any set $B$, there is exactly one function from the empty set to $B$, which is the empty function itself.\nThe condition for an isometric embedding is that $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\emptyset$. This condition is vacuously true because there are no elements in $\\emptyset$ to test.\nTherefore, for any Banach space $B$, there is exactly one isometric embedding from the empty space $X = \\emptyset$ into $B$.\nIn this case, the number of embeddings is 1.\n\n**Case 2: The trivial Banach space**\nLet's consider $B = \\{0\\}$, the vector space containing only the zero vector. This is a valid Banach space. Its norm is $\\|0\\|=0$, and it is complete. The cardinality is $K=1$.\nFor an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ to exist, we must have:\n$\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\nSince the only point in $B$ is 0, any function $f$ must map all points of $X$ to 0. So $f(x)=0$ for all $x$.\nThe condition becomes $\\|0 - 0\\| = d(x, y)$, which simplifies to $d(x, y) = 0$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\nIn a metric space, $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$. The condition $d(x,y)=0$ for all $x,y$ means that $X$ can have at most one point.\nLet's choose $X$ to be a one-point space, say $X = \\{p\\}$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space, with $d(p, p) = 0$.\nNow consider the pair $(X=\\{p\\}, B=\\{0\\})$.\nAn embedding is a function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. The only such function is $f(p)=0$.\nLet's check the isometry condition: $\\|f(p)-f(p)\\| = d(p, p)$ which is $\\|0-0\\|=0$, or $0=0$. This is true.\nSo, for this pair $(X, B)$, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\nThe number of embeddings is 1.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings. This number must be at least 1 (assuming an embedding exists).\nIn both scenarios considered in Step 3, we found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n*   Scenario 1: $X=\\emptyset$ and any Banach space $B$.\n*   Scenario 2: $X=\\{p\\}$ (a one-point space) and $B=\\{0\\}$ (the trivial Banach space).\n\nSince the number of embeddings cannot be smaller than 1, and we have found cases where the number is exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1. This conclusion avoids making unstated assumptions such as \"X must be non-empty\" or \"B must be non-trivial\", which would lead to a different answer ($c$, the cardinality of the continuum, as the minimal cardinality of a non-trivial Banach space). Without such extra assumptions, the answer is straightforward."
