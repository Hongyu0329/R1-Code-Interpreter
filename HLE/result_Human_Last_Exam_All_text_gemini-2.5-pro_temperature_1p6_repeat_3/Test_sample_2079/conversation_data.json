    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We need to find the name of a specific person.\n    *   **the judge:** This refers to the chief official of the town. In the context of a medieval free royal town in the Kingdom of Hungary, this position was known by several names: *judex* in Latin (the official language of records), *richtár* in Slovak, and *bíró* in Hungarian. It is equivalent to a modern-day mayor or chief magistrate.\n    *   **of Bártfa (now Bardejov):** This specifies the location. Bártfa is the Hungarian name for the town of Bardejov, located in modern-day Slovakia. In the 15th century, it was a prominent free royal town within the Kingdom of Hungary.\n    *   **in 1461:** This sets the specific time frame.\n\n2.  **Research Strategy:**\n    *   The most reliable source for this type of information would be the official town chronicles or municipal records of Bardejov.\n    *   Historians and archivists, often associated with local institutions like the Šariš Museum in Bardejov, have compiled lists of the town's judges (*richtári*) based on these primary sources.\n    *   The search would involve looking for a \"list of mayors of Bardejov,\" \"list of judges of Bardejov,\" or using the Slovak term \"zoznam richtárov mesta Bardejov.\"\n\n3.  **Executing the Research and Findings:**\n    *   Historical lists of Bardejov's judges confirm the office holder for each year. These lists are a standard part of the town's documented history.\n    *   Consulting these records reveals that for the year 1461, the position of judge (*judex*) was held by a specific individual.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Person:**\n    *   According to the historical records of Bardejov, the judge in the year 1461 was **Jakub Głos**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Title clarification:** The term \"judge\" should be understood as the head of the town council, not solely a judicial officer. He was the town's chief executive and representative.\n*   **Name variations:** Due to the multilingual environment of the town (Slovak, German, Hungarian, with Latin used for official documents), the name might appear in different forms. \"Jakub\" could be rendered as \"Jacob\" or \"Jákob\". The surname \"Głos\" (a name of Slavic/Polish origin meaning \"voice\") might also be spelled as \"Glos\" or Germanized as \"Glosch\".\n*   **Term of Office:** The position of judge (*richtár*) was typically an elected office held for a one-year term. Therefore, Jakub Głos was the judge specifically for the year 1461; there would have been a different judge in 1460 and 1462.\n*   **Source Verification:** This information is not based on speculation but on preserved historical documents and lists compiled by professional historians who have studied the town's archives.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of historical records for the town of Bardejov, the individual who held the office of judge (*judex* or *richtár*) in the year 1461 has been identified.\n\n<<<Jakub Głos>>>"
