    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the source and target spaces and their properties\n\nLet the map be denoted by `f: X → Y`.\n*   The source space is `X = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`.\n*   The target space is `Y = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`.\n\nWe need to determine the connectivity of these spaces. The connectivity of a space `Z`, denoted `conn(Z)`, is the largest integer `k` such that `πᵢ(Z) = 0` for all `i ≤ k`.\n\n**Connectivity of the source space X:**\n\n1.  **Loop spaces:** The connectivity of the loop space `ΩSⁿ` is `conn(ΩSⁿ) = n - 2`.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁴) = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁶) = 6 - 2 = 4`.\n\n2.  **Smash product:** For CW-complexes `A` and `B`, the connectivity of their smash product is `conn(A ∧ B) = conn(A) + conn(B) + 2`. `ΩSⁿ` is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) = conn(ΩS⁴) + conn(ΩS⁶) + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   This means `πᵢ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n\n3.  **Suspension:** The suspension functor `Σ` increases connectivity by 1.\n    *   `conn(X) = conn(Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)) = conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`.\n    *   So, `πᵢ(X) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`.\n\n**Connectivity of the target space Y:**\n\n1.  **Smash product of spheres:** The smash product `Sⁿ ∧ Sᵐ` is homeomorphic to `Sⁿ⁺ᵐ`.\n    *   `S⁴ ∧ S⁶ ≅ S¹⁰`.\n\n2.  **Loop space:** The target space is `Y = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶) ≅ ΩS¹⁰`.\n    *   `conn(Y) = conn(ΩS¹⁰) = 10 - 2 = 8`.\n    *   So, `πᵢ(Y) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the connectivity of a map to the connectivity of its homotopy fiber\n\nThe connectivity of a map `f: X → Y` is defined as the largest integer `k` such that the induced map on homotopy groups, `f_*: πᵢ(X) → πᵢ(Y)`, is an isomorphism for `i < k` and an epimorphism (surjection) for `i = k`.\n\nThis is equivalent to analyzing the homotopy fiber `F_f` of the map `f`. The map `f` is `k`-connected if and only if its homotopy fiber `F_f` is `(k-1)`-connected. So, `k = conn(F_f) + 1`.\n\nWe can find the connectivity of `F_f` by using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the fibration `F_f → X → Y`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups\n\nThe long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration `F_f → X → Y` is:\n`... → πᵢ₊₁(Y) → πᵢ(F_f) → πᵢ(X) → πᵢ(Y) → πᵢ₋₁(F_f) → ...`\n\nWe will use this sequence to determine `πᵢ(F_f)` for low values of `i`.\n\n*   **For `i ≤ 8`:**\n    We know `conn(X) = 9` and `conn(Y) = 8`. This means:\n    *   `πᵢ(X) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`.\n    *   `πᵢ(Y) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n    So for any `i ≤ 8`, the relevant part of the long exact sequence is:\n    `... → πᵢ(X) → πᵢ(Y) → πᵢ₋₁(F_f) → πᵢ₋₁(X) → ...`\n    `... → 0 → 0 → πᵢ₋₁(F_f) → 0 → ...`\n    By exactness, we must have `πᵢ₋₁(F_f) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`. This is equivalent to `πⱼ(F_f) = 0` for `j ≤ 7`.\n    This tells us that `conn(F_f) ≥ 7`.\n\n*   **For `i = 9`:**\n    The long exact sequence contains the segment:\n    `... → π₉(X) → π₉(Y) → π₈(F_f) → π₈(X) → ...`\n    Let's find the homotopy groups involved:\n    *   `π₉(X) = 0` since `conn(X) = 9`.\n    *   `π₈(X) = 0` since `conn(X) = 9`.\n    *   `π₉(Y) = π₉(ΩS¹⁰) = π₁₀(S¹⁰) = ℤ`.\n    Substituting these into the sequence:\n    `... → 0 → ℤ → π₈(F_f) → 0 → ...`\n    For the sequence to be exact at `π₉(Y)` and `π₈(F_f)`, the map `ℤ → π₈(F_f)` must be an isomorphism.\n    Therefore, `π₈(F_f) ≅ ℤ`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map\n\nFrom Step 3, we have found:\n*   `πⱼ(F_f) = 0` for `j ≤ 7`.\n*   `π₈(F_f) ≠ 0`.\n\nBy the definition of connectivity, this means `conn(F_f) = 7`.\n\nThe connectivity of the map `f` is `k = conn(F_f) + 1`.\n`k = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n\nThe connectivity of the map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)` is 8.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The connectivity calculations for the source and target spaces are standard results in algebraic topology.\n*   The definition of a map's connectivity and its relation to the homotopy fiber is crucial.\n*   The long exact sequence in homotopy is the primary tool to find the fiber's connectivity.\n*   This result holds for any map `f` between these spaces, as the argument only relies on the connectivity of the spaces themselves. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" ensures that a natural, non-zero map exists between these spaces, making the question meaningful.\n\n<<<8>>>"
