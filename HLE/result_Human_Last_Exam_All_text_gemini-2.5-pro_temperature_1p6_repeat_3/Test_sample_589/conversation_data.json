    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for a specific scene in a specific type of film. Let's break down the key elements required:\n1.  **Hollywood feature film:** A mainstream movie intended for theatrical release.\n2.  **Produced by a major film studio:** The film's backing company must be one of the large, established studios (e.g., Universal, Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony, Disney, 20th Century Studios).\n3.  **A teenager:** The character performing the action is an adolescent.\n4.  **Rides a pink bike:** The color of the bike is specifically pink. This is a crucial visual detail.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This describes the specific action, suggesting a confrontation or a game of \"chicken.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Common Guesses and Potential Traps\n\nSeveral popular films feature teenagers and bikes, but they often fail to meet all the specific criteria.\n*   ***It*** **(2017):** This film features a group of kids on bikes (The Losers' Club) who are confronted by bullies in a car. However, none of the main characters ride a pink bike, and the confrontation is more of a chase and a fight (the rock war) rather than a single rider pedaling head-on toward a car.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*** **(1982):** Famous for its bicycle chase scene, but the bikes are BMX style, not pink, and the kids are flying *over* the cars, not pedaling *toward* them.\n*   ***Now and Then*** **(1995):** This film features four young girls on their bikes, and one of them (Samantha) does ride a pink Schwinn. However, there is no scene where she pedals directly toward an oncoming car in a standoff. Their bike scenes involve racing each other.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite*** **(2004):** Napoleon rides a bike, but it is not pink, and there is no such scene with a car.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Film and Scene\n\nThe film that precisely matches all the given criteria is **The World's End** (2013), directed by Edgar Wright.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Each Element within the Correct Film\n\nLet's check each point from Step 1 against the scene in *The World's End*:\n1.  **Hollywood feature film:** Yes, it is a prominent feature film.\n2.  **Produced by a major film studio:** The film was distributed in North America by **Universal Pictures**, a major film studio.\n3.  **A teenager:** The scene is a flashback to the youth of the main characters. In this flashback, they encounter an unnamed teenage girl.\n4.  **Rides a pink bike:** The teenage girl in the scene is riding a distinctively **pink bike**.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** As the young protagonists drive recklessly down a narrow country lane, they come face-to-face with the girl on her pink bike. She does not swerve and instead continues to pedal defiantly and directly toward their oncoming car. The driver, a young Gary King, is forced to swerve at the last second to avoid hitting her.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scene in *The World's End* is a perfect match for every specific detail provided in the question. It is a major studio film in which a teenager on a pink bike deliberately pedals toward an oncoming car.\n\n<<<The World's End>>>"
