    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the initial setup and coordinates\nFirst, let's establish a coordinate system. We can place the first cube, let's call it C1, in a standard position. For a cube with a side length of 1, it is most convenient to define it as the region in 3D space where all coordinates are between 0 and 1.\n*   **Cube C1:** The set of all points (x, y, z) such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the shift\nThe problem states the second cube, C2, is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to\" C1.\n*   **Main Diagonal:** A cube has four main diagonals connecting opposite vertices. Let's consider the main diagonal connecting the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as applying a shift vector **v** that is `1/2` of the diagonal vector **d**.\n    *   **Shift vector v** = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   **Careful Point:** One could misinterpret this as a shift of *distance* 1/2. This would mean a shift vector of magnitude 1/2 in the direction of (1,1,1). This interpretation is less standard for this type of problem phrasing and would lead to a more complex calculation and an irrational result. The simpler, more direct interpretation of scaling the diagonal vector is standard.\n\n### Step 3: Define the second cube\nThe second cube, C2, is the first cube C1 translated by the shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means we add 1/2 to the bounds of each coordinate for C1.\n*   **Cube C2:** The set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the region of intersection\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) belongs to *both* C1 and C2. To find this region, we must find the intersection of the inequalities for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (from C1) AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (from C2). The common range is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` (from C1) AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` (from C2). The common range is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` (from C1) AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2` (from C2). The common range is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection\nThe intersection region is defined by the inequalities:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThis region is itself a cube. We can find its side length, `L`, for each dimension:\n*   `L = (upper bound) - (lower bound) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula `V = L³`.\n*   **Volume of intersection** = `(1/2)³ = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Final Check\n*   The logic holds. The intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube located at the corner of C1 that points in the direction of the shift.\n*   The problem is symmetrical. Shifting along any of the four main diagonals would yield the same volume of intersection due to the symmetry of the cube.\n*   The interpretation of the shift vector is the most critical step, and the one chosen is the most standard and leads to a simple, rational answer, which is common for such problems.\n\nThe final answer is the volume of this smaller intersection cube.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
