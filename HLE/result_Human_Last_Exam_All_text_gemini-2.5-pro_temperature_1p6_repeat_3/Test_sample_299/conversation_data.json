    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the properties of the function $f$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Deduce the fundamental properties of $f$**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. The given equation tells us this is equivalent to $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, the function $f$ must be injective.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** We are given that $f$ is a continuous function. A continuous and injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotone. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nWe analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - $f$ is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means that the composition $f(f(x))$ is a strictly increasing function. The function $\\exp(x)$ is indeed strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  Let's analyze the limits of $f$ at infinity.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, since $f$ is decreasing, its limit must be $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$, where $L$ can be a finite number or $-\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, its limit must be $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = U$, where $U$ can be a finite number or $\\infty$.\n    *   Because $f$ is decreasing, we must have $L < U$. The range of $f$ is the open interval $(L, U)$.\n\n3.  Let's analyze the limits of the composition $f(f(x))$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$.\n        Also, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y)$. For this limit to be $\\infty$, the input $y$ must approach $-\\infty$ (since $f$ is decreasing). This implies $L = -\\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n        Also, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y)$. If $U$ were $\\infty$, this limit would be $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = L = -\\infty$, which contradicts the limit being 0. Therefore, $U$ must be a finite real number.\n    *   By the continuity of $f$, we have $\\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y) = f(U)$. So, we must have $f(U) = 0$.\n\n4.  Now we have a collection of properties for any decreasing solution $f$:\n    a) $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n    b) $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = U \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    c) $f(U) = 0$.\n    d) The range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, U)$, which means $f(x) < U$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. For $x=U$, this implies $f(U) < U$, so $0 < U$.\n\n5.  Let's use the original equation to find more specific values.\n    *   From $f(U)=0$, we can compute $f(f(U)) = f(0)$.\n    *   From the given equation, $f(f(U)) = \\exp(U)$.\n    *   Therefore, $f(0) = \\exp(U)$. Since $U > 0$, we have $\\exp(U) > \\exp(0) = 1$. So, $f(0) > 1$.\n\n6.  Let's check for contradictions. We have established three key points:\n    *   $f(U) = 0$\n    *   $f(0) = e^U$\n    *   We also have $f(f(0))=e^0=1$, which means $f(e^U)=1$.\n\n7.  Let's check the ordering of the arguments $0, U, e^U$.\n    *   We know $U>0$.\n    *   For any $x>0$, the function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $g'(x) = e^x-1>0$, and $g(0)=1$. So $e^x > x$ for all $x$, in particular $e^U > U$.\n    *   So we have the strict ordering $0 < U < e^U$.\n\n8.  Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, applying $f$ to this chain of inequalities reverses the signs:\n    $f(0) > f(U) > f(e^U)$.\n\n9.  Now, substitute the values we found for the function at these points:\n    $e^U > 0 > 1$.\n\n10. The inequality $e^U > 0$ is always true. However, the inequality $0 > 1$ is false. This is a contradiction.\n\n11. The contradiction shows that our initial assumption must be false. There are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - $f$ is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n1.  Let's analyze the limits. Following a similar logic as in the decreasing case:\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\infty$. This implies $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$. Then $\\lim_{y\\to M^+} f(y)=0$. By continuity this implies $f(M)=0$. $M$ must be a finite real number, otherwise if $M=-\\infty$, $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty}f(y)=-\\infty \\ne 0$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(M, \\infty)$. So $f(x) > M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. At $x=M$, we get $f(M) > M$, which means $0 > M$. So $M$ must be negative.\n\n2.  We have derived several properties for any increasing solution $f$:\n    a) $f$ is strictly increasing.\n    b) $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$, for some $M < 0$.\n    c) $f(M)=0$.\n    d) Using the equation, $f(f(M)) = f(0)$ and $f(f(M)) = \\exp(M)$. Thus, $f(0) = e^M$. Since $M<0$, we have $0 < e^M < 1$.\n\n3.  Let $a = e^M$. So $a \\in (0,1)$. We have a sequence of points and values: $f(M)=0$, $f(0)=a$. Applying $f$ again: $f(a) = f(f(0)) = e^0=1$. $f(1)=f(f(a)) = e^a$. And so on.\n\n4.  We can show that a valid function $f$ can be constructed, and its behavior is uniquely determined by two choices:\n    a) The choice of the parameter $M \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. Let $a = e^M \\in (0,1)$.\n    b) The choice of the function's definition on a starting interval, for instance, $[0, a]$. On this interval, $f$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function connecting the point $(0,a)$ to $(a,1)$. Let's call this piece of the function $h_0(x)$, so $f(x) = h_0(x)$ for $x \\in [0, a]$, where $h_0(0)=a$ and $h_0(a)=1$.\n\n5.  Once $M$ and $h_0$ are chosen, the entire function $f$ is determined. For example:\n    *   For $x \\in [a, 1]$, $x$ is in the range of $h_0$. Let $y = h_0^{-1}(x) \\in [0, a]$. Then $f(x) = f(h_0(y)) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{h_0^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [M, 0]$, we need to find $f(x)$. Let $y=f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing, $y \\in [f(M), f(0)] = [0, a]$. Then $f(y) = f(f(x)) = e^x$. On the interval $[0,a]$, $f$ is $h_0$, so $h_0(y) = e^x$. This gives $y = h_0^{-1}(e^x)$. So, $f(x) = h_0^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    This process can be continued to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and the resulting function is continuous and strictly increasing and satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of possible functions**\n\nThe construction shows that each unique solution corresponds to a unique pair $(M, h_0)$.\n\n1.  **How many choices for M?** $M$ can be any number in $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **For a fixed M, how many choices for $h_0$?** $h_0$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$ (where $a=e^M$) with $h_0(0)=a$ and $h_0(a)=1$.\n    *   We can construct such functions by, for instance, choosing an intermediate point. Let $x_0 \\in (0,a)$ and $y_0 \\in (a,1)$. We can define $h_0$ as the piecewise linear function that goes from $(0,a)$ to $(x_0, y_0)$ and then to $(a,1)$.\n    *   There are uncountably many choices for $y_0$ for any fixed $x_0$. So, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from $[0,a]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set of our functions $h_0$ is a subset of this, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, for each choice of $M$, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ possible functions for $h_0$.\n\n3.  **Total Cardinality:** The total number of solutions is the number of possible pairs $(M, h_0)$. This is the product of the cardinalities of the sets of choices for $M$ and $h_0$.\n    $|S| = |(-\\infty, 0)| \\times |\\{\\text{choices for } h_0\\}| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of solutions contains only strictly increasing functions. The number of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
