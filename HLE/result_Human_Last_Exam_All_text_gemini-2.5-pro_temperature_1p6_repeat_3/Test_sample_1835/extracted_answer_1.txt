Yes. According to Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, thought is systematic and its conceptual components are recombinable. To understand the proposition `Fa`, you must possess a general concept of the property `F` that is independent of the concept of the object `a`. This means you grasp the predicate `Fx` as a distinct conceptual unit. You are also explicitly assumed to understand universal quantification (`∀`), which is a logical operation that applies to predicates. The Generality Constraint dictates that if you possess the conceptual components (the predicate `Fx` and the quantifier `∀`), you must be able to combine them systematically. Therefore, you should be able to form and understand the proposition `∀x Fx`.
