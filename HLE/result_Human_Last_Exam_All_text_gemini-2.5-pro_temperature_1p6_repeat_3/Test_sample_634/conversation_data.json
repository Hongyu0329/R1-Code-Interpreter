    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We need to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\n    P1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n    P2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  **Method:** The standard method to find the GCRD is the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. We stack the two matrices and use elementary row operations to reduce the stacked matrix. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form a GCRD.\n    The elementary row operations are:\n    i.   Swapping two rows.\n    ii.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    iii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n3.  **Form the Stacked Matrix:**\n    Let M be the stacked matrix of P1 and P2. Let the rows be denoted by R1, R2, R3, R4.\n    M =\n    [R1:  s^2 + s, -s]\n    [R2: -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n    [R3:        s,    0]\n    [R4:    -s - 1,   1]\n\n4.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations:**\n    Our goal is to create zeros in the first column below the first row by using rows with the lowest degree polynomial in the first column. R3 and R4 have the lowest degree (1). Let's use them to simplify the matrix.\n\n    *   **Step A: Simplify using existing rows.** A simple first step is to add R3 to R4.\n        Let the new R4 be `R4' = R4 + R3`:\n        R4' = [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]\n        The matrix becomes:\n        [ s^2 + s, -s]\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n        [       s,   0]\n        [      -1,   1]\n\n    *   **Step B: Use the simplest row as a pivot.** The new R4', which is [-1, 1], has a constant as its first element. This is an ideal pivot. Let's move this row to the top (by swapping rows) and call it the new R1''.\n        The matrix is now:\n        [R1'':      -1,       1]\n        [R2'':  s^2 + s,     -s]\n        [R3'': -s^2 - 1,     s^2]\n        [R4'':        s,       0]\n\n    *   **Step C: Eliminate other elements in the first column.** Use R1'' to make the first element of R2'', R3'', and R4'' zero.\n        *   `R2'' -> R2'' + (s^2 + s) * R1''`:\n            [s^2 + s, -s] + (s^2 + s) * [-1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s^2 + s] = [0, s^2]\n        *   `R3'' -> R3'' - (s^2 + 1) * R1''`:\n            [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - (s^2 + 1) * [-1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2 + 1, s^2 - (s^2 + 1)] = [0, -1]\n        *   `R4'' -> R4'' + s * R1''`:\n            [s, 0] + s * [-1, 1] = [s - s, 0 + s] = [0, s]\n        The matrix transforms to:\n        [-1,   1]\n        [ 0,  s^2]\n        [ 0,  -1]\n        [ 0,   s]\n\n    *   **Step D: Focus on the second column.** We have a sub-problem with the last three rows. The row [0, -1] has the simplest non-zero element. Let's move it up to become the second pivot row.\n        The matrix is now ordered as:\n        [R1''': -1,   1]\n        [R2''':  0,  -1]\n        [R3''':  0,  s^2]\n        [R4''':  0,   s]\n\n    *   **Step E: Eliminate other elements in the second column.** Use the new pivot row R2''' = [0, -1].\n        *   `R1''' -> R1''' + R2'''`:\n            [-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]\n        *   `R3''' -> R3''' + s^2 * R2'''`:\n            [0, s^2] + s^2 * [0, -1] = [0, s^2 - s^2] = [0, 0]\n        *   `R4''' -> R4''' + s * R2'''`:\n            [0, s] + s * [0, -1] = [0, s - s] = [0, 0]\n        The matrix is now fully reduced:\n        [-1,  0]\n        [ 0, -1]\n        [ 0,  0]\n        [ 0,  0]\n\n5.  **Identify the GCRD:** The non-zero rows of the final matrix form a GCRD.\n    R(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result and Finalize:**\n    A GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n    *   Let's check the determinant of our result R(s): det(R(s)) = (-1)*(-1) - (0)*(0) = 1. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, R(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n    *   When the GCRD is unimodular, it signifies that the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**.\n    *   Any unimodular matrix can serve as the GCRD in this case. By convention, the simplest form is chosen, which is the identity matrix I.\n    *   We can obtain the identity matrix by multiplying our result R(s) on the left by the unimodular matrix U(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]:\n        U(s) * R(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[-1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I\n    Therefore, the identity matrix is also a GCRD and is the most standard answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
