    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $K$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Space**\n\nThe space is $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is the space of 3-tensors of size $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$. An element in this space is defined by its values $T(x, y, z)$ for $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\nThe function defining the tensor is given by:\n\\[ T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1 \\]\nwhere $x=(x_1, ..., x_n)$, $y=(y_1, ..., y_n)$, $z=(z_1, ..., z_n)$ with $x_i, y_i, z_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Tensor to a Tensor Product**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the main term $\\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\nLet $S_1$ be the $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor (a function on $\\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\}$) defined by $S_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$.\nThe product form suggests that the tensor $S_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $S_1$. That is, $S_n = S_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nThe given tensor is $T_n = S_1^{\\otimes n} - \\mathbf{J}_n$, where $\\mathbf{J}_n$ is the tensor whose entries are all 1. The tensor $\\mathbf{J}_n$ has rank 1, and therefore slice rank 1, since $\\mathbf{J}_n(x,y,z) = u(x)v(y)w(z)$ where $u,v,w$ are the all-ones functions.\n\nThe slice rank is subadditive, so $\\text{slicerank}(A-B) \\ge |\\text{slicerank}(A) - \\text{slicerank}(B)|$.\nFor large $n$, the slice rank of $S_1^{\\otimes n}$ will grow exponentially, so the slice rank of $T_n$ will have the same asymptotic behavior as the slice rank of $S_1^{\\otimes n}$.\nThe problem boils down to finding the asymptotic slice rank of $S_1$, denoted $Q(S_1) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (\\text{slicerank}(S_1^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$.\nThe problem states that this value is $(3/2^K)$. We need to find $K$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor $S_1$**\n\nThe tensor $S_1$ is defined by $S_1(i,j,k) = i+j+k$ for $i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We want to find its slice rank.\nA tensor $T$ has slice rank $r$ if $r$ is the minimum number of slices that sum to $T$. A slice is a tensor of the form $u \\otimes B$, $v \\otimes C$, or $w \\otimes D$.\n\nLet's represent vectors in the space $V = \\mathbb{C}^2$ (functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$) as pairs $(u_0, u_1)$. The tensor can be viewed as a trilinear map $S_1(u,v,w) = \\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}} (i+j+k) u_i v_j w_k$.\n\nWe can decompose this sum:\n$S_1(u,v,w) = \\sum_{i,j,k} i u_i v_j w_k + \\sum_{i,j,k} j u_i v_j w_k + \\sum_{i,j,k} k u_i v_j w_k$.\nThis is equal to:\n$(\\sum_i i u_i)(\\sum_j v_j)(\\sum_k w_k) + (\\sum_i u_i)(\\sum_j j v_j)(\\sum_k w_k) + (\\sum_i u_i)(\\sum_j v_j)(\\sum_k k w_k)$.\n\nLet's define two linear forms on $\\mathbb{C}^2$: $L(u) = u_1$ and $M(u) = u_0+u_1$.\nThen the decomposition becomes:\n$S_1(u,v,w) = L(u)M(v)M(w) + M(u)L(v)M(w) + M(u)M(v)L(w)$.\nThis expresses $S_1$ as a sum of three rank-1 tensors. This shows its tensor rank is at most 3.\n\nLet's analyze this from the slice rank perspective.\nThe term $L(u)M(v)M(w)$ can be written as $A(u) B(v,w)$ where $A=L$ and $B(v,w)=M(v)M(w)$. This is a slice of type 1.\nThe term $M(u)L(v)M(w)$ can be written as $C(v) D(u,w)$ where $C=L$ and $D(u,w)=M(u)M(w)$. This is a slice of type 2.\nThe term $M(u)M(v)L(w)$ can be written as $E(w) F(u,v)$ where $E=L$ and $F(u,v)=M(u)M(v)$. This is a slice of type 3.\nSo, $S_1$ is a sum of three slices, which means $\\text{slicerank}(S_1) \\le 3$.\n\nLet's try to find a smaller decomposition. Can we write $S_1$ as a sum of two slices?\nConsider the decomposition $S_1(i,j,k) = i + (j+k)$.\nLet's define a slice $S_a(i,j,k) = i$. This corresponds to the slice $(i \\mapsto i) \\otimes (j,k \\mapsto 1)$, which is a type-1 slice.\nLet's define a second slice $S_b(i,j,k) = j+k$. This corresponds to the slice $(i \\mapsto 1) \\otimes (j,k \\mapsto j+k)$, which is also a type-1 slice.\nThe sum $S_a + S_b$ gives $S_1$.\nSo, $S_1$ can be written as a sum of two slices. Thus, $\\text{slicerank}(S_1) \\le 2$.\n\nTo show that the slice rank is exactly 2, we must show it's not 1. If $\\text{slicerank}(S_1)=1$, then $S_1$ would be a slice, for instance, of type 1, meaning $S_1(i,j,k) = A(i)B(j,k)$.\n$i+j+k = A(i)B(j,k)$.\nFor $i=0$: $j+k = A(0)B(j,k)$. So $B(j,k)=(j+k)/A(0)$ (assuming $A(0) \\ne 0$).\nFor $i=1$: $1+j+k = A(1)B(j,k) = A(1)(j+k)/A(0)$.\nThis implies $1 = (A(1)/A(0) - 1)(j+k)$. This cannot hold for all $j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}$. So $S_1$ is not a slice.\nTherefore, $\\text{slicerank}(S_1) = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Bounding the Asymptotic Slice Rank**\n\nA basic property of slice rank is sub-multiplicativity for tensor products: $\\text{slicerank}(A \\otimes B) \\le \\text{slicerank}(A) \\cdot \\text{slicerank}(B)$.\nApplying this property repeatedly gives:\n$\\text{slicerank}(S_1^{\\otimes n}) \\le (\\text{slicerank}(S_1))^n = 2^n$.\n\nThis implies that the asymptotic slice rank $Q(S_1)$ satisfies $Q(S_1) \\le 2$.\n\nThe techniques that give improved bounds on asymptotic rank (like the Coppersmith-Winograd method and its descendants) show that sometimes $Q(T) < \\text{slicerank}(T)$. Such tensors are key to algorithms for fast matrix multiplication.\nThe tensor $S_1$ has the right algebraic structure to be a candidate for such an improved bound. The question provides a formula for the slice rank which indicates that $Q(S_1)$ is not simply 2, but a different constant. The question asserts that $\\text{slicerank}(T_n) = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$, which means $Q(S_1) = 3/2^K$.\n\nWithout diving into the complex machinery of these advanced methods, we can recognize that the problem asks for a known, albeit non-trivial, result. For many tensors, the asymptotic rank is not known. However, for some small tensors that appear in this context, it is. The Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $T_{CW_q}$ has slice rank $q+2$ but asymptotic slice rank $q+1$. Our tensor is not $T_{CW_q}$.\n\nLet's re-examine the decomposition into 2 slices of type 1: $S_1 = A_1 \\otimes B_1 + A_2 \\otimes B_2$.\nThen $S_1^{\\otimes n} = (A_1 \\otimes B_1 + A_2 \\otimes B_2)^{\\otimes n} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (A_1 \\otimes B_1)^{\\otimes k} \\otimes (A_2 \\otimes B_2)^{\\otimes (n-k)}$.\nA term in this sum is $\\text{Sym}((A_1^{\\otimes k} \\otimes A_2^{\\otimes(n-k)}) \\otimes (B_1^{\\otimes k} \\otimes B_2^{\\otimes(n-k)}))$. This is a type-1 slice.\nThe total number of slices is the number of distinct functions $A_I = A_1^{\\otimes I} \\otimes A_2^{\\otimes I^c}$. As shown in thought process, the dimension of the space spanned by these functions is $2^n$. This gives the $Q(S_1) \\le 2$ bound.\n\nIf the problem statement is accurate, we must have $Q(S_1) < 2$. However, an alternative interpretation is that the formula provided is a way to *define* $K$ via an equation. Given that the upper bound $Q(S_1) \\le 2$ is quite direct, it's very likely that this bound is tight, unless there's a non-obvious cancellation scheme (which is what the advanced methods are all about).\n\nIf we assume there are no such \"tricks\" for this tensor, or that the question is simpler than it seems, then the asymptotic slice rank would be equal to the \"trivial\" bound derived from the slice rank of the base tensor. In this case, $Q(S_1) = \\text{slicerank}(S_1) = 2$.\nLet's assume this is the intended solution path.\nWe set the asymptotic value equal to 2.\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\]\nSolving for $K$:\n\\[ 2^K = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ K = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\]\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3) - 1$. This evaluates to approximately $1.585 - 1 = 0.585$.\n\nFinal check: The structure of the problem is very similar to research questions in algebraic complexity theory, where for specific tensors, the asymptotic rank is shown to be strictly smaller than the rank of the base tensor. If this is the case, $Q(S_1) < 2$, and $K > \\log_2(1.5)$. However, computing the exact value of $Q(S_1)$ requires stating or re-deriving a research result. The most straightforward interpretation is that the asymptotic growth is simply $2^n$.\n\nLet's assume the provided formula is correct as given and the most direct calculation for the asymptotic base is the correct one to use.\nAsymptotic slice rank is $Q(S_1)=2$.\nTherefore $3/2^K = 2$.\n$2^K = 3/2$.\n$K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nFinal Answer should be the value of K.\n\n$K=\\log_2(1.5)$."
