    "This question asks for the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve over a valuation field, with the condition that its Jacobian variety has good reduction.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the conditions\n\n1.  **Curve and Valuation Field**: We have a curve $C$ of genus $g=4$ defined over a field $K$ with a valuation. We are interested in its stable reduction, which is a stable curve $\\mathcal{C}_s$ over the residue field $k$. A stable curve is a connected nodal curve with a finite automorphism group.\n\n2.  **Jacobian with Good Reduction**: The Jacobian of $C$, denoted $J(C)$, is an abelian variety of dimension 4. The condition that $J(C)$ has good reduction has a precise meaning in terms of the stable reduction $\\mathcal{C}_s$. The connected component of the identity of the special fiber of the Néron model of $J(C)$ is an extension of an abelian variety $A$ by a torus $T$. Good reduction means this special fiber is purely an abelian variety, which implies the torus part $T$ is trivial (i.e., $\\dim T = 0$).\n\n3.  **Relating Reduction of Curve and Jacobian**: A fundamental result by Raynaud connects the geometry of the stable reduction $\\mathcal{C}_s$ to the structure of the reduction of its Jacobian.\n    *   The dimension of the torus part, $\\dim T$, is given by the first Betti number of the dual graph of $\\mathcal{C}_s$. The dual graph, let's call it $\\Gamma$, has vertices for the irreducible components of $\\mathcal{C}_s$ and edges for the nodes connecting them. So, $\\dim T = \\text{rank}(H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    *   The dimension of the abelian part, $\\dim A$, is the sum of the genera of the irreducible components of $\\mathcal{C}_s$.\n\n4.  **Consequences of Good Reduction**:\n    *   The condition $\\dim T = 0$ implies that the dual graph $\\Gamma$ must be a **tree** (a graph with no cycles).\n    *   For a curve with good reduction, the dimension of the Jacobian must be preserved upon reduction. The dimension of the reduced Jacobian is $\\dim A + \\dim T = \\sum g_i + \\text{rank}(H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}))$. This must equal the genus $g=4$.\n    *   The arithmetic genus of a nodal curve $\\mathcal{C}_s$ is given by $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - n + 1$, where $g_i$ are the geometric genera of the $n$ components and $\\delta$ is the number of nodes.\n    *   For a tree, the number of edges (nodes) $\\delta$ is related to the number of vertices (components) $n$ by $\\delta = n-1$. Plugging this into the genus formula gives $g = \\sum g_i + (n-1) - n + 1 = \\sum g_i$.\n    *   So, the problem boils down to finding configurations of curves whose dual graph is a tree and the sum of the genera of the components is 4.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Stability Conditions\n\nThe stable reduction $\\mathcal{C}_s$ must be a stable curve. For a nodal curve whose dual graph is a tree, stability imposes conditions on its components:\n*   A component $C_i$ with genus $g_i=0$ (a rational curve) must have at least 3 nodes on it. In the context of the dual graph, this means the corresponding vertex $v_i$ must have a degree of at least 3, i.e., $d(v_i) \\ge 3$.\n*   A component $C_i$ with genus $g_i=1$ (an elliptic curve) must have at least 1 node on it. As long as it is connected to the rest of the curve, this is satisfied.\n*   A \"type\" of stable reduction corresponds to a unique labeled dual graph, where vertices are labeled by genera, considered up to graph isomorphism.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerating the Types\n\nWe classify the types by the number of components, $n$. For each $n$, we check possible tree structures and partitions of 4 into $n$ genera, subject to the stability constraints.\n\n*   **n=1**: The dual graph is a single vertex. It must have genus 4. $\\mathcal{C}_s$ is a smooth curve of genus 4.\n    *   **1 type**.\n\n*   **n=2**: The dual graph is a line with two vertices, $v_1-v_2$. Both vertices have degree 1.\n    *   Stability: $d(v_1)=d(v_2)=1$, so $g_1>0$ and $g_2>0$.\n    *   Genera: $g_1+g_2=4$. Partitions of 4 into 2 positive integers are (3,1) and (2,2).\n    *   **2 types**: {g=3}---{g=1} and {g=2}---{g=2}.\n\n*   **n=3**: The only tree is a path, $v_1-v_2-v_3$.\n    *   Stability: $d(v_1)=1, d(v_3)=1 \\implies g_1>0, g_3>0$. $d(v_2)=2 \\implies g_2>0$. So all genera must be positive.\n    *   Genera: $g_1+g_2+g_3=4$. The only partition into 3 positive integers is (2,1,1).\n    *   Assignments: The central vertex $v_2$ can have genus 2 or 1.\n        1.  (1,2,1): {g=1}---{g=2}---{g=1}.\n        2.  (2,1,1) or (1,1,2): {g=2}---{g=1}---{g=1}.\n    *   **2 types**.\n\n*   **n=4**: Two possible trees: the path $P_4$ and the star $K_{1,3}$.\n    *   **Path ($P_4$)**: $v_1-v_2-v_3-v_4$. Degrees are (1,2,2,1). All vertices must have positive genus. The only partition of 4 into 4 positive integers is (1,1,1,1).\n        *   **1 type**: {1}-{1}-{1}-{1}.\n    *   **Star ($K_{1,3}$)**: A central vertex $v_c$ connected to 3 leaves $v_1,v_2,v_3$.\n        *   Stability: $d(v_{leaves})=1 \\implies g_{leaves}>0$. $d(v_c)=3 \\implies g_c \\ge 0$.\n        *   Genera: $g_c+g_1+g_2+g_3=4$. We need partitions of 4 into 4 parts where at most one part (for $g_c$) is zero.\n            1.  (1,1,1,1): All genera are 1. One assignment.\n            2.  (2,1,1,0): The 0 must be $g_c$. Leaf genera are {2,1,1}. Unique assignment up to isomorphism.\n        *   **2 types** from the star graph.\n    *   Total for n=4: 1 + 2 = **3 types**.\n\n*   **n=5**: Three possible trees: $P_5$, $K_{1,4}$, and a \"fork\".\n    *   **Path ($P_5$)**: Has internal vertices of degree 2, so all 5 components must have positive genus. Sum of genera would be $\\ge 5$. Impossible.\n    *   **Star ($K_{1,4}$)**: Center $v_c$ (deg 4), 4 leaves (deg 1). Leaves must have $g>0$. Center can have $g_c=0$. Partition of 4 into 5 parts must be (1,1,1,1,0). The 0 must be $g_c$. Leaves are all genus 1.\n        *   **1 type**.\n    *   **Fork**: One vertex of degree 3, one of degree 2, three leaves. Leaves and deg-2 vertex must have $g>0$. Vertex of deg-3 can have $g=0$. So we need $\\ge 4$ positive genera. Partition must be (1,1,1,1,0). The zero genus must go to the deg-3 vertex. The rest are genus 1.\n        *   **1 type**.\n    *   Total for n=5: 0 + 1 + 1 = **2 types**.\n\n*   **n=6**: Requires a careful analysis of tree structures.\n    *   Genera: $\\sum g_i = 4$. Any partition into 6 parts must have at least two 0s. Let $N_+$ be the number of positive genera.\n    *   Stability requires a tree with $L+I_2 \\le N_+$, where $L$ is the number of leaves and $I_2$ is the number of internal vertices of degree 2.\n    *   The only possibility is the partition (1,1,1,1,0,0) with $N_+=4$, which can be realized by a unique tree with 6 vertices: the \"H-shaped\" graph with 4 leaves and 2 internal vertices, both of degree 3. Here $L=4, I_2=0$, so $L+I_2=4 \\le N_+$.\n    *   The 4 leaves must have genus 1, and the 2 internal vertices must have genus 0.\n    *   **1 type**.\n\n*   **n ≥ 7**: A systematic analysis shows that no tree with $n \\ge 7$ vertices can satisfy the stability constraints for any partition of 4 into $n$ parts.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nSumming the number of types from each case:\n*   n=1: 1 type\n*   n=2: 2 types\n*   n=3: 2 types\n*   n=4: 3 types\n*   n=5: 2 types\n*   n=6: 1 type\n*   n≥7: 0 types\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n<<<11>>>"
