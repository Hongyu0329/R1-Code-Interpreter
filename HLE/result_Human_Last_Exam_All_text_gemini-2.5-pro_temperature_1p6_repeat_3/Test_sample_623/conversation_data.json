    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Molecule\nThe molecule in question is **1,4-¹³C glucose**. This means that it is a glucose molecule where the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde/anomeric carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C isotope.\n\n**Structure of 1,4-¹³C glucose (linear form):**\n```\n      ¹³CHO (C1)\n        |\n      H-C-OH (C2)\n        |\n    HO-C-H (C3)\n        |\n      H-¹³C-OH (C4)\n        |\n      H-C-OH (C5)\n        |\n       CH₂OH (C6)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Metabolic Pathway\nThe question specifies that the molecule goes through **glycolysis**. It is crucial to limit the analysis to only the set of reactions that constitute the glycolytic pathway.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Net Reaction of Glycolysis\nGlycolysis is a sequence of ten enzymatic reactions that convert one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. The overall net reaction is:\nGlucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Carbon Flow and CO₂ Production in Glycolysis\nLet's analyze the carbon balance in the net reaction:\n*   **Input:** 1 molecule of Glucose (a 6-carbon molecule)\n*   **Output:** 2 molecules of Pyruvate (each a 3-carbon molecule)\n\nThe entire carbon skeleton of the initial 6-carbon glucose is conserved and ends up in the two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules (2 * 3 carbons = 6 carbons). There are no steps in the glycolytic pathway where a carbon atom is removed from the sugar backbone. Reactions that release CO₂ are called **decarboxylation** reactions. A review of the ten steps of glycolysis confirms that there are **no decarboxylation reactions**.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Scope of the Question:** The question is very specific: \"goes through glycolysis\". It does not ask about subsequent pathways like alcoholic fermentation, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (link reaction), or the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle).\n2.  **CO₂ Production in Related Pathways:** It's important not to be misled by other pathways.\n    *   **Alcoholic fermentation** (in yeast): Pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, releasing CO₂.\n    *   **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex** (aerobic respiration): Pyruvate is decarboxylated to form acetyl-CoA, releasing CO₂.\n    *   **Krebs Cycle** (aerobic respiration): Two more molecules of CO₂ are released per acetyl-CoA.\n    *   These pathways occur *after* glycolysis but are not part of it. The labeling information (¹³C at C1 and C4) would be relevant for tracking the carbon into these subsequent pathways, but it is extraneous for the question asked.\n3.  **Fate of the ¹³C Labels (For Context):** Although not needed for the answer, if we were to trace the carbons, the C4 label would end up on the carboxyl carbon of one of the pyruvate molecules. This specific carbon is the one released as CO₂ in both alcoholic fermentation and the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. Thus, if the question had asked about these subsequent steps, the answer would have been 1. The C1 label ends up on the methyl carbon of the other pyruvate molecule, which is not immediately decarboxylated.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis:\nSince the process is strictly limited to glycolysis, and glycolysis does not produce any CO₂ molecules, it follows that no ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules can be released.\n\nThe final answer is therefore **0**.\n\n<<<0>>>"
