The appropriate management begins with an immediate referral to a physician to start treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes, as her HbA1c of 7.5% poses a high risk for infection and poor healing. Simultaneously, emergency dental care involves cleaning and suturing the wound, prescribing antibiotics, managing pain, and taking radiographs (ideally a CBCT) to assess for bone fractures. Replantation of the lost teeth is impossible due to the 28-hour delay. An interim removable partial denture should be made for aesthetics while the site heals and her medical condition improves.

The key cells of interest are **osteoblasts** (for bone healing), **fibroblasts** (for soft tissue healing), and immune cells like **neutrophils and macrophages** (for fighting infection), all of which are compromised by her diabetes. **Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells**, which would have been vital for replantation, are now necrotic.

If a definitive denture is chosen, the most appropriate option is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy** with **acrylic** saddles and teeth. The **abutment teeth** would be the **left second premolar** and the **left central incisor** to support the denture near the gap. Crucially, abutments on the contralateral side, such as the **right canine and a right molar**, would also be used to provide essential **cross-arch stabilization** and prevent the denture from rocking, which is especially important given her Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88‚Å∞).
