    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific artwork and its context:** The question refers to a self-portrait by the German painter Curt Querner painted in 1933. The crucial context is that he had just been arrested and briefly imprisoned by Nazi authorities (specifically the SA, the precursor to the Gestapo's full power) due to his membership in the Communist Party. The painting is known as \"Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel\" or \"Self-Portrait with Palette Knife.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the object in his hand:** By examining the painting, we can see that Querner is holding a tool specific to his profession as a painter. This tool is a palette knife, sometimes referred to as a spatula (Spachtel in German).\n\n3.  **Analyze the symbolism of the object:** The choice to include this object and the way he holds it is highly symbolic, especially given the context.\n    *   **The Artist's \"Weapon\":** As a painter living under a repressive regime that would soon label his style \"degenerate art,\" Querner's art itself was his primary means of expression and defiance. The palette knife is a tool used to apply, mix, and scrape paint. In this portrait, it is held not casually, but firmly and assertively, much like one might hold a weapon.\n    *   **Symbol of Unbroken Will:** By portraying himself with the tool of his trade immediately after his imprisonment, Querner asserts that his spirit is not broken. He is defiantly presenting himself as what he is: an artist who will continue his work despite political persecution.\n    *   **Resistance through Art:** The palette knife symbolizes his commitment to his artistic identity and his refusal to be silenced. It represents his only weapon against the overwhelming force of the totalitarian stateâ€”his creative and artistic will. His resistance is not one of violence, but one of continued artistic production in the face of oppression.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish between a literal and symbolic weapon:** The palette knife is not a literal weapon for fighting. Its power is entirely symbolic, representing the artist's resilience and defiance.\n*   **Context is key:** Without the knowledge of his arrest in 1933, the object might just be seen as a simple attribute of a painter. The political context elevates it to a powerful symbol of resistance.\n*   **Artist's identity:** The portrait is a powerful statement about identity. He is not depicting himself as a victim, but as a worker and an artist, ready to continue his craft.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the object Curt Querner holds is a palette knife. It symbolizes his unbroken will, his identity as an artist, and his defiant resistance through art against the nascent Nazi regime that had just imprisoned him.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a painter's palette knife (or spatula). This object symbolizes his artistic identity and his unbroken will to continue his work, serving as his symbolic \"weapon\" of resistance against the Nazi regime.>>>"
