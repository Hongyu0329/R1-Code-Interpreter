    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and basic properties.**\n*   We are looking for the f-vector, which is the tuple of face counts $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$, for a 4-dimensional polytope (4-polytope).\n*   The number of vertices is given: $f_0 = 6$.\n*   The polytope is specified as **non-simplicial**. A polytope is simplicial if all its facets are simplices. For a 4-polytope, a simplex is a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex). So, a non-simplicial 4-polytope must have at least one facet (3-face) that is not a tetrahedron.\n*   The polytope must have the **maximal number of 2-faces** ($f_2$) possible for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n*   All 4-polytopes must satisfy Euler's formula: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$. Substituting $f_0 = 6$, we get $6 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$, or $f_1 - f_2 + f_3 = 6$.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the upper bound for the number of faces.**\nThe Upper Bound Theorem (UBT) states that for any given dimension $d$ and number of vertices $n$, the polytope with the maximum possible number of faces of all dimensions is the cyclic polytope, $C_d(n)$. Cyclic polytopes are always simplicial.\n\nFor a 4-polytope with 6 vertices ($d=4, n=6$), the maximums are achieved by $C_4(6)$. The f-vector for $C_4(6)$ is $(6, 15, 18, 9)$. Thus, for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices, $f_2 \\le 18$.\n\nA crucial theorem in polytope theory states that a polytope having the same f-vector as a simplicial polytope must itself be simplicial. This implies that any non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices cannot have the f-vector $(6, 15, 18, 9)$. Therefore, its number of 2-faces, $f_2$, must be strictly less than 18. So, $f_2 \\le 17$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.**\nLet $P$ be a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n1.  Since $P$ is non-simplicial, it must have at least one facet $F$ which is not a tetrahedron.\n2.  A 3-polytope (polyhedron) with 4 vertices must be a tetrahedron. Therefore, the non-simplicial facet $F$ must have 5 or more vertices.\n3.  The vertices of a facet $F$ are a subset of the vertices of the polytope $P$. Thus, the number of vertices of $F$, $f_0(F)$, must be less than or equal to the number of vertices of $P$, which is 6.\n4.  Can a facet $F$ have 6 vertices? If $f_0(F) = 6$, then all 6 vertices of the polytope $P$ lie on the hyperplane defined by $F$. This would mean $P$ is identical to $F$, making it a 3-polytope, not a 4-polytope. This is a contradiction. So, no facet can have 6 vertices.\n5.  From points 2, 3, and 4, we conclude that any non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices must have at least one facet with exactly 5 vertices. The only combinatorial type of 3-polytope with 5 vertices is the square pyramid. Let's call it $S_p$. Its f-vector is $(f_0, f_1, f_2) = (5, 8, 5)$.\n6.  Let $F$ be a facet of $P$ that is a square pyramid. Let the vertices of $P$ be $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_6\\}$, and let the vertices of $F$ be $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_5\\}$. The sixth vertex, $v_6$, cannot lie in the 3D hyperplane containing $F$. The polytope $P$ is the convex hull of its vertices, which can be described as the convex hull of $F$ and the point $v_6$. This construction is known as taking a **pyramid** over the base $F$. So, $P = \\text{Pyr}(F) = \\text{Pyr}(S_p)$.\n\nThis argument shows that any non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices must be combinatorially equivalent to the pyramid over a square pyramid. This means there is only one such combinatorial type.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the f-vector.**\nSince there is only one combinatorial type of non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices, it trivially satisfies the condition of having the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" for its category. We just need to compute its f-vector.\n\nLet's use the standard formulas for the number of faces of a pyramid $P = \\text{Pyr}(B)$ over a d-polytope base $B$. The number of k-faces of $P$ is given by $f_k(P) = f_k(B) + f_{k-1}(B)$ for $k \\ge 0$ (with $f_{-1}(B)=1$). Our base is the square pyramid $S_p$, a 3-polytope.\n*   f-vector of the base $S_p$: $f_0(S_p)=5$, $f_1(S_p)=8$, $f_2(S_p)=5$.\n*   $f_0(P) = f_0(S_p) + f_{-1}(S_p) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   $f_1(P) = f_1(S_p) + f_0(S_p) = 8 + 5 = 13$.\n*   $f_2(P) = f_2(S_p) + f_1(S_p) = 5 + 8 = 13$.\n*   $f_3(P) = f_3(S_p) + f_2(S_p) = 0 + 5 = 5$? This formula is not quite right. A better way: The facets of $P$ are the base $B$ itself and the pyramids over the facets of $B$. For a 4-polytope $P = \\text{Pyr}(B)$ where $B$ is a 3-polytope, the facets of $P$ are $B$ and $f_2(B)$ tetrahedra/pyramids. So, $f_3(P) = 1 + f_2(S_p) = 1 + 5 = 6$.\n\nLet's reconfirm the f-vector calculation:\n*   **Vertices ($f_0$):** 5 vertices of the base pyramid + 1 apex vertex = 6.\n*   **Edges ($f_1$):** 8 edges of the base + 5 edges connecting the apex to base vertices = 13.\n*   **2-Faces ($f_2$):** 5 faces of the base (1 square, 4 triangles) + 8 triangular faces formed by connecting the apex to the base edges = 13.\n*   **3-Faces (Facets, $f_3$):** The base square pyramid is one facet. The pyramids formed over each of the 5 faces of the base form 5 more facets = 6.\nSo the f-vector is $(6, 13, 13, 6)$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification.**\nThe resulting f-vector is $(6, 13, 13, 6)$. Let's check Euler's formula: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 6 - 13 + 13 - 6 = 0$. The formula holds. This confirms the calculations.\n\nThe complete classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices confirms there are three types: two are simplicial ($(6, 15, 18, 9)$ and $(6, 14, 16, 8)$), and one is non-simplicial with f-vector $(6, 13, 13, 6)$. Thus, this is indeed the unique non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices, and its f-vector is the required answer.\n\nThe final answer is the f-vector $(6, 13, 13, 6)$.\n\n<<< (6, 13, 13, 6) >>>"
