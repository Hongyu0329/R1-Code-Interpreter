    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the careful points to consider:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core terminology.**\n*   **Cambré:** A French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist, either forward, backward, or to the side.\n*   **Derrière:** A French ballet term meaning \"to the back.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A backbend, executed while maintaining ballet posture and alignment.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A highly structured and codified Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It emphasizes clean lines, strength, stability in the torso, and expressive upper body work (port de bras). It is known for its logical progression and building a strong, reliable technique.\n*   **Balanchine Method/Style:** A style of ballet developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, dynamism, musicality, and pushing the classical vocabulary to its limits. It often features deeper pliés, more extreme lines, and a different use of energy.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the movement (Cambré Derrière) within each method.**\n*   **Vaganova Cambré Derrière:** The primary focus is on stability and control. The movement is initiated from the upper back (thoracic spine). A key rule is to keep the hips \"square\" and directly over the supporting leg(s). The hips do not push forward. This ensures the bend is supported by the back and abdominal muscles, creating a pure, classical arc without distorting the body's central alignment. The degree of the bend is dictated by the dancer's flexibility *while maintaining this strict hip alignment*.\n\n*   **Balanchine Cambré Derrière:** The aesthetic goal is often a deeper, more dramatic, and visually exciting line. To achieve this, the Balanchine style allows the hips to press forward as the upper body bends backward. This \"releases\" the hips, changing the fulcrum of the bend and allowing for a much greater range of motion and a deeper arch. This is a fundamental departure from the Vaganova principle of a stable, square pelvis.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices based on the analysis.**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in arm placement and hand shape (port de bras) between the two methods (Balanchine sometimes uses more open arms or a \"broken\" wrist), this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most critical and defining difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and square, not pushing them forward. Balanchine specifically teaches dancers to press the hips forward to achieve a deeper backbend. This is a core technical distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is famously fast, a cambré can be performed slowly or quickly in either style, especially in a training context. Speed is a choreographic or musical choice, not a fundamental technical difference in how the movement is executed.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the bend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. The Balanchine cambré is typically deeper *because* the hips are allowed to push forward. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the more fundamental point of difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine. While the final position might look more extreme in Balanchine due to the deeper bend, the principle of how the head moves in relation to the torso is similar. It is not the primary point of distinction.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe most significant, foundational, and technically distinct difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the action and placement of the hips. The Vaganova method emphasizes stability by keeping the hips square, while the Balanchine style utilizes a forward press of the hips to achieve a more dynamic and extreme line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
