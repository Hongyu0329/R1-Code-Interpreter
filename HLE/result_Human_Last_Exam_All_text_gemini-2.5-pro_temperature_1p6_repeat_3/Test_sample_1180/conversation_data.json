    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and define the objects**\n\n*   **The Curve:** The curve $C$ is defined by the affine equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n*   **The Base Field:** We are working over the field of 2-adic numbers, $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **The Valuation:** The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$. We use $\\pi=2$ as the uniformizer.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the \"thickness\" of the unique double point in the stable reduction of the curve $C$. The thickness of a double point in a stable model is an integer $n \\ge 1$ such that the completed local ring at that point is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2[[X,Y]]/(XY - 2^n)$.\n\n**2. Prepare the equation for analysis**\n\nThe theory of reduction for hyperelliptic curves works best when the equation is in a specific form. We can rewrite the equation of the curve as:\n$z^2 = 1 + 2(x^5 + 2x^3)$\nThis is of the form $z^2 = h(x)^2 + \\pi g(x)$, where:\n*   $h(x) = 1$\n*   $\\pi = 2$\n*   $g(x) = x^5 + x^3$\n\n**3. Analyze the reduction of the components**\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the properties of $h(x)$ and $g(x)$ over the residue field $k = \\mathbb{F}_2$.\n1.  Reduce $h(x)$ modulo 2: $\\bar{h}(x) = 1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x]$.\n2.  Reduce $g(x)$ modulo 2: $\\bar{g}(x) = x^5 + x^3 = x^3(x^2+1) = x^3(x+1)^2 \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x]$.\n\nThe special fiber of the stable model consists of components related to $\\bar{h}(x)$ and the roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$.\n\n**4. Identify the roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$ and their properties**\n\nThe roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$ in the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ are:\n*   $r_1 = 0$, with multiplicity $m_1 = 3$.\n*   $r_2 = 1$, with multiplicity $m_2 = 2$.\n\n**5. Locate the double point in the stable reduction**\n\nThe theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (due to Saito, Liu, and others) states that the singularities of the stable fiber are determined by the multiplicities of the roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$.\n*   A root of odd multiplicity (like $r_1=0$ with $m_1=3$) leads to a more complex structure, where different components of the special fiber are identified. It does not typically form a simple double point.\n*   A root of even multiplicity (like $r_2=1$ with $m_2=2$) leads to an ordinary double point (a node) where a new component attaches to the main component.\n\nSince the question asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, we focus on the situation arising from the root $r_2=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the thickness of the double point**\n\nThe thickness of the double point associated with a root $r$ of even multiplicity is given by the valuation of $g(x)$ evaluated at a lift of $r$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nFor the root $r_2=1$, we lift it to $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nWe need to calculate $v(g(1))$.\n\n1.  Evaluate $g(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $g(1) = 1^5 + 1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n2.  Calculate the valuation:\n    $v(g(1)) = v(2) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the double point associated with the root $r_2=1$ is 1.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The curve must be put into the standard form $y^2 = h(x)^2 + \\pi^n u(x)$ to apply the standard results. Our equation $z^2 = 1^2 + 2(x^5+x^3)$ perfectly matches this form with $n=1$.\n*   One must correctly identify which features of the equation correspond to which geometric features of the stable reduction. In this case, the even multiplicity of the root $\\bar{g}(x)=0$ at $x=1$ is the key to locating the double point.\n*   The term \"thickness\" has a precise definition in the context of arithmetic geometry, corresponding to the power of the uniformizer in the local equation of the singularity. The calculation $v(g(1))$ is the standard method to find this value in this context.\n*   The other root at $x=0$ has an odd multiplicity. This leads to a different type of reduction at that point, which does not form a double point. This justifies why the question refers to \"the\" double point, as there is only one.\n\nFinal Answer step-by-step:\n1. The curve is $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n2. Rewrite as $z^2 = 1^2 + 2(x^5 + x^3)$. This is in the form $z^2 = h(x)^2 + \\pi g(x)$ with $h(x)=1$, $\\pi=2$, and $g(x) = x^5+x^3$.\n3. The reduced polynomial $\\bar{g}(x)$ is $x^3(x+1)^2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2[x]$.\n4. The roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$ are $0$ (multiplicity 3) and $1$ (multiplicity 2).\n5. A double point in the stable reduction arises from the root with even multiplicity, which is $x=1$.\n6. The thickness of this double point is $v(g(1))$.\n7. $g(1) = 1^5 + 1^3 = 2$.\n8. The thickness is $v(2) = 1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
