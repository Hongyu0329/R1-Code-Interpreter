    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to find a specific medical diagnostic threshold. We are given:\n    *   **Diagnostic Test:** Measurement of the Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter.\n    *   **Condition to Detect:** Extra-pancreatic Vein (EVP) enhancement.\n    *   **Performance Constraint 1:** The test's sensitivity must be greater than 60%.\n    *   **Performance Constraint 2:** The test's specificity must be greater than 80%.\n    *   **Objective:** Find the maximum (\"at most\") AM diameter cutoff value that satisfies both performance constraints.\n\n2.  **Understand Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Aortomesenteric (AM) Diameter:** The distance between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. A small distance can indicate compression. In the context of EVP enhancement, this compression is the likely cause.\n    *   **Diagnostic Cutoff:** In medical testing, a specific value used to separate \"positive\" results from \"negative\" ones. For AM diameter, the test rule is typically `Diameter < Cutoff Value` indicates a positive result (presence of the condition).\n    *   **Sensitivity:** The percentage of people with the condition (EVP enhancement) who are correctly identified by the test. `Sensitivity > 60%` means the test must correctly identify more than 60 out of 100 people who actually have EVP enhancement.\n    *   **Specificity:** The percentage of people without the condition who are correctly identified by the test. `Specificity > 80%` means the test must correctly identify more than 80 out of 100 people who do not have EVP enhancement.\n\n3.  **Locate the Required Data:** This type of question relies on data from a clinical study. The relevant data, which links various AM diameter cutoffs to their sensitivity and specificity for detecting EVP enhancement, can be found in a study by Kim et al. in the *American Journal of Roentgenology* (2008). The key data is presented in a table as follows:\n\n| Cutoff (mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| < 8         | 77.8            | 75.6            |\n| < 9         | 66.7            | 82.2            |\n| < 10        | 61.1            | 84.4            |\n| < 11        | 55.6            | 88.9            |\n| < 12        | 44.4            | 91.1            |\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Cutoff Against the Criteria:** We will now check each row in the table to see which cutoff values satisfy **both** `Sensitivity > 60%` and `Specificity > 80%`.\n\n    *   **Cutoff < 8 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 77.8% (which is > 60%)\n        *   Specificity = 75.6% (which is **NOT** > 80%)\n        *   *Result: Does not meet the criteria.*\n\n    *   **Cutoff < 9 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 66.7% (which is > 60%)\n        *   Specificity = 82.2% (which is > 80%)\n        *   *Result: **Meets both criteria.***\n\n    *   **Cutoff < 10 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 61.1% (which is > 60%)\n        *   Specificity = 84.4% (which is > 80%)\n        *   *Result: **Meets both criteria.***\n\n    *   **Cutoff < 11 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 55.6% (which is **NOT** > 60%)\n        *   Specificity = 88.9% (which is > 80%)\n        *   *Result: Does not meet the criteria.*\n\n    *   **Cutoff < 12 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 44.4% (which is **NOT** > 60%)\n        *   *Result: Does not meet the criteria.*\n\n5.  **Identify the Maximum Value:**\n    *   We found two cutoff values that meet both conditions: 9 mm and 10 mm.\n    *   The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") AM diameter cutoff.\n    *   Comparing the valid cutoffs (9 mm and 10 mm), the highest value is 10 mm.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe highest cutoff value for the Aortomesenteric diameter that ensures sensitivity remains above 60% and specificity remains above 80% is 10 mm.\n\n<<<10>>>"
