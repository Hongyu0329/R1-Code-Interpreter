    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The request is to identify two specific people who satisfy three conditions:\n    *   They are Nobel Prize winners (laureates).\n    *   They appeared in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was part of a campaign in the year 2000 with the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a real, high-profile corporate branding effort by Enron in late 2000. Its goal was to position Enron not just as an energy company, but as a revolutionary innovator of ideas. The campaign became infamous after Enron's scandalous collapse just over a year later, making the tagline deeply ironic.\n\n3.  **Research the Participants:** The campaign featured several notable figures in short television spots. A search for the participants of Enron's \"Ask Why\" commercials reveals a list of public intellectuals and celebrities. The goal is to cross-reference this list with the list of all Nobel laureates.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Nobel Laureate:** One of the prominent figures featured in the commercials was **F.W. de Klerk**.\n    *   **Verification:** F.W. de Klerk was the former State President of South Africa. He, along with Nelson Mandela, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for their work in peacefully ending the apartheid regime.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since he received his Nobel Prize in 1993, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial aired in 2000. He fits the criteria perfectly.\n\n5.  **Identify the Second Nobel Laureate:** Another well-known individual in the \"Ask Why\" series was the economist **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   **Verification:** Paul Krugman is a highly respected economist and columnist. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Krugman appeared in the 2000 commercial, and he is a Nobel laureate. Therefore, he also fits the criteria of the question.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** This is the most important nuance. While F.W. de Klerk was already a laureate in 2000, Paul Krugman was not. He was a famous economist at the time, but he received his Nobel Prize eight years *after* appearing in the commercial. The question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates *were featured*,\" which correctly identifies them by their current/eventual status as Nobel winners, regardless of when they won the prize relative to the commercial's air date.\n*   **The Irony of the Campaign:** The campaign's \"infamous\" nature stems from Enron's spectacular collapse due to massive, systemic accounting fraud in 2001. The \"Ask Why\" tagline became a joke, as investigators and the public were indeed forced to ask why the company's finances were a complete fabrication. The association with respected figures like de Klerk and Krugman was a key part of Enron's deceptive public relations strategy.\n*   **Distinct Fields:** The two laureates represent very different fieldsâ€”Peace (de Klerk) and Economic Sciences (Krugman). This reflects the campaign's intent to portray Enron as a company whose influence and ideas were broad and transformative.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals are F.W. de Klerk, who was a Nobel Peace Prize laureate at the time, and Paul Krugman, who would later become a Nobel laureate in Economic Sciences.\n\n<<<F.W. de Klerk and Paul Krugman>>>"
