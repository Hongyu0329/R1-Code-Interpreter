    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the starting leg position. \"Leg position\" refers to the configuration of the feet (e.g., fifth position with the right foot in front). This means the step must not be *changé* (changed).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Answer Choice:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** An \"entrechat\" is a jump with beats. The number indicates the movements. An *entrechat six* involves three changes of the feet in the air. For instance, if you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** A closed position like fifth.\n    *   **Execution:** \"Échappé\" is a jump from a closed to an open position and back to closed. \"Battu\" means it has a beat. Crucially, \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name itself indicates that the feet change position. If you start with the right foot in front, you will end with the left foot in front.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble\". A dancer brushes one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air, landing on both feet simultaneously. While there are variations of assemblé that change feet (like *assemblé dessus* or *dessous*), a basic *petit assemblé* to the side does not. For example, a dancer can start in fifth position with the right foot front, brush the left (back) foot to the side, jump, and assemble the legs in the air to land back in fifth position with the right foot still in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Unlike the other options, the fundamental step \"assemblé\" has a common and simple form that finishes in the same position it started.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide\". It is a traveling step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind\". To perform a *glissade derrière*, the dancer glides the front foot to the side and closes the other foot behind it. So, if starting with the right foot front, the left foot will close behind the right, resulting in the left foot being in front at the end of the step.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The directional term \"derrière\" specifies an action that causes the feet to change position.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a *pas de chat*, but with a *rond de jambe* (circular movement) of one or both legs. In a standard *gargouillade*, the sequential action of the legs and the landing result in the feet changing position. If you start with the right foot in front, you will typically land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The execution of the step results in a changed final position.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n\nReviewing all the options, *Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, *Glissade derrière*, and *Gargouillade* are all steps that inherently involve a change of feet from the starting to the ending position. *Assemblé* is the only step listed that has a fundamental variation (a non-traveling petit assemblé) where the dancer starts and ends in the exact same leg position.\n\n<<<C>>>"
