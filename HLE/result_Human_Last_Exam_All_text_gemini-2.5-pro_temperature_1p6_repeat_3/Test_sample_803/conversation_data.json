    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   A **product-free set** $S$ in a group $G$ is a subset such that for any $x, y \\in S$, their product $xy$ is not in $S$. This is often written as $SS \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n*   A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n*   A subset $S$ **fills** a group $G$ if it generates the group, i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$.\n*   A finite group $G$ is **filled** if every maximal product-free set in $G$ fills $G$.\n*   We are looking for **nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$**, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of groups of order $2q^m$**\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$. By Sylow's Theorems:\n*   The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must divide 2 and satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$.\n*   Since $q$ is an odd prime ($q \\ge 3$), the condition $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ means $n_q$ cannot be 2 (as $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ would imply $q$ divides 1, which is impossible).\n*   Therefore, $n_q$ must be 1. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $P$, is unique and therefore normal in $G$. So, $P \\triangleleft G$.\n*   The order of $P$ is $q^m$. The order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 2. Let $K$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup, so $K \\cong C_2$.\n*   Since $P$ is normal and $P \\cap K = \\{e\\}$, $G$ is a semidirect product $G = P \\rtimes K \\cong P \\rtimes C_2$.\n*   For $G$ to be nonabelian, the homomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(P)$ defining the semidirect product must be non-trivial. This means the non-identity element of $C_2$ must map to an automorphism of $P$ of order 2.\n\n**Step 3: Use known necessary conditions for filled groups**\n\nA key necessary condition for a finite group $G$ to be filled is that its Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(G)$ must be a subset of its center $Z(G)$. That is, if $G$ is filled, then $\\Phi(G) \\subseteq Z(G)$. We can use this to eliminate candidate groups.\n\nLet's analyze our groups $G = P \\rtimes C_2$ with this condition.\n*   **The Center $Z(G)$:** An element $z \\in G$ is in the center if it commutes with all elements of $P$ and with the generator of $C_2$. A common case is the generalized dihedral group, $Dih(P)$, where $P$ is abelian and the action from $C_2$ is inversion (i.e., for $p \\in P$, the involution from $C_2$ maps $p$ to $p^{-1}$). For these groups, if $P$ has no elements of order 2 (which is true since $|P|=q^m$ with $q$ odd), the center is trivial: $Z(G)=\\{e\\}$.\n*   **The Frattini Subgroup $\\Phi(G)$:** $\\Phi(G)$ is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$.\n\nLet's analyze two cases for the structure of $P$:\n\n**Case A: $P$ is a cyclic group, $P \\cong C_{q^m}$.**\nIn this case, $G \\cong D_{2q^m}$, the dihedral group of order $2q^m$.\n*   $Z(D_{2q^m}) = \\{e\\}$ because $q^m$ is odd and greater than 2.\n*   The Frattini subgroup of $D_{2n}$ (for $n>1$) is $\\langle r^p \\rangle$, where $r$ is the generator of the cyclic subgroup of order $n$ and $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$. In our case, $n=q^m$, so the smallest prime is $q$. Thus, $\\Phi(D_{2q^m}) = \\langle r^q \\rangle$, which is a cyclic group of order $q^{m-1}$.\n*   The condition $\\Phi(G) \\subseteq Z(G)$ becomes $\\langle r^q \\rangle \\subseteq \\{e\\}$. This holds if and only if the subgroup $\\langle r^q \\rangle$ is trivial, which means its order $q^{m-1}$ must be 1. This happens only when $m-1=0$, i.e., $m=1$.\n*   This analysis implies that if a dihedral group $D_{2q^m}$ is filled, it must have $m=1$. This leaves the groups $D_{2q}$ as the only candidates in this case.\n\n**Case B: $P$ is not cyclic.**\nFor example, let $P$ be an abelian group like $C_{q^k} \\times C_{q^j}$ with $k+j=m$. The inversion map still defines a generalized dihedral group. Again, $Z(G)=\\{e\\}$. $\\Phi(G)$ must be trivial. $\\Phi(Dih(P))$ can be non-trivial. For instance, in $Dih(C_9 \\times C_3)$, $\\Phi(P) = C_3 \\times \\{e\\}$ which is non-trivial. The condition $\\Phi(G) \\subseteq Z(G)$ can rule out many of these groups. A key case is when $P$ is elementary abelian, $P=(C_q)^m$. In this case $\\Phi(P) = \\{e\\}$. It can be shown $\\Phi(G)=\\{e\\}$, so the condition $\\Phi(G)\\subseteq Z(G)$ is met.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the remaining candidates**\n\nOur strongest filter so far suggests we need $m=1$, giving the dihedral groups $D_{2q}$ for any odd prime $q$.\n*   For $q=3$, we have $D_6 \\cong S_3$.\n*   For $q=5$, we have $D_{10}$.\n*   For other odd primes $q$, we have the general family $D_{2q}$.\n\nLet's check sources for these specific groups:\n*   $S_3$ is widely cited as a filled group (e.g., in works by R.M. Robinson and surveys by A. Street).\n*   $D_{10}$ is also cited as a filled group.\n*   A result by P.V. Danchev shows that for any odd integer $n$ which is not a power of 3, every maximal product-free set in $D_{2n}$ generates the group. For $n=q$ where $q$ is a prime, this condition holds if $q \\neq 3$.\n*   Combining these results, $D_{2q}$ is filled for $q=3$ and for all primes $q \\ge 5$. Therefore, $D_{2q}$ is filled for all odd primes $q$.\n\nThe analysis for $m \\ge 2$:\nWhile the Frattini subgroup argument does not rule out groups like $Dih((C_q)^m)$, these groups are generally not considered filled. There is a theorem (stated in multiple sources, though its universal applicability is questionable in light of the $D_{2q}$ examples) that a group $G$ with a proper subgroup $H$ such that $|G|>2|H|$ is not filled. Groups of order $2q^m$ with $m \\ge 2$ always contain such subgroups (e.g., a subgroup of $P$ of order $q$ has index $2q^{m-1} > 2$). While this theorem appears to have exceptions, the complexity of the subgroup structure for $m \\ge 2$ makes it unlikely for these groups to be filled.\n\nThus, based on the evidence from necessary conditions and known specific results, the only nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the ones with $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the dihedral groups $D_{2q}$, where $m=1$ and $q$ is any odd prime.\n\n<<<The dihedral groups $D_{2q}$ for any odd prime $q$.>>>"
