    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation:**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order separable differential equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n\n**2. Separate the variables:**\nTo separate the variables, we can divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful Point:** We are dividing by $x^2$. This is valid as long as $x(t) \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$ for all $t$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the equation becomes $(t-1) \\cdot 0^2 = 0$. So $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, so the solution we are looking for is not the zero solution. Thus, dividing by $x^2$ is permissible.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides:**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n- The left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n- The right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nCombining these results and adding the constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n**Careful Point:** Be mindful of the signs.\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution:**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1):**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution and then solve for $x(1)$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow we simplify the right side of the equation.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nTo solve for $x(1)$, we can multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$"
