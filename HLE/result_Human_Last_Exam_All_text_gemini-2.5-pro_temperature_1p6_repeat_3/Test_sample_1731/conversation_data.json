    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory and statistical mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Interpreting the Role of Large Deviation Theorems**\n\nThe question invokes the **Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems**. In the context of statistical mechanics, these theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for its core principles.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem** deals with the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from a true underlying distribution. It justifies why the entropy of a macrostate (a particular distribution of particles over energy levels) can be related to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Minimizing this divergence subject to constraints is equivalent to maximizing entropy.\n*   **Cramer's Theorem** deals with the probability of the sample mean (like the mean energy per particle) deviating from its expected value. The rate function in Cramer's theorem is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function, which is directly related to the free energy in thermodynamics.\n*   **Conclusion:** These theorems establish the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. The equilibrium state of a system, subject to certain constraints (e.g., fixed average energy), is the one that maximizes the statistical entropy. The probability of the system being in any other macroscopic state is exponentially small for a large number of particles. Therefore, to find the equilibrium values, we must find the particle distribution that maximizes entropy.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the System and the Entropy**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume `V`.\n*   **Statistics:** Photons are indistinguishable bosons.\n*   **Constraints:**\n    1.  The system is at a fixed temperature `T`, implying a fixed average total energy `<E>`. The Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint is `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n    2.  The number of photons is not conserved. This is a key feature of a photon gas, and it means there is no constraint on the total number of particles `N`. This is equivalent to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n*   **Bose-Einstein Entropy:** For a set of energy levels `{ε_i}` with `g_i` states (degeneracy) and `n_i` bosons in each level, the number of microstates is `Ω = Π_i (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! (g_i - 1)!)`. The entropy is `S = k_B log(Ω)`. Using Stirling's approximation, this becomes:\n    `S/k_B = Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) log(n_i + g_i) - n_i log(n_i) - g_i log(g_i) ]`\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution via Maximum Entropy**\n\nWe maximize `S` subject to the constraint `Σ_i n_i ε_i = <E>` (and no constraint on `Σ_i n_i`). We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing `F = S/k_B - β (Σ_i n_i ε_i)`.\n`∂F/∂n_j = log(n_j + g_j) - log(n_j) - β ε_j = 0`\n`log((n_j + g_j)/n_j) = β ε_j`\n`1 + g_j/n_j = exp(β ε_j)`\nThis gives the equilibrium average occupation number `<n_j>` for the energy level `ε_j`:\n`<n_j> = g_j / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)`\nThis is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential.\n\n**Step 4: Moving from Discrete Sums to Integrals**\n\nFor a macroscopic volume `V`, the energy levels of photons are dense enough to be treated as a continuum. We replace the sum `Σ_i g_i (...)` with an integral `∫ dε g(ε) (...)`, where `g(ε)` is the density of states.\n\n*   **Careful Point (Density of States):** For photons (massless spin-1 bosons) in a 3D box of volume `V`, there are two polarization states. The density of states is given by:\n    `g(ε) = (V * ε^2) / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy `<E>`**\n\nThe mean energy is the sum of the energies of all photons, weighted by their average occupation number.\n`<E> = ∫_0^∞ ε <n(ε)> dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * [g(ε) / (exp(β ε) - 1)] dε`\nSubstituting `g(ε)`:\n`<E> = ∫_0^∞ ε * [(V * ε^2) / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)] / (exp(β ε) - 1) dε`\n`<E> = (V / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)) ∫_0^∞ ε^3 / (exp(β ε) - 1) dε`\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `x = β ε`:\n`<E> = (V / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3 * β^4)) ∫_0^∞ x^3 / (exp(x) - 1) dx`\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann-Zeta function: `∫ x^3 / (e^x-1) dx = π^4 / 15`.\nSubstituting this result and `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n`<E> = (V / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (π^4 / 15)`\n`<E> = (V * π^2 * k_B^4 / (15 * ħ^3 * c^3)) * T^4`\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann Law for energy in blackbody radiation.\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy `S`**\n\nThe entropy can be calculated using the thermodynamic relation `S = (<E> - F) / T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. For a system with `μ=0`, `F = -k_B T log(Z)`, where `Z` is the grand partition function.\n`log(Z) = -Σ_i g_i log(1 - exp(-β ε_i)) = -∫_0^∞ g(ε) log(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε`\n`log(Z) = - (V / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3)) ∫_0^∞ ε^2 * log(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε`\nUsing the substitution `x = β ε` and integration by parts, the integral evaluates to `∫ x^2 log(1 - e^-x) dx = -π^4 / 45`.\n`log(Z) = - (V / (π^2 * ħ^3 * c^3 * β^3)) * (-π^4 / 45) = (V * π^2 / (45 * ħ^3 * c^3 * β^3))`\nSo, the free energy is `F = -k_B T * log(Z) = - (V * π^2 * k_B^4 / (45 * ħ^3 * c^3)) * T^4`.\nWe note that `<E> = -3F`, a standard result for an ultra-relativistic gas.\nNow we find the entropy:\n`S = (<E> - F) / T = (<E> - (-<E>/3)) / T = (4/3) * <E> / T`\n`S = (4/3T) * [(V * π^2 * k_B^4 / (15 * ħ^3 * c^3)) * T^4]`\n`S = (4 * V * π^2 * k_B^4 / (45 * ħ^3 * c^3)) * T^3`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas at temperature T in a volume V are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$E = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n>>>"
