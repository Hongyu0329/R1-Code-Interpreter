    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from fractal geometry (Hausdorff dimension) and additive combinatorics (Sidon sets).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Defining the Terms**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set `S` is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique, up to the order of the summands. Formally, for any `a, b, c, d` in `S`, if `a + b = c + d`, then the multiset `{a, b}` must be equal to the multiset `{c, d}`. This means either (`a=c` and `b=d`) or (`a=d` and `b=c`).\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, `dim_H(S)`, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `S`. It generalizes the notion of dimension to sets that are not smooth manifolds. For example, the Hausdorff dimension of a point is 0, a line segment is 1, a square is 2, but the middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of `log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.631`.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the maximum possible value of the Hausdorff dimension for a set `S` contained in the interval `[0, 1]` that has the Sidon property. This is the value `sup{dim_H(S) | S ⊂ [0,1] is a Sidon set}`.\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nThere is a well-established theorem in geometric measure theory that provides an upper bound on the dimension of Sidon sets.\n\n*   **Theorem (Salem, 1951):** If `S ⊂ R` is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension `dim_H(S)` cannot exceed `1/2`.\n\n*   **Proof Sketch:** The proof is quite technical and relies on Fourier analysis. Here is a high-level outline:\n    1.  Assume, for contradiction, that `dim_H(S) = d > 1/2`.\n    2.  By Frostman's Lemma, because `d > 1/2`, there must exist a probability measure `μ` supported on `S` and a value `s` with `1/2 < s < d` such that the `s`-energy integral `I_s(μ) = ∫∫ |x-y|^(-s) dμ(x)dμ(y)` is finite.\n    3.  The finiteness of the energy integral can be related to the decay of the Fourier transform `hat(μ)(t) = ∫ e^(-2πitx) dμ(x)`. Specifically, `I_s(μ) < ∞` is equivalent to `∫ |t|^(s-1) |hat(μ)(t)|^2 dt < ∞`.\n    4.  On the other hand, the Sidon property of the set `S` imposes strong constraints on any measure `μ` it supports. For any continuous probability measure `μ` on a Sidon set `S`, one can show that `∫ |hat(μ)(t)|^4 dt = 2`.\n    5.  A delicate analysis shows that the condition `∫ |t|^(s-1) |hat(μ)(t)|^2 dt < ∞` for `s > 1/2` forces the integral `∫ |hat(μ)(t)|^4 dt` to be infinite. This contradicts the result from the Sidon property.\n    6.  Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, and we must have `dim_H(S) ≤ 1/2`.\n\n**3. Showing the Upper Bound is Tight (Construction of a Lower Bound)**\n\nTo show that `1/2` is the maximum possible dimension, we need to demonstrate that we can construct Sidon sets in `[0,1]` with dimensions arbitrarily close to `1/2`. We do this by constructing special types of Cantor sets.\n\n*   **The Construction:**\n    1.  Start with a finite set of non-negative integers `D` which is itself a Sidon set (e.g., `D = {0, 1, 4, 6}`). Let `m = |D|` be the number of digits and `d_max = max(D)`.\n    2.  Choose an integer base `b` that is large enough to prevent \"carries\" when adding numbers whose digits are from `D`. The condition `b > 2 * d_max` is sufficient.\n    3.  Construct the Cantor-like set `S_{D,b}` as the set of all numbers in `[0,1]` whose base-`b` expansion only contains digits from `D`. That is, `S_{D,b} = { Σ_{k=1}^∞ c_k b^(-k) | c_k ∈ D }`.\n    4.  The Hausdorff dimension of this set is given by `dim_H(S_{D,b}) = log(m) / log(b)`.\n    5.  The no-carry condition (`b > 2 * d_max`) and the fact that `D` is an integer Sidon set together ensure that the resulting set `S_{D,b}` is a Sidon set in `[0,1]`.\n\n*   **Optimizing the Dimension:**\n    1.  To maximize the dimension `log(m) / log(b)`, we need to choose our digit set `D` cleverly. We need `m = |D|` to be as large as possible for a given `d_max = max(D)`.\n    2.  The theory of integer Sidon sets tells us about the maximum density of such sets. A Sidon set `D` with `m` elements will have `d_max ≥ C(m-1)^2` for some constant `C`. Conversely, there are constructions (e.g., by Bose and Chowla) of Sidon sets `D_m` of size `m` where `d_max` is on the order of `m^2`.\n    3.  Let's take such a dense Sidon set `D_m` with `|D_m| = m` and `max(D_m) ≈ c⋅m^2` for some constant `c`. We must choose our base `b > 2 * max(D_m)`, so let's pick `b ≈ 2c⋅m^2`.\n    4.  The dimension of the resulting Sidon set `S_m` is `dim_H(S_m) = log(m) / log(b) ≈ log(m) / log(2c⋅m^2) = log(m) / (log(2c) + 2log(m))`.\n    5.  As we let the size `m` of our digit set go to infinity, this dimension approaches a limit:\n        `lim_{m→∞} [log(m) / (2log(m) + log(2c))] = 1/2`.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Construction:** We have shown that for any `ε > 0`, we can find a Sidon set `S` in `[0,1]` whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than `1/2 - ε`. This means the supremum of the dimensions is at least `1/2`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We have shown that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set `S ⊂ [0,1]` must satisfy `dim_H(S) ≤ 1/2`.\n*   We have also shown that we can construct Sidon sets `S ⊂ [0,1]` with dimensions arbitrarily close to `1/2`.\n\nCombining these two facts, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is exactly `1/2`.\n\n>>>1/2"
