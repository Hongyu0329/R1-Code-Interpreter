    "An elegant way to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is by analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. The stable reduction is a stable curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, and its double points correspond to intersections between the components of this curve.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nLet $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nThe reduction of the curve is considered over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of f(x).**\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ has a root at $x=0$, since the constant term is zero. So, one root is $r_1=0$.\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nLet $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The other four roots of $f(x)$ are the roots of $g(x)=0$.\nWe use Newton's polygon method for $g(x)$ with respect to the prime $p=2$ to find the valuations of its roots. The coefficients of $g(x)$ are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$. Their 2-adic valuations are $v_2(a_4)=3, v_2(a_3)=2, v_2(a_2)=2, v_2(a_1)=0, v_2(a_0)=3$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$:\n$P_0=(0,3)$, $P_1=(1,0)$, $P_2=(2,2)$, $P_3=(3,2)$, $P_4=(4,3)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  The segment from $P_0(0,3)$ to $P_1(1,0)$.\n    -   The horizontal length is $1-0=1$.\n    -   The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0)=-3$.\n    -   This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_2$, with valuation $v_2(r_2) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-3)=3$.\n2.  The segment from $P_1(1,0)$ to $P_4(4,3)$. (The points $P_2$ and $P_3$ lie on or above this segment).\n    -   The horizontal length is $4-1=3$.\n    -   The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1)=1$.\n    -   This corresponds to three roots, say $r_3, r_4, r_5$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(1)=-1$.\n\nSo, the 2-adic valuations of the five roots of $f(x)$ are:\n$v_2(r_1) = v_2(0) = \\infty$\n$v_2(r_2) = 3$\n$v_2(r_3) = v_2(r_4) = v_2(r_5) = -1$\n\n**Step 3: Cluster the branch points.**\nA hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ is determined by its $2g+2$ branch points. For $y^2=f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=5$, the branch points are the five roots of $f(x)$ plus the point at infinity, $r_6=\\infty$.\nThe branch points are $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\nWe group these branch points into clusters based on their 2-adic valuations and the valuations of their differences. Two roots are considered \"close\" if the valuation of their difference is large and \"far\" if it is small.\n\n-   $v_2(r_1-r_2)=v_2(0-r_2)=v_2(r_2)=3$.\n-   $v_2(r_1-r_k)=v_2(0-r_k)=v_2(r_k)=-1$ for $k \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$.\n-   $v_2(r_2-r_k)=\\min(v_2(r_2), v_2(r_k))=\\min(3,-1)=-1$ for $k \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$.\n-   For $j, k \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$ with $j\\neq k$, it can be shown that $v_2(r_j-r_k)=-1$.\n\nThe largest finite valuation of a difference is $v_2(r_1-r_2)=3$. This suggests that $r_1$ and $r_2$ are much \"closer\" to each other than to any other roots. This justifies forming a cluster $I = \\{r_1, r_2\\}$.\nAll other pairs of finite roots have a difference valuation of -1. This suggests they are \"far\" from each other and from the first cluster. So, the remaining finite roots $\\{r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$ form another group. We group them with the point at infinity to form the second cluster $J = \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\n\nSo we have a partition of the 6 branch points into two sets: $I=\\{r_1, r_2\\}$ and $J=\\{r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\nAccording to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, when the set of branch points partitions into two sets $I$ and $J$, the stable reduction consists of two components, $C_I$ and $C_J$.\n-   The genus of component $C_I$ is $g_I = \\lfloor(\\#I-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor((2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$. So, $C_I$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n-   The genus of component $C_J$ is $g_J = \\lfloor(\\#J-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$. So, $C_J$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe number of intersection points between these two components $C_I$ and $C_J$ is given by the formula $\\gcd(\\#I, \\#J)$.\nNumber of intersections = $\\gcd(2, 4) = 2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve consists of a rational curve component and an elliptic curve component, intersecting at two points. These two intersection points are ordinary double points (nodes). A curve with these properties is a stable curve of arithmetic genus $g = g_I + g_J + \\delta -1 = 0+1+2-1 = 2$, which matches the genus of our original curve.\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is the number of these intersection points.\nTherefore, the curve has 2 double points in its stable reduction."
