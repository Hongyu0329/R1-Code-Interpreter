    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Group and Involutions**\n\n*   **The Group:** PSU(n, q) is the Projective Special Unitary group. It is defined as the quotient group PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)), where SU(n, q) is the Special Unitary group and Z denotes its center.\n*   **Our specific group:** We are interested in PSU(4, 997), so n = 4 and q = 997. The prime p is 997, so we are working over the finite field GF(997^2).\n*   **Involutions:** An involution in a group G is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` (the identity element) and `g ≠ 1`.\n\n**2. Relating Involutions in PSU(4, 997) to Elements in SU(4, 997)**\n\nAn element `g` in PSU(4, q) is a coset of the center, written as `g = [A] = A * Z(SU(4, q))`, where `A` is a matrix in SU(4, q).\n\n*   The identity element in PSU(4, q) is `[I] = Z(SU(4, q))`.\n*   An element `g = [A]` is an involution if `[A]^2 = [I]` and `[A] ≠ [I]`.\n    *   `[A]^2 = [A^2]`. So, `[A^2] = [I]` means `A^2` must be in the center, `Z(SU(4, q))`.\n    *   `[A] ≠ [I]` means `A` must not be in the center, `Z(SU(4, q))`.\n\n**3. Determining the Center of SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe center of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c` is in GF(q^2), `c^n = 1`, and `c` belongs to the unitary group, which implies `c * c^H = 1`, or `c * c^q = c^(q+1) = 1`.\nSo, `c` must satisfy `c^n = 1` and `c^(q+1) = 1`. This means the order of `c` must divide `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor SU(4, 997):\n*   n = 4\n*   q = 997\n*   d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2.\n*   So, `c` must satisfy `c^2 = 1`. In any field with characteristic not equal to 2 (997 is not 2), the solutions are `c = 1` and `c = -1`.\n*   Therefore, the center is Z(SU(4, 997)) = {I, -I}, which has order 2.\n\n**4. Finding Preimages of Involutions in SU(4, 997)**\n\nWe need to count the number of matrices `A` in SU(4, 997) such that:\n1.  `A^2 = I` or `A^2 = -I`\n2.  `A ≠ I` and `A ≠ -I`\n\nLet's analyze the two cases for `A^2`:\n\n*   **Case 1: `A^2 = -I`**\n    An element `A` in the unitary group U(n,q) is diagonalizable over GF(q^2). If `λ` is an eigenvalue of `A`, it must satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n    If `A^2 = -I`, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. Let's check if such eigenvalues can exist for a matrix in U(4, 997).\n    *   `q = 997`. We check `q mod 4`. `997 = 4 × 249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.\n    *   This means -1 is a quadratic residue in the base field GF(q). Let `j ∈ GF(q)` be such that `j^2 = -1`.\n    *   Since `j` is in the base field GF(q), its conjugate is itself: `j^q = j`.\n    *   Now, let's check the unitary condition for the eigenvalue `j`: `j^(q+1) = j^q * j = j * j = j^2 = -1`.\n    *   For an eigenvalue of a unitary matrix, we must have `λ^(q+1) = 1`. Here we get -1. Since `1 ≠ -1` (as the characteristic is 997), there can be no such eigenvalue.\n    *   Therefore, there are no matrices `A` in U(4, 997) (and thus no matrices in SU(4, 997)) such that `A^2 = -I`. The number of solutions for this case is 0.\n\n*   **Case 2: `A^2 = I` and `A ≠ ±I`**\n    These are the involutions in SU(4, 997) other than `-I` (which is an involution since `n=4` is even).\n    An element `A` with `A^2=I` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. For `A` to be in SU(4, 997), `det(A) = 1`. If `k` is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `-1`, then `det(A) = (-1)^k = 1`. This requires `k` to be even.\n    The possible values for `k` (the dimension of the (-1)-eigenspace) are 0, 2, 4.\n    *   `k=0`: The only eigenvalue is `+1`. `A = I`.\n    *   `k=4`: The only eigenvalue is `-1`. `A = -I`.\n    *   `k=2`: The eigenvalues are `+1, +1, -1, -1`. These are the matrices we need to count.\n    The number of such involutions is equal to the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in the 4-dimensional unitary space, as each such subspace can be the (-1)-eigenspace of a unique involution.\n    This number is given by the size of the conjugacy class of these involutions. The formula for the size of this class is: `|SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(t)|`, where `t` is a representative involution of this type. The centralizer size is known from the theory of finite classical groups.\n    The number of such involutions is given by the formula: `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**5. Counting the Involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\n\n*   The set of preimages in SU(4, 997) of involutions in PSU(4, 997) consists only of the matrices from Case 2, i.e., involutions of type `k=2`. Let's call this set `S`.\n*   The number of these preimages is `|S| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n*   The canonical map `φ: SU(4, q) → PSU(4, q)` sends a matrix `A` to the coset `[A]`. Each involution `[A]` in PSU(4, q) has `|Z| = 2` preimages: `A` and `-A`.\n*   If `A` is an involution of type `k=2`, then `(-A)^2 = A^2 = I`, and `det(-A) = (-1)^4 det(A) = det(A) = 1`. The eigenspaces are swapped, so `-A` is also an involution of type `k=2`. Since `A ≠ -A`, the set `S` is partitioned into pairs `{A, -A}`.\n*   The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the number of such pairs, which is `|S| / 2`.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe number of involutions is `(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`.\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\n\nNumber of involutions = `(997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2`.\n\nThis expression is the final answer. It is a specific, very large integer.\n\nFinal expression for the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is:\n` (997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2 `\n\n<<< (997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2 >>>"
