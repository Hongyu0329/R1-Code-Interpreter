    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Historical Context**\nThe question concerns a military defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng in Vietnam. This points to the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), a Vietnamese rebellion led by Lê Lợi against the rule of the Chinese Ming Dynasty. Mu Sheng was one of the key Ming generals tasked with suppressing this revolt. His earlier campaign in 1406-1407 to conquer the Hồ Dynasty was successful, so his major defeat must have occurred during the later Lam Sơn Uprising.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the Specific Campaign**\nBy 1427, the Lam Sơn rebels had gained significant ground, besieging the main Ming force under Wang Tong in Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). In response, the Ming Emperor sent two massive relief armies.\n1.  An army from Guangxi, led by General Liu Sheng.\n2.  An army from Yunnan, led by General Mu Sheng.\nThe plan was for these two armies to execute a pincer movement to crush the rebellion and relieve the siege of Dongguan.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Mu Sheng's Advance and First Major Engagement**\nMu Sheng led his army from Yunnan province in China, advancing into Vietnam along the Red River valley. Meanwhile, Liu Sheng's army entered from the northeast and was drawn into a trap by the Vietnamese forces. However, we must focus on Mu Sheng's own actions. Before Mu Sheng could link up with Liu Sheng, his advancing army was intercepted by a Vietnamese force commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Battle and its Outcome**\nThe Vietnamese forces set up a defensive position at the Khả Lưu Pass (Ải Khả Lưu), also referred to as the Lãnh Câu valley. A fierce battle ensued. Mu Sheng’s forces tried to break through the Vietnamese line but were decisively repulsed and defeated. They were unable to advance further.\n\n**Careful Point:** This was the first significant battle and clear defeat for Mu Sheng's column during this crucial 1427 campaign. It effectively halted his army's main objective. While he was stalled here, he received news that Liu Sheng's entire army had been annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang. This double blow—his own defeat at Khả Lưu and the complete destruction of the other relief army—shattered his army's morale, prompting a panicked and costly retreat back to Yunnan.\n\n**Step 5: Locate the Battle Site on a Modern Map**\nThe historical site of the Khả Lưu Pass (or Lãnh Câu) where this battle took place is located within the territory of modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in the northern highlands of Vietnam.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the historical accounts of the Lam Sơn Uprising, General Mu Sheng's army was defeated at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass, which stopped his advance. This was his first major defeat during the critical 1427 campaign. This battle site is located in the present-day Vietnamese province of Tuyên Quang.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
