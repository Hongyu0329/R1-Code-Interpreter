    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C\n\nLet $C$ be a compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$.\nLet $X = C^{(15)}$ be its 15th symmetric power. $X$ is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on $C$. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\nThe Neron-Severi group of a variety $V$, denoted $NS(V)$, is the group of divisors on $V$ modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank $\\rho(V)$ is called the Picard number.\n\nThere is a fundamental connection between the symmetric powers of a curve and its Jacobian variety. Let $J(C)$ be the Jacobian of $C$, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The Abel-Jacobi map gives a morphism $u_{15}: C^{(15)} \\to J(C)$.\n\nA key theorem in the theory of algebraic curves, due to Mattuck and Mumford, states that the pullback map induced by the Abel-Jacobi map, $u_d^*: \\text{Pic}(J(C)) \\to \\text{Pic}(C^{(d)})$, is an isomorphism for any $d \\ge 1$. Here $\\text{Pic}(V)$ denotes the Picard group of a variety $V$.\n\nThe Neron-Severi group is defined as the quotient $NS(V) = \\text{Pic}(V) / \\text{Pic}^0(V)$, where $\\text{Pic}^0(V)$ is the subgroup of divisor classes algebraically equivalent to zero. The Abel-Jacobi map $u_{15}$ induces an isomorphism $u_{15}^*: \\text{Pic}^0(J(C)) \\to \\text{Pic}^0(C^{(15)})$.\n\nFrom the isomorphism of Picard groups, it follows that the Neron-Severi groups are also isomorphic:\n$NS(X) = NS(C^{(15)}) \\cong NS(J(C))$.\nTherefore, their ranks are equal:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C))$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of a principally polarized abelian variety (like a Jacobian) is always at least 1. This is because the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor) is always an algebraic class which is not algebraically trivial. So, $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n\nFor a *very general* curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, $\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. These are the trivial endomorphisms corresponding to multiplication by an integer.\n\nIn this \"general case\", the only algebraic cycles in $H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})$ are rational multiples of the polarization class. This means that the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor. Therefore, for a very general curve $C$ of genus 3, we have $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nThe set of curves with this property is dense in the moduli space of genus 3 curves. Thus, the minimum possible rank is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ is bounded above by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A)$. We have $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\nFor the Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus 3 curve, $g=3$, so the maximum theoretical rank is $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved if $J(C)$ has complex multiplication (CM) and is of a specific type. Specifically, we need to find a genus 3 curve $C$ such that $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group is large when the Jacobian has extra endomorphisms, i.e., it is not simple. Consider the case where $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves:\n$J(C) \\sim E_1 \\times E_2 \\times E_3$.\n\nThe Picard number of a product of abelian varieties $A_1 \\times A_2$ is given by $\\rho(A_1 \\times A_2) = \\rho(A_1) + \\rho(A_2) + \\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(A_1, A_2^\\vee))$. With the principal polarization, this simplifies to $\\rho(A_1 \\times A_2) = \\rho(A_1) + \\rho(A_2) + \\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(A_1, A_2))$.\nFor a product of three, this generalizes to:\n$\\rho(E_1 \\times E_2 \\times E_3) = \\rho(E_1) + \\rho(E_2) + \\rho(E_3) + \\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_1, E_2)) + \\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_1, E_3)) + \\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_2, E_3))$.\n\nFor any elliptic curve $E$, its Picard number is $\\rho(E) = 1$.\nThe rank of the group of homomorphisms, $\\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_i, E_j))$, depends on whether the curves are isogenous and whether they have CM.\n- If $E_i$ and $E_j$ are not isogenous, $\\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_i, E_j)) = 0$.\n- If $E_i$ and $E_j$ are isogenous but have no CM, $\\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_i, E_j)) = 1$.\n- If $E_i$ and $E_j$ are isogenous and have CM, $\\text{rank}(\\text{Hom}(E_i, E_j)) = 2$.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose $E_1, E_2, E_3$ to be isogenous to each other and to have CM. Let $E_1=E_2=E_3=E$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve with CM. In this case, $\\text{Hom}(E_i, E_j) = \\text{End}(E)$, and $\\text{rank}(\\text{End}(E))=2$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\rho(E \\times E \\times E) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Find a curve C realizing the maximum rank\n\nThe final step is to show that there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ whose Jacobian $J(C)$ is isogenous to $E^3$ for a CM elliptic curve $E$. Such curves exist; they are typically curves with large automorphism groups.\n\nA well-known example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. This is a smooth curve of degree 4, so its genus is $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is known to be isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nAnother example is the **Klein quartic curve**, given by $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$. It also has genus 3 and its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Eisenstein integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2}]$.\n\nSince such curves exist, the maximum possible rank of 9 is achieved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X=C^{(15)}$ is the same as the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of $C$, $\\rho(J(C))$.\n- The smallest possible rank is 1, achieved for a generic curve $C$.\n- The largest possible rank is 9, achieved for special curves $C$ with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat or Klein quartics.\n\nSmallest rank: 1\nLargest rank: 9\n\n<<<1, 9>>>"
