    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** The *first* to develop *specialized terminology*. This points to a novel, systematic conceptual vocabulary, not just a general discussion of miracles.\n3.  **Purpose of Terminology:** To describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This implies a framework for how the regular, observable patterns of the universe could be altered or operate differently.\n4.  **Specific Applications:** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a specific, localized miracle).\n    *   Potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, ongoing change in the state of the created order).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\nSeveral major theologians have discussed God's relationship with the natural world and miracles, but we must check them against all the criteria.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas developed a sophisticated system for classifying miracles based on whether they were beyond nature's power entirely, beyond the power of a specific subject, or just outside nature's usual order. However, this is more of a *classification* of divine actions *upon* a stable natural order. It is less a terminology for how the *laws themselves* might fundamentally change or contain latent possibilities, especially in a systemic way post-Fall.\n*   **The Protestant Reformers (e.g., John Calvin):** Calvin spoke of God's \"ordinary providence\" (the normal workings of nature) and His \"extraordinary\" or \"special\" providence (miracles). This is a crucial distinction, but it largely follows a long tradition and does not constitute the *first* development of a specialized vocabulary explaining the underlying mechanism of such changes.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine is a very strong candidate. Faced with questions about creation, miracles, and divine omnipotence, he developed a unique and detailed framework.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Augustine's Specific Terminology and its Application**\nAugustine’s specialized terminology centers on the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which translates to \"seminal reasons,\" \"causal principles,\" or \"seed-like principles.\"\n\n*   **The Concept:** Augustine proposed that in the initial act of creation, God embedded all the latent potentialities for everything that would ever come into being within the fabric of the world. The regular course of nature is the gradual, orderly unfolding of these principles.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature or a change in its fundamental laws. Instead, it is the activation by God of a *ratio seminalis* that was always present but dormant. The event is contrary to the *usual course of nature* that we observe, but it is not contrary to the deeper potential of nature as God originally constituted it. This provides a way to describe a change in outcome without claiming the fundamental laws were broken or rewritten.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Application to the Fall:** This framework is also uniquely applicable to the idea of natural laws changing after the Fall. The introduction of suffering, toil, and physical death into the human experience can be explained not as God rewriting the laws of physics, but as a consequence of sin altering the conditions of creation. The *rationes seminales* for decay and mortality, which were always latent within the created order (as man was created from \"dust\"), were held in check by a gift of grace. With the Fall, this grace was lost, allowing these previously dormant \"seeds\" of corruption and death to become active and run their course. This represents a systemic change in the operation of nature as it pertains to humanity.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to develop a specialized terminology—the *rationes seminales*—that provides a coherent philosophical and theological mechanism to describe apparent changes in the laws of nature. His framework is robust enough to apply to both specific miracles like the virgin birth and a systemic shift in the world's condition like the one posited to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
