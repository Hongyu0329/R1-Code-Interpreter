    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the character's structure.**\nThe character is 謄. We must first break it down into its constituent parts to identify the radical.\nThe character 謄 has a left-right structure, known as \"hen-tsukuri\" (偏旁).\n*   The left part (hen, 偏) is **言**.\n*   The right part (tsukuri, 旁) is **朕**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (bushu).**\nFor characters with a left-right structure, the radical is typically the component on the left side (the \"hen\"). In this case, the left component is **言**. The character 言 is a standard radical (Kangxi radical number 149) and is used to classify many kanji related to speech, language, or words. Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Japanese name of the radical.**\nThe name of a radical can change depending on its position within a character. The radical 言 has a specific name when it appears on the left side of a character.\n*   The character 言 itself has the on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of \"gon\" or \"gen\".\n*   The term for a left-side radical is \"hen\" (へん).\nWhen combined, the name for the 言 radical on the left side is **ごんべん (Gonben)**. The \"hen\" part becomes voiced (\"ben\") in the compound word.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the name to Hepburn romanization.**\nThe Japanese name for the radical is ごんべん. We now transcribe this into the Hepburn system of romanization.\n*   ご -> Go\n*   ん -> n\n*   べ -> be\n*   ん -> n\nThe resulting Hepburn transcription is **Gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correctly Deconstructing the Kanji:** It is essential to correctly see the structure as left-right (言 + 朕) and not mistake it for a different arrangement or misidentify the components.\n*   **Knowing Positional Names:** One must be aware that radicals have specific names based on their position (e.g., -hen for left, -tsukuri for right, -kanmuri for top). Simply stating the radical's own name (\"gon\" or \"kotoba\" for 言) is not sufficient; the positional name (\"Gonben\") is required for this type of question.\n*   **Accurate Romanization:** Ensure the Hepburn transcription is precise. For \"Gonben,\" this is straightforward, but for other radicals with long vowels (like \"ninben\" for 亻 vs. \"nin\" for 人), accuracy is critical.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
