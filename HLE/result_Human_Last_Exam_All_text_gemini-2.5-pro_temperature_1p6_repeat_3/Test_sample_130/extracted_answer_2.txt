The edges of the image are smoothed, and the shapes they bound are simplified. The edge moves with a velocity proportional to its local curvature, which has the effect of rounding off sharp corners and removing small or thin features. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the image converges to a stable state where regions are separated by very smooth curves (with a radius of curvature everywhere greater than $\delta$) or straight lines.
