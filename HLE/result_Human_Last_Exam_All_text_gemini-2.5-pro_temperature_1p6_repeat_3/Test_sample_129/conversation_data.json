    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\nThe operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`.\nAn expression's length is the number of symbols used.\n\nWe will systematically enumerate all possible valid syntactic structures of length 5, and for each structure, count how many combinations of `T` and `F` make the expression evaluate to `True`. The structures must be disjoint to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet 'L' represent a literal (`T` or `F`). Let `op` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`).\n\n### Structure 1: Expressions without parentheses\n\nThese are of the form `A op B op C`, where A, B, and C are literals, possibly prefixed by one or more `!`s. The total length must be 5. With 3 literals and 2 operators, the total length is 5, leaving no room for extra symbols besides the negation operator `!` which can replace a literal placeholder. However, the problem specifies using 5 symbols. `T&!F&T` has 6 symbols. The structure must be composed of 5 symbols total.\n\nLet's correct the interpretation: The 5 symbols are chosen from the set, and can be literals, operators, or parentheses. For example, `T & F | T` is a valid expression of length 5. `! T & F | T` has length 6. So `!` can only be used if it fits within the 5-symbol limit.\n\nWe categorize expressions by their structure. A valid expression of 5 symbols can be:\n1.  A sequence of 3 literals and 2 binary operators.\n2.  A sequence containing negation operators `!`.\n3.  A sequence containing parentheses `()` .\n\nLet's re-enumerate structures by their makeup and guarantee they are disjoint sets of strings.\n\n#### **Set A: Flat expressions of the form `L1 op1 L2 op2 L3`**\nThese expressions have no parentheses and no negation operators. Total length is 5.\n*   The expression's value depends on the operators and their precedence. `&` is higher than `|`.\n*   Let's count the number of true expressions for each combination of operators. There are $2^3 = 8$ ways to assign T/F to `L1, L2, L3`.\n    *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: True only for `T&T&T`. (1 true expression)\n    *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: True for all except `F|F|F`. ($8 - 1 = 7$ true expressions)\n    *   `(L1 & L2) | L3`: True if `L3=T` (4 cases) or if `L1=T, L2=T` (1 case: `T&T|F`). (5 true expressions)\n    *   `L1 | (L2 & L3)`: True if `L1=T` (4 cases) or if `L2=T, L3=T` (1 case: `F|T&T`). (5 true expressions)\n*   Total for Set A: $1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18$.\n\n#### **Set B: Expressions with one `!`**\nTotal length is 5. With one `!`, one binary operator, and two literals: `!L1 op L2`. Length is 4. No.\nWith one `!`, two binary operators, and two literals: e.g., `!L1&L2|L3`. Length is 6. No.\nThis means the `!` must be combined with parentheses or other operators to meet the 5-symbol length.\n\nLet's categorize by overall structure, which is a more robust way to ensure disjoint sets.\n\n#### **Disjoint Structural Categories of Length 5**\n\n**Category 1: `A op B op C` (No parentheses)**\nThis structure has the form `X op Y op Z` where `X, Y, Z` are primitive expressions (literals).\n*   Number of `!`:\n    *   **Zero `!`s:** As calculated above, there are **18** true expressions.\n    *   **One `!`, e.g., `!L1 op L2 op L3`:** Length `2+1+1+1+1=6`. Not possible.\n    This means flat expressions cannot contain `!`. Wait, `!T` is length 2. My initial analysis was `T & !F`, where `!F` is a sub-expression. Let's count characters. `T & ! F` is 4 characters. The question is about `symbols`. A symbol is one of `T F ! & | ( )`. `T&!F|T` has 6 symbols. `!T&!F` is `!T & !F`, 5 symbols. `L` in my analysis should be a \"Factor\" (from grammar) which can be `T` or `F`. `!T` is not a Factor, it is an expression of length 2.\nLet's analyze based on the string itself.\n\n**Let's list all possible valid syntactical structures of length 5 symbols.**\n\n1.  **`L op1 L op2 L`**: 5 symbols. As calculated above. **18** true expressions.\n\n2.  **`!L1 op !L2`**: e.g. `!T & !F`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `!L1 & !L2`: True only if `!L1` is True and `!L2` is True, which means `L1=F, L2=F`. `!F&!F` is the only true expression. (1)\n    *   `!L1 | !L2`: True unless `!L1` is False and `!L2` is False, i.e., `L1=T, L2=T`. False only for `!T|!T`. Thus, 3 true expressions. (`!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`). (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4** true expressions.\n\n3.  **`(L op L)`**: e.g., `(T&F)`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `(&)`: `(T&T)` is true. (1)\n    *   `(|)`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4** true expressions.\n\n4.  **`L op (L)`**: e.g., `T&(F)`. 5 symbols. (`L1 op1 (L2)`).\n    *   `&`: `L1` must be T and `(L2)` must be T (so `L2=T`). `T&(T)` is the only true expression. (1)\n    *   `|`: `L1` or `L2` must be T. Cases are `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (3)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4** true expressions.\n\n5.  **(L) op L**: e.g., `(T)&F`. 5 symbols. By symmetry with case 4, there are **4** true expressions.\n\n6.  **`!(!L)`**: e.g., `!(!T)`. `!` `(` `!` `T` `)`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `!(!T)` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   `!(!F)` -> `!(T)` -> `F`. (0)\n    *   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n7.  **`!!(L)`**: e.g., `!!(T)`. `!` `!` `(` `T` `)`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `!!(T)` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. (1)\n    *   `!!(F)` -> `!(T)` -> `F`. (0)\n    *   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n8.  **`((L))`**: e.g., `((T))`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `((T))` is True. (1)\n    *   `((F))` is False. (0)\n    *   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n9.  **`(!!L)`**: e.g., `(!!T)`. 5 symbols.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)` which is True. (1)\n    *   `(!!F)` evaluates to `(F)` which is False. (0)\n    *   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n10. **`(!L op L)`**: e.g. `(!T&F)`. 6 symbols `(` `!` `T` `&` `F` `)`. Not length 5.\n11. **`L op !L op L`**: 7 symbols. No.\n\nLet's check if there are any other possible valid structures of length 5. We have covered structures with 0, 1, and 2 pairs of parentheses. We have covered flat structures with binary operators and negated structures. The list seems exhaustive and the structures are disjoint strings.\n\n**Final Tally:**\n*   From structure `L op L op L`: 18\n*   From structure `!L op !L`: 4\n*   From structure `(L op L)`: 4\n*   From structure `L op (L)`: 4\n*   From structure `(L) op L`: 4\n*   From structure `!(!L)`: 1\n*   From structure `!!(L)`: 1\n*   From structure `((L))`: 1\n*   From structure `(!!L)`: 1\n\nTotal number of true expressions = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38.\n\nLet me double-check the analysis. Everything seems sound. The key is to correctly identify the set of disjoint valid syntactical structures of length 5.\n\nRecheck calculation for `L op L op L`:\n*   `T&T&T`: 1 true\n*   `T&F&T`: 1 false\n*   ... 8 combinations.\n*   For ops `&&`: TTT -> T (1)\n*   For ops `||`: not FFF -> 7\n*   For ops `&|` (parsed `(..)&..|..` is wrong, it's `(&)|`): `(L1&L2)|L3`. True if `L3=T` (4/8 cases) or `L1=T,L2=T,L3=F` (1/8 case). Total 5/8. So 5 true.\n*   For ops `|&` (parsed `|(&)`): `L1|(L2&L3)`. True if `L1=T` (4/8 cases) or `L1=F,L2=T,L3=T` (1/8 case). Total 5/8. So 5 true.\n*   Total is 1+7+5+5=18. This seems correct.\n\nLet me rethink. Maybe `!!T` is length 3. If we don't count spaces. But the problem defines a set of symbols. `!` and `T` are two symbols. So `!T` is length 2.\nMy structure analysis and counting seems correct.\n\nFinal list of counts:\n1. `L op L op L`: 18\n2. `!L op !L`: 4\n3. `(L op L)`: 4\n4. `L op (L)`: 4\n5. `(L) op L`: 4\n6. `!(!L)`: 1\n7. `!!(L)`: 1\n8. `((L))`: 1\n9. `(!!L)`: 1\n\nSum = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38.\n\nLet's re-verify my reasoning one last time to be certain.\n- Disjoint structures: The top-level patterns of symbols (e.g., L_L_L vs (L_L) vs L_(L)) are distinct strings, so the sets are disjoint.\n- Completeness: Have all 5-symbol structures been considered?\n  - Any valid expression must be parseable.\n  - Length 5 is very restrictive.\n  - e.g., `!(L|L)` has 6 symbols. `(!L|L)` has 6. `!!L|L` has 5: `!!T|F`.\n  - Oh, a new structure. **`!!L op L`**. Let's analyze it.\n12. **`!!L op L`**: 5 symbols. `(!(!L))` has 6 symbols: `(!(!T))`. My `!(!L)` form above had one less parenthesis pair. Ah, `!(!T)` means `!( !T )` = 5. Ok that was ambiguous. Let's write them explicitly.\nLet's restart with explicit strings.\n1. `L B L B L`: 18.\n2. `! L B ! L`: 4.\n3. `( L B L )`: 4.\n4. `L B ( L )`: 4.\n5. `( L ) B L`: 4.\n6. `! ( ! L )`: 1.\n7. `! ! ( L )`: 1.\n8. `( ( L ) )`: 1.\n9. `( ! ! L )`: 1.\n10. `! ! L B L`: `! ! T & F`. (5 symbols).\n    * `&`: `!!L1 & L2` is same as `L1 & L2`. True only for `!!T&T`. (1)\n    * `|`: `!!L1 | L2` is same as `L1 | L2`. True for 3 cases. `!!T|T, !!T|F, !!F|T`. (3)\n    * Total: 1+3=4.\n11. `L B ! ! L`: By symmetry, **4** true expressions.\n\nTotal: 38 (from before) + 4 (from !!L op L) + 4 (from L op !!L) = 46.\n\nAnything else?\n- `(!L)` has 4 symbols.\n- A binary op needs two operands. `E1 op E2`.\n- `L op (!L)` -> len `1+1+4 = 6`. No.\n- Let's check `(!T)` and `!(T)`. `(!T)` length 4. `!(T)` length 4. These are different. Let's check if my previous cases are ambiguous.\n  - `!(!L)` could be `!(!T)` or `!( ! T )`. Both len 5. Let's assume standard parsing `!(!T)` means `!( ! T )`. This is what I used for `!(!L)`.\nOk, my previous analysis seems to hold up to the new cases found.\n\nSum = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46.\n\nFinal check. `(L B L)` -> `(T&T)`. `! (T&T)` -> 6 symbols.\n`! ( ( T ) )` -> 6 symbols.\nSeems my list of disjoint structures is growing but might be complete now.\n\n<<<46>>>"
