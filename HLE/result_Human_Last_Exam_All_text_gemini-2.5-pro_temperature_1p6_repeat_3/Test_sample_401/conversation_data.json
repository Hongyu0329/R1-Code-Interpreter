    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum**: A compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general definition, not the more restrictive one (compact, connected metric space).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum**: A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subspace that is a continuum itself and is not equal to the entire space $X$. An equivalent and crucial property is that in an indecomposable continuum, every proper subcontinuum has an empty interior.\n*   **Composant**: For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$.\n*   **Composants (not components)**: The question highlights this to avoid confusion. For any continuum, there is only one component (the space itself), as it is connected. Composants, on the other hand, form a partition of the space into dense subsets.\n\n### Step 2: Basic Properties of Composants\n\n*   The collection of all composants of a continuum $X$ forms a partition of $X$. This means every point of $X$ belongs to exactly one composant.\n*   In any continuum, every composant is a dense subset.\n*   A continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant (which is the space itself).\n*   Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. This means the smallest possible number is at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Proving the Number of Composants is Uncountable\n\nThis is the core of the problem. We need to show that having a finite or countably infinite number of composants leads to a contradiction.\n\n1.  Let $X$ be an indecomposable continuum. As established, it must have at least two distinct composants. Let's call them $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n2.  Pick any point $p \\in C_1$ and any point $q \\in C_2$.\n3.  By a fundamental theorem of topology (the Brouwer Reduction Theorem, a consequence of Zorn's Lemma), there must exist a subcontinuum of $X$ that is *irreducible* between $p$ and $q$. Let's call this subcontinuum $K$. \"Irreducible\" means that $K$ is a continuum containing both $p$ and $q$, but no proper subcontinuum of $K$ contains both $p$ and $q$.\n4.  Now we analyze the relationship between $K$ and the composants of $X$. A key lemma in continuum theory states that any proper subcontinuum of an indecomposable continuum must be contained entirely within a single composant.\n5.  The subcontinuum $K$ contains $p \\in C_1$ and $q \\in C_2$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are distinct, $K$ contains points from at least two different composants of $X$.\n6.  From points 4 and 5, it follows that $K$ cannot be a proper subcontinuum of $X$. Since $K$ is a subcontinuum of $X$, the only possibility is that $K = X$.\n7.  This shows that if a continuum $X$ is indecomposable, it must be irreducible between any pair of points chosen from two different composants.\n8.  We now rely on a major theorem from the theory of irreducible continua, established by Kuratowski: **Any indecomposable continuum that is irreducible between two points has uncountably many composants.**\n9.  This line of reasoning holds for general (not necessarily metric) continua. It forces the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum to be uncountable.\n\n*Alternative line of reasoning (for metric continua):* If the continuum is metric, it has a countable base, which implies each composant is an F-sigma set (a countable union of closed sets). In an indecomposable continuum, these closed sets are proper subcontinua, which are nowhere dense. Thus, each composant is a meager set (a set of first category). By the Baire Category Theorem, a complete metric space (like a continuum) cannot be written as a countable union of meager sets. Therefore, there must be uncountably many composants. This argument relies on metrizability, while the irreducibility argument is more general.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Uncountable Number\n\n1.  We have established that the number of composants must be uncountable. In set theory, numbers are represented by cardinals. The smallest uncountable cardinal is denoted by **$\\aleph_1$** (Aleph-one).\n2.  Therefore, the number of composants must be at least $\\aleph_1$. This means $\\aleph_1$ is a lower bound for the answer.\n\n### Step 5: Checking if the Lower Bound is Achievable\n\nFor $\\aleph_1$ to be the *smallest number*, there must exist an indecomposable continuum that has exactly $\\aleph_1$ composants.\n\n*   For **metric** indecomposable continua (like the solenoid or the pseudo-arc), a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that the number of composants is always exactly **$c$**, the cardinality of the continuum ($c=2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n*   Under the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), $\\aleph_1 = c$, so metric continua would provide an example. However, the answer should not depend on CH.\n*   If we do not assume CH, it is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC) that $\\aleph_1 < c$. In this case, metric continua have $c$ composants, not $\\aleph_1$.\n*   The \"not necessarily metric\" clause in the question is essential. Advanced constructions in set-theoretic topology have shown that it is consistent with ZFC to construct non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly $\\aleph_1$ composants. These results, for instance by Dow and Hart, confirm that the minimum value of $\\aleph_1$ is indeed achievable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be uncountable. The smallest uncountable cardinal is $\\aleph_1$. Since there are models of set theory in which continua with exactly $\\aleph_1$ composants exist, the smallest possible number is $\\aleph_1$."
