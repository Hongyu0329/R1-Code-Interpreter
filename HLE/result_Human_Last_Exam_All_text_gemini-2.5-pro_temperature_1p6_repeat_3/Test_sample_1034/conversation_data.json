    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a triangle $A B C$.\n    *   A side length $B C$ is given by a variable $S=S N Y W R$.\n    *   An angle $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B=30^{\\circ}$ is given.\n    *   We need to find the number of possible *integer* values for the side length $AC$.\n    *   The condition that these integer values of $AC$ must satisfy is that for each such value, there are exactly two possible values for the side length $A B$.\n\n2.  **Determine the value of S:**\n    The string $S=S N Y W R$ is likely a code for a number. A common method in such problems is to sum the alphabetical positions of the letters (A=1, B=2, ... Z=26).\n    *   S is the 19th letter.\n    *   N is the 14th letter.\n    *   Y is the 25th letter.\n    *   W is the 23rd letter.\n    *   R is the 18th letter.\n    *   Summing these values: $S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n    *   So, in $\\triangle ABC$, we have the side length $BC = 99$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Two Possible Values\" Condition:**\n    Let the sides of the triangle be $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We are given:\n    *   $a = 99$\n    *   $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$\n    *   We are looking for the number of integer values of $b$ for which there are two possible values of $c$.\n\n    This is the classic \"ambiguous case\" in trigonometry, specifically when using the Law of Sines (the Side-Side-Angle or SSA case).\n\n    Let's visualize the setup:\n    *   Draw the side $BC$ of length $a=99$.\n    *   At vertex $B$, draw a ray that makes a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie on this ray.\n    *   The vertex $A$ must also be at a distance of $b$ from the vertex $C$. This means $A$ lies on a circle of radius $b$ centered at $C$.\n\n    For there to be two possible locations for vertex $A$ (and thus two possible triangles and two values for side $AB=c$), the circle centered at $C$ must intersect the ray from $B$ at two distinct points.\n\n    Let $h$ be the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. This is the shortest distance from $C$ to that line.\n    *   In the right triangle formed by the altitude, $h = a \\sin(B)$.\n    *   $h = 99 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 99 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 49.5$.\n\n    The conditions for the number of intersections are:\n    *   If $b < h$: The circle's radius is too short to reach the ray. There are zero intersections (no possible triangle).\n    *   If $b = h$: The circle is tangent to the ray. There is exactly one intersection (one right-angled triangle).\n    *   If $b > h$: The circle intersects the line containing the ray at two points.\n\n    Now, we need to ensure both intersections result in a valid triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n    *   If $h < b < a$: The circle intersects the ray at two distinct points, leading to two different valid triangles.\n    *   If $b = a$: The circle intersects the ray at one point, and also at point $B$. The intersection at $B$ creates a degenerate triangle (with side $c=0$), so there is only one non-degenerate triangle (which is isosceles, since $a=b$).\n    *   If $b > a$: The circle intersects the line containing the ray at two points, but one of these points lies on the extension of the ray \"behind\" point $B$, which would correspond to an angle of $180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ$ at $B$. Only one intersection lies on the correct ray for $\\angle B=30^\\circ$. So, there is only one possible triangle.\n\n    Therefore, the condition for having exactly two possible values for side length $AB$ is $h < b < a$.\n\n4.  **Establish the Inequality and Find Integer Solutions:**\n    From our analysis, the side length $b = AC$ must satisfy:\n    $h < AC < a$\n    Substituting the calculated values:\n    $49.5 < AC < 99$\n\n    The question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$. So we need to count the integers in the interval $(49.5, 99)$.\n    *   The smallest integer greater than 49.5 is 50.\n    *   The largest integer less than 99 is 98.\n    *   The integer values for $AC$ are $50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98$.\n\n5.  **Count the Integers:**\n    To find the number of integers in this inclusive range, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\n    *   Number of integer values = $98 - 50 + 1$\n    *   Number of integer values = $48 + 1 = 49$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\n*   Given information: $BC=S$, $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   Value of $S = SNYWR = 19+14+25+23+18 = 99$. So $a=BC=99$.\n*   Let $b = AC$ and $c = AB$. The condition for two possible values of $c$ is the ambiguous case of SSA.\n*   This occurs when the side opposite the given angle ($b$) is strictly between the altitude from C ($h$) and the other given side ($a$).\n*   The altitude $h = a \\sin(B) = 99 \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 99 \\times 0.5 = 49.5$.\n*   The condition is $h < b < a$, which is $49.5 < b < 99$.\n*   We need the number of integer values for $b$ in this range.\n*   The possible integers are $50, 51, \\ldots, 98$.\n*   The count is $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
