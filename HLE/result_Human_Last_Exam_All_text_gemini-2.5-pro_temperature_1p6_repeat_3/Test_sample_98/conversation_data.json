    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Object:** The tank is a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its triangular faces is perfectly horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   **The Filling:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Principles of Symmetry and Gravity**\n*   A regular icosahedron possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a single point at its geometric center known as the center of symmetry (or inversion center). Any line drawn through this center will intersect the surface of the icosahedron at two points equidistant from the center.\n*   When the icosahedron rests on a face, its center of symmetry is located at a specific height, exactly halfway between the base face and the opposite top face.\n*   Under the influence of gravity, the surface of a liquid in a container will be a horizontal plane.\n*   Since the tank is exactly half-filled, the volume of water equals the volume of the empty space above it. Due to the perfect symmetry of the icosahedron, the horizontal plane that divides the solid into two equal volumes must pass through its geometric center.\n*   Therefore, the water surface will be a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The question now becomes: What is the shape of the cross-section created when a horizontal plane slices through the center of an icosahedron that is resting on one of its faces?\n*   Let's analyze the vertices and edges of the icosahedron in this orientation. The 12 vertices are arranged in four horizontal layers.\n    *   Layer 1 (Bottom): 3 vertices forming the base triangle.\n    *   Layer 2: 3 vertices forming another triangle just above the base.\n    *   Layer 3: 3 vertices forming a triangle below the top face.\n    *   Layer 4 (Top): 3 vertices forming the top triangle.\n*   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) lies exactly between Layer 2 and Layer 3. This means the plane does not pass through any of the vertices.\n*   The plane must therefore intersect the edges that connect vertices from the lower half (Layers 1 and 2) to the upper half (Layers 3 and 4).\n*   Let's identify these connecting edges. Each of the 3 vertices in Layer 2 is connected to 2 vertices in Layer 3. This gives a total of 3 x 2 = 6 edges that cross the central plane.\n*   Since the water surface intersects exactly 6 edges of the icosahedron, the resulting shape of the water surface will be a polygon with 6 vertices, which is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Properties of the Hexagon**\n*   We can determine the type of hexagon by considering the symmetries of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The axis passing through the centers of the top and bottom faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the icosahedron by 120Â° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Therefore, the hexagonal water surface must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Reflectional Symmetry:** The icosahedron also has three vertical planes of reflection symmetry. Each plane passes through a vertex of the base triangle and the midpoint of the opposite side. The hexagonal water surface must also be symmetric across these planes.\n*   A hexagon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and planes of reflection passing through its vertices must be a **regular hexagon** (all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are equal).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen a half-filled icosahedron tank stands on one of its faces, the water surface forms a horizontal plane that cuts the icosahedron through its center. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
