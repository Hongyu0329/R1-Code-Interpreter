    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Calabi-Yau Hypersurface in a Weighted Projective Space:** A variety defined by a single polynomial equation $P(z_1, ..., z_{n+1})=0$ in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, ..., w_{n+1})$. For the variety to be Calabi-Yau, the polynomial $P$ must be quasi-homogeneous of a certain weighted degree $d$, and this degree must equal the sum of the weights: $d = \\sum w_i$. Quasi-homogeneous means every monomial term in the polynomial has the same weighted degree.\n*   **Crawley-Nordström (CN) Invariant:** For a link $L_P$ of a Gorenstein canonical singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $P$, the invariant is given by the formula:\n    $c(L_P) = d - \\sum w_i + l$\n    where:\n    *   `d` is the weighted degree of the polynomial $P$.\n    *   $\\sum w_i$ is the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n    *   `l` is the number of monomial terms in the polynomial $P$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Data\n*   **Polynomial:** $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n*   **Ambient Space:** $\\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n\n### Step 3: Check for Quasi-homogeneity (A Careful Point)\nA critical step is to verify that the polynomial is indeed quasi-homogeneous. We calculate the weighted degree of each monomial term.\n*   Weight of $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times w_1 + 1 \\times w_3 = 8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   Weight of $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\times w_1 + 3 \\times w_2 + 1 \\times w_3 = 4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   Weight of $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times w_1 + 7 \\times w_2 = 1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   Weight of $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n*   Weight of $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\times w_2 + 4 \\times w_3 = 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   Weight of $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times w_4 + 1 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   Weight of $z_5^3$: $3 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 75 = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We observe an inconsistency. One term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has a weighted degree of 224, while all other six terms have a weighted degree of 225. A polynomial that is not quasi-homogeneous cannot define a hypersurface in a weighted projective space in the standard way.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition and Resolve the Inconsistency\nThe question refers to a \"Calabi-Yau Link\", which implies the condition $d = \\sum w_i$ must hold.\n*   Sum of weights: $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   For the Calabi-Yau condition to be satisfied, the degree `d` of the polynomial must be 225.\n\nThis strongly suggests that the intended degree of the polynomial is 225, and the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ with degree 224 is a typographical error in the problem statement. To proceed, we must assume the problem intended to provide a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree 225. The most reasonable assumption is to discard the erroneous term.\n\n**Corrected Polynomial:**\n$P' = z_1^8z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant\nUsing the corrected, quasi-homogeneous polynomial $P'$, we can now determine the parameters for the CN invariant formula.\n*   **Degree `d`**: The weighted degree of $P'$ is 225.\n*   **Sum of Weights `Σw_i`**: This is unchanged and equals 225.\n*   **Number of Monomials `l`**: Counting the terms in the corrected polynomial $P'$, we find there are 6 monomials.\n\nNow, we apply the formula:\n$c = d - \\sum w_i + l$\n$c = 225 - 225 + 6$\n$c = 6$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau Link, after correcting for the inconsistent term in the defining polynomial, is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
