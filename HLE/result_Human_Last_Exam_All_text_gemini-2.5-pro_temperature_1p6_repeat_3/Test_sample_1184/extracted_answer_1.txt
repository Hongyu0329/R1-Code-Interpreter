Based on structural and functional studies, using the canonical human CACNB1 sequence (UniProt: Q02641) for residue numbering:

**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues are located within the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) groove on the GK domain of the beta-1 subunit and are critical for physical binding.
*   **W340** (Tryptophan): Provides a critical hydrophobic anchor.
*   **V345** (Valine): Contributes to the hydrophobic binding groove.
*   **Y393** (Tyrosine): Forms a key hydrogen bond with the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID).
*   **I397** (Isoleucine): Contributes to the hydrophobic binding groove.
*   **E430** (Glutamate) & **R432** (Arginine): Form electrostatic interactions/salt bridges at the edge of the binding site.

**2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation of the alpha-1 subunit:**
These residues are typically located outside the core binding groove and allosterically regulate channel function.
*   **The N-terminal domain (residues ~1-70):** This entire region acts as a module that strongly influences inactivation kinetics.
*   **D383** (Aspartate), **E384** (Glutamate), **N386** (Asparagine): A cluster on a surface loop of the GK domain that modulates voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **K443** (Lysine): A surface residue on the GK domain that influences channel activation kinetics.
