    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph Definition**\n\n*   **Graph \\(G\\):** The question defines \\(G\\) as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, often denoted by the '+' symbol, refers to the **graph join** operation.\n*   **Cycles of length \\(n\\) (\\(C_n\\)):** These are graphs with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges forming a single loop. We assume \\(n \\ge 3\\) since a cycle must have at least 3 vertices.\n*   **Graph Join (\\(G_1 + G_2 + ... + G_k\\)):** The join of several graphs is formed by taking their disjoint union (i.e., all their vertices and edges, with no overlap) and then adding all possible edges between vertices that belong to different original graphs.\n*   **Applying the definition to \\(G\\):** Let the three cycles be \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\), each a \\(C_n\\).\n    *   The vertex set of \\(G\\), \\(V(G)\\), is the disjoint union of the vertex sets of the three cycles. So, \\(|V(G)| = n + n + n = 3n\\).\n    *   The edge set of \\(G\\), \\(E(G)\\), consists of:\n        1.  The edges within each cycle \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(C_C\\).\n        2.  All possible edges connecting a vertex in \\(C_A\\) to a vertex in \\(C_B\\).\n        3.  All possible edges connecting a vertex in \\(C_A\\) to a vertex in \\(C_C\\).\n        4.  All possible edges connecting a vertex in \\(C_B\\) to a vertex in \\(C_C\\).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The crucial part of the structure is that any vertex from one cycle is adjacent to *every* vertex from the other two cycles.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**\n\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** This is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Property of Graph Join:** A fundamental property of the chromatic number with respect to the join operation is:\n    \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2)\\)\n    This extends to multiple graphs: \\(\\chi(G_1 + G_2 + ... + G_k) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + ... + \\chi(G_k)\\).\n*   **Reasoning:** Consider the vertex sets \\(V(C_A)\\), \\(V(C_B)\\), and \\(V(C_C)\\). Because every vertex in \\(V(C_A)\\) is connected to every vertex in \\(V(C_B)\\), the set of colors used for \\(V(C_A)\\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for \\(V(C_B)\\). The same logic applies to all pairs of vertex sets. Therefore, to find the total minimum number of colors for \\(G\\), we must sum the minimum numbers of colors required for each component graph.\n*   **Applying to \\(G\\):**\n    \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_A + C_B + C_C) = \\chi(C_A) + \\chi(C_B) + \\chi(C_C)\\)\n    Since all three cycles have the same length \\(n\\), they have the same chromatic number, \\(\\chi(C_n)\\).\n    \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\)\n\n**3. Determining the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(\\chi(C_n)\\))**\n\n*   The chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on its length \\(n\\).\n*   **Case 1: \\(n\\) is even (\\(n \\ge 4\\)).**\n    *   An even-length cycle is a bipartite graph. We can color its vertices by alternating between two distinct colors (e.g., color 1, color 2, color 1, ...). This coloring is valid.\n    *   Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\) for even \\(n\\).\n*   **Case 2: \\(n\\) is odd (\\(n \\ge 3\\)).**\n    *   An odd-length cycle is not bipartite. If we try to use two colors, we will inevitably have two adjacent vertices with the same color (specifically, the first and last vertices in the alternating sequence). We need a third color to resolve this conflict.\n    *   Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\) for odd \\(n\\).\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider both possibilities for \\(n\\) since the question does not specify whether \\(n\\) is even or odd.\n\n**4. Calculating the Maximal Chromatic Number of \\(G\\)**\n\n*   Now we combine our findings to calculate \\(\\chi(G)\\) for both cases of \\(n\\).\n*   **If \\(n\\) is even:**\n    \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\)\n*   **If \\(n\\) is odd:**\n    \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\)\n*   The question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number. This means we should choose the case that results in the larger value.\n*   Comparing the two possible results, 6 and 9, the maximum value is 9. This value is achieved for any graph \\(G\\) where the cycles have an odd length \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(G = C_3 + C_3 + C_3\\)).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the largest value calculated.\n\n<<<9>>>"
