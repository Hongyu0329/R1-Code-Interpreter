    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that the value of $W$ is completely determined if the value of $Z$ is known.\n\n**Goal:** Find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### **2. Recall and Apply Fundamental Information Theory Identities**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the chain rule for mutual information, which can be expressed in a few ways. For three variables, we have:\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nLet's use these rules to find other information quantities for $X, Y, Z$.\n\n**Step 2.1: Calculate I(X;Z)**\nUsing the chain rule for $I(X; Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    *   Substituting the given values: $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    *   Using the value we just found: $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n    *   Solving for $I(X;Z)$, we get: $I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nSo, we have derived an additional important quantity: $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n### **3. Incorporate the Variable W**\n\nNow, we analyze the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$, using the properties of the deterministic relationship $W=f(Z)$.\n\n**Step 3.1: Properties of W = f(Z)**\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$. This has several consequences:\n1.  Conditioning on $(A,Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on $(A,Z)$ for any other variable $A$.\n2.  Therefore, any conditional mutual information term like $I(A;B|C,Z,W)$ simplifies to $I(A;B|C,Z)$.\n3.  Specifically for our problem:\n    *   $I(X;Y | Z, W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z | Y, W) = I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n**Step 3.2: Relate I(X;Y|W) to other quantities**\nLet's apply the chain rule to the term $I(X; Y,Z | W)$, which represents the information $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$ given $W$. We can expand this in two ways:\n1.  $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Using our property from 3.1, this becomes:\n    $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + 5$.\n2.  $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$. Using our property from 3.1, this becomes:\n    $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + 2$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z | W)$, we get a relationship between $I(X;Y|W)$ and $I(X;Z|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) + 5 = I(X;Z|W) + 2$\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) - 3$\n\nThis equation shows that maximizing $I(X;Y|W)$ is equivalent to maximizing $I(X;Z|W)$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Express I(X;Z|W) in terms of knowns**\nLet's use the chain rule on $I(X;Z)$. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information in $Z$ about $X$ can be decomposed into the information in $W$ about $X$ and the remaining information in $Z$ about $X$ after $W$ is known.\n$I(X;Z) = I(X; W,Z)$ (because W is redundant if Z is known)\n$I(X; W,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$ (by the chain rule)\nSo, we have:\n$I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$\nSubstituting the value $I(X;Z)=6$ we found earlier:\n$6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$\nThis gives us an expression for $I(X;Z|W)$:\n$I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$\n\n### **4. Find the Maximum Value**\n\nNow we can combine our findings to get an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ that depends only on $I(X;W)$.\n\n**Step 4.1: Final Expression for I(X;Y|W)**\nSubstitute the expression for $I(X;Z|W)$ from Step 3.3 into the equation from Step 3.2:\n$I(X;Y|W) = (6 - I(X;W)) - 3$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W)$\n\n**Step 4.2: Maximize the Expression**\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. From the equation $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W)$, we can see that we need to find the **smallest** possible value of $I(X;W)$.\n\nA fundamental property of mutual information is that it is always non-negative:\n$I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n\nThe minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This minimum can be achieved. For example, we could choose the function $f$ to be a constant function, $W = f(Z) = c$ for all outcomes of $Z$. A constant random variable is independent of any other random variable, so $I(X;W)=0$. Such a choice of $W$ is consistent with all the problem's conditions.\n\nPlacing the minimum value $I(X;W)=0$ into our final expression:\nLargest value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - 0 = 3$.\n\n### **5. Final Check (Careful Points)**\n*   All intermediate and final information quantities must be non-negative. Let's check this for the maximizing case where $I(X;W)=0$:\n    *   $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - 0 = 3 \\ge 0$. (OK)\n    *   $I(X;Z|W) = 6 - 0 = 6 \\ge 0$. (OK)\n*   The logic holds at every step, using only standard and valid information theory identities. The key steps are the correct application of the chain rule and the properties stemming from the deterministic relationship $W=f(Z)$.\n*   The range of possible values for $I(X;W)$ is constrained by non-negativity. Specifically, $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) \\ge 0$ implies $I(X;W) \\le 3$. So the valid range for $I(X;W)$ is $[0, 3]$. To maximize $3-I(X;W)$, we must choose the minimum value from this range, which is 0.\n\nThe largest possible value is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
