No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is dependent on the perception of natural predators, primarily birds. Human vision is trichromatic and cannot perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas avian vision is tetrachromatic and includes UV perception. Bee color patterns often have significant UV components. Therefore, species that appear similar to humans may look very different to a bird, and vice versa. Using human undergraduates as a proxy for the relevant predators ignores the key sensory modality through which the mimicry signal has evolved, making the resulting clusters unlikely to reflect the true, functional mimicry rings.
