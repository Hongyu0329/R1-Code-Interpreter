    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film:** The 1972 movie *Solaris*, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. It is important to focus on this specific adaptation, not the original novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 remake.\n    *   **Action/Emotion:** A character expresses that they are \"ashamed\" to miss a specific earthly sound.\n    *   **Specific Sound:** \"the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n    *   **Task:** Identify which character says this.\n\n2.  **Character Evaluation and Context:**\n    The film explores the psychological state of a small group of scientists isolated on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Their prolonged separation from Earth is a central theme. The line in question reflects a deep sense of homesickness and alienation. Let's consider each character:\n\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to evaluate the situation on the station. He has just left Earth, so while he has strong memories of it (as seen in the film's opening sequence), he hasn't been away long enough to develop the specific kind of long-term deprivation and shame expressed in the quote. He is the person to whom this feeling is confessed.\n\n    *   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife. She is a creation of the Solaris ocean and has no authentic memories of Earth. Her journey is about becoming human, not about missing a home she never truly had.\n\n    *   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is a cyberneticist and one of the two scientists still alive on the station when Kris arrives. He has been there for a long time and has become weary and philosophical. He often discusses the psychological toll of their mission and their isolation. A statement reflecting a deep, almost shameful longing for a simple aspect of Earth is highly consistent with his character, which serves as a voice of experience and existential despair.\n\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is a biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific problem that Solaris represents. He actively suppresses emotion and sentimentality, viewing them as weaknesses that interfere with his work. It is highly unlikely he would admit to, let alone feel shame over, missing something as poetic as rustling leaves.\n\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris. In this video, his state is one of desperation and warning, not nostalgic reflection.\n\n3.  **Locating the Scene and Dialogue:**\n    The specific line is spoken during a conversation between the newly arrived Kris Kelvin and the long-term station resident, Dr. Snaut. Snaut is trying to explain the mental state of the crew and the profound sense of alienation they feel. He confides in Kris, saying he feels homesick to the point of physical illness. It is in this context that he makes the confession, admitting that he is almost embarrassed by the simplicity and intensity of his longing. The dialogue demonstrates how their grand scientific mission has been overshadowed by a basic, human need for their terrestrial home.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Material:** Ensure the answer pertains specifically to Tarkovsky's 1972 film, as characterizations can differ between the book and the two film adaptations.\n*   **Character Motivation:** The emotion of \"shame\" is key. The character isn't just missing Earth; they feel that this simple, nostalgic feeling is somehow inappropriate or a sign of weakness in their high-minded scientific environment. This points directly to the world-weary and self-aware Snaut, who understands the futility and psychological cost of their mission. Sartorius would be dismissive, not ashamed, of such a feeling.\n*   **Excluding Other Characters:** Kris is too new to the station, Hari isn't human, and Gibarian's role is too limited for this specific dialogue. This leaves Snaut and Sartorius, and the sentiment is entirely out of character for Sartorius.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. He expresses this to Kris Kelvin as a way of describing the profound homesickness and loss of purpose felt by the station's long-term crew.\n\n<<<C>>>"
