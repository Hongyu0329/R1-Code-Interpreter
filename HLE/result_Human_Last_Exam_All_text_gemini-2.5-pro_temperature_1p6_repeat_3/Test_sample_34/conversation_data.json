    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Context of the Question**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB deep No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n*   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a key detail. The absence of rake increases the expected value (EV) of playing any hand, encouraging slightly wider opening ranges compared to a raked game.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river), which gives you a significant informational advantage. This advantage allows you to profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n*   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size from the button.\n*   **The Goal:** Identify the *worst* suited Jack hand (JXs) that should be included in this opening range. This means finding the hand at the bottom of the JXs opening range, which is still profitable to open.\n\n**2. List and Rank the Candidate Hands**\n\nThe category of hands is suited Jacks (JXs). Let's list them in descending order of strength:\n1.  JTs (strongest - good high card, connected)\n2.  J9s (strong - one-gapper)\n3.  J8s (good - two-gapper)\n4.  J7s (playable - three-gapper)\n5.  J6s\n6.  J5s\n7.  J4s\n8.  J3s\n9.  J2s (weakest - poor kicker, no straight connectivity)\n\nThe strength decreases primarily due to two factors:\n*   **Connectivity:** The ability to make straights diminishes as the gap between the two cards widens. JTs is a premium connector, while J2s has no straight-making potential that doesn't also involve the other four cards on the board making a straight.\n*   **Kicker Strength:** A higher kicker is better when you make a pair of Jacks.\n\n**3. Analyze the Profitability of Opening from the Button**\n\nOpening from the button is profitable for several reasons:\n*   **High Fold Equity:** The Small Blind and Big Blind must fold to your raise a large percentage of the time. When they do, you win the blinds uncontested, which is a significant source of profit.\n*   **Positional Advantage:** When you are called, you get to act last post-flop. This allows you to control the size of the pot, bluff more effectively, and realize your hand's equity better than your opponents.\n*   **Playability of Suited Hands:** Suited hands are particularly valuable because they can make flushes, which are very strong hands. They also frequently make flush draws, which gives you semi-bluffing opportunities and adds equity to your hand.\n\n**4. Determine the Cutoff Point**\n\nGiven the immense advantage of the button, Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies recommend an extremely wide opening range. We need to determine if the weakest hand in our list, J2s, is part of that standard range.\n\n*   A hand like J2s has two main sources of value:\n    1.  **High Card Value:** The Jack can make top pair on a Jack-high flop, or a strong pair on lower boards.\n    2.  **Flush Potential:** The suitedness provides a powerful backdoor plan to make a flush.\n*   Even though J2s lacks straight potential, its combination of high-card strength and flush potential, when combined with the positional advantage of the button and pre-flop fold equity, makes it a profitable open-raise.\n*   In a standard 100BB GTO-based chart for button opening ranges (even in raked games), the entire suite of JXs hands (from JTs down to J2s) is included as a pure open-raise.\n*   The fact that the game is **rake-free** only strengthens the case for opening J2s, as its marginal profitability is now even higher.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nSince a standard, GTO-approved button opening range includes *all* suited Jacks from JTs through J2s, the \"worst\" one that you *should* still open is the weakest one in that sequence. That hand is J2s. Any suited Jack weaker than this does not exist.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Don't Confuse \"Worst\" with \"Unplayable\":** The question asks for the worst hand you *should open*, not a hand you should fold. It's the bottom boundary of your opening range for this specific hand type.\n2.  **Position is Paramount:** This answer is specific to the button. From an earlier position like Under-the-Gun (UTG), J2s would be an easy fold.\n3.  **Rake-Free Condition:** This detail makes the decision easier. In a very high-rake game, the most marginal hands might be borderline. In a rake-free game, they become clearer opens.\n4.  **Opponent Tendencies:** While GTO provides the baseline, if the blinds are extremely aggressive 3-bettors, you might tighten your range. Conversely, against very passive opponents, you can open even wider. However, the question implies a baseline GTO approach.\n\nThe weakest suited Jack is J2s. Following a standard opening strategy from the button, all suited Jacks are profitable opens. Therefore, the worst suited Jack you should open is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
