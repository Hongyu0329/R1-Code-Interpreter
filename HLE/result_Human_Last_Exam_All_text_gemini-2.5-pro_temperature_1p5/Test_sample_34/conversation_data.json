    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Game Conditions**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **100BB Stack Depth:** This is the standard stack size. It means post-flop playability, implied odds, and reverse implied odds are all significant factors.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a critical detail. In a normal game, the rake requires you to win a larger pot to be profitable, which tightens opening ranges. In a rake-free environment, any hand that is even slightly profitable (+EV) against the blinds' continuing range becomes a correct open. This leads to much wider opening ranges.\n    *   **Cash Game:** The goal is to maximize long-term expected value ($EV) with each decision.\n\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN).\n    *   This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river).\n    *   This positional advantage allows you to \"realize\" your hand's equity more effectively than out-of-position players and lets you bluff more successfully.\n    *   Consequently, the opening range from the button is the widest of any position.\n\n*   **Action:** Open to 2.5x.\n    *   This is a standard open-raise size. You are risking 2.5 big blinds to win the 1.5 big blinds (Small Blind + Big Blind) already in the pot.\n\n*   **Hand in Question:** The \"worst suited jack\" (JsX).\n    *   This refers to the suited Jack combo with the lowest profitability that should still be included in an optimal opening range. The potential candidates are J2s, J3s, J4s, J5s, etc. (Hands like AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs are premium and are obviously opened).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Factors That Give a Hand Value**\n\nWhen opening from the button, a hand's value comes from:\n1.  **High Card Value:** The ability to make strong top pairs. A Jack is a decent high card.\n2.  **Playability:** How well the hand plays post-flop. This is driven by suitedness and connectedness.\n    *   **Suitedness:** The ability to make flushes and strong flush draws. This adds significant equity and makes the hand easier to play post-flop, as you can continue on many board textures. All hands in question are suited.\n    *   **Connectedness:** The ability to make straights and straight draws. Better connectors (like JTs, J9s) are more valuable than gapped connectors (like J8s) or very weakly connected hands (like J4s, J3s, J2s).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Suited Jack Candidates**\n\nWe need to rank the weaker suited jacks from best to worst to find the cutoff point.\n\n*   **J9s, J8s, J7s:** These hands have good high-card value and reasonable connectivity. They can easily make strong draws (both straight and flush draws) and are clear opens from the button.\n*   **J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s:** As the second card (the \"kicker\") gets lower, the hand gets progressively weaker.\n    *   **Domination:** When you flop a pair of Jacks, a lower kicker makes it more likely that an opponent who also has a Jack will have you out-kicked, costing you a large pot.\n    *   **Connectivity:** The ability to make straights diminishes. J5s can connect with middle cards (6, 7, 8). J2s has the worst connectivity, primarily only connecting with 3, 4, 5 to make a low straight.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the \"Worst\" Hand to Open**\n\nGiven the extremely favorable conditions (Button position, rake-free game), the optimal opening range is very wide. GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solvers show that in this specific scenario, you should be opening close to 50% of all hands, and sometimes more.\n\n*   This wide range includes all suited Aces, all suited Kings, all suited Queens, and **all suited Jacks.**\n*   The value of being suited combined with having a decent high card (the Jack) and being in the best position (the Button) makes every single suited Jack combination profitable to open.\n*   Since all suited Jacks from JTs down to J2s are considered profitable opens, the \"worst\" one you should open is simply the weakest hand in that category.\n*   Ranking them by strength, J2s is weaker than J3s, which is weaker than J4s, and so on. The primary reasons J2s is the worst are its terrible connectivity and high likelihood of being dominated on J-high flops.\n\nTherefore, J2s is the suited Jack with the lowest expected value that is still a profitable, standard open from the button in a rake-free, 100BB game.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
