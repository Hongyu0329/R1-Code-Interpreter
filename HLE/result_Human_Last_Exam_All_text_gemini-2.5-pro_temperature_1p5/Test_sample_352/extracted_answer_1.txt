The best replacement for the Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate (SEED) sequence at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine (A). This would result in an Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (AAAA) sequence. This change effectively neutralizes the patch by replacing the negatively charged acidic residues (EED) with the uncharged Alanine and, crucially, replaces the phosphorylatable Serine (S) with a non-phosphorylatable Alanine, thereby completely eliminating the negative charge from this entire inhibitory region.
