    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups:**\n    *   **Wallpaper groups** are the 17 distinct groups of symmetries of the 2D plane that include translations in two independent directions. They classify all possible repeating patterns on a plane.\n    *   The **point group** of a wallpaper group consists of the symmetries that leave a single point fixed (rotations and reflections). For any wallpaper group, its point group must be one of the 10 crystallographic point groups in 2D.\n\n2.  **List the 10 Crystallographic Point Groups in 2D and their Orders:**\n    The order of a group is the number of elements (symmetries) it contains.\n    *   **C1:** Order 1 (identity only)\n    *   **C2:** Order 2 (identity, 180째 rotation)\n    *   **C3:** Order 3 (identity, 120째 rotation, 240째 rotation)\n    *   **C4:** Order 4\n    *   **C6:** Order 6\n    *   **D1 (or m):** Order 2 (identity, one reflection)\n    *   **D2 (or 2mm):** Order 4\n    *   **D3 (or 3m):** Order 6\n    *   **D4 (or 4mm):** Order 8\n    *   **D6 (or 6mm):** Order 12\n\n3.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:**\n    From the list above, there are two distinct point groups of order 2:\n    *   **C2:** This group contains only a 2-fold (180째) rotation symmetry.\n    *   **D1 (m):** This group contains only a reflection symmetry across a single axis.\n\n4.  **Identify Wallpaper Groups Corresponding to Each Point Group of Order 2:**\n    We now need to examine the 17 wallpaper groups and see which of them have C2 or D1 as their point group. We can use the standard International Union of Crystallography (IUC) notation to identify them.\n\n    *   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group C2:**\n        There is only one wallpaper group whose highest order of rotation is 2-fold, with no reflection or glide reflection symmetries.\n        *   **p2:** This group has 2-fold rotation centers but no reflection lines. Its point group is C2.\n\n    *   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group D1 (m):**\n        These groups contain reflection or glide reflection symmetries but no rotational symmetries (other than the identity). A glide reflection's \"point\" component is a simple reflection, so groups with only glides still have D1 as their point group.\n        *   **pm:** Contains parallel reflection lines. Its point group is D1.\n        *   **pg:** Contains parallel glide reflection lines. Its point group is D1.\n        *   **cm:** Contains parallel reflection lines and glide lines on a centered lattice. Its point group is D1.\n\n5.  **Count the Identified Wallpaper Groups:**\n    Let's list all the wallpaper groups we found that have a point group of order 2:\n    1.  **p2** (from point group C2)\n    2.  **pm** (from point group D1)\n    3.  **pg** (from point group D1)\n    4.  **cm** (from point group D1)\n\n    In total, there are 4 such wallpaper groups.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
