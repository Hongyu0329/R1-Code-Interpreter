    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical effect that belongs to the class of second-order nonlinear optical processes. In this process, a single photon from a high-frequency pump beam (frequency $\\omega_p$) interacts with a nonlinear material and is annihilated, creating a pair of lower-frequency photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" ($\\omega_s$) and \"idler\" ($\\omega_i$). This process must conserve energy ($\\omega_p = \\omega_s + \\omega_i$) and momentum ($\\vec{k}_p \\approx \\vec{k}_s + \\vec{k}_i$, the phase-matching condition).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material requirement for SPDC.**\nThe efficiency of any second-order nonlinear process, including SPDC, is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted by the tensor $\\chi^{(2)}$. A fundamental principle in optics and crystal symmetry dictates that for a material to possess a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$, its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). In materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials), the $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor is identically zero due to symmetry constraints, and thus, they cannot exhibit bulk second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the material in question: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene).**\nBoron nanosheets, commonly known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single, highly stable hexagonal lattice, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic structures. The most stable and commonly synthesized phases (typically grown on a silver substrate) are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases. The question specifies \"free-standing,\" so we must consider the intrinsic structure of the nanosheet itself, without influence from a substrate.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the crystal symmetry of common borophene phases.**\nTo determine if borophene can exhibit SPDC, we must examine the symmetry of its crystal structure.\n*   **$\\beta_{12}$ Borophene:** This structure consists of a triangular lattice with periodic vacancies, resulting in a buckled sheet. Its structure is described by the space group *Pmmn* (No. 59).\n*   **$\\chi_3$ Borophene:** This is another stable phase, which is planar. Its structure is also described by the space group *Pmmn* (No. 59).\n\nThe crucial point is that the space group *Pmmn* **is centrosymmetric**. It contains an inversion center as one of its symmetry elements. This holds true for most other theoretically predicted stable, free-standing borophene phases as well.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the symmetry analysis.**\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a material to be non-centrosymmetric.\n3.  The most stable and common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, the intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of boron nanosheets is zero.\n\nBased on this, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The analysis assumes an ideal, infinite, and defect-free crystal structure. In a real, finite-sized nanosheet, the inversion symmetry is broken at the **edges**. This could theoretically lead to a very weak, edge-localized SPDC signal, but it would not be a bulk property of the material and would be extremely inefficient.\n2.  **Symmetry Breaking:** External factors could break the inversion symmetry. For example, an applied static electric field, significant strain gradients, or interactions with a substrate (which is excluded by the \"free-standing\" condition) could induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, this is an *induced* effect, not an *intrinsic* property of the material itself. The question asks what would be *expected*, which implies intrinsic behavior.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant electric-dipole contribution to SPDC (governed by $\\chi^{(2)}$) is forbidden, much weaker contributions from electric-quadrupole or magnetic-dipole interactions can exist even in centrosymmetric media. These effects are many orders of magnitude weaker and are generally not what is meant when asking if a material exhibits SPDC.\n4.  **Polymorphism:** While the most common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible for a less stable, non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene to exist. However, without evidence of such a phase being stable and fabricable, the expectation for \"boron nanosheets\" in general would be based on the common, stable forms.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe primary requirement for SPDC is the absence of inversion symmetry in the material's crystal lattice. The most stable and well-documented phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Due to this symmetry, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is intrinsically zero. Consequently, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n<<<No, because the common stable phases of boron nanosheets possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.>>>"
