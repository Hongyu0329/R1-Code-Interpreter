    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Problem:** Find a(10), which is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks.\n*   **Lattice:** The walk takes place on a \"Manhattan lattice,\" which is another name for the 2D square grid or integer grid (denoted as Z^2). Points on this lattice have integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **Walk:** A walk is a sequence of moves between adjacent points. A move consists of changing either the x or the y coordinate by Â±1. An n-step walk consists of n such moves, involving n+1 points in total.\n*   **Self-Avoiding:** This is the key constraint. The walk is not allowed to visit any point (vertex) more than once.\n*   **Starting Point:** By convention, all walks start at the origin (0,0).\n\n**2. Careful Points and General Strategy**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The square lattice is highly symmetric. The number of walks that start by moving East (to (1,0)) is the same as the number of walks starting North, West, or South. We can calculate the number for one starting direction and multiply the result by 4.\n*   **Backtracking vs. Self-Intersection:** A self-avoiding walk cannot step on *any* previously visited point. This is stricter than a \"non-backtracking walk,\" which is only forbidden from immediately reversing its last step.\n*   **Complexity Growth:** The number of walks grows exponentially, but there is no simple formula for a(n). The number of choices at each step depends on the entire history of the path, not just the last few moves. Therefore, direct enumeration is required, which becomes computationally intensive very quickly.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation for Small `n`**\n\nLet's compute the first few terms to understand the process.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    Let's begin with one of the 4 first moves, say to (1,0). From (1,0), the neighbors are (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). To be self-avoiding, the walk cannot return to the origin (0,0). This leaves 3 valid choices for the second step. Since there were 4 choices for the first step, the total is:\n    *   a(2) = (choices for step 1) * (choices for step 2) = 4 * 3 = **12**\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Let's continue from the 12 paths of length 2. For any 2-step path, such as (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) or (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1), the three non-backtracking next moves will always lead to a new, unvisited point. You can check that the origin or any other point on the short path cannot be a neighbor of the endpoint (other than the immediate predecessor). Therefore, each of the 12 paths has 3 ways to extend.\n    *   a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = **36**\n\n*   **a(4): The complexity begins**\n    The simple multiplication pattern breaks here. The number of valid next steps now depends on the specific shape of the 3-step walk.\n    *   **Case 1: Straight walk:** e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0). From (3,0), there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   **Case 2: \"S-shaped\" walk:** e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (1,1), (0,2), (-1,1), and (0,0). However, the path has already visited both (1,1) and (0,0). This leaves only 2 valid moves.\n    Because some 3-step walks have 3 continuations and others have only 2, we must perform a full enumeration. This calculation yields:\n    *   **a(4) = 100**\n\n**4. Acquiring the Answer for a(10)**\n\nThe process of direct enumeration becomes overwhelmingly complex for `n=10`. This is a classic hard problem in computational combinatorics. There is no simple closed-form formula. The values have been found using powerful computer algorithms. This sequence is well-known and documented in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nBy referring to these established computational results, we can find the value for a(10).\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n<<<44100>>>"
