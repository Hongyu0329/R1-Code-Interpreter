    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral**\n\nThe two-point Green's function, also known as the propagator, describes the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another. In the path integral formalism for a free (non-interacting) scalar field theory, the **bare Green's function** $G_0(x-y)$ is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of two field operators:\n\n$G_0(x-y) = \\langle 0 | T[\\phi(x) \\phi(y)] | 0 \\rangle$\n\nThis is calculated via the path integral as:\n\n$G_0(x-y) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, \\phi(x) \\phi(y) e^{iS_0[\\phi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{iS_0[\\phi]}}$\n\nwhere $S_0[\\phi]$ is the action for the free theory.\n\n**Step 2: The Free Action and its Operator**\n\nFor a free real scalar field of mass $m$, the action is the integral of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian:\n\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}_0 = \\int d^4x \\, \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi - m^2 \\phi^2)$\n\nBy integrating by parts (and discarding boundary terms), the action can be written in a way that makes the relevant operator explicit:\n\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\int d^4x \\, \\frac{1}{2}\\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 - m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nwhere $\\partial^2 = \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu$ is the d'Alembertian operator. The Green's function $G_0$ is fundamentally the inverse of the operator appearing in this quadratic action. That is, it solves the equation:\n\n$(-\\partial^2 - m^2) G_0(x-y) = -i \\delta^{(4)}(x-y)$\n*(The factor of -i is a convention that arises from the Gaussian integral evaluation)*.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The Green's function is the inverse of the differential operator that defines the particle's free equation of motion (the Klein-Gordon operator in this case).\n\n**Step 3: Transforming to Momentum Space**\n\nSolving this differential equation is much easier in momentum space. We perform a Fourier transform on the fields and the Green's function:\n\n$G_0(x-y) = \\int \\frac{d^4k}{(2\\pi)^4} e^{-ik \\cdot (x-y)} \\tilde{G}_0(k)$\n\nIn momentum space, the differential operator $\\partial_\\mu$ becomes an algebraic multiplication by $-ik_\\mu$. Therefore, the Klein-Gordon operator transforms as:\n\n$-\\partial^2 - m^2 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad -(-ik_\\mu)(-ik^\\mu) - m^2 = k^2 - m^2$\n\nwhere $k^2 = k_\\mu k^\\mu = (k^0)^2 - |\\vec{k}|^2$ is the Lorentz-invariant product of the four-momentum $k^\\mu = (k^0, \\vec{k})$.\n\nThe equation for the Green's function becomes a simple algebraic equation:\n\n$(k^2 - m^2) \\tilde{G}_0(k) = -i$\n\nSolving for the momentum-space Green's function $\\tilde{G}_0(k)$ gives:\n\n$\\tilde{G}_0(k) = \\frac{-i}{k^2 - m^2} = \\frac{-i}{(k^0)^2 - |\\vec{k}|^2 - m^2}$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The Feynman path integral naturally includes a prescription for handling the poles that appear in this expression. This is the Feynman prescription, denoted by \"+iη\" (where η is an infinitesimal positive number), which correctly enforces causality and time ordering. So the proper expression is:\n\n$\\tilde{G}_0(k) = \\frac{i}{k^2 - m^2 + i\\eta}$\n\n**Step 4: Introducing the Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$**\n\nThe single-particle energy eigenvalues, which we denote as $\\epsilon_k$, correspond to the energy of a physical, **on-shell** particle. An on-shell particle satisfies the relativistic energy-momentum relation, which is derived from the condition where the denominator of the propagator vanishes (i.e., its pole).\n\n$k^2 - m^2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (k^0)^2 - |\\vec{k}|^2 - m^2 = 0$\n\nThe energy of a particle with spatial momentum $\\vec{k}$ is the positive solution for $k^0$:\n\n$(k^0)^2 = |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k^0 = \\sqrt{|\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2}$\n\nThis is precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$\\epsilon_k \\equiv \\sqrt{|\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** It is crucial to distinguish between the continuous energy variable $k^0$ (the first component of the off-shell four-momentum $k^\\mu$) and the specific, on-shell energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, which is a function of the spatial momentum $\\vec{k}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Expression for the Functional Dependence**\n\nWe can now express the bare Green's function's denominator in terms of the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. We substitute the definition of $\\epsilon_k^2$ back into the expression for $\\tilde{G}_0(k)$:\n\n$k^2 - m^2 = (k^0)^2 - |\\vec{k}|^2 - m^2 = (k^0)^2 - (|\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2) = (k^0)^2 - \\epsilon_k^2$\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $\\tilde{G}_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ (and the continuous energy variable $k^0$) is:\n\n$\\tilde{G}_0(k^0, \\vec{k}) = \\frac{i}{(k^0)^2 - \\epsilon_k^2 + i\\eta}$\n\nThis expression clearly shows that for a given spatial momentum $\\vec{k}$, the propagator is a function of the square of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The poles of the propagator occur precisely when the energy variable $k^0$ is equal to the on-shell particle energies, $\\pm\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the mathematical expression for the momentum-space bare Green's function, which explicitly shows its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<$\\tilde{G}_0(k^0, \\vec{k}) = \\frac{i}{(k^0)^2 - \\epsilon_k^2 + i\\eta}$>>>"
