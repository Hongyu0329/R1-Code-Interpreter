    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks about a specific detail in a painting: the 1933 self-portrait by German artist Curt Querner.\n\n2.  **Establish the Context:** The crucial piece of information is that the portrait was painted *after* Querner had been arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo. Querner was a member of the Communist Party, and his arrest in March 1933 was part of the Nazi crackdown on political opponents. This context is essential for understanding the symbolism in the artwork.\n\n3.  **Locate the Artwork:** The painting is known as \"Self-Portrait after Imprisonment\" (\"Selbstbildnis nach der Haft\") or \"Self-Portrait with Red Cloth\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\"). Visually, it depicts Querner with a thin, defiant face, looking directly at the viewer.\n\n4.  **Identify the Object in his Hand:** In the lower part of the painting, Querner is clearly holding a small, vibrant red object in his right hand. Art historical sources identify this object as a red carnation.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Symbolism:** The choice of a red carnation is not accidental; it is a deliberate and powerful symbol.\n    *   **Political Affiliation:** The color red is the international color of socialism and communism.\n    *   **Symbol of the Labor Movement:** The red carnation, specifically, was a widely recognized symbol of the socialist labor movement, often worn on May Day (International Workers' Day).\n    *   **Act of Defiance:** For Querner to paint himself holding this symbol immediately after being arrested by the Gestapo for his communist beliefs was an unambiguous act of resistance. It was a declaration that his spirit was not broken and that he stood by his political convictions despite the threat of persecution.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The phrasing \"escaped from Gestapo\"** can be slightly misleading. He was arrested, held for a period, and then released. The \"escape\" was from their immediate control and the psychological trauma of the event, which he channeled into this act of artistic defiance.\n*   **The specific object:** While sometimes described broadly as a \"red flower\" or \"red cloth,\" the most accurate identification is a **red carnation**, which carries the specific historical symbolism of the labor movement.\n*   **The painting's intent:** This is a key work of German art from the period, showcasing an artist using his craft for personal and political expression against a totalitarian regime at its very beginning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy holding a red carnation, Curt Querner used a well-understood political symbol to defiantly reaffirm his commitment to the socialist/communist cause for which he had just been persecuted, turning his self-portrait into a powerful statement of resistance.\n\n<<<a red carnation>>>"
