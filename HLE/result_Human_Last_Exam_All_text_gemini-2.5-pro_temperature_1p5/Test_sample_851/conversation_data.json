    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of the 32 crystal point groups. The question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously: they must be achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Conditions:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active (i.e., to rotate the plane of polarized light) is that its structure must be non-centrosymmetric. A center of symmetry (inversion center, `-1`) forbids optical activity. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups out of the 32.\n    *   **Achiral:** An object or structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, a point group is achiral if it contains any rotoinversion operation (`-n`). This includes a center of inversion (`-1`) and a mirror plane (`-2` is equivalent to a mirror plane `m`). The point groups that do *not* contain any rotoinversion operations are called chiral or enantiomorphic. There are 11 chiral point groups. The question requires **achiral** classes, so we must exclude the 11 chiral groups.\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have any unique polar axes. A polar axis is a direction in the crystal whose two ends are not related by any symmetry operation of the point group. Polar crystals exhibit properties like pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity. There are 10 polar point groups. The question requires **non-polar** classes, so we must exclude these 10 groups.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Set of Crystal Classes:**\n    We need to find the crystal classes that are the intersection of three sets: {Non-centrosymmetric} ∩ {Achiral} ∩ {Non-polar}.\n\n    Let's list the point groups based on these properties:\n    *   **Centrosymmetric (11 groups):** `-1, 2/m, mmm, -3, 4/m, 6/m, -3m, 4/mmm, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m`. These are achiral and non-polar, but because they have a center of symmetry, they are **not optically active**. So, this set is excluded.\n    *   **Chiral (11 groups):** `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`. These are all optically active (as they are non-centrosymmetric), but they are **chiral**. The question specifies **achiral** classes. So, this set is also excluded.\n    *   **Achiral and Non-centrosymmetric (10 groups):** This is the remaining set. These are `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -6, -42m, -62m, -43m`. By definition, these are all achiral and optically active. Now we must apply the final condition: they must be **non-polar**.\n        *   The polar point groups are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n        *   From our set of 10 Achiral/Non-centrosymmetric groups, we must remove the ones that are polar. The polar ones in this list are `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n        *   The remaining groups are ` -4, -6, -42m, -62m, -43m`.\n\n    Therefore, the set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is **{-4, -6, -42m, -62m, -43m}**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    Now we check which of the provided answer choices consists of classes from our derived set.\n\n    *   **A. m and mm2:** Both `m` and `mm2` are polar. Incorrect.\n    *   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** All three of these classes (`-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`) are in our correct set of five. This is a valid choice.\n    *   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** `3m` and `6mm` are polar. (`4m` is usually written as `4mm`, which is also polar). Incorrect.\n    *   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` are in our correct set of five. This is also a valid choice.\n    *   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral classes. Incorrect.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    We are left with two choices, B and D, both of which contain only correct crystal classes. In such a situation, we must look for a reason to prefer one over the other. The five classes in our solution set exhibit distinct optical activity behaviors:\n    *   Optical activity is observable *only* along the optic axis: `-4`, `-6`.\n    *   Optical activity is *forbidden* along the optic axis but observable in other directions: `-42m`, `-62m`.\n    *   Optical activity is isotropic (the same in all directions): `-43m` (as it is a cubic class).\n\n    Let's examine the choices in this light:\n    *   Choice D, `{-4, -42m}`, contains one example from the first category and one from the second.\n    *   Choice B, `{-6, -62m, -43m}`, contains one example from each of the three distinct categories.\n\n    Because choice B provides a more comprehensive and representative sample of the different physical phenomena associated with optical activity in achiral, non-polar crystals, it is the better and likely intended answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Optical Activity vs. Chirality:** While optical activity is most famously associated with chiral molecules and crystals, it is fundamentally a property of non-centrosymmetric media. This means some achiral crystals can exhibit it.\n*   **Definitions:** Be precise with the definitions of chiral, achiral, polar, non-polar, and centrosymmetric in the context of crystallography.\n*   **Systematic Elimination:** Methodically eliminating groups that do not meet each criterion is the safest way to arrive at the correct set.\n*   **Ambiguous Multiple Choice:** When more than one answer choice appears correct, look for a deeper physical or pedagogical reason why one might be considered \"best\" or \"most complete.\" In this case, the diversity of physical behaviors represented by the classes in choice B makes it superior.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis systematically identified the set of achiral, non-polar, optically active crystal classes as `{-4, -6, -42m, -62m, -43m}`. Both options B and D are subsets of this set. Option B provides a more diverse representation of the physical phenomena, including examples from uniaxial crystals with activity on the optic axis (`-6`), uniaxial crystals with activity off the optic axis (`-62m`), and isotropic crystals (`-43m`). This makes it the most comprehensive correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
