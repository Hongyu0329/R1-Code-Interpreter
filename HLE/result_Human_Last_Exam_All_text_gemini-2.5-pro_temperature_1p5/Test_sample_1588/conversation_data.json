    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an explicit expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^X e^Y = e^Z$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (typically operators or matrices). The formula expresses $Z$ as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree (or order) $n$. The order of a term is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it.\n\n*   **Order 1:** $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   **Order 2:** $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   **Order 3:** $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]]$\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. The Connection to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe set of all formal linear combinations of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$ forms a mathematical structure called the **free Lie algebra** on two generators, denoted $L(X, Y)$. This algebra is graded by the degree of the commutators:\n\n$L(X, Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\\infty} L_n$\n\nwhere $L_n$ is the subspace of all homogeneous Lie polynomials (commutators) of degree $n$. The term $Z_n(X, Y)$ from the BCH expansion is an element of this subspace $L_n$.\n\n**3. Interpreting the Question: \"Number of Nonzero Coefficients\"**\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This is equivalent to asking for the number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10. It is a known property of the BCH formula that every basis element of the free Lie algebra subspace $L_n$ has a non-zero coefficient in the expansion $Z_n$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the **dimension of the subspace $L_{10}$** for the free Lie algebra generated by two elements ($X$ and $Y$).\n\n**4. Using Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by **Witt's formula**:\n\n$\\dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the order (degree), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 ($X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**5. Applying Witt's Formula for Order 10**\n\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   $n = 10$\n    *   $k = 2$\n\n*   **Divisors of n=10:**\n    *   The positive divisors $d$ of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n*   **Values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = \\mu(2)\\mu(5) = (-1)(-1) = 1$ (since 10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [988 + 2]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = 99$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct Interpretation:** The key is realizing that \"number of nonzero coefficients\" refers to the dimension of the underlying vector space of commutators, not the specific values of the coefficients themselves.\n2.  **Möbius Function:** A correct calculation of the Möbius function for each divisor is crucial.\n3.  **Arithmetic Precision:** Standard arithmetic errors in calculating powers or the final sum can lead to an incorrect result. A useful check is that the sum inside the bracket must be divisible by $n$. In our case, 990 is divisible by 10, which provides confidence in the result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th-grade component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is calculated to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
