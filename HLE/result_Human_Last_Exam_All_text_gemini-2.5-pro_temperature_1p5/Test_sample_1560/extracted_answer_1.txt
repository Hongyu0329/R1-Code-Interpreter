After applying gate Q to the first ququint of the entangled pair and measuring it, the system will probabilistically collapse into one of five possible final states. The outcomes are as follows:
- With probability 1/5, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/5, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 3/10, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/5, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/10, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
