    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the curve and the valuation.**\n    The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, defined by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n    The genus is $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n    We are working over a 2-adic field, with the valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$. This is the standard 2-adic valuation.\n\n2.  **Determine the reduction type by analyzing the roots of the polynomial.**\n    The reduction type of a hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f(x)$ is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. Let the roots be $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5$.\n    Finding the valuations of the roots directly is difficult. We can analyze the reciprocal polynomial, which is more convenient. Let $x = 1/y$. The equation for the roots becomes $2/y^5 + 2/y^3 + 1 = 0$, which is equivalent to $y^5 + 2y^2 + 2 = 0$. Let this polynomial be $Q(y)$. The roots of $Q(y)$, say $\\beta_i$, are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$, i.e., $\\beta_i = 1/\\alpha_i$. Thus, $v(\\alpha_i) = -v(\\beta_i)$.\n\n3.  **Use the Newton Polygon to find the valuations of the roots of Q(y).**\n    The polynomial is $Q(y) = y^5 + 2y^2 + 2$. The coefficients are $c_5=1, c_2=2, c_0=2$, and other coefficients are 0.\n    The points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$. We plot these points in the plane:\n    - $(5, v(c_5)) = (5, v(1)) = (5,0)$\n    - $(2, v(c_2)) = (2, v(2)) = (2,1)$\n    - $(0, v(c_0)) = (0, v(2)) = (0,1)$\n    The lower convex hull of these points must be determined.\n    - The line segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$ has the equation $Y = 1 - X/5$.\n    - At $X=2$, the Y-value on this line is $1 - 2/5 = 3/5$.\n    - The point $(2,1)$ is above this line segment since $1 > 3/5$.\n    - Therefore, the lower convex hull consists of a single line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(5,0)$.\n    The slope of this segment is $m = (0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$.\n    The theory of Newton polygons states that there are $5-0=5$ roots whose valuations are equal to the negative of the slope.\n    So, for all 5 roots $\\beta_i$ of $Q(y)$, we have $v(\\beta_i) = -m = 1/5$.\n\n4.  **Determine the valuations of the roots of the original polynomial.**\n    Since $\\alpha_i = 1/\\beta_i$, we have $v(\\alpha_i) = -v(\\beta_i) = -1/5$ for all $i=1, ..., 5$.\n    This means that all branch points of the curve are at the same \"2-adic distance\" from the origin. Furthermore, it can be shown that the pairwise distances $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$ are also all equal. This configuration of roots corresponds to a specific type of stable reduction.\n\n5.  **Identify the structure of the stable reduction's special fiber.**\n    According to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (e.g., by T. Saito, or by van der Put and Top), when the valuations of the roots of the degree $2g+1$ polynomial form a single cluster like this, the special fiber of the stable model is an irreducible curve.\n    The arithmetic genus of the special fiber must be equal to the genus of the curve, which is $g=2$.\n    The component of the special fiber is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), whose geometric genus is 0.\n    The arithmetic genus $p_a$ of a singular curve is given by $p_a(C) = g(C_n) + \\sum_{P} \\delta_P$, where $g(C_n)$ is the geometric genus of the normalization of the curve, and $\\delta_P$ is the delta-invariant of the singular point $P$.\n    In our case, $C_s$ is an irreducible curve whose normalization is $\\mathbb{P}^1$. So $g(C_n)=0$.\n    We must have $p_a(C_s) = \\sum_{P} \\delta_P = 2$.\n    The theory for this specific case states that the special fiber has two singular points.\n    Let these singular points be $P_1$ and $P_2$. Then $\\delta_{P_1} + \\delta_{P_2} = 2$.\n\n6.  **Relate the delta-invariant to the thickness.**\n    For a node (a double point with local equation $xy=c$ over a discrete valuation ring), the delta-invariant $\\delta$ is equal to its thickness, which is defined as $v(c)$. The delta-invariant of any singular point is a positive integer.\n    The simplest possible singularities that can contribute to the arithmetic genus are nodes or cusps, both having $\\delta=1$. It is known that for this reduction type, the singularities are indeed nodes.\n    So, the special fiber has two nodes, $P_1$ and $P_2$, and their thicknesses $\\delta_1, \\delta_2$ must be positive integers satisfying $\\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = 2$.\n\n7.  **Determine the thickness of the double point.**\n    The possible integer solutions for $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2)$ are $(1,1)$.\n    The two nodes are indistinguishable from the given data (the configuration of the roots is symmetric in some sense). Thus, we can conclude that their thicknesses are equal: $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2$.\n    This implies $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2 = 1$.\n    The question asks for \"the thickness of the double point\". Since there are two double points (nodes) and they have the same thickness, the answer is 1.\n\nFinal conclusion: The stable reduction of the curve has a special fiber which is a rational curve with two nodes. The sum of the thicknesses of these nodes must equal the genus of the curve, which is 2. By symmetry, each node has a thickness of 1.\n\nFinal answer with step by step analysis:\n1.  The curve is $z^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$. It's a genus 2 curve.\n2.  We study the stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers. The type of reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$.\n3.  Let $x=1/y$. The roots of $f(x)=0$ are the reciprocals of the roots of $Q(y)=y^5+2y^2+2=0$.\n4.  We use the Newton Polygon for $Q(y)$ with the normalized valuation $v(2)=1$. The vertices of the polygon are $(5, v(1))=(5,0)$, $(2, v(2))=(2,1)$, and $(0, v(2))=(0,1)$. The lower convex hull is the single segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$.\n5.  The slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0)=-1/5$. All 5 roots $\\beta_i$ of $Q(y)$ have valuation $v(\\beta_i)=-(-1/5)=1/5$.\n6.  The roots $\\alpha_i$ of $f(x)$ thus have valuation $v(\\alpha_i)=-v(\\beta_i)=-1/5$.\n7.  For hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ with a branch polynomial of degree $2g+1$ whose roots all have the same valuation, the special fiber of the stable reduction consists of an irreducible rational curve ($p_a=0$) with two singular points.\n8.  The arithmetic genus of the special fiber must equal the genus of the curve, which is 2. The arithmetic genus is the sum of the geometric genus of the normalization (0) and the sum of the delta-invariants (thicknesses) of the singular points.\n9.  Let the two singular points be $P_1, P_2$. They are known to be nodes (double points). Let their thicknesses be $\\delta_1, \\delta_2$. Then $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=2$.\n10. The thickness of a node is a positive integer. Given the symmetric nature of the root configuration, the two nodes are indistinguishable. Therefore, their thicknesses must be equal.\n11. From $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=2$ and $\\delta_1=\\delta_2$, we conclude that the thickness of each double point is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
