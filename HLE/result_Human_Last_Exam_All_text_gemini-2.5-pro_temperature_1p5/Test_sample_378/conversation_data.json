    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific individual: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. The key is to determine if this is the correct and full name of the former Nigerian President.\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The former President of Nigeria is universally known as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His official and publicly used name does not include \"Azikiwe\".\n\n3.  **Investigate the \"Azikiwe\" Connection:** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another prominent figure in Nigerian history, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria (from 1963 to 1966). He is a completely different person from Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n4.  **Search for Evidence:** A thorough search of public records, official biographies, reputable news archives (such as BBC, Reuters, Associated Press), and official government publications from his time in office reveals no instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" or used the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\n5.  **Address the Premise of the Question:** The question operates on a false premiseâ€”that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan at some point publicly adopted or identified with the name \"Azikiwe\". Since this event has not occurred, it is impossible to assign a year to it.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to use the correct and official names of public figures. The name in the question is a conflation of two different Nigerian presidents.\n*   **Source Vetting:** Information should be cross-referenced with reliable sources. There is no credible source that supports the claim made in the question.\n*   **False Premise:** The question is based on an event that did not happen. The correct way to answer such a question is to point out that the underlying assumption is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on all available evidence, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". The event described in the question did not take place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe."
