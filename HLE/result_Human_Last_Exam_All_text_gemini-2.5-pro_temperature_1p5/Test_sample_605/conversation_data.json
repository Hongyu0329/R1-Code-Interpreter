    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Gorenstein toric singularity, such as the one described by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial for a Calabi-Yau link, is the weighted degree of the defining polynomial.\n\nA polynomial `f(z_1, ..., z_n)` is called quasi-homogeneous (or weighted homogeneous) of degree `d` with respect to the weights `(w_1, ..., w_n)` if every monomial term in the polynomial has the same weighted degree `d`. The weighted degree of a monomial `c * z_1^{a_1} * z_2^{a_2} * ... * z_n^{a_n}` is given by the sum `a_1*w_1 + a_2*w_2 + ... + a_n*w_n`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Polynomial and Weights**\n\n*   **Polynomial:** `f(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5) = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`\n*   **Weights:** `(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Weighted Degree of Each Monomial**\n\nWe must check if the polynomial `f` is quasi-homogeneous by calculating the weighted degree for each of its seven monomial terms.\n\n1.  **Term 1:** `z_1^8 z_3`\n    *   Degree = `8 * w_1 + 1 * w_3` = `8 * 22 + 1 * 49` = `176 + 49` = **225**\n\n2.  **Term 2:** `z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3`\n    *   Degree = `4 * w_1 + 3 * w_2 + 1 * w_3` = `4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 1 * 49` = `88 + 87 + 49` = **224**\n\n3.  **Term 3:** `z_1 z_2^7`\n    *   Degree = `1 * w_1 + 7 * w_2` = `1 * 22 + 7 * 29` = `22 + 203` = **225**\n\n4.  **Term 4:** `z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5`\n    *   Degree = `1*w_1 + 1*w_2 + 1*w_3 + 1*w_4 + 1*w_5` = `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75` = **225**\n\n5.  **Term 5:** `z_2 z_3^4`\n    *   Degree = `1 * w_2 + 4 * w_3` = `1 * 29 + 4 * 49` = `29 + 196` = **225**\n\n6.  **Term 6:** `z_4^3 z_5`\n    *   Degree = `3 * w_4 + 1 * w_5` = `3 * 50 + 1 * 75` = `150 + 75` = **225**\n\n7.  **Term 7:** `z_5^3`\n    *   Degree = `3 * w_5` = `3 * 75` = **225**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Results and List Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The polynomial is not strictly quasi-homogeneous. Six of the seven terms have a weighted degree of 225, but the second term, `z_1^4z_2^3z_3`, has a weighted degree of 224.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to define a Calabi-Yau manifold, the degree `d` of the defining quasi-homogeneous polynomial must be equal to the sum of the weights. Let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n    *   Sum of weights = `w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5` = `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75` = **225**.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The fact that the sum of the weights is 225, and almost all terms in the polynomial have a degree of 225, strongly suggests that the intended degree of the polynomial is 225. The discrepancy in the second term is very likely a typographical error in the problem statement. The question asks for the invariant *for the Calabi-Yau Link represented by* this data, implying that we should treat it as such.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\nBased on the analysis, the singularity is intended to be defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree `d = 225`. The Crawley-Nordström invariant is this degree `d`. Therefore, despite the apparent typo, the invariant is determined by the consistent degree of the other terms and the Calabi-Yau condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau link is the intended weighted degree of the defining polynomial. Based on the analysis, this degree is 225.\n\n<<<225>>>"
