    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"BUD\" (Beyond-Use Date) for a \"single dose container ampule\" after it has been \"punctured\" (i.e., opened) within a \"sterile environment.\"\n\n*   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or opened container must not be used. It is assigned based on the potential for microbial contamination and chemical degradation.\n*   **Single-Dose Container Ampule:** This is a crucial detail. An ampule is a sealed glass container designed for a single use. To open it, the glass neck is broken. Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper, an ampule cannot be resealed. It becomes an open system, fully exposed to the surrounding environment.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to a primary engineering control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a compounding aseptic isolator (CAI), which provides an ISO Class 5 or better air quality environment.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Standard**\nThe primary authority for sterile compounding practices and BUDs in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. The analysis will use the rules from the most current version of this chapter.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Relevant Rule in USP <797>**\nUSP <797> has a specific section on handling manufactured products, including single-dose and multiple-dose containers. The chapter makes a critical distinction between a single-dose *vial* (which has a rubber stopper) and a single-dose *ampule*.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Rule for Ampules**\nWhile USP <797> allows a single-dose *vial* that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment to be used for up to 12 hours, the rule for an *ampule* is much stricter.\n\nThe chapter explicitly states that an opened ampule is a completely open system and cannot be protected from contamination once broken. The official guidance is:\n*   An opened ampule must be handled within the ISO Class 5 environment.\n*   Its contents must be used **immediately** to prepare a compounded sterile preparation.\n*   Any unused portion of the solution from the ampule must be **discarded** and not stored for any period.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\nThe term \"immediately\" means there is no permissible storage time for the opened ampule itself. It is opened, the required drug volume is drawn up, the CSP is prepared, and the remaining ampule and its contents are immediately discarded.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Do not confuse the rule for an ampule with the rule for a single-dose vial. A single-dose vial with a stopper can be used for up to 12 hours if kept in the ISO Class 5 environment, but an ampule cannot.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The \"BUD\" in this context is not a length of time for storage. The requirement for immediate use means the ampule itself has no BUD for storage after being opened. The process of opening, using, and discarding it must be one continuous action.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nBased on the explicit guidance in USP <797>, the contents of a single-dose ampule opened in a sterile environment must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no assigned BUD that allows for storage of the opened ampule.\n\n***\n\n<<<The contents must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded. There is no BUD for storing the opened ampule."
