No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical system of Gödel's ontological proof operate in fundamentally different and incommensurable domains. The former is a physical theory describing the behavior of matter and energy using Hilbert spaces and operators, while the latter is a metaphysical argument within modal logic based on axioms about abstract properties. There is no coherent way to translate the concepts of Gödel's proof (like "positive property" or "necessity") into the mathematical objects of quantum mechanics (like state vectors or physical observables).
