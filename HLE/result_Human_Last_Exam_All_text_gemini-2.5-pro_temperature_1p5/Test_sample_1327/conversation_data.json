    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms**\nLet's examine the difference between consecutive terms.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious simple arithmetic or geometric pattern in this sequence of differences.\n\n**Step 3: Explore a multiplicative relationship**\nLet's try to find a pattern of the form `Next Term = k * Previous Term ± Constant`.\nLet's test `k=2`:\n*   2 * 2 = 4. To get 11, we add 7. (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n*   2 * 11 = 22. To get 23, we add 1. (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n*   2 * 23 = 46. To get 51, we add 5. (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n*   2 * 51 = 102. To get 119, we add 17. (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\nThe sequence of added numbers is 7, 1, 5, 17. This does not follow a clear pattern.\n\nLet's test `k=3`:\n*   3 * 2 = 6. To get 11, we add 5. (11 = 3 * 2 + 5)\n*   3 * 11 = 33. To get 23, we subtract 10. (23 = 3 * 11 - 10)\n*   3 * 23 = 69. To get 51, we subtract 18. (51 = 3 * 23 - 18)\n*   3 * 51 = 153. To get 119, we subtract 34. (119 = 3 * 51 - 34)\nThis seems to create a consistent pattern from the third term onwards: `Next Term = 3 * Previous Term - N`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pattern in the subtracted numbers**\nThe sequence of numbers being subtracted is {10, 18, 34, ...}. Let's find the pattern in this new sequence.\nLet's look at the differences between its terms:\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are 8 and 16. This is a clear geometric progression where each difference is twice the previous one (8, 16, ...). We can also express them as powers of 2: 8 = 2³, 16 = 2⁴.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next terms in the patterns**\nThe next difference in the subtracted sequence should be 2⁵ = 32.\nTherefore, the next number to be subtracted is 34 + 32 = 66.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence**\nUsing the rule we found (`Next Term = 3 * Previous Term - N`), the next term in the original sequence will be:\n*   Next Term = 3 * 119 - 66\n*   Next Term = 357 - 66\n*   Next Term = 291\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Multiple patterns can sometimes fit a short sequence. It's important to find a pattern that is simple, logical, and consistent across all terms.\n2.  The chosen pattern (`An = 3*A(n-1) - Bn`) has a very clear and non-arbitrary sub-pattern (`Bn` differences are `2^3, 2^4, ...`), which makes it a strong candidate.\n3.  The calculation must be done accurately. 3 * 119 = 357, and 357 - 66 = 291.\n4.  The final result must match one of the given options. Our result, 291, corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n- Rule: A(n) = 3 * A(n-1) - B(n)\n- B(3)=10, B(4)=18, B(5)=34\n- Differences in B: 18-10=8=2³, 34-18=16=2⁴\n- Next difference in B: 2⁵=32\n- B(6) = 34 + 32 = 66\n- A(6) = 3 * A(5) - B(6) = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
