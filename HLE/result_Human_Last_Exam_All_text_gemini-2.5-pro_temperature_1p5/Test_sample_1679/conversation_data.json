    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must be the *first* one to do so chronologically.\n3.  It must visually depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on-screen.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"\nThis is a crucial point. The \"Luxor Obelisks\" are a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks.\n*   One obelisk remains in its original location, standing in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other obelisk was given to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n\nTherefore, we need to search for a Best Picture winner that features scenes in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners\nWe must go through the list of winners starting from the first award ceremony and check the setting and key scenes of each film.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), *Grand Hotel* (1931/32), and *It Happened One Night* (1934) are set in WWI France, Germany, Berlin, and the US, respectively. None of them feature the specific landmarks in Paris or Luxor.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris. However, it is a biographical drama focused on interiors like courtrooms and offices. It does not feature sweeping scenic shots of Paris landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   ***Gone with the Wind* (1939):** Set in the American South. No obelisk.\n*   ***Rebecca* (1940):** Set in England. No obelisk.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Key Candidates from the 1940s and 1950s\nThis is where films with international settings become more common.\n\n*   ***Casablanca* (1942):** This film is famous for a flashback sequence set in Paris. The montage shows Rick and Ilsa at a cafe, on a boat on the Seine, and driving down the Champs-Élysées towards the Arc de Triomphe. However, the sequence does not include a shot of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** As the title suggests, this film is set entirely in Paris. It culminates in a famous 17-minute ballet sequence. This sequence features elaborate, stylized sets designed to look like famous Parisian locations and paintings. One of the prominent backdrops in this sequence is the Place de la Concorde, with its fountains and the Luxor Obelisk clearly depicted in the center. As a winner from 1951, this is a very strong candidate.\n*   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** The film's protagonist, Phileas Fogg, travels through Paris early in his journey. The film shows him traveling through the Place de la Concorde, with a clear view of the Luxor Obelisk. However, this film won in 1956, five years *after* *An American in Paris*. Therefore, it cannot be the *first*.\n*   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set in Paris, this film also features many Parisian landmarks. However, it won in 1958, making it later than *An American in Paris*.\n\n### Step 5: Consider the Obelisk in Luxor, Egypt\nWe also need to check if any earlier Best Picture winner was set at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Reviewing the list of winners, none of the films that won Best Picture prior to 1951 (such as *Cimarron*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, *Mrs. Miniver*, etc.) are set in Luxor, Egypt. While films like *The Ten Commandments* (1956) were set in ancient Egypt, it did not win Best Picture.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy chronologically examining the Best Picture winners, we find that while several films are set in Paris, the first one to definitively show the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is *An American in Paris* in its celebrated final ballet sequence. No earlier winner features either the Paris or the Egyptian obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
