    "This problem asks us to identify all finite nilpotent groups that have a specific property called \"filled\". Let's break down the problem by defining the terms and analyzing their implications.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A standard group with a finite number of elements. Every finite group has an identity element, which we will denote by `e`.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` are not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. In set notation, this means `S ∩ (S.S) = ∅`, where `S.S = {xy | x ∈ S, y ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (M):** A product-free set `M` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a \"filled group\" if the union of all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets is equal to the entire group `G`. If we denote the collection of all maximal product-free sets of `G` by `\\mathcal{M}`, the condition for `G` being a filled group is:\n    `⋃_{M ∈ \\mathcal{M}} M = G`\n*   **Finite Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the \"Product-Free\" Property**\n\nLet's examine the properties of product-free sets, specifically concerning the identity element `e` of the group `G`.\n\n1.  **Consider the identity element `e`:** By definition of the identity element, `e * e = e`.\n2.  **Consider a product-free set `S`:** By definition, if `x, y ∈ S`, then `xy ∉ S`.\n3.  **Can `e` be in a product-free set?** Let's assume `e` is an element of a product-free set `S`. If we take `x = e` and `y = e`, both are in `S`. Their product is `xy = e*e = e`. The definition of a product-free set requires that this product, `e`, must *not* be in `S`. This leads to a contradiction: `e ∉ S` and `e ∈ S`.\n4.  **Conclusion about the identity element:** Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. The identity element `e` cannot be a member of any product-free set `S`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing Maximal Product-Free Sets**\n\n1.  A maximal product-free set `M` is, first and foremost, a product-free set.\n2.  From Step 2, we know that no product-free set can contain the identity element `e`.\n3.  Therefore, no maximal product-free set `M` can contain the identity element `e`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the \"Filled Group\" Condition**\n\n1.  A group `G` is filled if the union of all its maximal product-free sets equals `G`. Let this union be `U = ⋃_{M ∈ \\mathcal{M}} M`. The condition is `U = G`.\n2.  For the equality `U = G` to hold, every element of `G` must be in `U`. This means every element of `G` must belong to at least one maximal product-free set.\n3.  In particular, the identity element `e` must be in `U` for `G` to be a filled group. So, there must exist at least one maximal product-free set `M` such that `e ∈ M`.\n4.  However, in Step 3, we proved that the identity element `e` can never be a member of any maximal product-free set.\n\n**Step 5: Reaching the Conclusion**\n\n1.  For any non-empty group `G`, the identity element `e` is an element of `G`.\n2.  The union of all maximal product-free sets, `U`, will never contain `e`.\n3.  Therefore, `U` is always a proper subset of `G` (specifically, `U ⊆ G \\ {e}`).\n4.  This means the condition `U = G` can never be satisfied for any non-empty group.\n5.  A finite nilpotent group is, by definition, a non-empty finite group.\n\nTherefore, there are no finite groups (nilpotent or otherwise) that satisfy the definition of a filled group. The only possible exception would be the \"empty group\", which is not a group by standard definitions. The trivial group `G={e}` is not filled because its only maximal product-free set is the empty set `∅`, and their union `∅` is not equal to `{e}`.\n\nThe condition of the group being \"nilpotent\" is extraneous information; the conclusion holds for all non-empty finite groups.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are no finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
