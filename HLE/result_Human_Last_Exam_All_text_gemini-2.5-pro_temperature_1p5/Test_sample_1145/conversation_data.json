    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle within a specific small interval inside a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n*   **System:** A particle in a 1D infinite potential well (a \"box\").\n*   **Box length:** `a` (from `x=0` to `x=a`).\n*   **Quantum state:** The particle is in the second energy level, `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval:** The particle's location is sought between `x1 = 0.495a` and `x2 = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Principles**\n*   **Wave function:** The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position `x` is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2`\n*   **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle in the interval `[x1, x2]` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `P(x1, x2) = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|^2 dx`\n\n**3. Apply the Specifics of the Problem**\n*   For the state `n=2`, the wave function is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n*   The probability density is:\n    `|ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`\n*   The probability integral is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Analyze the Function and the Interval**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Node at the Center.** For `n=2`, the wave function `ψ_2(x)` has a node (a point where the wave function is zero) at the center of the box, `x = a/2`. We can check this: `sin(2π(a/2) / a) = sin(π) = 0`. Consequently, the probability density `|ψ_2(a/2)|^2` is also zero at this point.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Small Interval.** The interval of interest is `[0.495a, 0.505a]`. This interval is centered exactly at the node `x = 0.5a`, and its width `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a` is very small compared to the box length `a`.\n*   **Approximation Strategy:** Since the interval is very small, we can approximate the integral. A simple approximation like `P ≈ |ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 * Δx` would yield `0 * 0.01a = 0`, which is not accurate enough. We need to account for the shape of the `sin^2` function near its minimum. We can use a Taylor expansion of the probability density function around the center of the interval, `x=0.5a`.\n\n**5. Perform the Approximation and Integration**\n*   Let `x = 0.5a + u`, where `u` represents the small displacement from the center of the box. The integration interval for `x` from `0.495a` to `0.505a` corresponds to an interval for `u` from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n*   Substitute `x = 0.5a + u` into the probability density function:\n    `|ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(0.5a + u) / a)`\n    `= (2/a) * sin^2(π + 2πu/a)`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n    `= (2/a) * [-sin(2πu/a)]^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a)`\n*   **Careful Point 3: Small Angle Approximation.** Since `u` is very small, the argument `y = 2πu/a` is also very small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(y) ≈ y`.\n    `|ψ_2(x)|^2 ≈ (2/a) * (2πu/a)^2 = (2/a) * (4π^2u^2 / a^2) = (8π^2 / a^3) * u^2`\n*   Now, we integrate this simplified expression for the probability density over the interval for `u`:\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π^2 / a^3) * u^2 du`\n*   The integral of `u^2` is `u^3 / 3`.\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [u^3 / 3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / (3a^3)) * [(+0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3]`\n    `P ≈ (8π^2 / (3a^3)) * [2 * (0.005a)^3]`\n*   The term `a^3` cancels out, which is expected as the probability must be a dimensionless number.\n    `P ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (0.005)^3`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n*   `P ≈ (16 * π^2 / 3) * (5 x 10^-3)^3`\n*   `P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)^2 / 3) * (125 x 10^-9)`\n*   `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n*   `P ≈ (52.6378) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n*   `P ≈ 65.797 * 10^-7`\n*   `P ≈ 6.58 x 10^-6`\n\nSo, the probability is approximately `0.00000658`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is calculated by integrating the probability density `|ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a)sin^2(2πx/a)` over this interval. Given the small size of the interval centered on a node (where the probability density is zero), an approximation using Taylor expansion is appropriate. This leads to the result: `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (0.005)^3`.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
