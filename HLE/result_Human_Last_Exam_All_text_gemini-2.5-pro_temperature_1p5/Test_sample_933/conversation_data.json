    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for efficient Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) production.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The primary and most common method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is through the direct reaction of its constituent elements, Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the Meaning of \"Efficiently\":** In chemical synthesis, \"efficient\" production means achieving a good balance between:\n    *   **Reaction Rate:** The reaction must proceed at a practical speed. If it's too slow, it's not efficient.\n    *   **Yield and Purity:** The process should produce a high amount of the desired product (XeF4) with minimal byproducts.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of Temperature in this Reaction:**\n    *   Like most chemical reactions, this synthesis requires an initial input of energy to break chemical bonds and overcome the activation energy barrier. This energy is typically supplied as heat.\n    *   **Too Low Temperature:** If the temperature is too low (e.g., room temperature or below), the reactant molecules will not have enough kinetic energy to react upon collision. The reaction rate would be infinitesimally slow, making the process highly inefficient.\n    *   **Too High Temperature:** The formation of XeF4 is an exothermic process. According to Le Chatelier's principle, excessively high temperatures can shift the equilibrium back towards the reactants (Xe and F2), reducing the overall yield. Furthermore, at very high temperatures, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) becomes more favorable, especially with an excess of fluorine. This would reduce the purity and yield of XeF4.\n\n4.  **Determine the Optimal Conditions:**\n    *   To produce different xenon fluorides, chemists carefully control the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants).\n    *   For the synthesis of **XeF4**, the established, standard conditions involve heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to provide excess fluorine) in a sealed nickel container.\n    *   The widely accepted optimal temperature for this reaction to be efficient is **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction rate is sufficiently high, and the production of XeF4 is favored over other fluorides like XeF2 or XeF6.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high and would likely lead to the formation of XeF6 or decomposition of the product, making the synthesis of XeF4 inefficient.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the standard, optimized temperature cited in chemical literature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4. It provides the necessary activation energy for a good reaction rate while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** At 200 °C, the reaction would be significantly slower than at 400 °C. While some product might form over a very long period, it would not be considered an \"efficient\" process.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** At these low temperatures, the thermal reaction rate between xenon and fluorine is negligible. The synthesis is practically non-existent and thus completely inefficient. (Note: Other methods like electric discharge can be used at low temperatures, but they are typically for synthesizing XeF2 and are less selective for XeF4).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the most common and reliable method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride, a temperature of 400 °C is required for the reaction to be efficient. Lower temperatures result in an impractically slow reaction rate. Therefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature listed at which XeF4 can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
