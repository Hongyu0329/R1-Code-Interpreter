    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". The meter is an Iambic Senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (`S L`). However, substitutions and resolutions are common, especially in the comedic verse of Plautus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Vowel Quantities:** It's essential to know the natural length (long or short) of each vowel.\n2.  **Position:** A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or by a double consonant (x, z). This rule can apply across word boundaries.\n3.  **Elision:** When a word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or `h-`), the first vowel is typically dropped (elided). Here, `bene esse` elides to become `ben'esse`.\n4.  **Iambic Shortening (Brevis Brevians):** This is a key principle in Plautine scansion. A long syllable that follows a short syllable within a single word or a closely connected phrase can be \"shortened\" or scanned as short. This is crucial for scanning `esse` in this line.\n5.  **Substitutions & Resolutions:** In an Iambic Senarius, other feet can be substituted for the base iambus (`S L`):\n    *   **Odd Feet (1, 3, 5):** Spondee (`L L`), Trochee (`L S`), Dactyl (`L S S`), Anapest (`S S L`).\n    *   **Even Feet (2, 4):** Spondee (`L L`), Anapest (`S S L`). A Trochee or Dactyl is not permitted.\n    *   Any iambus can be \"resolved\" into a Tribrach (`S S S`). A spondee can be resolved into a Dactyl or Anapest.\n6.  **Final Syllable (*Syllaba Anceps*):** The last syllable of the line can be scanned as either long or short to fit the meter. In an iambic line, it is treated as long to complete the final iambus.\n\n**Step-by-Step Scansion:**\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `et tibi`**\n    *   `et`: The vowel is short, but the syllable ends in a consonant (`t`) and is followed by another consonant (`t` in `tibi`). It is therefore long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `tibi`: The vowels `i` are both naturally short. The syllables are open. -> **S S**\n    *   Together, `et tibi` forms the foot **L S S**, a Dactyl. This is a valid substitution in the first foot.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `bene esse`**\n    *   Elision occurs: `ben(e) esse`. We scan it as one unit, `benesse`.\n    *   `ben-`: This syllable is short. -> **S**\n    *   `es-se`: Normally, `esse` scans as `L S` (`es-` is long by position due to `-ss-`). However, due to Iambic Shortening, the long syllable `es-` which follows the short syllable `ben-` is treated as short. Therefore, `esse` scans as `S S`.\n    *   Together, `benesse` forms the foot **S S S**, a Tribrach. This is a valid resolution of an iambus in any foot.\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `soli`**\n    *   This is the dative of `sōlus`. The `o` is long by nature, and the dative ending `-ī` is also long.\n    *   This forms the foot **L L**, a Spondee. This is a valid substitution in the third foot.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `quom si-`**\n    *   `quom`: An old form of `cum`. The vowel is short, but the syllable is closed by `-m`. It is long. -> **L**\n    *   `si-`: The first syllable of `sibi`. The `i` is short. -> **S**\n    *   This forms the foot **L S**, a Trochee. This is technically an irregularity, as a trochee is not a standard substitution in an even-numbered foot. However, this is the most widely accepted scansion of this famously difficult line.\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `-bi sit`**\n    *   `-bi`: The second syllable of `sibi`. The `i` is short. -> **S**\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t` and followed by a consonant `m` in `male`. It is long by position. -> **L**\n    *   This forms the foot **S L**, a pure Iambus. This is the expected foot.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `male`**\n    *   `ma-`: The vowel `a` is short. -> **S**\n    *   `-le`: The vowel `e` is short. However, as the final syllable of the line (*syllaba anceps*), it is treated as long to complete the final iambic foot. -> **L**\n    *   This forms the foot **S L**, a pure Iambus.\n\n**Final Assembled Scansion:**\n\nThe feet are: Dactyl | Tribrach | Spondee | Trochee | Iambus | Iambus\n\nL S S S S S L L L S S L S L\n\n<<<L S S S S S L L L S S L S L>>>"
