    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question**\n\nThe question asks for a Beatles song that has a specific chord change right at the beginning.\n*   **Artist:** The Beatles\n*   **Starting Point:** The very beginning of the song.\n*   **Chord 1:** The \"tonic\" chord. The tonic is the home chord of a song's key. It is represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key.\n*   **Chord 2:** The \"minor fifth chord\" (the user typed \"fitfh\", which is a typo for \"fifth\").\n\n**Step 2: Analyze \"Minor Fifth Chord\"**\n\nThis term is the most crucial part of the question. In music theory, the \"fifth\" degree of a scale is called the dominant.\n*   A standard chord built on the fifth degree is a major chord (V) or a dominant 7th (V7). For example, in the key of C major, the fifth is G, and the dominant chord is G major.\n*   A \"minor fifth chord\" would therefore be a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (v). In the key of C major, this would be a G minor chord.\n*   So, the question is looking for a song that starts with the progression of `I -> v` (in a major key) or `i -> v` (in a minor key). This is a somewhat uncommon but very distinct-sounding progression.\n\n**Step 3: Examine Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's analyze the openings of famous Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n\n*   \"A Hard Day's Night\": Starts with a famous, complex, dissonant chord. It is not a tonic chord.\n*   \"Help!\": The verse starts A -> C#m -> F#m. In the key of A major, this is I -> iii -> vi. This is not a I -> v progression.\n*   \"Yesterday\": Starts on F major (I). The next chord is Em7. In F major, E is the seventh degree, so this is a I -> vii progression.\n*   \"I Feel Fine\": Starts with a riff over a G major chord (I). The verse progression is G -> C -> G -> D, which is I -> IV -> I -> V. This uses a major fifth (V), not a minor fifth (v).\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the most likely candidate: \"Michelle\"**\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is well-known for its sophisticated and unique chord progression, particularly in the intro and verse.\n\n*   **Key:** The verse of \"Michelle\" is in the key of F minor. Therefore, the tonic chord ('i') is F minor (Fm).\n*   **First Chord:** The verse begins with Paul McCartney singing \"Michelle...\" over an F minor chord. This is our tonic.\n*   **Second Chord:** The next line, \"ma belle...\", is sung over the next chord in the progression. This chord is B-flat minor (Bbm).\n*   **Analysis of the Progression:**\n    *   The first chord is Fm (the tonic, `i`).\n    *   The second chord is Bbm. In the key of F minor, B-flat is the fourth degree of the scale (F-G-Ab-**Bb**-C-Db-Eb). Therefore, the Bbm chord is the minor subdominant, or the `iv` chord.\n    *   The actual progression at the start of the verse is `i -> iv` (tonic minor to subdominant minor).\n\n**Step 5: Reconcile the Analysis with the Question**\n\nThe progression in \"Michelle\" is `i -> iv` (tonic to minor fourth), but the question asks for \"tonic to minor fifth\". While this is a discrepancy, it is the most plausible answer for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Common Confusion:** It is a very common mistake for listeners, even those with some musical knowledge, to confuse the fourth and fifth degrees of a scale (the subdominant and the dominant).\n2.  **Distinctiveness:** The opening `i -> iv` chord change in \"Michelle\" is one of the most memorable and unusual in the entire Beatles catalog. It sets the melancholic, French-inspired mood of the song immediately.\n3.  **Lack of Alternatives:** There is no other famous Beatles song that clearly and immediately jumps from a tonic chord to a minor fifth chord (`I -> v` or `i -> v`). The progression in \"Michelle\" is the closest fit for a song that \"starts with a chord jump from the tonic to a [different] minor chord.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the song the question is referring to is almost certainly \"Michelle,\" with the term \"minor fifth chord\" being a slight misidentification of the minor fourth (subdominant) chord.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
