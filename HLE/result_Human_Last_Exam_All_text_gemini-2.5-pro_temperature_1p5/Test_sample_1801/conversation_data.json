    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** An infamous commercial.\n    *   **Company:** Enron.\n    *   **Year:** 2000.\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **People:** Two Nobel laureates.\n\n2.  **Context of the Commercial:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort by Enron in 2000. The commercials were slickly produced and aimed to portray Enron as an innovative, forward-thinking company that was changing the world. The campaign became \"infamous\" because just a year later, Enron collapsed in one of the largest corporate scandals in history, built on systemic accounting fraud. The irony of a fraudulent company using the tagline \"Ask Why\" was not lost on the public.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** We need to find individuals who are Nobel Prize winners and appeared in this specific ad campaign. Research into Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals a series of television spots featuring various notable figures.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Nobel Laureates:** Among the featured personalities, two economists who are also Nobel laureates are consistently cited as having appeared in the commercials.\n    *   **First Laureate:** Myron Scholes. He appeared in one of the commercials.\n    *   **Second Laureate:** Paul Krugman. He also appeared in a separate commercial as part of the same campaign.\n\n5.  **Verify Their Nobel Laureate Status and Timing:** This is a crucial step for accuracy.\n    *   **Myron Scholes** won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997, along with Robert C. Merton, for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model). Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000.\n    *   **Paul Krugman** won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity. He was not yet a Nobel laureate at the time of the commercial in 2000, but he is one now. The question asks which two Nobel laureates *were featured*, a description that applies to him today. He has since expressed regret for his participation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** A key detail is that only one of the two, Myron Scholes, was a Nobel laureate *at the time* the commercial was made. Paul Krugman received his prize eight years later. However, both individuals are now Nobel laureates who were featured in the campaign, fitting the most common interpretation of the question.\n*   **The Irony:** The primary reason the commercials are \"infamous\" is the stark contrast between the high-minded, intellectual image Enron projected (using respected academics) and the fraudulent reality of its business practices.\n*   **Other Participants:** The campaign also featured other notable individuals who were not Nobel laureates, such as the architect Frank Gehry and the musician John Cale. The question specifically asks for the two laureates.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
