    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    The first step is to find the base health of the boss in the specified game mode. According to Terraria's source data, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of **3,640 HP** in Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria, boss health scales with the number of players present in the world. For Expert Mode, the health is increased by 35% for each player beyond the first one. The formula is:\n    `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\n    Substituting the Eye of Cthulhu's health:\n    `Health(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))` where `n` is the number of players.\n\n3.  **Interpret the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question posits a scenario with an \"infinite number of players.\" If we analyze the formula purely mathematically, as `n` (the number of players) approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\n    `Health(n) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35n) = 2366 + 1274n`\n    `lim (n → ∞) [2366 + 1274n] = ∞`\n    This indicates there is no mathematical maximum.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Theoretical Maximum\" within Game Constraints:**\n    The phrase \"theoretical maximum\" suggests we must consider the technical limitations of the game engine, not just the abstract mathematical formula. A computer program cannot store an infinitely large number. A value such as health is stored in a specific data type, which has a maximum possible value.\n\n5.  **Determine the Game's Data Type Limit for Health:**\n    Terraria is built on the C# programming language. In its source code, the variable used to store NPC health (`life` and `lifeMax`) is a **32-bit signed integer** (`int`). This data type has a strict upper limit.\n\n6.  **Find the Maximum Value of a 32-bit Signed Integer:**\n    The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`. Calculating this gives:\n    `2,147,483,647`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Mode and Boss Specifics:** It is crucial to use the values for Expert Mode and for the correct boss (Eye of Cthulhu). Using Normal Mode values or a different boss's health would lead to an incorrect starting point.\n*   **Player Scaling Factor:** The per-player health scaling factor is different between modes. The 35% (0.35) value is specific to Expert and Master Mode.\n*   **\"Infinite\" vs. Practical Limits:** The term \"infinite players\" is a hypothetical construct meant to push the formula to its limit. It directs us to ignore the practical server limit of 255 players and instead focus on the absolute ceiling imposed by the game's architecture.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Mathematical Maximum:** The key is distinguishing between a mathematical limit (which is infinity in this case) and a theoretical limit within a software system (which is defined by data types). The question is about the latter.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula would increase indefinitely with more players, the game can only represent health up to the maximum value of the data type used to store it. Any calculation exceeding this value would result in an integer overflow. Therefore, the absolute theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu (or any single NPC) can have is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
