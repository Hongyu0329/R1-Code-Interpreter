    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem and Duality Principle**\n    We are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by matrices A and C:\n    x(k+1) = Ax(k)\n    y(k) = Cx(k)\n\n    A = [[1, 1, 0],\n         [2, 1, 1],\n         [0, 2, 0]]\n\n    C = [[0, 1, 0],\n         [1, 1, 0]]\n\n    We need to find the observer canonical form of this system. The method specified is to use duality. The duality principle in control theory states that the properties of observability of a system (A, C) are dual to the properties of controllability of a system (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>).\n    Specifically, transforming a system (A, C) to observer canonical form (A<sub>o</sub>, C<sub>o</sub>) is equivalent to transforming its dual system (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>) to controllable canonical form (A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>) and then taking the transpose of the resulting matrices.\n    -   A<sub>o</sub> = A<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>\n    -   C<sub>o</sub> = B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>\n\n2.  **Define the Dual System**\n    First, we define the dual system (A', B') where A' = A<sup>T</sup> and B' = C<sup>T</sup>.\n    A' = A<sup>T</sup> = [[1, 2, 0],\n                       [1, 1, 2],\n                       [0, 1, 0]]\n\n    B' = C<sup>T</sup> = [[0, 1],\n                       [1, 1],\n                       [0, 0]]\n\n3.  **Check Controllability and Find Controllability Indices**\n    We need to find the transformation matrix P that converts the dual system (A', B') to its controllable canonical form. First, we must check if the system is controllable and determine its controllability indices (μ<sub>i</sub>). The system is controllable if the controllability matrix W<sub>c</sub> has full rank (n=3).\n    W<sub>c</sub> = [B', A'B', (A')<sup>2</sup>B', ...]\n    Let the columns of B' be b'<sub>1</sub> = [0, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup> and b'<sub>2</sub> = [1, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup>.\n\n    A'b'<sub>1</sub> = [[1,2,0],[1,1,2],[0,1,0]] * [0,1,0]<sup>T</sup> = [2,1,1]<sup>T</sup>\n    A'b'<sub>2</sub> = [[1,2,0],[1,1,2],[0,1,0]] * [1,1,0]<sup>T</sup> = [3,2,1]<sup>T</sup>\n\n    To find the indices, we select linearly independent vectors from the sequence [b'<sub>1</sub>, b'<sub>2</sub>, A'b'<sub>1</sub>, A'b'<sub>2</sub>, ...]:\n    -   b'<sub>1</sub> is linearly independent (LI).\n    -   b'<sub>2</sub> is LI with {b'<sub>1</sub>}.\n    -   A'b'<sub>1</sub> is LI with {b'<sub>1</sub>, b'<sub>2</sub>}. det([[0,1,2],[1,1,1],[0,0,1]]) = -1 ≠ 0.\n    We now have 3 LI vectors: {b'<sub>1</sub>, b'<sub>2</sub>, A'b'<sub>1</sub>}.\n    The controllability index μ<sub>i</sub> is the number of vectors selected from the chain of input b'<sub>i</sub>.\n    -   From chain 1 (starting with b'<sub>1</sub>): we have b'<sub>1</sub>, A'b'<sub>1</sub>. So, μ<sub>1</sub> = 2.\n    -   From chain 2 (starting with b'<sub>2</sub>): we have b'<sub>2</sub>. So, μ<sub>2</sub> = 1.\n    The controllability indices are {2, 1}. The sum is 3, which is the order of the system. The dual system is controllable.\n\n4.  **Construct the Transformation Matrix P**\n    The transformation matrix P is constructed using a standard algorithm.\n    a. Form the selection matrix S from the chosen linearly independent vectors, ordered by input index first, then by power of A'.\n       S = [b'<sub>1</sub>, A'b'<sub>1</sub>, b'<sub>2</sub>] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    b. Compute the inverse of S.\n       det(S) = 0 - 2(0 - 0) + 1(1 - 0) = 1.\n       The inverse S<sup>-1</sup> is the adjugate matrix:\n       S<sup>-1</sup> = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]\n    c. Construct the rows of the transformation matrix P. Let the rows be p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>. The last row of each chain of P is taken from the rows of S<sup>-1</sup>.\n       -   The last row of the first chain (length μ<sub>1</sub>=2) is p<sub>2</sub>. It's given by the μ<sub>1</sub>=2<sup>nd</sup> row of S<sup>-1</sup>.\n           p<sub>2</sub> = [0, 0, 1]\n       -   The last row of the second chain (length μ<sub>2</sub>=1) is p<sub>3</sub>. It's given by the (μ<sub>1</sub>+μ<sub>2</sub>)=3<sup>rd</sup> row of S<sup>-1</sup>.\n           p<sub>3</sub> = [1, 0, -2]\n    d. The remaining rows of P are computed. The only one left is p<sub>1</sub>.\n       p<sub>1</sub> = p<sub>2</sub> * A' = [0, 0, 1] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [0, 1, 0]\n    e. Assemble the transformation matrix P:\n       P = [[p<sub>1</sub>], [p<sub>2</sub>], [p<sub>3</sub>]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Controllable Canonical Form**\n    Now we can find the controllable canonical form matrices (A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>). We only need B<sub>c</sub> to find the final answer C<sub>o</sub>.\n    B<sub>c</sub> = P * B'\n    B<sub>c</sub> = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n    B<sub>c</sub> = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n6.  **Determine the Observer Canonical Form Matrix C<sub>o</sub>**\n    The new matrix C for the observer canonical form, C<sub>o</sub>, is the transpose of B<sub>c</sub>.\n    C<sub>o</sub> = B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup> = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n\n    Alternatively, using the transformation T = P<sup>T</sup> for the original system, we get:\n    C<sub>o</sub> = C * T = C * P<sup>T</sup>\n    P<sup>T</sup> = [[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, -2]]\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, -2]]\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n    The result is consistent.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe new matrix C in the observer canonical form is C<sub>o</sub>.\n\nC<sub>o</sub> = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]>>>"
