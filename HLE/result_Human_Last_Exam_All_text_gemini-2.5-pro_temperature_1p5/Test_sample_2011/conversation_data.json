    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms:\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G` that has a vertex set `V` with `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find a single graph `G` with 128 vertices that contains the highest possible number of different clique sizes. For example, if a graph has induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_1`, `K_3`, and `K_5`, but no others, it has 3 different clique sizes. We want to maximize this count.\n\nA careful point to note is the relationship between a \"clique\" and an \"induced subgraph\". By definition, a set of vertices `S` forms a clique if the subgraph induced by `S` is a complete graph. So, finding a \"clique of size `k`\" is the same as finding an \"induced `K_k` subgraph\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Clique Sizes\n\nLet's consider what it means for a graph `G` to have a clique of a certain size.\n\n*   Suppose `G` has a clique of size `k_max`. Let's call the set of vertices in this largest clique `S_max`, where `|S_max| = k_max`.\n*   By definition of a clique, every pair of vertices in `S_max` is connected by an edge.\n*   Now, let's consider any smaller size `j`, where `1 <= j < k_max`. Can we find a clique of size `j` in this graph?\n*   Yes. We can simply choose any subset of `S_max` with `j` vertices. Let's call this subset `S_j`. Since every vertex in `S_max` is connected to every other vertex in `S_max`, it must be true that every vertex in `S_j` is connected to every other vertex in `S_j`.\n*   Therefore, the subgraph induced by `S_j`, which is `G[S_j]`, is a complete graph `K_j`. This means `S_j` is a clique of size `j`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This leads to a crucial insight: If a graph contains a clique of size `k`, it must also contain cliques of all smaller integer sizes `1, 2, ..., k-1`.\n\n### Step 3: Reformulating the Problem\n\nBased on the insight from Step 2, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is not just some arbitrary collection of numbers. It will always be a continuous sequence of integers starting from 1, up to the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nLet `ω(G)` be the **clique number** of the graph `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\nThe set of all different clique sizes that appear in `G` as induced subgraphs is `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore simply `ω(G)`.\n\nThe original question can now be reformulated as:\n\"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on 128 vertices?\"\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Reformulated Problem\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible size of a clique in a graph with `n=128` vertices.\n\n*   A clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices.\n*   Since our graph has only 128 vertices in total, it is impossible to form a clique of a size larger than 128. So, for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, `ω(G) <= 128`.\n*   Now we must ask if it's possible to actually achieve this maximum. Can we construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices where `ω(G) = 128`?\n*   Yes. The complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`, is such a graph. In `K_{128}`, all 128 vertices are connected to each other. The entire set of 128 vertices forms a single large clique.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible clique number is 128.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe graph that maximizes the number of different clique sizes is the complete graph `K_{128}`.\nIn `K_{128}`:\n*   The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128.\n*   Any subset of 127 vertices forms a clique of size 127.\n*   Any subset of 126 vertices forms a clique of size 126.\n*   ...\n*   Any subset of 1 vertex forms a clique of size 1.\n\nThus, the graph `K_{128}` contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. The number of different clique sizes is 128. No graph on 128 vertices can have a clique of size 129 or more, so this is the maximum possible number.\n\nThe final answer is the total count of these different sizes.\n\n<<<128>>>"
