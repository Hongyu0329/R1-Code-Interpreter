    "An analysis of the question, with careful points and a step-by-step derivation of the answer, is provided below.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Objective:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A \"spectral volume\" is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). For each pixel (x,y) in the scene, we want to know its full light spectrum.\n    *   \"From a single image\" means this is a \"snapshot\" technique. We capture all the necessary information in one exposure on a 2D sensor.\n*   **Method:** \"Computed Tomography\" (CT).\n    *   CT is a mathematical reconstruction technique used to create a 3D representation of an object from a series of its 2D projections taken from different viewing angles.\n*   **Tool:** \"Diffraction Gratings\".\n    *   Diffraction gratings are optical components that split and diffract light into several beams traveling in different directions. The direction of these beams depends on the wavelength of the light, which is how spectral information is encoded.\n*   **Core Question:** What is the *minimum number* of gratings needed to make this process work?\n\n**2. Linking the Concepts: Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**\n\nThe technique described is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Here’s how it works:\n\n*   The 3D data cube (x, y, λ) of the scene is the \"object\" we want to reconstruct.\n*   The 2D image captured by the camera sensor is the \"projection\".\n*   The diffraction grating system acts as the \"projector\". It takes the 3D data cube and maps, or projects, it onto the 2D sensor plane.\n*   The reconstruction algorithm then inverts this process, using the single 2D sensor image to rebuild the original 3D data cube.\n\n**3. Careful Points & Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Point 1: The Problem of Dimensionality.** We are trying to recover a 3D object (the x, y, λ cube) from a 2D measurement (the sensor image). This is only possible if the 2D image contains cleverly encoded information about the third dimension (λ).\n\n*   **Step A: Consider using 1 diffraction grating.**\n    *   A single one-dimensional (1D) grating will disperse light along one axis. For example, if the grating lines are vertical, it will spread the spectrum of each point source horizontally.\n    *   On the 2D sensor, this creates a central, undispersed (0th order) image of the scene, plus a series of dispersed (1st order, 2nd order, etc.) images smeared out along a single line (horizontally, in our example).\n    *   **Analogy to standard CT:** This is like trying to reconstruct a 3D patient model by only taking X-ray images from the front. You would get information about front-to-back density, but you would have no information from the sides, top, or any other angle.\n    *   **Conclusion for 1 grating:** A single set of projections along one axis is insufficient information to solve the reconstruction problem robustly. The problem is mathematically \"ill-posed,\" meaning a unique and stable solution for the 3D cube cannot be found. Therefore, 1 grating is not enough.\n\n*   **Step B: Consider using 2 diffraction gratings.**\n    *   To get a well-posed problem, CT requires projections from multiple, distinct angles. In CTIS, this means we need to disperse light in more than one direction.\n    *   The simplest way to achieve this is to use a second 1D grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first one (e.g., at a 90-degree angle). These two gratings can be combined into a single component called a 2D or \"crossed\" grating.\n    *   This 2D grating disperses light into a two-dimensional grid pattern on the sensor. You get the central (0,0) order image, plus orders dispersed horizontally ((±1,0), (±2,0)...), vertically ((0,±1), (0,±2)...), and diagonally ((±1,±1), (±1,±2)...).\n    *   **Analogy to standard CT:** This is like taking X-rays from the front *and* from the side. Now you have two orthogonal sets of projection data, which provides enough information to begin reconstructing the 3D object.\n    *   **Conclusion for 2 gratings:** This 2D pattern of dispersed images provides a rich set of projections from different effective \"angles,\" making the reconstruction problem well-posed. The CT algorithm can use this information to successfully reconstruct the 3D spectral data cube. This is the standard configuration for a CTIS instrument.\n\n*   **Step C: Consider using more than 2 gratings.**\n    *   Could we use 3 or more gratings (e.g., oriented at 0, 60, and 120 degrees)? Yes. This would provide even more projections, which can reduce artifacts and improve the quality of the final reconstructed data cube.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *minimum* number necessary to construct the volume. The leap from an ill-posed problem (1 grating) to a solvable problem (2 gratings) is the critical step. Two gratings (or a single 2D grating element) are the minimum requirement to enable the principle of tomographic reconstruction in this context.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nTo reconstruct a 3D spectral volume using computed tomography, one needs projections along at least two distinct axes. This requires a minimum of two 1D diffraction gratings oriented orthogonally to each other.\n\n<<<B>>>"
