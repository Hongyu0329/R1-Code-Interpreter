    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\nThe question asks to identify the specific range of verses (*abyat*, singular: *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the Prophets of Islam.\n\n**2. Identifying the Poem and its Structure**\nThe poem is *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* (The Creed of the Laymen), a famous didactic poem that summarizes the foundational beliefs of the Ash'ari school of Sunni theology. It is structured to be memorized easily and covers topics like the attributes of Allah, the Prophets, the Angels, the Divine Books, and the Last Day. The section on the Prophets includes an obligation to know the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an.\n\n**3. Locating the Relevant Section**\nTo find the verses, we must scan the poem for the enumeration of the Prophets' names. The poem typically has around 57 verses. The section on the Prophets begins after the discussion of Allah's attributes.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Verses (Step by Step)**\n\n*   **Bayt 29 (The Introduction to the List):**\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"The details of twenty-five are binding, upon every accountable person, so verify and take benefit.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse serves as an introduction. It states the *number* of prophets whose names must be known (25) but does not begin listing their names. Therefore, it is the preamble to the list, not the start of the list itself.\n\n*   **Bayt 30 (The Beginning of the List):**\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n    > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the **first verse** that explicitly mentions the names of the Prophets, starting with Prophet Adam (عليه السلام).\n\n*   **Bayt 31 (Continuation of the List):**\n    > لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا\n    > يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Translation:** \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed their path.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse continues the enumeration of the Prophets' names.\n\n*   **Bayt 32 (Continuation of the List):**\n    > شُعَيْبٌ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n    > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman who followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse continues the list further.\n\n*   **Bayt 33 (The End of the List):**\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n    > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (the seal), leave misguidance.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the **final verse** that mentions the names of the Prophets, concluding with Prophet 'Isa (Jesus) and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them all), who is referred to by the title \"Taha\" and described as the \"Khatim\" (the Seal).\n\n*   **Bayt 34 (The Conclusion of the Section):**\n    > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n    > وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, as long as the days last.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse is a supplication (a prayer of peace and blessings) for all the prophets mentioned. It does not contain any of their names and comes *after* the list is completed.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguishing the Introduction:** Bayt 29 introduces the topic but doesn't list the names. The question asks from which *bayt* the *names are mentioned*, which starts from Bayt 30.\n2.  **Identifying the First Verse:** The listing of names begins definitively in Bayt 30 with \"Hum Ādamun...\" (They are Adam...).\n3.  **Identifying the Last Verse:** The listing concludes in Bayt 33 with the mention of \"'Isa wa Taha...\".\n4.  **Understanding \"Taha\":** The name \"Taha\" (طه) in Bayt 33 is a title used to refer to the final Prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ), derived from the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n5.  **Excluding the Concluding Supplication:** Bayt 34 is a concluding prayer and is not part of the enumeration of names.\n6.  **Verse Numbering:** The verse numbering (29-34) used here is the most common and standard one found in widely circulated prints and commentaries of the poem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from **Bayt 30** to **Bayt 33** in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
