The product is a tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reaction opens the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene skeleton and forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C5 of the norbornene moiety and C2 of the cyclopentenyl substituent. The final structure contains a ketone at the C2 position and a new double bond at the C1-C6 position of the original norbornene system. The TBS silyl ether and the dimethyl ketal protecting groups remain unchanged.
