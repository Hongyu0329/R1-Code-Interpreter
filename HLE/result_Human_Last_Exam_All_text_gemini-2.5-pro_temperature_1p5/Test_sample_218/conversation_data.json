    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined by a partition of $n$. Let $\\lambda$ be a partition of $n=25$. The dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. We want to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nThe dimensions of irreps are smallest for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\". These correspond to partitions that are \"close to the edge\" of the poset of partitions. We can classify these partitions by the size of their first part, $\\lambda_1$. Let $k = n - \\lambda_1$. This means $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$ and its parts are no larger than $n-k$. The number of boxes outside the first row is $k$.\n\nSimilarly, partitions with a large number of parts (i.e., a large first part of the conjugate partition, $\\lambda'_1$) also have small dimensions. These are the conjugate partitions of the ones we consider. Since $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$, we can count the partitions of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$ and multiply by 2, making sure to handle self-conjugate partitions separately (though none will appear in our list of qualifying partitions).\n\nWe will systematically analyze partitions based on the value of $k$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze for k=0**\n- The only partition of 0 is the empty partition. So $\\mu=()$.\n- $\\lambda = (25)$. The Young diagram is a single row. The dimension is $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n- Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, which also has dimension $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n- Both are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=0: 2**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze for k=1**\n- The only partition of 1 is (1). So $\\mu=(1)$.\n- $\\lambda = (24,1)$. The dimension is $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$.\n- Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension.\n- Both are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=1: 2**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze for k=2**\n- Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n- For $\\mu=(2)$, $\\lambda=(23,2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n- For $\\mu=(1,1)$, $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$. $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = \\frac{24 \\times 23}{2} = 276$. (using the formula for hook shapes $d_{(n-k,1^k)}=\\binom{n-1}{k}$).\n- Both dimensions and those of their conjugates are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=2: 2 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 4**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze for k=3**\n- Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1). $p(3)=3$.\n- $\\lambda=(22,3): d = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n- $\\lambda=(22,2,1): d = 4025$.\n- $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1): d = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n- All are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=3: 3 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 6**\n\n**Step 5: Analyze for k=4**\n- Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1). $p(4)=5$.\n- $\\lambda=(21,4): d = 10350$.\n- $\\lambda=(21,3,1): d = 31350$.\n- $\\lambda=(21,2,2): d = 21000$.\n- $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1): d = 31625$.\n- $\\lambda=(21,1^4): d = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$.\n- All are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=4: 5 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 10**\n\n**Step 6: Analyze for k=5**\n- Partitions of 5 are (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1^5). $p(5)=7$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,5): d = 40480$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,4,1): d = 164220$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,3,2): d = 218500$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1): d = 41580$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1): d = 209000$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1): d = 168245$.\n- $\\lambda=(20,1^5): d = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$.\n- All are < 500,000.\n- **Count for k=5: 7 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 14**\n\n**Step 7: Analyze for k=6**\n- There are $p(6)=11$ partitions of 6.\n- $\\lambda=(19,6): d=123,970$ (< 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,5,1): d=632,500$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,4,2): d=1,155,440$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,4,1,1): d=1,131,130$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,3,3): d=644,025$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,3,2,1): d=2,580,600$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,3,1,1,1): d=436,270$ (< 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,2,2,2): d=483,000$ (< 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,2,2,1,1): d=808,025$ (> 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,2,1,1,1,1): d=199,975$ (< 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(19,1^6): d=\\binom{24}{6}=134,596$ (< 500k).\n- There are 5 such partitions.\n- **Count for k=6: 5 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 10**\n\n**Step 8: Analyze for k=7**\n- There are $p(7)=15$ partitions of 7.\n- $\\lambda=(18,7): d = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303,600$ (< 500k).\n- $\\lambda=(18,1^7): d=\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$ (< 500k).\n- For other partitions $\\mu$ of 7, the dimension $d_{(18, \\mu)}$ is significantly larger. For instance, $d_{(18,6,1)}$ is over 1.8 million. It is safe to conclude only the hook-shaped partitions work for k=7.\n- **Count for k=7: 2 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 4**\n\n**Step 9: Analyze for k=8**\n- $\\lambda=(17,8): d = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$ (> 500k).\n- Since the dimension for the \"outermost\" partition for k=8 is already too large, all other partitions for $k=8$ and any partitions for $k>8$ will have even larger dimensions.\n- **Count for k>=8: 0**\n\n**Step 10: Final Count**\nSumming up the counts from each value of $k$:\nTotal irreps = (count for k=0) + (k=1) + (k=2) + (k=3) + (k=4) + (k=5) + (k=6) + (k=7)\nTotal irreps = 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 4 = 52.\n\nNone of the counted partitions are self-conjugate, so multiplying by 2 for the conjugate partition is correct in all cases.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n2 + 2 = 4\n4 + 4 = 8\n8 + 6 = 14\n14 + 10 = 24\n24 + 14 = 38\n38 + 10 = 48\n48 + 4 = 52.\n\nThe number of irreducible representations of $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000 is 52."
