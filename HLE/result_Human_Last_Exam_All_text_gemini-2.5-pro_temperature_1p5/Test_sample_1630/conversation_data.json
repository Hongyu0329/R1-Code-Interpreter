    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem and the properties of the functions.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be two polynomials of degree 3.\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$ be the composition of these two polynomials.\nWe want to find the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$. A fixed point is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n*   Since $f'(x) > 0$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n*   Since $g'(x) > 0$, the function $g(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n\nLet's analyze the derivatives.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\nThen $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For this quadratic to be always positive, the parabola must open upwards ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and it must not have real roots (discriminant must be negative). The discriminant is $\\Delta_{f'} = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) = 4b^2 - 12ac < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 < 3ac$.\nSimilarly, for $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the composite function and the fixed-point equation.**\nThe function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe fixed points are the real solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the real roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$.\nSince $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the maximum possible number of roots.**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\nTherefore, the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\nThis means that the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if this maximum number is achievable under the given constraints.**\nThe question now is whether it's possible to find polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions ($f'>0, g'>0$) and for which $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem. The equation $f(g(x))=x$ can be viewed as a system of two equations:\n1.  $y = g(x)$\n2.  $f(y) = x$\n\nGraphically, we are looking for the number of intersection points of the two curves defined by these equations in the Cartesian plane.\nThe equation $y=g(x)$ represents the graph of the cubic polynomial $g$.\nThe equation $x=f(y)$ also represents a cubic curve. It's the graph of a cubic polynomial in $y$.\n\nBy Bézout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves of degrees $m$ and $n$ is at most $mn$, unless they share a common component. Here, both curves have degree 3. So the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ ensure that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. This means the curve $y=g(x)$ is the graph of a strictly increasing function, and the curve $x=f(y)$ is the graph of a function $y = f^{-1}(x)$, which is also strictly increasing. These conditions constrain the shapes of the curves but do not fundamentally change the maximum number of possible intersections.\n\nIt is a known result in mathematics that this maximum of 9 intersections can be achieved. One can construct examples of two cubic curves that intersect at 9 distinct points. For instance, the system $y = x^3 - cx$ and $x = y^3 - cy$ has 9 solutions for certain values of $c$. These specific polynomials do not satisfy the positive derivative condition. However, one can perturb these polynomials (e.g., by adding a carefully chosen linear term $kx$ with a large $k$) to make their derivatives positive everywhere, while preserving the existence of 9 real solutions by continuity of roots.\n\nTherefore, since the degree of the resulting polynomial equation is 9, and there are no further constraints that reduce this number, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n**Summary of the careful points:**\n1.  The degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n2.  The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of the 9th-degree polynomial $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n3.  A 9th-degree polynomial has at most 9 real roots. This provides the upper bound.\n4.  The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ mean the functions are strictly increasing. This is a crucial property, but it does not reduce the maximum number of fixed points. An increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times (e.g., consider $h(x)$ that wiggles around the line $y=x$).\n5.  Viewing the problem as intersections of two cubic curves $y=g(x)$ and $x=f(y)$ confirms the maximum of 9 intersections via Bézout's theorem.\n6.  The achievability of 9 fixed points under the given conditions is a non-trivial fact but is known to be true.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
