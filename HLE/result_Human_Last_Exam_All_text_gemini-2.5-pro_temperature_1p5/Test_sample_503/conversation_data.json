    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$ equipped with 2-morphisms (the unit and counit) $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_B$ that satisfy the triangle identities. In a locally posetal 2-category like the one described, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis to find the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the 2-category structure of $\\Delta$.**\n    *   **Objects:** The objects are the finite non-empty ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. We are interested in the objects $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$.\n    *   **1-Morphisms:** The morphisms are order-preserving (monotone) maps. An adjunction involves a pair of morphisms $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   **2-Morphisms:** The 2-category is \"locally posetal\", meaning the hom-set $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ is a poset. The ordering is the pointwise order: for two maps $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ exists if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the adjunction conditions.**\n    An internal adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ consists of a pair of monotone maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying the unit and counit inequalities:\n    *   **Unit ($\\eta$):** $\\text{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$. This means for all $k \\in [23]$, $k \\le R(L(k))$.\n    *   **Counit ($\\epsilon$):** $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means for all $j \\in [37]$, $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\n3.  **Relate the conditions to standard poset theory.**\n    The conditions given above are precisely the definition of a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. Such a pair $(L, R)$ is also known as an adjoint pair of morphisms, where $L$ is the left adjoint and $R$ is the right adjoint ($L \\dashv R$).\n\n4.  **Characterize left and right adjoints between these posets.**\n    A fundamental result in poset theory states that a monotone map $f: P \\to Q$ between two complete lattices $P$ and $Q$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Similarly, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n    The posets $[n]$ are complete lattices, with $\\sup(S) = \\max(S)$ and $\\inf(S) = \\min(S)$ for any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [n]$.\n    *   For the empty set, $\\sup(\\emptyset) = \\bot$ (the bottom element) and $\\inf(\\emptyset) = \\top$ (the top element). In $[n]$, we have $\\bot = 0$ and $\\top = n$.\n\n5.  **Identify the condition for $L: [23] \\to [37]$ to be a left adjoint.**\n    $L$ must preserve all suprema.\n    *   For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [23]$, $L(\\sup S) = L(\\max S)$. Since $L$ is monotone, $L(\\max S) = \\max(L(S)) = \\sup(L(S))$. So, preservation of non-empty suprema is automatically satisfied for any monotone map between total orders.\n    *   For the empty set, we must have $L(\\sup \\emptyset_{[23]}) = \\sup L(\\emptyset_{[37]})$. This translates to $L(\\bot_{[23]}) = \\bot_{[37]}$. The bottom element of $[n]$ is $0$. So, the condition is $L(0) = 0$.\n    Thus, a monotone map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\n\n6.  **Identify the condition for $R: [37] \\to [23]$ to be a right adjoint.**\n    $R$ must preserve all infima.\n    *   For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [37]$, $R(\\inf S) = R(\\min S) = \\min(R(S)) = \\inf(R(S))$, which is true for any monotone map between total orders.\n    *   For the empty set, we must have $R(\\inf \\emptyset_{[37]}) = \\inf R(\\emptyset_{[23]})$. This translates to $R(\\top_{[37]}) = \\top_{[23]}$. The top element of $[n]$ is $n$. So, the condition is $R(37) = 23$.\n\n7.  **Count the number of adjunctions.**\n    An adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n    We need to count the number of monotone maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0) = 0$.\n    A monotone map is a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    With the condition $L(0)=0$, we are counting the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n    $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    This is a classic combinatorial problem equivalent to choosing 23 numbers (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement.\n    *   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$.\n    *   The size of the set to choose from is $n = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\n    The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula (\"stars and bars\"):\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n8.  **Verification (optional but recommended).**\n    We can also count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. These are monotone maps satisfying $R(37)=23$. This means counting the non-decreasing sequences:\n    $0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\n    Here we choose $k=37$ values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ which has size $n=24$.\n    The number is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n    Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$ and $\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$, the two counts agree, confirming the result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the number of such maps, given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
