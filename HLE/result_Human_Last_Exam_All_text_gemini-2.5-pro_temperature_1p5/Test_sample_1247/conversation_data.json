    "Answering this question requires finding the number of permutations \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n=333\\) that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324. This means there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n2.  The number of inversions in \\(\\pi\\), denoted \\(inv(\\pi)\\), is exactly \\(k=3\\). An inversion is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\).\n\nLet's analyze permutations with a very small number of inversions. Such permutations are \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). The structure of such permutations is that most elements are in their natural sorted position (i.e., \\(\\pi_i=i\\)). The inversions are caused by a small number of elements that are out of place.\n\nA permutation with \\(k\\) inversions can be obtained from the identity permutation by performing \\(k\\) adjacent transpositions. The elements that are not fixed (\\(\\pi_i \\ne i\\)) form one or more \"blocks\" of disorder.\n\nLet's analyze the condition for a permutation to have a 1324 pattern. It means there exist indices \\(a < b < c < d\\) such that \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\). A key observation is that the pair \\((b,c)\\) must correspond to an inversion \\(\\pi_b > \\pi_c\\). The pattern requires finding an element \\(\\pi_a\\) before this inversion that is smaller than \\(\\pi_c\\), and an element \\(\\pi_d\\) after the inversion that is larger than \\(\\pi_b\\).\n\nA general rule can be formulated: if an inversion \\((b,c)\\) (with values \\(\\pi_b > \\pi_c\\)) is \"in the middle\" of the permutation, it's likely to create a 1324 pattern. This is because we can likely find a small-valued element before it and a large-valued element after it. To avoid the 1324 pattern, the inversion must typically be at one of the ends of the permutation, or the values involved must be among the smallest or largest.\n\nFor \\(k=3\\), the permutation is a result of 3 adjacent transpositions. This leads to a limited number of \"shapes\" for the displaced elements. The elements \\(\\pi_i \\ne i\\) will be localized to a block of size at most 6. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, such a block will be \"in the middle\" unless it involves the first few or last few elements.\n\nLet's analyze the possible shapes of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they avoid 1324 for large \\(n\\). A shape can be described by the relative order of elements in the block that is not sorted.\n\n1.  **Shape 321**: One block of 3 elements in decreasing order.\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions: \\((\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+1}), (\\pi_i, \\pi_{i+2}), (\\pi_{i+1}, \\pi_{i+2})\\).\n    This structure avoids 1324 only if the block is at the very beginning or the very end.\n    -   \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, \\dots, n)\\). It avoids 1324 because there is no element before the block.\n    -   \\(i=n-2\\): \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). It avoids 1324 because there is no element after the block with a value larger than \\(n\\).\n    This gives **2** such permutations.\n\n2.  **Shape 2341**: One block of 4 elements.\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions.\n    This avoids 1324 only if the block is at the beginning or end.\n    -   \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\dots, n)\\). This avoids 1324.\n    -   \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\). This avoids 1324.\n    This gives **2** such permutations.\n\n3.  **Shape 4123**: One block of 4 elements. This shape is 132-avoiding, and therefore 1324-avoiding.\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, i+3, i, i+1, i+2, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions.\n    This structure gives a 1324 pattern for \\(1 < i < n-3\\).\n    -   \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, n)\\). Avoids 1324.\n    -   \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\). Avoids 1324.\n    This gives **2** such permutations.\n\n4.  **Shape 2413**: One block of 4 elements.\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, i+1, i+3, i, i+2, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions.\n    For \\(n \\ge 5\\), this shape creates a 1324 pattern if \\(i=1\\).\n    Example for \\(n=5, i=1\\): \\(\\pi=(2,4,1,3,5)\\). We have indices \\((a,b,c,d)=(1,2,4,5)\\). \\(\\pi_1=2, \\pi_2=4, \\pi_4=3, \\pi_5=5\\). We check \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\), which is \\(2 < 3 < 4 < 5\\). This is a 1324 pattern.\n    However, if the block is at the end, it avoids 1324.\n    -   \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n, n-3, n-1)\\). This avoids 1324.\n    This gives **1** such permutation.\n\n5.  **Shape 3142**: One block of 4 elements.\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, i+2, i, i+3, i+1, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions.\n    Similar to the 2413 case, this shape creates a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\) unless the block is at the end.\n    Example for \\(n=5, i=1\\): \\(\\pi=(3,1,4,2,5)\\). We have indices \\((a,b,c,d)=(2,3,4,5)\\). \\(\\pi_2=1, \\pi_3=4, \\pi_4=2, \\pi_5=5\\). We check \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\), which is \\(1 < 2 < 4 < 5\\). This is a 1324 pattern.\n    -   \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-1, n-3, n, n-2)\\). This avoids 1324.\n    This gives **1** such permutation.\n\n6.  **Other shapes**: Any other way of arranging elements to get 3 inversions, such as by having two separate blocks of swapped elements (e.g., \\(\\pi = (2,1, ..., 4,3, ...)\\)), can be shown to generate a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\).\n\nThe number of such permutations does not depend on \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) large enough (here \\(n=333\\) is much larger than \\(k=3\\)). We need to sum up the number of permutations identified.\n\nFrom our analysis:\n-   Shape 321: 2 permutations.\n-   Shape 2341: 2 permutations.\n-   Shape 4123: 2 permutations.\n-   Shape 2413: 1 permutation.\n-   Shape 3142: 1 permutation.\n\nAll these permutations are distinct. For example, \\((3,2,1,4,...)\\) starts with a descent at position 1. \\((2,3,4,1,...)\\) starts with an ascent. They are clearly different. The permutations involving elements near the end of the sequence are also distinct from each other and from those involving elements at the start.\n\nTotal number of such permutations is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8\\).\n\nLet's list them for clarity:\n1.  \\((3,2,1,4, \\dots, n)\\)\n2.  \\((1,2, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\)\n3.  \\((2,3,4,1,5, \\dots, n)\\)\n4.  \\((1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\)\n5.  \\((4,1,2,3,5, \\dots, n)\\)\n6.  \\((1, \\dots, n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\)\n7.  \\((1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n, n-3, n-1)\\)\n8.  \\((1, \\dots, n-4, n-1, n-3, n, n-2)\\)\n\nSince \\(n=333\\) is large, the analysis holds."
