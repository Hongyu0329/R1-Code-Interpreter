    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Given Information**\n\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where:\n    *   $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum.\n    *   $p$ is the magnitude of the electron's momentum.\n*   **Given Information:**\n    *   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit** ($n=1$).\n    *   The uncertainty in its position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n\n*   **Principle:** We use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The minimum uncertainty is given by the relation:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$).\n*   **Calculation:**\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for $\\Delta p$:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Point:** We are given $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$. We need to convert this to SI units (meters) for consistency.\n    $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n    So, $\\Delta x = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n\n*   **Principle:** In the Bohr model of the atom, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an orbit is quantized:\n    $L = n \\hbar$\n    where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, so the angular momentum is:\n    $L_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$\n*   **Relation to Linear Momentum:** Angular momentum ($L$) is also defined as the product of the orbital radius ($r$) and the linear momentum ($p$):\n    $L = r \\cdot p$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    For the first orbit, we have $L_1 = r_1 \\cdot p_1$. We can rearrange this to find the momentum $p_1$:\n    $p_1 = \\frac{L_1}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n*   **Careful Point:** We need the value for the radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1$. This is a well-known constant called the Bohr radius, $a_0$.\n    $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n    So, the momentum is $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Required Ratio ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$)**\n\n*   **Assemble the Ratio:** Now we can substitute the expressions for $\\Delta p$ and $p_1$ into the ratio.\n    Ratio = $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}}$\n*   **Simplify:** The reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, cancels out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    Ratio = $\\frac{1}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Final Calculation:** Substitute the numerical values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$.\n    *   $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n    Ratio = $\\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    Ratio = $2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
