    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe integral to be evaluated is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThis integral is in the form `∫ (g'(x)/g(x)) dx`, where `g(x) = F₃(x)`. The antiderivative (indefinite integral) of this form is `ln|g(x)|`.\nTherefore, the antiderivative of our integrand is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1`\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate F₃(1)**\nWe need to calculate the value of `F₃(x)` at `x = 1`. We do this by following the chain of function definitions:\n1.  `F₀(x) = x`\n    `F₀(1) = 1`\n2.  `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`\n    `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n3.  `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`\n    `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n4.  `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F₃(0)**\nSimilarly, we calculate the value of `F₃(x)` at `x = 0`:\n1.  `F₀(x) = x`\n    `F₀(0) = 0`\n2.  `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`\n    `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n3.  `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`\n    `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n4.  `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Check the Sign of F₃(x) and Simplify the Expression for V**\nBefore we can calculate `V`, we must determine the sign of `F₃(x)` on the interval `[0, 1]` to handle the absolute value.\n*   For `x` in `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is non-negative (since `1` radian is in the first quadrant). `0 <= sin(x) <= sin(1)`.\n*   Therefore, `F₂(x) = e^(sin(x))` will be greater than or equal to `e^0 = 1`.\n*   This means the argument of the logarithm in `F₃(x)`, which is `1 + F₂(x)`, will be greater than or equal to `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   Since `ln(z)` is positive for `z > 1`, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))` is positive for all `x` in `[0, 1]`.\n*   Thus, we can remove the absolute value signs: `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\nNow we can write the expression for `V` as:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\nSubstituting the values we found:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 6: Numerical Calculation**\nNow we calculate the numerical value of V.\n*   `sin(1)` (in radians) ≈ 0.84147\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ e^(0.84147) ≈ 2.31978\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(1 + 2.31978) = ln(3.31978)` ≈ 1.20001\n*   `ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n*   `V = ln( 1.20001 / 0.69315 )` ≈ `ln(1.7312)` ≈ 0.5488\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation and Rounding**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V` ≈ `10000 * 0.5488` = 5488\nUsing higher precision:\n`V` ≈ 0.5488402\n`10000 * V` ≈ 5488.402\nThe closest integer to 5488.402 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
