    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of size $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$. So, the group is $Q_{128}$ with the presentation:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of this group can be uniquely written in the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ or $yx^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$. The total number of elements is $64 + 64 = 128$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a \"power subgroup\".**\n\nA \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**.\nSo, the question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a strategy for counting all cyclic subgroups.**\n\nWe can partition the elements of $Q_{128}$ into two disjoint sets and find the cyclic subgroups generated by the elements in each set. A natural partition is:\n1.  The elements of the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 63\\}$.\n2.  The remaining elements, which are all of the form $yx^i$ for $0 \\le i < 63$.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set and then check for any overlaps.\n\n**Step 4: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i$.**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{64}$. For any cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of subgroups is therefore $\\tau(m)$, the number of divisors of $m$.\n\nFor $\\langle x \\rangle$, the order is $m=64$. We need to find the number of divisors of 64.\nSince $64 = 2^6$, the divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).\nThe number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6 + 1 = 7$.\nThese 7 subgroups are all cyclic and are contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. They are:\n$\\langle x^{64/1} \\rangle=\\langle 1 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{64/2} \\rangle=\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, and $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$.**\n\nLet $g = yx^k$. We first need to determine the order of these elements.\nLet's compute $g^2$:\n$g^2 = (yx^k)(yx^k) = y(x^k y)x^k$.\nFrom the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we can derive $xy = yx^{-1}$, and more generally $x^k y = yx^{-k}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $g^2$:\n$g^2 = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k} x^k = y^2$.\nUsing the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n\nNow we find the order of $g$. Since $x$ has order 64, $x^{32}$ is not the identity element, but $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$. So, $x^{32}$ has order 2.\nThis means $g^2 \\ne 1$. We compute $g^4$:\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$.\nSince $g^2 \\ne 1$ and $g^4 = 1$, the order of any element $g = yx^k$ is 4.\n\nThere are 64 such elements (for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63$), and they all have order 4. Now we need to determine how many *distinct* cyclic subgroups they generate.\nA cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. If $\\langle g \\rangle$ is such a group, its generators are $g$ and $g^3$.\nFor $g = yx^k$, the other generator is $g^3$:\n$g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32} \\cdot yx^k$.\nThe element $x^{32}$ is the unique element of order 2 in $Q_{128}$ and forms the center of the group, $Z(Q_{128})=\\{1, x^{32}\\}$. So, $x^{32}$ commutes with all elements, including $y$.\n$g^3 = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\nThis implies that $yx^k$ and $yx^{k+32}$ generate the same subgroup.\n$\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\langle yx^{k+32 \\pmod{64}} \\rangle$.\n\nThe 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ can be grouped into pairs $\\{yx^k, yx^{k+32}\\}$ that generate the same cyclic subgroup. The number of such distinct subgroups is therefore $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and check for overlaps.**\n\nFrom Step 4, we have 7 cyclic subgroups, all contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nFrom Step 5, we have 32 cyclic subgroups, each generated by an element of the form $yx^k$.\n\nIs there any overlap between these two sets of subgroups?\nA subgroup from the second set, like $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$, contains the element $yx^k$. This element is not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nAll subgroups from the first set are entirely contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nTherefore, a subgroup from the second set cannot be equal to any subgroup from the first set. The two collections of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the numbers from the two sets.\nTotal number = (Number from $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Number from elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64 is $\\tau(64) = 7$.\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $n = 32$.\n*   Total number of power subgroups = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
