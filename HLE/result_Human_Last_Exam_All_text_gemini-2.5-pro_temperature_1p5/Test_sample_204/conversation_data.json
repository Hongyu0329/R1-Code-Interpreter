    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Vector Field\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined as:\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a unit vector field (`nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = 1`) for all `(x, y, z)`. The field `n` maps each point in 3D space `R^3` to a point on the unit sphere `S^2`. The parameters `G` and `f` correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles on this target sphere `S^2`.\n\nThe angles `f` and `G` depend on the spatial coordinates `(x, y, z)` as follows:\n1.  `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is simply the azimuthal angle `φ` in cylindrical coordinates `(ρ, φ, z)`, where `ρ = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. So, `f = φ`.\n2.  `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`: This is the polar angle, controlled by the term `r2`.\n3.  `r2 = sqrt((x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = sqrt((ρ^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`. This term `r2` represents the distance from a point `(ρ, z)` in the cylindrical half-plane to the point `(ρ=sqrt(0.5), z=0)`. No, this is not quite the distance, but it shares a key property: `r2 = 0` if and only if `ρ^2 = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of the field at different locations in space:\n*   **At spatial infinity** (`ρ` or `|z| → ∞`): `r2 → ∞`, which means `G → PI * exp(-∞) = 0`. In this case, `n → (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`. So, the field points uniformly upwards at infinity. This is the necessary boundary condition for the field to represent a map from `S^3` (compactified `R^3`) to `S^2`.\n*   **On the circle `ρ^2 = 0.5, z = 0`**: On this circle, `r2 = 0`, which means `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`. In this case, `n → (sin(PI)cos(f), sin(PI)sin(f), cos(PI)) = (0, 0, -1)`. The field points uniformly downwards on this specific circle in the `xy`-plane.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing a Method to Calculate the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` is a topological invariant that characterizes how the preimages of points on the target sphere `S^2` are linked in the domain space `R^3`.\nThere are several ways to compute it:\n1.  **Linking Number of Preimages**: The Hopf charge is the linking number `Lk(C1, C2)` of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere `S^2`. This is the most direct and geometrically intuitive method.\n2.  **Product of Winding Numbers**: For fields with toroidal symmetry, the Hopf charge is the product of a toroidal winding number (`p`) and a poloidal winding number (`q`). `Q_H = p * q`.\n3.  **Whitehead Integral Formula**: `Q_H = (1 / 4π^2) ∫ A · B dV`, where `B` is the emergent magnetic field derived from `n`, and `A` is the corresponding vector potential (`B = ∇ × A`). This method is powerful but can be subtle to apply correctly.\n\nWe will primarily use the first two methods as they are more robust for this type of field configuration.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation via Linking Number\n\nLet's find the preimages of two different points on the target sphere `S^2`.\n*   **Point 1: The South Pole, `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`**. This corresponds to `G = π`.\n    The preimage `C_S` is the set of points `(x, y, z)` where `G(x,y,z) = π`.\n    `π = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n    `1 = exp(-10 * r2)`\n    `0 = -10 * r2` ⇒ `r2 = 0`\n    `sqrt((x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = 0`\n    This is only true if `z=0` and `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5`.\n    So, the preimage `C_S` is the circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the `z=0` plane, centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Point 2: A point on the Equator, `p_E`**. Let's choose the point corresponding to `G = π/2` and `f = 0`.\n    The preimage `C_E` is the set of points where `G = π/2` and `f = 0`.\n    `f = atan2(y, x) = 0` implies `y = 0` and `x > 0`. This is the positive x-axis half-plane.\n    `G = π/2` implies `π/2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`.\n    `1/2 = exp(-10 * r2)`\n    `ln(1/2) = -10 * r2` ⇒ `-ln(2) = -10 * r2` ⇒ `r2 = ln(2) / 10`.\n    `sqrt((x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2) / 10`.\n    Since we are in the half-plane `y=0`, this becomes `sqrt((x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2) / 10`.\n    Squaring both sides: `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2) / 10)^2`.\n    This is the equation of a closed loop in the `xz`-plane (specifically, for `x > 0`).\n\n*   **Linking Number `Lk(C_S, C_E)`**:\n    `C_S` is a circle in the `xy`-plane.\n    `C_E` is a loop in the `xz`-plane.\n    The linking number is determined by whether `C_S` pierces the surface spanned by `C_E`. The simplest such surface is the area enclosed by `C_E` in the `xz`-plane.\n    The circle `C_S` pierces the `xz`-plane at two points: `(x=sqrt(0.5), y=0, z=0)` and `(x=-sqrt(0.5), y=0, z=0)`.\n    Since `C_E` is in the `x>0` region, we only care about the piercing point `P = (sqrt(0.5), 0, 0)`.\n    Is `P` inside the loop `C_E`? The loop `C_E` is defined by `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2` where `R=ln(2)/10 > 0`. The loop crosses the x-axis (`z=0`) when `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = R^2`, i.e., `x^2 = 0.5 ± R`. The x-coordinates of the loop range from `sqrt(0.5 - R)` to `sqrt(0.5 + R)`.\n    The point `P` has `x=sqrt(0.5)`. Since `sqrt(0.5 - R) < sqrt(0.5) < sqrt(0.5 + R)`, the piercing point `P` is inside the loop `C_E`.\n    Therefore, the linking number is 1.\n    `Q_H = Lk(C_S, C_E) = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation via Winding Numbers\n\nThis method applies to fields with toroidal symmetry like the one given. The Hopf charge is the product of the winding `p` of the azimuthal angle `f` and the winding `q` of the polar angle structure `G`.\n*   **Toroidal Winding `p`**: The azimuthal function is `f = atan2(y, x) = φ`. As we go once around the z-axis in real space (from `φ=0` to `φ=2π`), the angle `f` also goes from `0` to `2π`. This corresponds to one full wrap. So, the winding number is `p = 1`.\n*   **Poloidal Winding `q`**: This describes how the vector `n` sweeps along a meridian of the target `S^2` as we traverse a poloidal loop in `R^3`. Consider a path in the `xz`-plane (`φ=const`) starting from far away (`G=0`), passing through the core ring (`G=π`), and returning to far away (`G=0`). This corresponds to the `n` vector starting at the North Pole `(0,0,1)`, sweeping down to the South Pole `(0,0,-1)`, and returning to the North Pole. This is one full wrap along a meridian. So, the winding number is `q = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge is `Q_H = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nBoth geometric methods yield the same result. The Whitehead integral formula also yields `1`, but its direct computation is notoriously subtle and prone to errors if not handled carefully, especially regarding gauge choices and singularities (the fact that `A·B = 0` for the most natural choice of potential `A` indicates one of these subtleties is at play). Based on the robust geometric analysis, the Hopf charge is 1."
