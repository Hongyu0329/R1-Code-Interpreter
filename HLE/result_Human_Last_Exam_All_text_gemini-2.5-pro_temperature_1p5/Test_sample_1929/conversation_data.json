    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user asks for the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. To determine the product, we need to follow a series of logical steps, paying attention to the details of the reactants and the reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and their Roles:**\n    *   **Butadiene:** The chemical formula is C₄H₆, and the structural formula is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene. In the context of the reaction in question, it will act as the \"diene\" component.\n    *   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** The chemical formula is C₂Cl₂F₂, and the structural formula is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene. The presence of electron-withdrawing halogen atoms (Cl and F) makes it electron-deficient, and thus a good \"dienophile\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   This is a type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition. The \"4\" represents the four pi electrons of the diene, and the \"2\" represents the two pi electrons of the dienophile that participate in the reaction.\n    *   The reaction is concerted, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single transition state.\n\n3.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Product (Topology):**\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, a new six-membered ring is formed.\n    *   Let's number the carbons of the reactants:\n        *   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H-C³H=C⁴H₂\n        *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: Let's arbitrarily label it C⁵F₂=C⁶Cl₂\n    *   The reaction involves the breaking of three pi bonds (C¹=C², C³=C⁴, and C⁵=C⁶) and the formation of two new C-C sigma bonds and one new C=C pi bond.\n    *   The new sigma bonds form between the ends of the diene and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond. For example, between C¹ and C⁶, and between C⁴ and C⁵.\n    *   A new pi bond forms between the central carbons of the original diene, i.e., between C² and C³.\n    *   The resulting product is a derivative of cyclohexene. The atoms forming the ring are C¹-C²-C³-C⁴ from the diene and C⁵-C⁶ from the dienophile. The sequence in the newly formed ring would be -C²H=C³H-C⁴H₂-C⁵F₂-C⁶Cl₂-C¹H₂-.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   Regiochemistry deals with which end of the dienophile adds to which end of the diene.\n    *   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical. C1 is equivalent to C4.\n    *   The dienophile, CCl₂=CF₂, is unsymmetrical. It has a CCl₂ end and a CF₂ end.\n    *   Two orientations are possible for the addition:\n        a) The CCl₂ group adds to C1 of the diene, and the CF₂ group adds to C4.\n        b) The CF₂ group adds to C1 of the diene, and the CCl₂ group adds to C4.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because the diene is symmetrical, these two possibilities result in the exact same molecule. We can see this by taking the product from orientation (b) and rotating it 180° in the plane, which will superimpose it onto the product from orientation (a). Therefore, only one constitutional isomer is formed.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Structure and Name:**\n    *   Based on the connectivity established in Step 3, the product is a cyclohexene ring with two CH₂ groups, a CH=CH group, a CCl₂ group, and a CF₂ group. The CCl₂ and CF₂ groups are on adjacent carbons.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n              CH = CH\n             /       \\\n           CH₂       CH₂\n           |         |\n           CF₂ ----- CCl₂\n        ```\n    *   To find the correct IUPAC name, we must number the ring according to standard rules:\n        1.  The double bond must be given the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2).\n        2.  Numbering is then chosen to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        3.  If a choice remains, the substituents are numbered to give the alphabetically first group the lowest locant.\n    *   Let's apply these rules:\n        *   **Numbering option A:** We number the ring such that the CCl₂ group is on carbon-4 and the CF₂ group is on carbon-5. The name would be **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n        *   **Numbering option B:** We number the ring the other way around the double bond, which would put the CF₂ group on carbon-4 and the CCl₂ group on carbon-5. The name would be **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n    *   Both options give the same set of locants: {4,4,5,5}. We must use the alphabetical rule to break the tie. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the \"chloro\" group should be assigned the lower number.\n    *   Option A assigns \"4\" to chloro, while Option B assigns \"5\" to chloro. We must choose Option A.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final product of the reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
