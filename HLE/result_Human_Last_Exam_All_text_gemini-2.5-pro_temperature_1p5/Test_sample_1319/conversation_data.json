    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source Text:** The *Iliad* by Homer.\n*   **Object:** A \"historical mountain\" – a real, physical mountain that can be identified today.\n*   **Exclusion:** Must not be Mount Olympus.\n*   **Ranking:** Must be the \"tallest\" among the remaining candidates based on physical elevation.\n\n**2. Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of all mountains explicitly named in the epic poem.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous, serving as the home of the gods. It is mentioned throughout the poem. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is critically important to the narrative. Zeus often sits on its peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War unfold below. This is the Mount Ida located near Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon ascends \"the highest peak of wooded Samothrace\" to view the battlefield. The island's highest point is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus, her journey takes her \"from Athos\" over the sea to the island of Lemnos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** The poem mentions that the mighty ash spear of Achilles was cut from the peak of Mount Pelion.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned once in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2. Homer describes the Maeonian forces as living \"under snowy Tmolus,\" locating them geographically in Lydia (modern Turkey).\n\n**3. Address Careful Points and Potential Ambiguities**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Two Mount Idas:** Greek mythology contains two very famous mountains named Ida. One is in Crete, associated with the birth and upbringing of Zeus. The other is near Troy. The *Iliad's* context is the Trojan War, and every mention of Ida clearly refers to the one overlooking the Trojan plain. The taller Cretan Ida is not mentioned by name in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Historical vs. Mythological:** All the mountains listed above are \"historical\" in that they correspond to real, identifiable geographical locations.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Other Peaks?** Mountains like Mount Parnassus, though very tall and famous in Greek mythology (associated with Delphi and the Muses), are not mentioned in the *Iliad*. They appear in other texts like the *Odyssey*. We must stick strictly to the text of the *Iliad*.\n\n**4. Gather Elevation Data for the Candidate Mountains**\nNow, we find the modern names and elevations (height above sea level) for each identified mountain.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus** (Greece): 2,918 meters (9,573 ft) - This is our baseline, the tallest.\n*   **Mount Tmolus** (Modern name: Bozdağ, in the Bozdağlar range, Turkey): **2,159 meters (7,083 ft)**\n*   **Mount Athos** (Greece): **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**\n*   **Mount Ida** (Modern name: Kaz Dağı, Turkey): **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**\n*   **Mount Pelion** (Greece): **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**\n*   **Mount Samothrace** (Highest peak: Fengari, Greece): **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**\n\n**5. Compare and Rank the Mountains**\nWith the elevation data, we can rank the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* by height:\n\n1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)**\n3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. Based on the ranking, the second-tallest mountain on the list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
