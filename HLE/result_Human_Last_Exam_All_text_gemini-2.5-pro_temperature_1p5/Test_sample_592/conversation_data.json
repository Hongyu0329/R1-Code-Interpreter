    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks for the specific U.S. city where the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Identify the key elements:**\n    *   **Film:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n    *   **Information needed:** The name of the U.S. city.\n\n3.  **Analyze the plot of the film:** *Ovosodo* primarily follows the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, in Livorno, Italy. A crucial secondary character is his best friend, Tommaso. Tommaso comes from a wealthy family but is deeply troubled and unhappy.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific event in the film:** Towards the end of the film, Tommaso's personal struggles culminate in his decision to leave Livorno and start a new life. He communicates this decision to Piero.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the method of communication:** The information about Tommaso's new location is revealed in a letter he sends to Piero from the United States.\n\n6.  **Identify the city named:** In his letter, Tommaso tells Piero that he has moved to Philadelphia to study, seeking a new beginning away from the environment he found stifling in Italy.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's important not to confuse the main character, Piero (who stays in Livorno), with his friend Tommaso (who moves). The question is specifically about Tommaso.\n*   **Source of Information:** The city is explicitly named within the film's narrative, specifically in the letter Tommaso writes. It is not just implied that he moves to \"America.\"\n*   **Film Verification:** Ensure we are analyzing the correct 1997 film directed by Paolo Virzì.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBy examining the plot details of *Ovosodo*, we can confirm that when the character Tommaso leaves Italy for the United States, he specifies his destination in a letter to his friend Piero. The city he moves to is Philadelphia.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
