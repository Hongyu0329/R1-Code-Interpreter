    "Answering this question requires finding the stable reduction of the given curve over the 2-adic numbers and counting its double points.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the initial curve and its reduction\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve defined over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The equation has coefficients in the ring of 2-adic integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe degree of the polynomial in $x$ is 5. For a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$, the genus $g$ is given by $\\deg(f) = 2g+1$ or $2g+2$. Here, $5 = 2g+1$, so the genus is $g=2$.\n\nLet's examine the reduction of this model modulo 2. The coefficients are reduced modulo 2, so the equation becomes:\n$\\bar{C}: y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be rewritten as $y^2 - x^2 = 0$, or $(y-x)^2 = 0$ in characteristic 2. The special fiber is the line $y=x$ with multiplicity 2. This is a non-reduced scheme, which means this model is not semistable. The stable reduction is obtained by resolving the singularities of the model.\n\n### Step 2: Find a better model through a change of variables\nThe form of the special fiber $(y-x)^2=0$ suggests making a change of variables involving $y-x$. Let a new variable be $y_1 = y-x$. Then $y=y_1+x$. Substituting this into the original equation:\n$(y_1+x)^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n$y_1^2 + 2xy_1 + x^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides gives:\n$y_1^2 + 2xy_1 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n\nLet's examine the 2-adic valuation of the coefficients in this equation. The coefficients of $y_1^2$ and $2xy_1$ are 1 and 2. The coefficients on the right-hand side are 8, 4, 4, 8. All terms in the equation are divisible by 2. This suggests another variable substitution to simplify the equation. Let $y_1 = 2y_2$.\n$(2y_2)^2 + 2x(2y_2) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\n$4y_2^2 + 4xy_2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$\nNow, we can divide the entire equation by 4:\n$C_2: y_2^2 + xy_2 = 2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x$\nThis equation defines a new model $C_2$ which is isomorphic to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the new model $C_2$ and its special fiber\nThe model $C_2$ is given by $F(x, y_2) = y_2^2 + xy_2 - (2x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2x) = 0$.\nFirst, we check if this is a regular model, which means the total scheme defined by $F=0$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is regular (has no singular points). A singular point would satisfy $F=0$, $\\partial F/\\partial x = 0$, and $\\partial F/\\partial y_2 = 0$. A calculation shows that this system of equations has no solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, so the model $C_2$ is regular.\n\nNext, we analyze the special fiber $\\bar{C}_2$ by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$\\bar{C}_2: y_2^2 + xy_2 \\equiv x^4 + x^3 \\pmod{2}$\n$\\bar{C}_2: y_2^2 + xy_2 + x^3(x+1) = 0$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the singularities of the special fiber\nTo find the singular points of $\\bar{C}_2$, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y_2$ and set them to zero.\n$\\partial/\\partial y_2: 2y_2 + x = x = 0$\n$\\partial/\\partial x: y_2 + 3x^2(x+1) + x^3(1) = y_2 + x^2(x+1) + x^3 = y_2 + x^3 + x^2 + x^3 = y_2+x^2=0$\nFrom the first equation, a singular point must have $x=0$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $y_2 + 0^2 = 0$, so $y_2=0$.\nThus, the only singular point of the special fiber $\\bar{C}_2$ is at the origin $(x, y_2) = (0,0)$.\n\n### Step 5: Classify the singularity\nTo determine the type of singularity at $(0,0)$, we examine the lowest degree terms of the equation for $\\bar{C}_2$:\n$y_2^2 + xy_2 + x^3(x+1) = 0$\nThe lowest degree terms are $y_2^2 + xy_2$. We can factor this as $y_2(y_2+x) = 0$. This equation represents two distinct lines, $y_2=0$ and $y_2=-x \\equiv y_2=x$, intersecting transversally at the origin. This type of singularity is an ordinary double point, also known as a node.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the stable reduction\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C}_2$ is a reduced curve (it can be shown to be irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) whose only singularity is a node. A reduced curve with only nodal singularities is called a semistable curve.\nSince the model $C_2$ is regular and its special fiber $\\bar{C}_2$ is semistable, $C_2$ is a semistable model of the original curve.\nThe stable reduction is obtained from a semistable model by contracting any smooth rational components that intersect the rest of the fiber in at most two points. Since our special fiber $\\bar{C}_2$ is irreducible, there are no such components to contract.\nTherefore, $\\bar{C}_2$ is the stable reduction of the curve $C$.\n\n### Step 7: Count the double points\nThe stable reduction of the curve is the nodal curve $\\bar{C}_2$. We found that this curve has exactly one singular point, which is a node (a double point).\n\nTherefore, the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve is 1."
