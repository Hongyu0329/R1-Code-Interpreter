    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### I. Conceptual Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics\n\nThe core idea of Large Deviation Theory (LDT) in the context of statistical mechanics is to formalize the notion that macroscopic systems in equilibrium are found in their most probable state. Any fluctuation away from this equilibrium state is exponentially unlikely. The \"rate function\" in LDT quantifies the exponent of this unlikeliness and is directly related to thermodynamic potentials like entropy or free energy.\n\n*   **System:** We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons).\n    *   Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics.\n    *   The number of photons is not conserved (e.g., in a cavity in thermal equilibrium), which implies the chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n    *   The system has discrete energy levels $\\epsilon_i$, each with a degeneracy $g_i$ (meaning there are $g_i$ distinct quantum states with the same energy $\\epsilon_i$).\n*   **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration of the system when it's in contact with a heat reservoir at temperature $T$. In LDT terms, this is the state that minimizes the rate function.\n\n### II. Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Equilibrium Mean Energy from the Cramer-Chernoff Theorem\n\n1.  **Identify the Macroscopic Observable:** The first quantity of interest is the mean energy of the system, $\\langle E \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Apply Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem describes the probability of the sample mean of i.i.d. random variables deviating from the true expectation value. In statistical mechanics, we can consider the total energy $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$ of the system as a random variable. The theorem states that the probability of observing a mean energy density $u$ that is different from the true ensemble average $\\langle E \\rangle$ is exponentially small:\n    $P(\\text{Energy} \\approx u) \\sim e^{-N \\cdot I(u)}$\n    where $N$ is the system size and $I(u)$ is the rate function.\n\n3.  **Find the Equilibrium Value:** The rate function $I(u)$ is always non-negative and is zero only when $u$ is equal to the expectation value of the energy, $\\langle E \\rangle$. Therefore, the probability is maximized when the observed energy is equal to the expected energy. This most probable value is the equilibrium value.\n    $E_{eq} = \\langle E \\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:** We calculate $\\langle E \\rangle$ using the rules of the grand canonical ensemble for bosons with $\\mu=0$. The probability of a state with energy $E$ is proportional to $e^{-\\beta E}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n    *   The average number of particles occupying a single quantum state with energy $\\epsilon_i$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution function for $\\mu=0$:\n        $\\langle n_{\\text{state}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    *   Since the energy level $\\epsilon_i$ has a degeneracy of $g_i$, the total average number of particles at this energy level is:\n        $\\langle n_i \\rangle = g_i \\times \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    *   The equilibrium mean energy is the sum of the energies of all occupied levels:\n        $E_{eq} = \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{i} \\langle n_i \\rangle \\epsilon_i$\n\n5.  **Final Expression for Mean Energy:**\n    $E_{eq} = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    This is the equilibrium mean energy for a gas of photons.\n\n#### Step 2: Equilibrium Entropy from the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem\n\n1.  **Identify the Macroscopic State:** The full macroscopic state (macrostate) is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ for each energy level $\\epsilon_i$.\n\n2.  **Apply Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem describes the probability of observing an empirical distribution (our macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$) that deviates from the true equilibrium distribution. The probability of a given macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is proportional to the number of microscopic ways, $\\Omega(\\{n_i\\})$, it can be realized. This connection is the essence of Boltzmann's principle, $S = k_B \\log \\Omega$. The theorem formalizes this by stating that the probability of a non-equilibrium macrostate is exponentially suppressed, with the rate function being directly related to the entropy difference from equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Find the Equilibrium Value:** The equilibrium state is the one that is overwhelmingly the most probable. This corresponds to the macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ that has the maximum number of associated microstates, $\\Omega_{max}$, and therefore the maximum entropy, $S_{eq}$. The LDT rate function for the distribution is minimized for this state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Combinatorial Factor $\\Omega$:** For bosons, the number of ways to distribute $n_i$ indistinguishable particles into $g_i$ distinguishable states (at the same energy level $\\epsilon_i$) is given by:\n    $\\Omega_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i} = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n    The total number of microstates for the macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is the product over all energy levels:\n    $\\Omega(\\{n_i\\}) = \\prod_i \\Omega_i = \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Entropy:** The entropy is $S = k_B \\log \\Omega$. For large $n_i$ and $g_i$, we use Stirling's approximation ($\\log x! \\approx x \\log x - x$):\n    $S(\\{n_i\\}) = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\log(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\log n_i - g_i \\log g_i \\right]$\n    This can be rewritten in terms of the average occupation per state, $\\nu_i = n_i / g_i$:\n    $S(\\{n_i\\}) = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (1 + \\nu_i) \\log(1 + \\nu_i) - \\nu_i \\log \\nu_i \\right]$\n\n6.  **Find the Equilibrium Entropy:** The equilibrium entropy, $S_{eq}$, is the value of this function when the occupation numbers $\\nu_i$ take on their equilibrium values. As found in Step 1, the equilibrium occupation numbers are determined by the temperature $T$:\n    $\\nu_{i, eq} = \\frac{\\langle n_i \\rangle}{g_i} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n    Substituting this into the entropy formula gives the equilibrium entropy.\n\n7.  **Final Expression for Entropy:**\n    $S_{eq} = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (1 + \\nu_{i, eq}) \\log(1 + \\nu_{i, eq}) - \\nu_{i, eq} \\log \\nu_{i, eq} \\right]$\n    where $\\nu_{i, eq} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1}$.\n\n    This expression can be simplified and shown to be equivalent to the standard thermodynamic relation $S = (E - F)/T$, where $F = -k_B T \\log Z_{GC}$ is the Helmholtz free energy and $Z_{GC}$ is the grand canonical partition function. Substituting the values for $E_{eq}$ and $Z_{GC}$ for the photon gas leads to:\n    $S_{eq} = \\frac{E_{eq}}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem identifies the equilibrium value with the expectation value in the grand canonical ensemble.\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:** The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem identifies the equilibrium value with the maximum value of the statistical entropy functional ($S=k_B\\log\\Omega$), evaluated at the equilibrium occupation numbers.\n\n***\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy ($E_{eq}$):**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is the sum of the average energy in each energy level $\\epsilon_i$ (with degeneracy $g_i$), given by the Bose-Einstein distribution with chemical potential $\\mu=0$:\n\n$E_{eq} = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\epsilon_i / k_B T} - 1}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of the i-th level.\n*   $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the i-th level.\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy ($S_{eq}$):**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is the value of the statistical entropy for a Bose gas evaluated at the equilibrium occupation numbers. Let $\\nu_{i,eq} = (e^{\\epsilon_i / k_B T} - 1)^{-1}$ be the average occupation per state at energy level $\\epsilon_i$. The entropy is given by:\n\n$S_{eq} = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (1 + \\nu_{i, eq}) \\log(1 + \\nu_{i, eq}) - \\nu_{i, eq} \\log \\nu_{i, eq} \\right]$\n\nAlternatively, using thermodynamic relations, the entropy can be expressed as:\n\n$S_{eq} = \\frac{E_{eq}}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\log\\left(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_i / k_B T}\\right)$\n>>>"
