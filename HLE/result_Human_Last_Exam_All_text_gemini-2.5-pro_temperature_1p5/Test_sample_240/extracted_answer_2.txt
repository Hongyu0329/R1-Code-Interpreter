The most common reason for this behavior is that the functional MRI coil is designed with an active decoupling circuit that places it in a non-resonant or "detuned" state by default as a safety measure. The coil requires a specific DC control signal (an "enable" voltage) from the MRI scanner to switch it into its high-Q, resonant receive mode. When testing the coil on a bench without this signal, it remains in its safe, detuned state, and therefore, no resonance can be detected by the VNA probe.
