    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Artist and the Question**\nThe artist is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. The question asks for the chronologically latest battle she depicted, meaning we need to identify the battle that occurred most recently in history, not the painting that was created last.\n\n**Step 2: Compile a List of Lady Butler's Battle Paintings and their Subjects**\nWe need to list her notable paintings that portray specific historical battles and identify the date each battle occurred.\n\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!* (painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which took place on June 18, **1815**.\n*   ***Quatre Bras* (painted 1875):** Depicts the 28th Regiment of Foot at the **Battle of Quatre Bras** on June 16, **1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call* (painted 1874):** Shows the aftermath of the **Battle of Inkerman** during the Crimean War, which was fought on November 5, **1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava* (painted 1876):** Portrays the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the **Battle of Balaclava**, which occurred on October 25, **1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift* (painted 1880):** Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War, which happened on January 22–23, **1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!* (painted 1882):** Shows an incident during the **Battle of Laing's Nek** in the First Boer War, on January 28, **1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir* (painted 1885):** Depicts the British assault at the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** during the Anglo-Egyptian War on September 13, **1882**.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards* (painted 1920):** This painting depicts the **Great Retreat from Mons**, which took place in August **1914** during the early stages of World War I.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26 February 1916* (painted 1917):** This work portrays a cavalry charge during the Senussi Campaign of World War I. The battle, the **Charge at Agagia**, occurred on February 26, **1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically Order the Battles**\nNow, let's list the dates of the battles to find the latest one:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras / Waterloo: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman: **1854**\n3.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n4.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n5.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n6.  Retreat from Mons: **1914**\n7.  Charge at Agagia: **1916**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, the **Charge at Agagia** in **1916** is the most recent historical event depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Painting Date vs. Battle Date:** It is crucial not to confuse the year a painting was made with the year the event it depicts occurred. For example, *The Retreat from Mons* was painted in 1920, later than the painting of Agagia (1917), but the battle itself (Mons, 1914) was earlier than the battle of Agagia (1916).\n*   **Specificity of Subject:** Ensure the painting depicts a specific, dated battle. Lady Butler painted many military scenes, but not all are tied to a precise historical battle. The ones listed above are confirmed to represent specific events.\n*   **Completeness of List:** The analysis includes her major works and, critically, her later works which cover World War I, ensuring the latest possible conflict she painted is considered.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Charge at Agagia, which took place on February 26, 1916, during World War I.\n\n<<<The Charge at Agagia>>>"
