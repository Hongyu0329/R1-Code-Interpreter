    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from fractal geometry (Hausdorff dimension) and combinatorial number theory (Sidon sets).\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers $E \\subset [0, 1]$ is called a Sidon set if all pairwise sums are unique, up to the order of summands. Formally, if $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in E$ and $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$, then it must be that the sets $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$ are identical. This condition essentially prevents \"additive coincidences\" within the set.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(E)$, is a way to assign a (possibly non-integer) dimension to any set in a metric space. It is a more refined measure of a set's size than topological dimension. For a set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension can be any real number between 0 and 1. For example, a single point has dimension 0, a line segment has dimension 1, and the classic middle-third Cantor set has dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63$.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum** possible value of $\\dim_H(E)$ for any set $E \\subset [0,1]$ that is a Sidon set.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the dimension**\n\nThis part of the analysis aims to find a value that the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set cannot exceed.\n\n1.  **Consider the Sum Set:** For a set $E$, we define its sum set as $E+E = \\{x+y \\mid x, y \\in E\\}$. If $E \\subset [0,1]$, then every element in $E+E$ must be in the interval $[0,2]$.\n2.  **Dimension of the Sum Set:** Since $E+E \\subset [0,2]$, a subset of the real line, its Hausdorff dimension cannot be greater than 1. So, $\\dim_H(E+E) \\le 1$.\n3.  **Relate to the Cartesian Product:** The sum set $E+E$ can be viewed as the image of the Cartesian product $E \\times E$ under the summation map $\\phi(x,y) = x+y$. The map $\\phi$ is a linear projection from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a Lipschitz continuous map. A general property of Hausdorff dimension is that a Lipschitz map cannot increase dimension, so $\\dim_H(E+E) \\le \\dim_H(E \\times E)$.\n4.  **Dimension of the Cartesian Product:** A fundamental theorem of Hausdorff dimension states that for any sets $A, B$, we have $\\dim_H(A \\times B) = \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(B)$. Therefore, $\\dim_H(E \\times E) = \\dim_H(E) + \\dim_H(E) = 2 \\dim_H(E)$.\n5.  **Use the Sidon Property:** The crucial step involves a result from fractal geometry, first shown by Kaufman (1981). For a Sidon set $E$, the summation map does not \"lose\" dimension. The lack of additive coincidences ensures that the dimension is preserved. The theorem states that if $E$ is a Sidon set, then $\\dim_H(E+E) = \\dim_H(E \\times E)$.\n6.  **Combine the inequalities:** We can now chain these facts together:\n    $2 \\dim_H(E) = \\dim_H(E \\times E) = \\dim_H(E+E) \\le 1$.\n    From this, we derive the upper bound:\n    $2 \\dim_H(E) \\le 1 \\implies \\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$.\n\nThis proves that no Sidon set in $[0,1]$ can have a Hausdorff dimension greater than $1/2$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that the upper bound is attainable**\n\nNow we need to show that this upper bound of $1/2$ is sharp, meaning we can find Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to, or equal to, $1/2$. This confirms that $1/2$ is not just an upper bound but the maximum possible value.\n\n1.  **Construction using integer Sidon sets:** We can construct fractal sets that are also Sidon sets. The method involves representing numbers in a large base $B$ and restricting their digits to a specific set $D$.\n    *   Let $m$ be a large integer. From number theory, it is known that we can find an integer Sidon set $D_m$ with $m$ elements (e.g., $\\{1, 2, 4, \\dots, 2^{m-1}\\}$). A denser construction by Singer gives a Sidon set $D_m$ of size $m$ whose largest element, $d_{max}$, is on the order of $m^2$.\n    *   To ensure our resulting real number set is a Sidon set, we need to avoid \"carries\" during addition. We can achieve this by choosing a sufficiently large base $B$. If we choose $B > 2 d_{max}$, adding any two numbers whose digits come from $D_m$ will not involve carries.\n    *   We define our set $E_m$ as:\n        $E_m = \\left\\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{B^k} \\mid a_k \\in D_m \\right\\}$.\n        This set is a self-similar fractal set contained in $[0,1]$.\n    *   Because the digit set $D_m$ is an integer Sidon set and we have avoided carries by choosing a large base $B$, the set $E_m$ is a real Sidon set.\n2.  **Calculate the dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by the formula $\\dim_H(E_m) = \\frac{\\log(\\text{number of allowed digits})}{\\log(\\text{base})} = \\frac{\\log|D_m|}{\\log B}$.\n    *   Substituting the values from our construction: $|D_m|=m$ and $B \\approx c \\cdot m^2$ for some constant $c$.\n    *   $\\dim_H(E_m) \\approx \\frac{\\log m}{\\log(c \\cdot m^2)} = \\frac{\\log m}{2\\log m + \\log c}$.\n3.  **Take the limit:** As we choose larger and larger digit sets (letting $m \\to \\infty$), the dimension approaches a limit:\n    $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\dim_H(E_m) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log m}{2\\log m + \\log c} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4.  **Existence of a set with dimension exactly 1/2:** The above argument shows that the supremum of dimensions is $1/2$. Deeper results in the field by authors like S.J. Taylor (1955) and later T.W. KÃ¶rner have provided specific (often probabilistic) constructions of compact Sidon sets whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$. Therefore, the supremum is attained and is a maximum.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Definition of Sidon Set:** The condition $x_1+x_2 = x_3+x_4 \\implies \\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$ is crucial and must be handled carefully. It's about unordered pairs.\n2.  **Kaufman's Theorem:** The fact that $\\dim_H(E+E) = \\dim_H(E \\times E)$ for a Sidon set is a non-trivial theorem. A hand-wavy argument is that the Sidon property prevents the self-intersections or overlaps that would normally cause a projection to decrease dimension.\n3.  **Upper vs. Maximum:** Proving the supremum is $1/2$ is done by showing the upper bound is $1/2$ and that it can be approached arbitrarily closely. Stating it is the *maximum* relies on knowing that a set with this exact dimension exists, which is a more advanced result but well-established in the literature.\n4.  **Construction of High-Dimension Sidon Sets:** The construction requires care. Using digits $\\{0,1\\}$ with base 4 gives dimension $1/2$, but it is *not* a Sidon set. The choice of the digit set $D$ as an integer Sidon set is essential.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ must have a Hausdorff dimension no larger than $1/2$. Furthermore, constructions exist that produce Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to and exactly equal to $1/2$. Therefore, the maximum possible dimension is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
