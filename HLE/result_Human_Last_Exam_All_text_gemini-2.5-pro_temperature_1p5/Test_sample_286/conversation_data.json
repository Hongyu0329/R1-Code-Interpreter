    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem is as follows:\n\nLet $N = 100000$. We are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]$. We need to find a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ such that all $x_k$ lie in the interval $[-B, B]$ where $B = 1-10^{-M}$, and $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, N$.\n\n1.  **Reformulating the condition:**\n    The condition $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ means $x_k = x_{k-1} \\pm a_k$. We can write this choice of sign as $\\epsilon_k \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, so $x_k = x_{k-1} + \\epsilon_k a_k$.\n    By induction, we can express any $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$:\n    $x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$.\n    Let's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$, with $S_0=0$. So, $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\n\n    The constraint is that $x_k \\in [-B, B]$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$. This is equivalent to:\n    $-B \\le x_k \\le B \\implies -B \\le x_0 + S_k \\le B \\implies -B - S_k \\le x_0 \\le B - S_k$.\n    This must hold for all $k=0, \\dots, N$. Thus, $x_0$ must lie in the intersection of all these intervals:\n    $\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} (-B - S_k) \\le x_0 \\le \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} (B - S_k)$.\n    This simplifies to $-B - \\min_k S_k \\le x_0 \\le B - \\max_k S_k$.\n\n    For such an $x_0$ to exist, the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound:\n    $-B - \\min_k S_k \\le B - \\max_k S_k$.\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $\\max_k S_k - \\min_k S_k \\le 2B$.\n    The term on the left is the range of the partial sums.\n\n2.  **Finding the tightest bound:**\n    The problem states that for *any* sequence $a_i \\in [0,1]$, we must be able to find the sequence $x_i$. This means for any $a_i$, we must be able to choose the signs $\\epsilon_i$ such that the range condition is satisfied.\n    This means that $2B$ must be greater than or equal to the minimal possible range we can achieve for any sequence $a_i$.\n    Let $W(a) = \\min_{\\epsilon_1,\\dots,\\epsilon_N} (\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k)$.\n    The condition must hold for the \"worst-case\" sequence $a_i$, i.e., the one which makes this minimal range as large as possible. Let this maximum possible range be $W_{max} = \\max_{a_i \\in [0,1]} W(a)$.\n    So, we must have $2B \\ge W_{max}$.\n\n3.  **The optimal strategy for choosing signs:**\n    To minimize the range of partial sums, a well-known optimal strategy is the greedy algorithm. At each step $k$, we choose the sign $\\epsilon_k$ to pull the current sum $S_{k-1}$ towards the origin. That is:\n    - If $S_{k-1} > 0$, we choose $\\epsilon_k = -1$.\n    - If $S_{k-1} < 0$, we choose $\\epsilon_k = +1$.\n    - If $S_{k-1} = 0$, the choice doesn't matter for the greedy principle. Let's say we choose $\\epsilon_k = +1$.\n    This is known to produce the minimum possible range $W(a)$.\n\n4.  **Constructing the worst-case sequence $a_i$:**\n    Now we need to find the sequence $a_i$ that maximizes the range when using this greedy strategy. This worst-case scenario occurs when we can force the sum to oscillate widely by making it land on values that lead to large jumps.\n    Let $N = 100000$. Let $K = N/2 = 50000$. Consider the sequence defined as follows for $i=1, \\dots, K$:\n    $a_{2i-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{K}$\n    $a_{2i} = 1$\n    All these $a_j$ are in $[0,1]$ since $K=50000 > 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the range for the worst-case sequence:**\n    Let's compute the partial sums $S_k$ using the greedy strategy for this sequence:\n    - $S_0 = 0$.\n    - $S_1 = S_0 + a_1 = 0 + (1 - 1/K) = 1 - 1/K$. (Since $S_0=0$, $\\epsilon_1=1$).\n    - $S_2 = S_1 - a_2 = (1 - 1/K) - 1 = -1/K$. (Since $S_1>0$, $\\epsilon_2=-1$).\n    - $S_3 = S_2 + a_3 = -1/K + (1 - 1/K) = 1 - 2/K$. (Since $S_2<0$, $\\epsilon_3=1$).\n    - $S_4 = S_3 - a_4 = (1 - 2/K) - 1 = -2/K$. (Since $S_3>0$, $\\epsilon_4=-1$).\n    This pattern continues. For $k=1, \\dots, K-1$, the odd-indexed sums are $S_{2k-1} = 1 - k/K > 0$ and the even-indexed sums are $S_{2k} = -k/K < 0$.\n    Let's see what happens at the end of the sequence:\n    - $S_{2K-2} = S_{2(K-1)} = -(K-1)/K$.\n    - $S_{2K-1} = S_{2K-2} + a_{2K-1} = -(K-1)/K + (1-1/K) = -(K-1)/K + (K-1)/K = 0$.\n    - $S_{2K} = S_N = S_{N-1} + a_N = 0 + 1 = 1$. (Since $S_{N-1}=0$, $\\epsilon_N=1$).\n\n    Now let's find the maximum and minimum values over the entire sequence of sums $S_0, \\dots, S_N$.\n    The sums are of the form $1-k/K$, $-k/K$, and finally 0 and 1.\n    - Maximum sum: $\\max(1 - 1/K, 1) = 1$. This is achieved at $S_N$.\n    - Minimum sum: $\\min(0, -1/K, -2/K, \\dots, -(K-1)/K) = -(K-1)/K$. This is achieved at $S_{N-2}$.\n    The range for this sequence is $\\max S_k - \\min S_k = 1 - (-(K-1)/K) = 1 + (K-1)/K = (2K-1)/K = 2 - 1/K$.\n    This range is known to be the maximum possible, so $W_{max} = 2 - 1/K$.\n\n6.  **Finding M:**\n    We must satisfy the condition $2B \\ge W_{max}$. Substituting the expressions for $B$ and $W_{max}$:\n    $2(1 - 10^{-M}) \\ge 2 - \\frac{1}{K}$\n    $1 - 10^{-M} \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{2K}$\n    With $K = 50000$, we get:\n    $1 - 10^{-M} \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{100000}$\n    $-10^{-M} \\ge -10^{-5}$\n    $10^{-M} \\le 10^{-5}$\n    Taking $\\log_{10}$ on both sides:\n    $-M \\le -5$\n    $M \\ge 5$.\n    The smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this condition is 5."
