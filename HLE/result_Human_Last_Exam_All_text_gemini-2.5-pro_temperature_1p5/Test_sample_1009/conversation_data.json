    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. This implies the Lindel√∂f number is countable, $L(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **First-countable:** There is a countable local base of neighborhoods at each point. For a topological group, this means the character at the identity, and thus for the whole space, is countable: $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The group may fail the T2 separation axiom. This is a crucial point, as many standard theorems for topological groups assume the Hausdorff property.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**\n\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The fact that $G$ is not Hausdorff means $N \\neq \\{e\\}$.\nConsider the quotient group $H = G/N$. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous, open, and surjective. The group $H$ equipped with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\nLet's examine the properties inherited by the quotient group $H = G/N$:\n*   **Compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space, $H$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** Since the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is open and continuous, $H$ is first-countable. A countable local base at $e \\in G$ maps to a countable local base at $N \\in H$. So, $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established, the quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is always a Hausdorff group.\n\n**3. Apply theorems for compact Hausdorff groups to H**\n\nNow we have a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $H = G/N$. Several powerful theorems apply to such groups:\n*   For any compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to its character: $w(H) = \\chi(H)$. Since $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$, we have $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. This means $H$ is second-countable.\n*   Arhangel'skii's theorem states that for any Hausdorff space $X$, $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$. For $H$, this gives $|H| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n**4. Relate the properties of G, H, and N**\n\nThe group $G$ is partitioned by the cosets of $N$. Therefore, the cardinality of $G$ is the product of the cardinalities of $H$ and $N$: $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\nSince $|H| \\le \\frak c$, we must have:\n$|N| = \\frac{|G|}{|H|} \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nSince $N$ is a subset of $G$, $|N| \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nThus, the cardinality of the subgroup $N$ is exactly $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**5. Relate the weights of G, H, and N**\n\nFor a topological group $G$ and a closed normal subgroup $N$, there is a general inequality relating their weights:\n$w(G) \\le w(G/N) \\cdot w(N)$.\nIn our case, $H = G/N$, so $w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N)$.\nSubstituting $w(H)=\\aleph_0$:\n$w(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot w(N) = w(N)$ (assuming $w(N)$ is infinite, which it must be for an infinite group that is not discrete).\n\nAlso, since $N$ is a subspace of $G$, its weight cannot exceed the weight of $G$: $w(N) \\le w(G)$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we get $w(G) = w(N)$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible weight of the subgroup $N$.\n\n**6. Determine the maximum possible weight of N**\n\nLet's list the properties of $N$:\n*   $N$ is a compact topological group (as a closed subset of a compact space $G$).\n*   $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $N$ is first-countable (as a subspace of a first-countable space $G$), so $\\chi(N) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since $N$ is an infinite compact group, it cannot be discrete, so $\\chi(N)=\\aleph_0$.\n\nNow we need to find the maximum possible weight of $N$. For any topological group $K$, a basis can be formed by taking translates of a local base at the identity, i.e., $\\{xU_i : x \\in K, U_i \\in \\mathcal{B}_e\\}$, where $\\mathcal{B}_e$ is a local base at the identity. This gives a general upper bound on the weight:\n$w(K) \\le |K| \\cdot \\chi(K)$.\nFor the group $N$, this inequality becomes:\n$w(N) \\le |N| \\cdot \\chi(N) = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nSo, the weight of $G$ (which equals the weight of $N$) is at most $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**7. Check if this upper bound is attainable**\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* weight. We must consider if this upper bound of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ can be achieved.\n\nMany theorems that constrain the weight of a group based on its cardinality rely on the Hausdorff property. For instance, for a Hausdorff group $K$, we have $|K| \\le 2^{w(K)}$. If this held for $G$, it would imply $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le 2^{w(G)}$, so $w(G) \\ge 2^\\frak c$. However, this theorem does not hold for non-Hausdorff groups.\n\nTo demonstrate that this constraint is lifted, consider the following construction:\nLet $H_0 = \\{e\\}$ be the trivial group. Let $N_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Equip $N_0$ with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N_0$). Let $G = H_0 \\times N_0 \\cong N_0$.\n*   $G$ is a topological group.\n*   $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ is compact (indiscrete topology is always compact).\n*   $G$ is first-countable (the single open neighborhood $\\{G\\}$ forms a local base at every point).\n*   $w(G) = 1$ (the base is just $\\{G\\}$).\nThis example satisfies all the hypotheses of the problem, and its weight is 1 (or $\\aleph_0$ if we use $S^1 \\times N_0$). This shows that a very large cardinality does not force a large weight in the non-Hausdorff case.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the largest *possible* weight. We have established an upper bound $w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The lack of the Hausdorff property removes the standard theorems that would force the weight to be smaller. There is no general theorem that prevents a group with these properties from attaining this upper bound. The construction of such a group is complex, but its existence is plausible because the normal constraints are absent. Therefore, the supremum of possible weights is the general upper bound we found.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe weight of the group $G$ is bounded above by its cardinality, $w(G) \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The non-Hausdorff condition allows for groups where this upper bound is the maximum possible value."
