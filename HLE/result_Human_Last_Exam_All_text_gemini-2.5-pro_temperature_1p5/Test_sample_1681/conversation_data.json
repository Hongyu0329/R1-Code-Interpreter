    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Classical Game\nFirst, let's understand the game in a classical context. The payoff matrix is:\n```\n        Player 2\n        Cooperate (C)   Defect (D)\nC       (5, 5)          (0, 7)\nD       (7, 0)          (1, 1)\n```\nWhere the payoffs are (Player 1, Player 2). Let's identify the standard payoff notations:\n*   Reward for mutual cooperation (R): 5\n*   Temptation to defect (T): 7\n*   Sucker's payoff for cooperating against a defector (S): 0\n*   Punishment for mutual defection (P): 1\n\nThe condition for a Prisoner's Dilemma is T > R > P > S, which holds here (7 > 5 > 1 > 0).\n\nIn classical game theory, we look for the Nash Equilibrium. For each player, \"Defect\" is the dominant strategy:\n*   If Player 2 Cooperates, Player 1 gets 7 by Defecting versus 5 by Cooperating. So, Player 1 should Defect.\n*   If Player 2 Defects, Player 1 gets 1 by Defecting versus 0 by Cooperating. So, Player 1 should Defect.\nSince Defecting is always the better option for Player 1 regardless of Player 2's choice, it is a dominant strategy. The same logic applies to Player 2.\n\nTherefore, the unique Nash Equilibrium in the classical game is (Defect, Defect), which results in the payoff **(1, 1)**. This outcome is suboptimal, as both players would be better off with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of **(5, 5)**, but they have no individual incentive to choose cooperation.\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the Quantum Game Framework\nWhen the game is played in \"quantum space,\" the rules change. We will use the widely-accepted Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The game starts with the two players sharing an entangled quantum state. The problem says, \"You design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This implies we can choose the level of entanglement. For the best possible resolution to the dilemma, we will assume a maximally entangled initial state, which is standard in this protocol.\n*   **Strategies:** Instead of just choosing C or D, players' strategies are unitary transformations (from the SU(2) group of matrices) applied to their respective qubits. The classical strategies are a subset of this larger space.\n    *   Cooperate (C) corresponds to the identity operator `I`.\n    *   Defect (D) corresponds to a spin-flip operator, like `iσ_x`.\n*   **Measurement:** After the players apply their strategies, a disentangling operation is performed, and the final state is measured to determine the outcome and corresponding payoffs.\n\n### Step 3: Identify New Quantum Equilibria\nIn the EWL framework, the expanded strategy space can introduce new Nash Equilibria that don't exist in the classical game.\n\n*   **Condition for Resolution:** A key finding in quantum game theory is that for Prisoner's Dilemma games where `2R > T + P`, a new, Pareto-optimal equilibrium can emerge. Let's check this condition for our payoff matrix:\n    *   `2 * 5 > 7 + 1`\n    *   `10 > 8`\n    *   The condition holds. This means the dilemma can be resolved in the quantum version of the game.\n\n*   **The Quantum Equilibrium:** When the condition `2R > T + P` is met and the initial state is sufficiently entangled (including maximal entanglement), a new Nash Equilibrium appears.\n    1.  The classical (D, D) equilibrium with payoff (1, 1) still exists.\n    2.  A new equilibrium, let's call it (Q, Q), emerges. This is when both players choose a specific quantum strategy `Q` (for example, `Q = iσ_z`). At this equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Equilibrium Payoff\nThe payoff at this new quantum Nash Equilibrium (Q, Q) is precisely the reward for mutual cooperation, (R, R).\n\n*   For our given matrix, R = 5.\n*   Therefore, the payoff at the (Q, Q) equilibrium is **(5, 5)**.\n\nThis outcome is the same as the classical (Cooperate, Cooperate) result, but unlike in the classical game, it is a stable equilibrium point in the quantum version. Since the (5, 5) payoff is strictly better for both players than the (1, 1) payoff from the classical equilibrium, rational players would choose to play the quantum strategy `Q` to achieve this superior outcome.\n\nThe question asks for the equilibrium point. While the classical (D, D) is still an equilibrium, the salient new equilibrium introduced by the quantum framework—and the one that solves the dilemma—is (Q, Q). The resulting payoff represents this equilibrium point.\n\nFinal Answer: The equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, given the optimal setup, corresponds to the payoff for mutual cooperation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{(5,5)}$."
