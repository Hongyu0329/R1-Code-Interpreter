    "Let the given quantity be $y^2$, so we have the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\nWe are looking for the number of integer values of $x$ for which $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square.\nLet $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\nWe can try to test some small integer values of $x$.\nFor $x=0$, $P(0) = 1056$, which is not a perfect square.\nFor $x=1$, $P(1) = 1-16-72+1056 = 969$, not a perfect square.\nFor $x=2$, $P(2) = 8-16(4)-72(2)+1056 = 8-64-144+1056 = 856$, not a perfect square.\nFor $x=3$, $P(3) = 27-16(9)-72(3)+1056 = 27-144-216+1056 = 723$, not a perfect square.\nFor $x=4$, $P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4^2) - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 1120 - 544 = 576 = 24^2$. So $x=4$ is a solution.\nFor $x=-4$, $P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1344 - 320 = 1024 = 32^2$. So $x=-4$ is a solution.\n\nLet's try to rewrite the polynomial $P(x)$. Since $x=4$ is a solution, we can write $P(x)$ in terms of $(x-4)$.\n$P(x) = (x-4)(x^2 - 12x - 120) + 576$.\nLet's check this factorization:\n$(x-4)(x^2-12x-120) = x^3 - 12x^2 - 120x - 4x^2 + 48x + 480 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 480$.\nSo, $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 480 + 1056 - 480 = (x-4)(x^2 - 12x - 120) + 576$. This is correct.\n\nWe want $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y$.\n$y^2 = (x-4)(x^2-12x-120) + 576$\n$y^2 - 576 = (x-4)(x^2-12x-120)$\n$(y-24)(y+24) = (x-4)(x^2-12x-120)$.\nLet's analyze the quadratic factor $x^2-12x-120$. We can complete the square for it:\n$x^2-12x-120 = (x-6)^2 - 36 - 120 = (x-6)^2 - 156$.\nSo the equation becomes $(y-24)(y+24) = (x-4)((x-6)^2 - 156)$.\n\nWe have already found the solutions for $x=4$ and $x=-4$. Let's test other values.\nFor $x=17$:\n$P(17) = (17-4)((17-6)^2-156) + 576 = 13(11^2-156)+576 = 13(121-156)+576 = 13(-35)+576 = -455+576=121=11^2$.\nSo $x=17$ is a solution.\n\nLet's see if there are other solutions. Let $u = x-6$. Then $x-4 = u+2$.\nThe equation is $(y-24)(y+24) = (u+2)(u^2-156)$.\nWe are looking for integer values of $u$ (since $x$ is an integer) for which $(u+2)(u^2-156)$ gives a value of the form $y^2-576$.\n\nLet's check if there are any other solutions by letting $(x-4) = kA^2$ and $((x-6)^2-156) = kB^2$ for some square-free integer $k$.\nA special case is when $(x-6)^2 - 156$ is a square itself.\nLet $(x-6)^2 - 156 = m^2$ for some integer $m$.\n$(x-6)^2 - m^2 = 156$\n$((x-6)-m)((x-6)+m) = 156$.\nLet $A = (x-6)-m$ and $B = (x-6)+m$. Then $AB=156$.\n$B-A=2m$ is even, so $A$ and $B$ must have the same parity. Since their product is even, both must be even.\nThe pairs of even factors of 156 are:\n1) $A=2, B=78$. Then $2(x-6) = A+B = 80$, so $x-6=40$, $x=46$.\nIf $x=46$, $(x-6)^2 - 156 = 40^2-156=1600-156=1444=38^2$.\nThen $P(46) = (46-4)(1444)+576 = 42(1444)+576=60648+576=61224$.\n$\\sqrt{61224} \\approx 247.43$, not an integer. So $x=46$ is not a solution.\n2) $A=-78, B=-2$. Then $2(x-6)=-80$, $x-6=-40$, $x=-34$.\n$P(-34) = (-34-4)((-34-6)^2-156)+576 = -38(1444)+576 = -54872+576 = -54296$, not a perfect square.\n3) $A=6, B=26$. Then $2(x-6)=32$, $x-6=16$, $x=22$.\n$P(22)=(22-4)((22-6)^2-156)+576 = 18(16^2-156)+576 = 18(256-156)+576=18(100)+576 = 1800+576=2376$, not a perfect square.\n4) $A=-26, B=-6$. Then $2(x-6)=-32$, $x-6=-16$, $x=-10$.\n$P(-10)=(-10-4)((-10-6)^2-156)+576=-14(256-156)+576=-14(100)+576=-1400+576=-824$, not a perfect square.\n\nWe can transform the original equation $y^2=x^3-16x^2-72x+1056$ into a Mordell equation.\nThis is an elliptic curve, and finding all integer points can be quite involved. However, for a problem of this type, the number of integer solutions is usually small.\nThe analysis for large $x$ can show that there are only a finite number of solutions.\nLet $y^2=u^3+2u^2-156u-312+576=u^3+2u^2-156u+264$ where $u=x-4$. This does not seem simpler.\n\nLet's re-verify the solutions we have found.\n$x=4, P(4)=576=24^2$. Correct.\n$x=-4, P(-4)=1024=32^2$. Correct.\n$x=17, P(17)=121=11^2$. Correct.\n\nThe question asks \"for how many integers $x$\". So we are counting the values of $x$. We have found three values so far: 4, -4, 17.\n\nIt is known that the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ has a finite number of integer solutions. A full proof that there are no other solutions is complex and might involve techniques from number theory on elliptic curves. Given the context, it is highly likely that we have found all solutions by testing small integers and checking some special algebraic forms. The solutions found are $x = -4, 4, 17$. There are 3 such integer values for $x$.\n\nFinal Check:\n$P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$.\n$P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4)^2 - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$.\n$P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17)^2 - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 = 11^2$.\nAll three are correct. There are no other \"obvious\" solutions.\n\nFinal Answer is the count of these values of $x$."
