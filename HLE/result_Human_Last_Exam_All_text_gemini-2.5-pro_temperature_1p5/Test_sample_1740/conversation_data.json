    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to determine the total number of unique members of the \"let-7\" microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n2.  **Define the \"let-7 family\":** The let-7 family is a group of miRNAs defined by a highly conserved \"seed sequence\". This shared sequence means they can regulate a similar set of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). It is one of the most well-studied and evolutionarily conserved miRNA families.\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between \"Members\" and \"Genes\":** This is a critical point. A miRNA \"family member\" usually refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence. However, a single mature miRNA sequence can be produced from multiple different genes (precursor miRNAs) located at different positions in the genome. The question asks for \"members,\" which is most commonly interpreted as the number of distinct mature miRNAs.\n\n4.  **List the Human let-7 Family Members:** Consulting primary databases like miRBase (the central repository for miRNA data) and established scientific literature, we can compile a list of the canonical let-7 family members in *Homo sapiens* (prefix: hsa).\n\n    The identified mature members are:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98\n\n5.  **Count the Members:** Counting the unique members from the list above gives a total of 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Inclusion of miR-98:** Although it has a different name, miR-98 shares the same seed sequence as the other let-7 members and is universally considered part of the let-7 family. This is a common point of confusion.\n\n2.  **Multiple Genes for a Single Member:** Some let-7 members are encoded by more than one gene, but they produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n    *   **let-7a** is produced from three distinct precursor genes: `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3`.\n    *   **let-7f** is produced from two distinct precursor genes: `let-7f-1` and `let-7f-2`.\n    *   All other members (let-7b, -7c, -7d, -7e, -7g, -7i, and miR-98) are each encoded by a single gene.\n    *   If the question were \"how many human genes encode for let-7 family miRNAs?\", the answer would be 12 (3 for let-7a + 2 for let-7f + 7 for the others). However, the question asks for \"members\", referring to the 9 unique mature sequences.\n\n3.  **Exclusion of Non-Human or Pseudogene Members:** Some let-7 members exist in other species but not in humans. For example, `let-7j` is a pseudogene in humans, meaning it is a non-functional genetic remnant and is not counted as an active member.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nBased on the list of unique, functional mature miRNA sequences identified in humans, the count is:\nlet-7a + let-7b + let-7c + let-7d + let-7e + let-7f + let-7g + let-7i + miR-98 = **9 members**.\n\n<<<9>>>"
