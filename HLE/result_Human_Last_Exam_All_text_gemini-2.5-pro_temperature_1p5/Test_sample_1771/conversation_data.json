    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti*.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **PIE Root and Form:** The given PIE form is *seh₂gieti*.\n    *   The root is *seh₂g-*. The laryngeal *h₂* has the effect of \"coloring\" an adjacent *e* vowel to an *a* vowel. Therefore, the root is often cited as *sāg-*.\n    *   The suffix is *-ye/o-*, which marks a present tense verb.\n    *   The ending is *-ti*, the 3rd person singular active indicative ending.\n    *   The meaning is related to perception, tracking, and seeking, as supported by the Latin and Hittite cognates.\n\n2.  **Major Sound Laws:** The development into the Germanic languages is governed by several major, systematic sound changes.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** Governs the shift of PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Vowel Shifts:** Specific, regular changes in vowel quality between language stages (e.g., PIE *ā* > PGmc *ō*).\n    *   **i-Umlaut (i-Mutation):** The fronting of a back vowel in a root syllable caused by an /i/ or /j/ in the following syllable. This is crucial for Old English and Old Norse.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** A further shift of stop consonants that distinguishes High German from other Germanic languages.\n    *   **Palatalization:** The fronting of a velar consonant (like *k* or *g*) when followed by a front vowel or glide (*i*, *e*, *j*). This is a key feature in the development of Old English.\n\n3.  **Verb Classification:** The PIE suffix *-ye/o-* leads to the verb becoming a **Class 1 Weak Verb** in the Germanic languages. This class is characterized by a suffix containing a *-j-* in Proto-Germanic, which is the direct cause of i-umlaut in the daughter languages.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **Consonant Change (Grimm's Law):** The PIE voiced velar stop **g** becomes the PGmc voiceless velar stop **k**.\n    *   *sā**g**-* → *sā**k**-*\n*   **Vowel Change:** The PIE long vowel **ā** becomes the PGmc long vowel **ō**.\n    *   *s**ā**k-* → *s**ō**k-*\n*   **Verb Formation:** The root *sōk-* combines with the Class 1 Weak Verb suffix *-ja(n)-*. The reconstructed PGmc infinitive is **\\*sōkijaną**. The meaning becomes 'to seek, to search for'.\n\n**Answer for Proto-Germanic:** **\\*sōkijaną**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkijaną*\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The **j** in the suffix causes the root vowel **ō** to be fronted. In Old Norse, the result of i-umlaut on *ō* is **œ**.\n    *   *\\*s**ō**kjaną* → *s**œ**kja...*\n*   **Suffix Change:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* is reduced to **-a** in Old Norse. The *j* from the suffix is retained in the orthography.\n*   **Result:** The verb becomes **sœkja**.\n\n**Answer for Old Norse:** **sœkja**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkijaną*\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The **j** in the suffix causes the root vowel **ō** to be fronted. In Old English, the result of i-umlaut on *ō* is **ē**.\n    *   *\\*s**ō**kjaną* → *\\*s**ē**kjan* (intermediate step)\n*   **Palatalization:** The velar consonant **k** is followed by the palatal glide **j**. This combination (*kj*) palatalizes to the affricate **/tʃ/**, which is spelled with the letter **c** in Old English. The *j* is then lost (absorbed).\n    *   *\\*sē**kj**an* → *sē**c**an*\n*   **Suffix Change:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-an** in Old English.\n*   **Result:** The verb becomes **sēcan**.\n\n**Answer for Old English:** **sēcan**\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *\\*sōkijaną*\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** This is the most defining change for OHG. The PGmc voiceless stop **k** in the middle of a word after a vowel shifts to the long voiceless fricative **/xː/**, written **hh** (or often simplified to **h**).\n    *   *\\*sō**k**ijaną* → *\\*sō**hh**...*\n*   **Vowel Change:** Independently of the consonant shift, the PGmc long vowel **ō** becomes the diphthong **uo** in Old High German.\n    *   *\\*s**ō**hh...* → *\\*s**uo**hh...*\n*   **Suffix Change & Umlaut Note:** The PGmc infinitive ending becomes **-en** in OHG. While the *j* was present historically to cause i-umlaut, in the OHG infinitive form of Class 1 weak verbs, the umlauted vowel is typically not written. The un-umlauted diphthong *uo* is standard for the infinitive.\n*   **Result:** The verb becomes **suohhen** (a common spelling variant is *suochen*).\n\n**Answer for Old High German:** **suohhen**\n\n---\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkijaną*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkja*\n*   **Old English:** *sēcan*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhen*\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkijaną*; **Old Norse:** *sœkja*; **Old English:** *sēcan*; **Old High German:** *suohhen*>>>"
