    "This is a classic problem in the field of point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Since we're talking about planar objects, they are subsets of the Euclidean plane (`R^2`), which is a metric space. So, we are looking for compact and connected subsets of the plane.\n    *   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the plane (`R^2`). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of `R^2`.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** A topological space `X` is homogeneous if for any two points `x` and `y` in `X`, there exists a homeomorphism (a topology-preserving transformation) `f: X -> X` such that `f(x) = y`. In simple terms, the space looks the same from every point.\n    *   **Homeomorphism Classes:** We are not counting every single possible shape, but rather grouping shapes that are topologically equivalent (i.e., one can be continuously deformed into another). For example, a square and a circle are in the same homeomorphism class.\n\n2.  **Applying the Classification Theorem:**\n    The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous result in topology, primarily established by the work of R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones in the 1950s. Their theorems allow us to systematically categorize all such objects. We can classify them based on their fundamental topological properties.\n\n    Let `X` be a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Degenerate vs. Non-degenerate Continua**\n        A continuum can be *degenerate* (consisting of a single point) or *non-degenerate* (containing more than one point).\n        *   **The Point:** A single point is compact, connected, planar, and trivially homogeneous. This forms our first homeomorphism class.\n\n    Now, let's consider the non-degenerate cases.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Presence of Arcs**\n        A major dividing line in the classification is whether the continuum contains a topological arc (a space homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1]).\n        *   **Theorem (Bing, 1954):** If a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum contains an arc, it must be homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve** (i.e., a circle).\n        *   Examples like a line segment or the letter 'Y' are not homogeneous because their points are not all equivalent (e.g., endpoints vs. interior points). The circle is homogeneous because any point can be rotated to any other point. This gives us our second class.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Arc-less Continua**\n        What if the continuum contains no arcs? These are sometimes called \"point-like\" or \"arc-less\" continua. Here, we must consider another property: decomposability. A continuum is *decomposable* if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is *indecomposable*.\n\n        *   **Indecomposable Case:**\n            *   **Theorem (Bing):** The only non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continuum is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a snake-like, infinitely crooked object that is famously complex but possesses these exact properties. It does not separate the plane. This gives us our third class.\n\n        *   **Decomposable Case (and Arc-less):**\n            *   **Theorem (Jones, 1955):** The only non-degenerate, decomposable, homogeneous planar continuum that contains no arcs is the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This object is formed by taking a \"circular\" chain of pseudo-arcs. Unlike the pseudo-arc, it is decomposable and separates the plane into two regions (like a circle does). This gives us our fourth class.\n\n3.  **Summary of the Classes:**\n    The theorems of Bing and Jones provide a complete classification. Every homogeneous planar continuum must fall into one of these four distinct categories.\n\n    1.  **The Point:** Degenerate.\n    2.  **The Simple Closed Curve (Circle):** Non-degenerate, contains arcs, decomposable.\n    3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** Non-degenerate, contains no arcs, indecomposable.\n    4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Non-degenerate, contains no arcs, decomposable.\n\n    These four types are topologically distinct from one another, so they represent four unique homeomorphism classes. It is important to note that other homogeneous continua exist (like the solenoids), but they are not planar and are therefore excluded by the conditions of the question.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nBased on the complete classification provided by cornerstone theorems in continuum theory, there are exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua.\n\nThe final count is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
