    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the linguistic rule: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. The rule states that a long vowel or a diphthong becomes a short vowel when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\n*   **Key Conditions for Trisyllabic Laxing:**\n    1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n    2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end).\n    3.  That vowel must have been long in an earlier stage of English or in a related base word.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word against the rule.**\n\nLet's examine each word in the list to see if it meets the conditions for trisyllabic laxing. We will look at its syllable count, the vowel in question, and its relation to a base word with a long vowel.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`south-ern`, /ˈsʌð.ən/).\n    *   **Analysis:** As a two-syllable word, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing by definition. Although the vowel in *south* (/saʊθ/) is long/a diphthong and it shortens in *southern* (/ʌ/), this change is due to a different phonological process, not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four (`de-riv-a-tive`, /dɪˈrɪv.ə.tɪv/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The base word is *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a long diphthong /aɪ/. In *derivative*, the second syllable \"-riv-\" is the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel /aɪ/ from *derive* has shortened to the short vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four (`se-ren-i-ty`, /səˈrɛn.ɪ.ti/).\n    *   **Analysis:** The base word is *serene* (/səˈriːn/), which has a long vowel /iː/. In *serenity*, the second syllable \"-ren-\" is the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel /iː/ from *serene* has shortened to the short vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`pleas-ant`, /ˈplɛz.ənt/).\n    *   **Analysis:** As a two-syllable word, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. The vowel in its base word *please* (/pliːz/) is long /iː/, and it shortens to /ɛ/ in *pleasant*. However, this is not due to the trisyllabic rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** Three (`grat-i-tude`, /ˈɡræt.ɪ.tjuːd/).\n    *   **Analysis:** We can compare this to the related word *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪt.fəl/), which preserves the long vowel/diphthong /eɪ/. In the three-syllable word *gratitude*, the first syllable \"grat-\" is the antepenultimate syllable, and its vowel has shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is another example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`shad-ow`, /ˈʃæd.oʊ/).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a two-syllable word, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. More importantly, its origin is from Old English *sceadu*, where the first vowel (`ea`) was already short. There was no historical long vowel in this position to be shortened or \"laxed.\"\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the words that did not undergo the process.**\n\nWe have identified three words that did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. All are two-syllable words, which is the primary reason the rule does not apply.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial distinction.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` show a shortening process when compared to their base words (*south*, *please*), even if it's not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `shadow`, on the other hand, never had a long vowel in its first syllable to begin with. The vowel was short in its Old English root and has remained short.\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the most definitive answer because not only does the trisyllabic rule not apply due to syllable count, but the fundamental condition of having a long vowel to shorten was never met. It has not undergone this type of sound change at all.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
