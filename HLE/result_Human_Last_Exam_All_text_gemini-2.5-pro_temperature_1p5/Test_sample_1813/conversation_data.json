    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concepts**\n\n*   **Continued Fraction:** Any rational number \\(p/q\\) can be expressed as a finite simple continued fraction. If \\(0 < p/q < 1\\), the form is \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\), where \\(a_i\\) are positive integers and we require \\(a_n > 1\\) for uniqueness.\n*   **Generalized Markov Number (\\(m_{p/q}\\)):** In this context, the generalized Markov number associated with a rational \\(p/q = [0; a_1, \\ldots, a_n]\\) is an integer derived from the sequence of partial quotients \\( (a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\). It is defined as the trace of a matrix product. Let \\( T_k = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then the matrix associated with the sequence is \\( M = T_{a_1} T_{a_2} \\cdots T_{a_n} \\). The generalized Markov number is \\( m_{p/q} = \\operatorname{tr}(M) \\).\n*   **Associated Continued Fraction:** The \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\)\" is the purely periodic continued fraction whose period is the sequence of partial quotients \\( (a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\) derived from \\(p/q\\). This periodic continued fraction, let's call it \\( \\alpha \\), is \\( \\alpha = [\\overline{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n}] \\). This number \\( \\alpha \\) is a quadratic irrational, and its properties (specifically, how well it's approximated by rationals) are governed by the value of \\( m_{p/q} \\).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Computation**\n\n**Step 2.1: Find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).**\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the partial quotients.\nFirst, we invert the fraction since it's less than 1: \\( 7/4 \\).\n1.  \\( 7 \\div 4 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 \\). So, \\( a_1 = 1 \\). The fraction becomes \\( 1/(3/4) = 4/3 \\).\n2.  \\( 4 \\div 3 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 \\). So, \\( a_2 = 1 \\). The fraction becomes \\( 1/(1/3) = 3 \\).\n3.  \\( 3 \\div 1 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 0 \\). So, \\( a_3 = 3 \\). The algorithm terminates.\n\nThe continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\( [0; a_1, a_2, a_3] \\), which is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\nThe last term \\( a_3=3 \\) is greater than 1, so this is the standard unique representation.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must use the standard representation of the continued fraction to get a unique sequence of quotients. The condition \\(a_n > 1\\) ensures this uniqueness.\n\n**Step 2.2: Identify the sequence of quotients.**\nFrom the continued fraction \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\), the sequence of partial quotients is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n**Step 2.3: Determine the associated continued fraction.**\nThe continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the one whose periodic part is the sequence we just found.\nThis is the purely periodic continued fraction \\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3}] \\).\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the continued fraction *associated with* \\(m_{4/7}\\), not the continued fraction of the number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself. For completeness, let's compute \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\\( m_{4/7} = \\operatorname{tr}(T_1 T_1 T_3) \\)\n\\( T_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( T_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\\( T_1 T_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\\( (T_1 T_1) T_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(3)+1(1) & 2(1)+1(0) \\\\ 1(3)+1(1) & 1(1)+1(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 2 \\\\ 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\nThe trace of this matrix is \\( \\operatorname{tr}(M) = 7 + 1 = 8 \\).\nSo, \\( m_{4/7} = 8 \\). The continued fraction of the number 8 is simply \\( [8] \\), but this is not what is meant by the \"associated continued fraction\" in this context. The associated continued fraction is the one that *defines* the number \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The sequence of partial quotients is \\( (1, 1, 3) \\). The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction formed from this sequence.\n\nThe associated continued fraction is \\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3}] \\). This can be written out as:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\ddots}}}} $$"
