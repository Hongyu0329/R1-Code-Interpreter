    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Definition**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system with state matrix `A` and input matrix `B`:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix, defined as `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. The feedback law is `u = Fx`.\n\n**Step 2: Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ_1 = -1 + j` and `λ_2 = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial `P_d(λ)` is formed from these roots:\n`P_d(λ) = (λ - λ_1)(λ - λ_2)`\n`P_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`P_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\n\nLet the state feedback gain matrix `F` be a 2x2 matrix:\n`F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n\nNow, we compute the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n`BF = [[1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22], [1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22]]`\n`BF = [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `P(λ) = λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\nFor our closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12 = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) * f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22) * (1 + f11)`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `P_cl(λ) = λ^2 - (f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)λ + det(A_cl)`.\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Polynomials and Formulate Equations**\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of `P_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `P_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`, we get two equations:\n\n1.  From the coefficient of `λ`:\n    `-(f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1) = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1 = -2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1` (Equation I)\n\n2.  From the constant term:\n    `det(A_cl) = 2`\n    `f12(-1 + f11 + 2*f21) - (1 + f11)(1 + f12 + 2*f22) = 2` (Equation II)\n\n**Step 6: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nWe have two equations and four unknowns (`f11`, `f12`, `f21`, `f22`). This indicates that the system is underdetermined, and there are infinite solutions for the gain matrix `F`. This is expected for a controllable multi-input system. We can find a particular solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nLet's assume that we only use the first input for feedback, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nSet `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nNow, the system of equations simplifies:\n*   Equation I becomes: `f11 + f12 = -1`\n*   The closed-loop matrix becomes `A_cl = [[-1 + f11, 1 + f12], [1 + f11, f12]]`.\n*   The determinant is `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11)f12 - (1 + f12)(1 + f11) = -f12 + f11*f12 - (1 + f11 + f12 + f11*f12) = -f11 - 2*f12 - 1`.\n*   Equation II (from `det(A_cl) = 2`) becomes: `-f11 - 2*f12 - 1 = 2` which simplifies to `-f11 - 2*f12 = 3`.\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f11 + f12 = -1`\n2.  `-f11 - 2*f12 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f11 + f12) + (-f11 - 2*f12) = -1 + 3`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = -2` back into the first equation:\n`f11 + (-2) = -1`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found a solution: `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, `f22 = 0`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer Construction**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the closed-loop matrix `A + BF` with this `F`:\n`A + BF = [[-1 + 1 + 2*0, 1 + (-2) + 2*0], [1 + 1, -2]]`\n`A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - (A+BF)) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\nThe roots of this equation are indeed `-1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
