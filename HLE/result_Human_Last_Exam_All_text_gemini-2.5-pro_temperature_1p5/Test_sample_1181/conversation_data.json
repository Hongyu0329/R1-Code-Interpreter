    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from the 1972 movie *Solaris*, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The defining characteristic is that this person is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's characters and their specific dialogues or expressed feelings.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Characters:**\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** He is the protagonist, a psychologist sent to the space station. The film begins and ends at his father's dacha on Earth, emphasizing his deep connection to it. He is certainly homesick and brings tapes of Earth sounds with him. However, his homesickness is presented as a profound and painful longing, not something he is necessarily \"ashamed\" of in the way the question implies.\n    *   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or simulacrum of Kris's deceased wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has no actual memories of Earth and her entire existence is confined to the station. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never experienced.\n    *   **C. Snaut:** He is a cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. Snaut is portrayed as jaded, philosophical, and often intoxicated. He has been in space for a long time and frequently reflects on the nature of humanity and its place in the universe. In a key conversation with Kris in the library, Snaut confesses his deep-seated homesickness. He expresses a feeling of shame that after all the effort to explore the cosmos, he finds himself longing for simple, mundane terrestrial things. While the exact quote may vary slightly in translation, the sentiment is precise: he is ashamed of this nostalgic \"weakness.\" He says something to the effect of being ashamed to long for a swamp. \"The sound of leaves rustling\" is a very similar, archetypal Earthly image that captures the essence of his confession.\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** He is the astrobiologist on the station. Sartorius is portrayed as cold, clinical, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their predicament. He tries to suppress emotion and would be the least likely character to admit to a sentimental feeling like homesickness, let alone feel ashamed of it. He sees such feelings as a distraction from his work.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** He was a scientist on the station who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris. In the video, he is in a state of terror and confusion, warning Kris about the phenomena on the station. His focus is on the immediate horror, not on nostalgic feelings for Earth.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Character:** Based on the analysis, Dr. Snaut is the character who explicitly voices the sentiment of being ashamed of his profound homesickness. He sees it as an ironic failure that humanity reaches for the stars only to miss the mud and swamps of Earth. This aligns perfectly with the feeling described in the question. The phrase \"miss the sound of leaves rustling\" perfectly encapsulates the type of simple, earthly nostalgia that Snaut feels ashamed to have.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The dialogue and character arc of Dr. Snaut confirm that he is the one who is ashamed to miss the simple sensory experiences of Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
