    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific Christian theologian.\n    *   **Key Action:** This theologian \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This points to an originator of a specific conceptual system or a set of terms, not just someone who discussed the general idea.\n    *   **The Terminology's Purpose:** To \"describe changes in the laws of nature.\" This moves beyond the general concept of \"miracle\" into a more philosophical or scientific-sounding framework dealing with the alteration of the natural order itself.\n    *   **First Application:** The terminology must be applicable to the \"virgin birth of Jesus.\" This is a standard test case for any theory of miracles, involving a biological event that occurs contrary to the normal, observed laws of reproduction.\n    *   **Second Application:** The terminology must also be applicable to \"possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\" This is a more specific and distinguishing criterion. It requires the theologian's system to account not just for singular, temporary miracles, but for a potential permanent, systemic change in the very fabric of nature (e.g., the introduction of death, decay, predation, etc., as a consequence of Adam's sin).\n\n2.  **Listing Careful Points and Considerations:**\n    *   **Distinguishing from General Miracle-Talk:** Many theologians (like Augustine or Aquinas) have sophisticated views on miracles. However, the question demands a \"specialized terminology\" for \"changes in the laws of nature.\" Augustine, for example, saw miracles not as violations of nature, but as events flowing from latent potentials (*rationes seminales*) placed in nature by God from the beginning. This is different from a \"change\" in the law. Thomas Aquinas categorized miracles based on their relationship to nature's power (e.g., God doing what nature can do, but not in that order), but his framework is less focused on a permanent *alteration* of the laws themselves post-Fall.\n    *   **The \"Fall\" is the Crucial Filter:** The need for the terminology to apply to systemic changes at the Fall is key. This idea—that the laws of physics, biology, and thermodynamics were fundamentally different before the Fall—is a specific theological position. The required theologian must have addressed this directly with their conceptual toolkit.\n    *   **The Meaning of \"First\":** In the history of ideas, \"first\" can be tricky. It often refers to the first person to systematize, name, and popularize a concept in a clear and influential way, even if precursors to the idea existed. We are looking for the key systematizer.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer through Analysis:**\n    *   Searching for theologians who fit all criteria leads us away from many of the most famous historical figures (Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin) who, despite discussing the components, did not develop a single, specialized terminological system for both applications as described.\n    *   The investigation points toward a 20th-century American evangelical philosopher and theologian who was known for creating clear, systematic categories for apologetic purposes.\n    *   This theologian is **Norman Geisler**. Geisler is well-known for developing a precise framework to categorize God's actions in relation to natural law.\n    *   **Geisler's Terminology:** He distinguished between:\n        1.  **Natural law:** How God normally and consistently sustains the universe.\n        2.  **Anomaly:** A rare natural event, a \"freak of nature,\" that does not violate natural law.\n        3.  **Supernatural act (or \"reordering\"):** God working *through* or *alongside* existing natural laws to produce a result that nature, left to itself, could not. The virgin birth is a prime example: God provides the supernatural input, and the natural laws of gestation take over from there.\n        4.  **Suspension of law:** God holding a natural law in abeyance for a specific purpose (e.g., a floating axe head, which involves the suspension of the normal law of gravity for that object).\n    *   **Application to the Question's Criteria:**\n        *   **Virgin Birth:** Geisler's category of a \"supernatural act\" or \"reordering\" of natural processes describes this event perfectly within his system.\n        *   **Changes at the Fall:** Geisler's framework is also used to explain the effects of the Curse in Genesis 3. The introduction of \"thorns and thistles,\" widespread animal predation, and the \"bondage to decay\" mentioned in Romans 8 could be described in his terms as a permanent **suspension** of some of creation's original, benevolent laws and a **reordering** of nature into its current, fallen state.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Norman Geisler is the theologian who most clearly developed a specific, specialized terminology designed to classify different kinds of divine actions in relation to natural law, and this system is directly applicable to describing both singular miracles like the virgin birth and the systemic changes to the natural order proposed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n***\n\n<<<Norman Geisler>>>"
