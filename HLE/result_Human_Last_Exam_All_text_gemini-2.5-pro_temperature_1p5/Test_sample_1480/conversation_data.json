    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This is a highly complex type of fuzzy set where the membership degrees are themselves interval type-2 fuzzy sets. An IT3 Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) uses these sets in its rules.\n    *   **Rule Activation:** In any fuzzy logic system, a rule has an antecedent (the \"IF\" part) and a consequent (the \"THEN\" part). When an input is provided to the system, we first calculate the \"firing level\" or \"firing strength\" of the antecedent. Then, this firing level is used to \"activate\" the consequent set. This activation process is a form of fuzzy implication, which uses a t-norm operation to combine the antecedent's firing level with the consequent's membership function.\n    *   **T-norm:** A t-norm is a mathematical function used to model the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. Common t-norms include the minimum (`min(a, b)`) and the product (`a * b`). When a specific t-norm is not mentioned, the `minimum` operator is the most standard choice for fuzzy implication (known as Mamdani implication).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System:** The problem specifies the context of an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set.\" In a full IT3 FLS, the antecedent firing level would be a type-2 fuzzy set, and the consequent would be an IT3 FS whose vertical slices are type-2 fuzzy sets.\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Level:** The problem provides a single, crisp value: $\\Phi_k(x') = 0.7$. This is a simplification. In a full IT3 system, this would be a complex set. The value 0.7 likely represents the firing level of the \"principal\" or \"embedded\" Type-1 FLS within the IT3 structure.\n    *   **Consequent Membership Degree:** The problem gives the membership degree of the output variable in the consequent fuzzy set as a single, crisp value: $\\mu_{G_k^j}(y_j) = 0.9$. Similar to the firing level, this is a simplified value, likely from the principal membership function of the consequent set.\n    *   **Operation:** The problem explicitly states to use a \"t-norm operation.\"\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   The goal is to find the \"rule activation level.\" This is the result of the fuzzy implication, which combines the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\n    *   Let the rule activation level be denoted by `A`.\n    *   The formula is: `A = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Level, Consequent Membership Degree)`\n    *   Substituting the given values: `A = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   Since the specific t-norm is not provided, we will use the most common one: the **minimum** t-norm.\n    *   `A = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   `A = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Simplification:** The most crucial point is recognizing that despite the \"interval type-3\" context, the provided crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9) mean the problem has been simplified to a calculation that mirrors a Type-1 FLS. You are not expected to perform the full, complex calculations of an IT3 FLS.\n*   **Choice of T-norm:** The choice of t-norm affects the result. If the product t-norm were used, the answer would be $0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63$. However, `minimum` is the standard default for this type of implication.\n*   **The Principle of Implication:** The result makes logical sense. The activation level of a rule's consequent cannot be greater than the firing level of its antecedent. The conclusion of a rule can only be as \"true\" as its premise. Since the premise (antecedent) is true to a degree of 0.7, the resulting activated membership (conclusion) is capped at 0.7.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level ($\\Phi_k(x')$):** 0.7\n*   **Consequent Membership Degree ($\\mu_{G_k^j}(y_j)$):** 0.9\n*   **Operation (T-norm):** Minimum (standard assumption)\n*   **Rule Activation Level:** min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
