The optimal combination is a single-site Hafnium (Hf) catalyst supported on partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO₂). The active species is a hafnium hydride fragment covalently bound to the silica surface via a siloxy (Si-O-Hf) bond. This system is chosen for the high thermal stability and enhanced Lewis acidity imparted by the Hf/SiO₂ combination, which is critical for activating and cleaving the inert C-C bonds of polyolefins via hydrogenolysis at high temperatures. The same catalytically active site is also highly effective for olefin polymerization under milder conditions (lower temperature and high olefin concentration), demonstrating the required bifunctionality controlled by reaction parameters.
