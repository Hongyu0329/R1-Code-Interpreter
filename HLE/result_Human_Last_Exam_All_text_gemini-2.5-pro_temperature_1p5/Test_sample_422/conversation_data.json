    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Premises\nThe question sets up a specific epistemological framework with three key components:\n1.  **The JTB Definition of Knowledge:** Knowledge is defined as a Justified True Belief. For an agent S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    *   S believes P. (Belief condition)\n    *   P is true. (Truth condition)\n    *   S is justified in believing P. (Justification condition)\n2.  **A Constrained Set of Epistemic States:** The only available mental (epistemic) states an agent can have regarding a proposition are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. There are no other states like doubt, suspicion, or, crucially, \"Justified Belief\" as a standalone state. An agent either *knows* P or merely *believes* P.\n3.  **Exclusion of Gettier Problems:** We must ignore the standard Gettier-style counterexamples, which are cases of Justified True Belief that we intuitively feel are not Knowledge due to epistemic luck.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Implications of the Constraints\nThe core of the problem lies in how the severe constraint on epistemic states interacts with the JTB definition's need for \"Justification\". Let's analyze the components:\n*   **Belief:** This is our baseline epistemic state.\n*   **Knowledge:** This is our higher epistemic state, defined as Belief + Justification + Truth.\n*   **Justification:** This is not an epistemic state in itself under the given rules, but rather a necessary condition that must be met to elevate a True Belief to the state of Knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the First Problem - The Regress of Justification\n\nThe Justification condition is the source of the first major problem. To know something (P), your belief in P must be justified. What does that justification rest upon? In most philosophical accounts, justification comes from other beliefs, evidence, or perceptions. Let's call the basis for the justification of P, proposition Q.\n\n1.  To be justified in believing P, you must have some epistemic attitude toward Q.\n2.  According to the constraint, your attitude toward Q can only be **Belief** or **Knowledge**.\n\nThis leads to a dilemma:\n\n*   **Option A: Justification rests on mere Belief.** If your justification for P rests on a mere *Belief* in Q, the justification is weak. Why should a belief that is itself not required to be justified (it's just a \"Belief\") be strong enough to justify another belief to the level of Knowledge? This would build our entire structure of knowledge on potentially arbitrary or whimsical foundations.\n*   **Option B: Justification rests on Knowledge.** If your justification for P must rest on *Knowledge* of Q, this creates a vicious infinite regress. To know P, you must know Q. But to know Q, you must have a justified true belief in Q. That justification must, in turn, be based on knowledge of some other proposition R. To know R, you must know S, and so on, forever. K(P) → K(Q) → K(R) → ...\n\n**Careful Point:** The JTB model, especially under this stark two-state constraint, has no mechanism to stop this regress. It cannot appeal to \"foundational beliefs\" (like sensory data) that are justified without being based on *other* beliefs, because the only starting points it offers are \"Belief\" (which is too weak) and \"Knowledge\" (which continues the chain).\n\n**Problem 1: The model forces justification into an impossible dilemma of being either arbitrary (based on mere belief) or infinitely regressive (based on prior knowledge).**\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Second Problem - The Inability to Represent Justified Falsehoods\n\nThe JTB framework relies heavily on the concept of a belief being justified, independent of whether it is true. A rational agent can have a perfectly justified belief that happens to be false. For example, you look at a clock you know to be reliable, and it reads 3:00. You form a justified belief that it is 3:00. However, unbeknownst to you, the clock stopped one hour ago, and the actual time is 4:00.\n\nLet's analyze this state within our constrained system.\n\n1.  You have a belief: \"The time is 3:00\".\n2.  Your belief is justified (based on strong evidence from a usually reliable source).\n3.  Your belief is false.\n\nWhat is your epistemic state?\n\n*   Is it **Knowledge**? No, because the belief fails the Truth (T) condition.\n*   Therefore, under the constraint that the only other available state is **Belief**, your epistemic state must be \"Belief\".\n\nNow, compare this to a person who has an *unjustified* false belief. For instance, someone with no clock simply guesses, for no reason, that the time is 3:00. Their belief is also false. Their epistemic state, as it cannot be Knowledge, must also be \"Belief\".\n\n**Careful Point:** The system is forced to assign the exact same epistemic state (\"Belief\") to two radically different situations: the rational mistake based on strong evidence and the arbitrary guess based on nothing. It loses the ability to distinguish between a justified belief and an unjustified one if that belief is false.\n\n**Problem 2: The model cannot represent the important epistemic category of a \"justified false belief,\" collapsing the distinction between a rational mistake and an irrational one into the single state of \"Belief\".**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two problems that the JTB definition runs into, given the specified constraints, are:\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The justification required for knowledge must be based on other epistemic states. Since the only available states are \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" this creates a dilemma. If justification is based on mere \"Belief,\" it is ungrounded and arbitrary. If it is based on \"Knowledge,\" it triggers an infinite regress where each piece of knowledge requires further knowledge for its justification.\n\n2.  **The Inability to Represent Justified Falsehoods:** The model cannot make a distinction, at the level of epistemic states, between a justified false belief (a rational mistake) and an unjustified false belief (an arbitrary guess). Since any false belief cannot be \"Knowledge,\" it must be categorized as \"Belief,\" regardless of whether it was rationally formed. This erases the crucial concept of being rational yet wrong.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems are:\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The model requires that justification for knowledge be grounded. If the ground is a mere \"Belief,\" the justification is arbitrary and weak. If the ground is \"Knowledge,\" it necessitates an infinite regress of knowledge, as each piece of justifying knowledge would itself require justification.\n2.  **The Inability to Represent Justified Falsehoods:** The model is forced to categorize any false belief as the state of \"Belief.\" This means it cannot distinguish between a justified false belief (a rational mistake based on evidence) and an unjustified false belief (a baseless guess), treating both as the same epistemic state and losing a crucial distinction about rationality.\n>>>"
