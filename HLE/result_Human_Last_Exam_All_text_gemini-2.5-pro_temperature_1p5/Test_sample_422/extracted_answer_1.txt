The two problems are:
1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** The model requires that justification for knowledge be grounded. If the ground is a mere "Belief," the justification is arbitrary and weak. If the ground is "Knowledge," it necessitates an infinite regress of knowledge, as each piece of justifying knowledge would itself require justification.
2.  **The Inability to Represent Justified Falsehoods:** The model is forced to categorize any false belief as the state of "Belief." This means it cannot distinguish between a justified false belief (a rational mistake based on evidence) and an unjustified false belief (a baseless guess), treating both as the same epistemic state and losing a crucial distinction about rationality.
