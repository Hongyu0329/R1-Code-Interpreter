    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of definitions from general topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Continuum:** The standard definition in general topology is a **compact, connected, Hausdorff space**. The user's clarification \"not necessarily metric\" is important because some properties of continua depend on the space being metric.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subset of $X$ that is itself a continuum but is not equal to $X$.\n*   **Composant:** For any point $p$ in a continuum $X$, its composant, denoted $C_p$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Decomposability and the Number of Composants\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem that connects the decomposability of a continuum to its number of composants:\n\n**Theorem:** A continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant.\n\n*   If a continuum $X$ is decomposable, say $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua, then for any point $p \\in X$, the entire space $X$ is the composant of $p$. Thus, there is only one composant.\n*   Conversely, if a continuum has only one composant, it can be shown to be decomposable.\n\nFrom this theorem, we can immediately deduce a lower bound for the number of composants in an *indecomposable* continuum. Since an indecomposable continuum is, by definition, not decomposable, it cannot have only one composant. As the number of composants must be an integer greater than or equal to one, for an indecomposable continuum, this number must be **at least 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Metric Case\n\nIt's instructive to first consider the more familiar case of metric continua.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For an **indecomposable metric continuum**, it is a classic result that it must have uncountably many composants, specifically $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n*   **Reasoning:** The proof for the metric case relies on the Baire Category Theorem. In a metric space, each composant can be shown to be a \"meager\" set (a set of the first category). If there were only countably many composants, their union (the entire space) would also be meager. However, a compact space (like a continuum) is a Baire space and cannot be meager in itself. This contradiction implies there must be uncountably many composants.\n*   Examples of indecomposable metric continua include the **pseudo-arc** and the **Knaster bucket-handle continuum**. Both have $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\nThis shows that if we are to find an indecomposable continuum with a small, finite number of composants, it cannot be a metric space. The user's constraint \"not necessarily metric\" is therefore the crucial element of the question.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the General (Non-Metric) Case\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The argument from Step 3 fails for non-metric continua. The key step that fails is proving that a composant is meager. A composant is a union of proper subcontinua. In a metric space, this union can be shown to be a countable union, but this is not guaranteed in the non-metric case. An uncountable union of meager sets is not necessarily meager, so the Baire Category argument collapses.\n\n*   This opens the possibility that a non-metric indecomposable continuum could have a finite number of composants (specifically, 2 or more).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The question now becomes one of existence. Does there exist a (non-metric) indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants? The answer is not something that can be easily constructed from scratch; it relies on known results from advanced topology.\n\n*   **The Existence Proof:** The mathematician **David P. Bellamy** proved the existence of such a space. In his 1980 paper, \"A non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants\", he provided a construction (in standard ZFC set theory) of a non-metric indecomposable continuum that has precisely two composants.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  By definition, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. This establishes that the minimum number is at least 2.\n2.  Known examples from metric continuum theory all have uncountably many composants, so an example with a finite number must be non-metric.\n3.  The existence of a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants has been established in the mathematical literature.\n\nCombining these points, the smallest possible number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
