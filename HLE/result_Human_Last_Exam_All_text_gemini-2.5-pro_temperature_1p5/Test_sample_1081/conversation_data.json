    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Mathematical Problem**\nThe question asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In the context of algebraic groups, \"number of tori\" is understood to mean the number of conjugacy classes of such tori under the action of the group of rational points, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. So, the precise problem is to find the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Classification Theorem**\nThere is a fundamental result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields that links the conjugacy classes of rational maximal tori to the structure of the Weyl group.\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. Let $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $F$-stable maximal tori (which are precisely the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori) is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$.\n\n**Step 3: Define and Analyze F-Conjugacy**\nTwo elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are said to be in the same $F$-conjugacy class if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$. The structure of these classes depends on the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Frobenius Action for a Group of Type $E_8$**\nThe action of $F$ on $W$ depends on whether the group $G$ is split or twisted. This is determined by the action of the Galois group Gal($\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$/$\\mathbb{F}_q$) on the Dynkin diagram of the group.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The Dynkin diagram for the simple Lie algebra of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This is a special property of the $E_8$ diagram (as well as $F_4$ and $G_2$).\n*   Because the automorphism group of the diagram is trivial, the Galois group must act trivially. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field (including $\\mathbb{F}_q$) must be of the *split* form.\n*   For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the associated root system and therefore also on the Weyl group $W$. This means $F(w) = w$ for every $w \\in W$.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Conjugacy Relation**\nWith the trivial action $F(w)=w$, the $F$-conjugacy relation simplifies:\n$w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$ becomes $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$.\nThis is the definition of ordinary conjugacy in the group $W$.\nTherefore, the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W$ is simply the total number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the group $W$.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Combinatorial Problem**\nThe problem has been reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a fixed number that depends only on the group type $E_8$, not on the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes of W(E8)**\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-studied finite Coxeter group of order $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been calculated by mathematicians (e.g., J.S. Frame, R.W. Carter) and is a standard result in the field.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This is not a number that can be easily computed from first principles. It must be taken from established mathematical literature or computational algebra databases.\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
