    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The question provides two critical pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   A description of a novel's plot: It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   A description of the novel's author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Author:** The second clue is the most direct way to identify the author. Jorge Luis Borges famously described the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti** as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" Onetti is widely recognized for being heavily influenced by William Faulkner, particularly in his creation of the mythical city of Santa Mar√≠a (akin to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County) and his exploration of themes of decay, alienation, and memory. The \"simplifier\" modifier acknowledges that Onetti's prose, while complex, is generally more direct than Faulkner's most famously convoluted passages.\n\n3.  **Locate the Source of the Quote:** The descriptions come from a prologue that Borges wrote in 1965.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Borges wrote this prologue not for the novel he was describing with the \"tiger/chess\" metaphor, but for a different book by the same author: **_Para una tumba sin nombre_** (**_A Grave with No Name_**). It's common for prologues to discuss an author's broader work.\n\n4.  **Identify the Novel:** In that prologue to _A Grave with No Name_, Borges praises Onetti's literary craftsmanship. When he uses the phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" he is referring specifically to the plot (\"argumento\" in the original Spanish) of one of Onetti's most famous novels.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The novel Borges is referring to with this specific quote is **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**), which was published in 1961. The quote perfectly captures the novel's combination of tense, brooding atmosphere (the \"tiger's intensity\") and its meticulously constructed, almost deterministic plot (the \"chess duel\").\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the clues, we can determine that Jorge Luis Borges described the author **Juan Carlos Onetti** as a simplified successor to Faulkner. In a prologue for one of Onetti's books, Borges used the \"tiger and chess\" metaphor to praise the intricate and intense plot of another of Onetti's novels, **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**).\n\n***\n\nThe novel is **_El astillero_** (**_The Shipyard_**) by Juan Carlos Onetti.\n\n<<<El astillero (The Shipyard)>>>"
