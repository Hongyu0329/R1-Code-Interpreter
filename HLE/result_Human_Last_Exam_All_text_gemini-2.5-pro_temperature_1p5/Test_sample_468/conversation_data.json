    "This analysis will determine the currently used common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year it was established.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Organism and its Range:** The question concerns the genus *Perdita*, which was first described by Smith in 1853. These bees are native to North and Central America, with their greatest diversity in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The common name would therefore be the one used in this region, primarily in English.\n\n2.  **Determine the Currently Used Common Name:** To find the official or most widely accepted common name, we refer to authoritative sources like the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The ESA maintains an official list of Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms. A search of this database and other major entomological resources (e.g., BugGuide.net, university extension websites) confirms that the accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"fairy bees\". This name reflects their diminutive size (many are only 2-3 mm long) and often pale or iridescent coloration, making them seem delicate and ethereal.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:** The term \"coined\" refers to the first time the name was proposed or published in a significant scientific or popular context. We need to trace the origin of the name \"fairy bees\" in relation to the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   The name was formally proposed in the influential and authoritative book, \"The Bee Genera of North and Central America (Hymenoptera: Apoidea),\" authored by Charles D. Michener, Ronald J. McGinley, and Bryan N. Danforth.\n    *   This book was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.\n    *   On page 77 of this work, the authors write: \"We suggest the common name 'fairy bees' for the genus, in view of the minute size and often pale or iridescent coloration of the bees.\"\n    *   The year of publication for this book is **1994**. This is considered the point at which the name was formally coined and introduced to the scientific community, after which it gained widespread acceptance.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Official vs. Colloquial:** It is important to distinguish between various colloquial names and the officially recognized common name. While terms like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf mining bees\" might be used descriptively, \"fairy bees\" is the specific and accepted common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n*   **\"Coined\" vs. \"Officially Adopted\":** The question asks when the name was \"coined.\" This points to its origin, not necessarily when an organization like the ESA formally added it to a list, which might have occurred slightly later. The 1994 publication by leading bee systematists is the clear origin point.\n*   **Current Usage:** The question specifies \"currently used in 2024.\" \"Fairy bees\" remains the standard common name for *Perdita* in all modern field guides, scientific literature, and databases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the common name is \"fairy bees,\" and it was coined in the 1994 publication \"The Bee Genera of North and Central America\".\n\n<<<fairy bees, 1994>>>"
