    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks to identify a specific philosopher.\n2.  **Identify the First Constraint:** The philosopher must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School.\" This is a well-defined group of Polish logicians and analytic philosophers active in the interwar period (roughly 1918-1939). Key members include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n3.  **Identify the Second Constraint:** This philosopher must have performed a specific conceptual analysis: \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\" This means the philosopher analyzed how we recognize distinguishing features (hallmarks) and proposed a classification scheme that includes the categories of \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n4.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:**\n    *   A \"hallmark\" is a distinguishing characteristic or sign.\n    *   A \"symptom\" in this philosophical context typically refers to a *natural sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is causal. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a rash is a symptom of a disease.\n    *   A \"signal\" refers to a *conventional sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on an agreement, rule, or intention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for a feline animal.\n5.  **Evaluate Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   While many philosophers in the school worked on logic and language, the philosopher most famously associated with semiotics (the theory of signs) and this specific distinction is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz, in his works on semantics, epistemology, and what he termed \"pragmatic logic,\" explicitly analyzed the concept of a sign (*znak* in Polish).\n    *   He divided signs into various categories, with the most fundamental distinction being between natural signs, which he called **symptoms** (*oznaki*), and conventional signs, which he called **signals** (*sygnały*). This work was central to his philosophy of language and his analysis of how language relates to the world and how knowledge is expressed.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Terminology:** The English terms \"hallmark,\" \"symptom,\" and \"signal\" are translations of the original Polish concepts. The core distinction made by the philosopher is between what he called *oznaka* (symptom/indicator) and *sygnał* (signal). The term \"hallmark\" serves as a good general concept for what these signs help us identify.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not merely a linguistic footnote; it is a fundamental part of Ajdukiewicz's epistemology. It helps to clarify how we gain knowledge about the world through both natural observation and human communication.\n*   **Attribution:** While other philosophers (like Charles Sanders Peirce, outside the Lviv-Warsaw School) developed complex theories of signs, within the context of the Lviv-Warsaw School, this specific decomposition is uniquely and strongly associated with Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made the distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) as ways of identifying the characteristics of things is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
