    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the core assertion.**\nThe question involves historian Fernand Braudel quoting writer Paul Morand. The core assertion is that a certain \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" Our goal is to identify this entity.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the source of the quotation.**\nThe quote is famously used by Fernand Braudel in the preface to the first edition of his seminal work, *The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II* (originally published in 1949). Knowing the source allows us to find the exact wording.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the quotation in its original context.**\nIn the preface, Braudel discusses his passion for studying the Mediterranean. He writes:\n\"Is it too much to say, as he [Paul Morand] does, that **every great life** must be inscribed within a sphere? For me, the life of the Mediterranean is such a 'great life,' and I have tried to inscribe it... in the sphere which contains it and which its own light illuminates.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific conceptual entity.**\nFrom the direct quote, the conceptual entity that Paul Morand asserts should be inscribed within a sphere is **\"a great life\"** (in French, *toute grande vie*).\n\n**Step 5: Connect the entity to the example given in the question.**\nThe question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" Braudel himself provides his own example: \"the life of the Mediterranean,\" which he treats as a singular, large-scale historical subject. A nation, as a complex, enduring historical entity with a distinct character and trajectory, is another perfect example of what could be considered \"a great life\" in this context. Therefore, a nation is an example of a \"great life,\" not the entity itself. The core concept is broader.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the original text where Fernand Braudel quotes Paul Morand, we can definitively identify the conceptual entity in question. It is not \"a nation\" itself, but the broader concept of \"a great life,\" for which both a nation and the Mediterranean Sea (in Braudel's view) serve as examples.\n\n<<<a great life>>>"
