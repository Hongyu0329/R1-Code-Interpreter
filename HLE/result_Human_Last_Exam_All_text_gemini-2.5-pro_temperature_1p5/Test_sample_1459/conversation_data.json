    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $[0,1]$ and the unit circle.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Metric Spaces\n\nFirst, we need to clearly define the two metric spaces we are comparing.\n\n*   **Space X:** The closed interval $[0, 1]$ with the standard metric induced by the absolute value.\n    *   $X = [0, 1]$\n    *   The metric is $d_X(x_1, x_2) = |x_1 - x_2|$.\n    *   The diameter of X, which is the supremum of distances between any two points, is $\\text{diam}(X) = d_X(0, 1) = 1$.\n\n*   **Space Y:** The unit circle $S^1$ with its intrinsic metric (geodesic distance).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term \"unit circle\" can be ambiguous. It could mean radius 1 (circumference $2\\pi$) or circumference 1. In the context of comparison with the interval $[0,1]$, it is standard to normalize the circle to have a circumference of 1. Let's proceed with this assumption.\n    *   We can model $S^1$ as the interval $[0, 1]$ with its endpoints identified, i.e., $Y = [0, 1] / \\{0 \\sim 1\\}$, which is equivalent to the quotient group $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The metric $d_Y(y_1, y_2)$ is the shortest arc length between two points. For $y_1, y_2 \\in [0, 1)$, this is $d_Y(y_1, y_2) = \\min(|y_1 - y_2|, 1 - |y_1 - y_2|)$.\n    *   The diameter of Y is the distance between two antipodal points, for example, 0 and $1/2$. $\\text{diam}(Y) = d_Y(0, 1/2) = \\min(1/2, 1-1/2) = 1/2$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound for the Distance\n\nA useful property of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is that it is bounded below by half the absolute difference of the diameters of the two spaces.\n\n*   $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\text{diam}(X) - \\text{diam}(Y)|$\n*   Plugging in the diameters we found:\n    $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} |1 - 1/2| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSo, we know the distance must be at least $1/4$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound by Constructing a Correspondence\n\nTo find an upper bound, we can construct a **correspondence** $R$ between $X$ and $Y$ and calculate its distortion. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by $d_{GH}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_R \\text{dis}(R)$, so for any specific correspondence $R$, we have $d_{GH}(X, Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\text{dis}(R)$.\n\nA correspondence $R$ is a subset of $X \\times Y$ such that every point in $X$ is related to at least one point in $Y$, and every point in $Y$ is related to at least one point in $X$. The distortion of $R$ is:\n$\\text{dis}(R) = \\sup_{(x, y), (x', y') \\in R} |d_X(x, x') - d_Y(y, y')|$.\n\nLet's construct a correspondence motivated by \"folding\" the interval $[0,1]$ and mapping it onto the circle. We want to map the interval $[0,1]$ to both the \"upper\" and \"lower\" semicircles simultaneously.\nLet's define the correspondence $R \\subseteq [0, 1] \\times S^1$ as follows:\n$R = \\{ (x, x/2) \\mid x \\in [0,1] \\} \\cup \\{ (x, 1-x/2) \\mid x \\in [0,1] \\}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify this is a valid correspondence.\n    *   For any $x \\in X$, $(x, x/2)$ is in $R$. So all points in $X$ are covered.\n    *   For any $y \\in S^1$ (represented as $y \\in [0, 1)$):\n        *   If $y \\in [0, 1/2]$, we can choose $x=2y \\in [0, 1]$. Then $(x, x/2)=(2y, y) \\in R$.\n        *   If $y \\in [1/2, 1)$, we can choose $x=2(1-y) \\in (0, 1]$. Then $(x, 1-x/2) = (2(1-y), 1-(1-y)) = (2(1-y), y) \\in R$.\n    *   So, all points in $Y$ are covered. The correspondence is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distortion of the Correspondence\n\nNow, we must find the supremum of $|d_X(x, x') - d_Y(y, y')|$ over all pairs of points in $R$. Let's test some specific pairs of points from $R$ to find the maximum possible difference.\n\n*   **Test Case 1:** Consider the point $x = 1/2$. According to our correspondence $R$, $x=1/2$ is related to two points in $Y$: $y_1 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4$ and $y_2 = 1 - (1/2)/2 = 3/4$. Let's choose two pairs from $R$:\n    *   $(x, y) = (1/2, 1/4)$\n    *   $(x', y') = (1/2, 3/4)$\n    *   The distance in $X$ is $d_X(1/2, 1/2) = 0$.\n    *   The distance in $Y$ is $d_Y(1/4, 3/4) = \\min(|1/4 - 3/4|, 1 - |1/4 - 3/4|) = \\min(1/2, 1/2) = 1/2$.\n    *   The difference is $|0 - 1/2| = 1/2$.\n\n*   **Test Case 2:** Consider the endpoints of the interval, $x=0$ and $x'=1$.\n    *   For $x=0$, $R$ contains the pair $(0, 0/2)=(0,0)$ and $(0, 1-0/2)=(0,1)$, which are the same point on the circle. So, $(0,0) \\in R$.\n    *   For $x'=1$, $R$ contains the pair $(1, 1/2)$ and $(1, 1-1/2)=(1, 1/2)$. So, $(1, 1/2) \\in R$.\n    *   Let's choose the pairs $(x,y)=(0,0)$ and $(x',y')=(1,1/2)$.\n    *   The distance in $X$ is $d_X(0, 1) = 1$.\n    *   The distance in $Y$ is $d_Y(0, 1/2) = 1/2$.\n    *   The difference is $|1 - 1/2| = 1/2$.\n\nThese two test cases show that the distortion is at least $1/2$. A more detailed analysis confirms that the supremum is exactly $1/2$.\nThus, $\\text{dis}(R) = 1/2$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nUsing the distortion we just calculated, we can find an upper bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance:\n$d_{GH}(X, Y) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\text{dis}(R) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nWe have now shown:\n1.  From the diameter difference: $d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\ge 1/4$.\n2.  From our constructed correspondence: $d_{GH}([0,1], S^1) \\le 1/4$.\n\nCombining these two results, we must have equality.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $[0,1]$ and the unit circle of circumference 1 is $1/4$.\n\n<<<0.25>>>"
