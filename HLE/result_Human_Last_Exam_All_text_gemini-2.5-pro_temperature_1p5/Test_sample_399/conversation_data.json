    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the initial value problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t)h(x)$, where $g(t) = t-1$ and $h(x) = x^2$.\n\n**2. Check for equilibrium solutions**\n\nEquilibrium solutions occur when $x'(t) = 0$. This happens if $x^2 = 0$, which means $x(t) = 0$ is a constant solution. Our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the equilibrium solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$ without worrying about division by zero.\n\n**3. Separate the variables**\n\nWe group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**4. Integrate both sides**\n\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The integral of the left side is $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The integral of the right side is $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results and adding a single constant of integration, $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**5. Apply the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to solve for $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**6. Write the particular solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo find $x(t)$, we first multiply by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} = - \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nNow, we take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n\n**7. Find the value of x(1)**\n\nThe final step is to evaluate the solution at $t=1$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\nTo subtract the fractions in the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
