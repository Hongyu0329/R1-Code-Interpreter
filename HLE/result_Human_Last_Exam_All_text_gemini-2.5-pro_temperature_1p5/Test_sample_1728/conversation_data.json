    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Graph Operation \"Sum\"**\n\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" can have several meanings. The most common and standard interpretation in graph theory, often denoted by the '+' symbol, is the **Graph Join** operation. Let's analyze the problem under this assumption.\n\nLet G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) be two graphs. The **join** of G1 and G2, denoted G1 + G2, is a graph with:\n*   Vertex set V = V1 U V2 (assuming V1 and V2 are disjoint).\n*   Edge set E = E1 U E2 U { (u, v) | u ∈ V1, v ∈ V2 }.\nIn other words, the join is formed by taking the disjoint union of the graphs and adding all possible edges between the vertices of the different graphs.\n\nIn this problem, G is the sum of three cycles of length n, which we denote as C_n. So, G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\nLet the three cycles be C_n_1, C_n_2, and C_n_3, with disjoint vertex sets V1, V2, and V3, respectively.\n*   The vertex set of G is V = V1 U V2 U V3, so G has 3n vertices.\n*   The edge set of G contains:\n    1.  All the edges of C_n_1, C_n_2, and C_n_3.\n    2.  All possible edges connecting a vertex in Vi to a vertex in Vj for all i ≠ j.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**\n\nA crucial property of the chromatic number with respect to the join operation is that it is additive. For any two graphs G1 and G2:\nχ(G1 + G2) = χ(G1) + χ(G2)\n\n*   **Proof Sketch:** Consider a coloring of G1 + G2. Any vertex in V1 is adjacent to every vertex in V2. Therefore, the set of colors used to color the vertices of V1 must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used to color the vertices of V2. To minimize the total number of colors, we need to color V1 with the minimum number of colors, which is χ(G1), and V2 with the minimum number of colors, which is χ(G2). Since these color sets must be disjoint, the total number of colors needed is χ(G1) + χ(G2).\n\nThis property extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our graph G = C_n + C_n + C_n, the chromatic number is:\nχ(G) = χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) = 3 * χ(C_n)\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Chromatic Number of a Cycle C_n**\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph C_n depends on its length n. For simple graphs, we assume n ≥ 3.\n*   **If n is even (n ≥ 4):** The cycle C_n is a bipartite graph. This means its vertices can be colored with just two colors. Therefore, χ(C_n) = 2.\n*   **If n is odd (n ≥ 3):** The cycle C_n is not bipartite. At least three colors are required to color an odd cycle. It's always possible to color an odd cycle with exactly three colors. Therefore, χ(C_n) = 3.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number of G**\n\nWe have found that χ(G) = 3 * χ(C_n). The question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of G. This means we must find the value of n that maximizes this expression.\n\n1.  If n is an even number (n ≥ 4), then χ(C_n) = 2, and χ(G) = 3 * 2 = 6.\n2.  If n is an odd number (n ≥ 3), then χ(C_n) = 3, and χ(G) = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nTo maximize χ(G), we must choose n such that χ(C_n) is maximized. The maximum value for χ(C_n) is 3, which occurs for any odd n ≥ 3.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of G is 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The interpretation of \"sum\" as Graph Join is critical. If it were interpreted as a disjoint union, the chromatic number would be max(χ(C_n), χ(C_n), χ(C_n)) = χ(C_n), with a maximum of 3. If interpreted as the union of edges on a common vertex set, the problem becomes significantly more complex (a graph decomposition problem), likely leading to a different answer (7). However, \"sum\" or '+' most standardly means the join operation.\n2.  **Cycle Length (n):** Standard definition of a cycle in graph theory requires n ≥ 3. The chromatic number of C_n is dependent on the parity of n.\n3.  **Maximization:** The question is not about a specific n, but the maximum possible chromatic number across all possible values of n. This requires us to find the case (odd or even n) that yields the highest chromatic number for G.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal chromatic number is achieved when the chromatic number of the base cycle, χ(C_n), is maximal. The maximum value of χ(C_n) is 3 (for odd n). Thus, the maximal chromatic number for G is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
