    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Coordinate System and the First Cube**\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, we first establish a coordinate system. Let's place one corner of the first cube (let's call it Cube A) at the origin (0, 0, 0) of a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Since the cube has a side length of 1, its edges will be aligned with the axes.\nThe region occupied by Cube A is defined by the following inequalities:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Shift along the Main Diagonal**\nThe problem states that the second cube (Cube B) is shifted relative to the first one by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n*   **The Main Diagonal:** For the cube we've defined, the \"main diagonal\" connects the corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner at (1, 1, 1). This diagonal can be represented by the vector **D** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **The Shift Vector:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" means the shift vector is 1/2 times the diagonal vector **D**.\n    *   Shift Vector **S** = (1/2) * **D** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   **Careful Point:** A common point of confusion is whether the shift is a *distance* of 1/2 or a *scaling factor* of the diagonal vector. If it were a distance, the shift vector's magnitude would be 1/2. The magnitude of **D** is √3, so the shift vector would be (1/2) * (**D**/√3), leading to irrational coordinates. In the context of such geometry problems, \"along a vector\" typically implies scaling that vector, which results in a cleaner, intended solution. Thus, we proceed with the shift vector **S** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Second Cube**\nCube B is the result of shifting every point of Cube A by the shift vector **S**. To find the boundaries of Cube B, we add the components of **S** to the boundaries of Cube A.\nThe region occupied by Cube B is defined by:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Region of Intersection**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the geometric shape that satisfies the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The region must satisfy both `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The region must satisfy both `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The region must satisfy both `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. We can calculate the length of its sides from the coordinate ranges found in the previous step.\n*   Length of the side in the x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   Length of the side in the y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   Length of the side in the z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
