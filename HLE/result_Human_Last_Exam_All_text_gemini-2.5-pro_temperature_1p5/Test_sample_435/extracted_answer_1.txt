CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit an increased or enhanced release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and TNF-alpha (TNF-α), upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 promotes a more persistent and functionally potent memory-like phenotype in the T cells.
