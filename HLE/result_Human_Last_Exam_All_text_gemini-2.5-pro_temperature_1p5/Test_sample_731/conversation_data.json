    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies the group size is 512. So, $2^n = 512$, which implies $n = 9$.\n    The group in question is $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^j$ for $0 \\le j < 256$.\n    The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. The elements $sr^j$ form a coset of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is the image of a power map, i.e., there exists an integer $k$ such that $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the power sets $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^k$ for an integer $k$ and determine for which $k$ this set forms a subgroup, and how many distinct such subgroups exist. The exponent of $G=SD_{512}$ is 256 (the maximum order of an element, which is the order of $r$). Thus, we only need to consider $k$ in the range $0 \\le k < 256$.\n\nAny positive integer $k$ can be uniquely written as $k = 2^a \\cdot m$, where $a \\ge 0$ and $m$ is an odd integer. We will analyze $G^k$ based on the value of $a$. The set $G^k$ is the union of two sets:\n$G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^j)^k \\mid 0 \\le j < 256 \\}$.\n\n*   **Analysis of the first set:**\n    The first set is the set of $k$-th powers of elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    $\\{ (r^i)^k \\} = \\{ r^{ik} \\} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k = 2^a m$ with $m$ odd, and the order of $r$ is $256 = 2^8$:\n    $\\gcd(k, 256) = \\gcd(2^a m, 2^8) = 2^{\\min(a, 8)}$.\n    For $a \\le 8$, $\\{ (r^i)^k \\} = \\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$. For $a > 8$, it is $\\{1\\}$.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second set:**\n    We first need the formula for powers of elements of the form $sr^j$. Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we get $sr=r^{127}s$. By induction, one can show $sr^j = r^{127j}s$.\n    The square of an element $sr^j$ is:\n    $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j sr^j = s(r^j s)r^j = s(sr^{-j})r^j = s^2 r^{-j}r^j = 1$. Let me recheck this.\n    Let's use conjugation: $s r^j s = (srs)^j = (r^{127})^j = r^{127j}$.\n    So, $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = (r^{127j}) r^j = r^{128j}$.\n    Now we can compute $(sr^j)^k$:\n    $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2^a m}$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $a=0$ (k is odd).**\n        $(sr^j)^k = ((sr^j)^2)^{(k-1)/2} (sr^j) = (r^{128j})^{(k-1)/2} (sr^j)$.\n        If $j$ is even ($j=2p$), $(sr^{2p})^k = (r^{128 \\cdot 2p})^{(k-1)/2} (sr^{2p}) = (r^{256p})^{(k-1)/2} sr^{2p} = 1 \\cdot sr^{2p} = sr^{2p}$.\n        If $j$ is odd ($j=2p+1$), $(sr^{2p+1})^k = (r^{128})^{(k-1)/2} sr^{2p+1}$.\n        The union of $\\{(sr^j)^k\\}$ for all $j$ can be shown to be the entire coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n        So, for odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup s\\langle r \\rangle = G$. This is one power subgroup, $G$ itself, which corresponds to $k=1$ (or any odd $k$). This is $G^{2^0}$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $a \\ge 1$ (k is even).**\n        $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2^a m} = ((sr^j)^2)^{2^{a-1} m} = (r^{128j})^{2^{a-1}m} = r^{128j \\cdot 2^{a-1}m} = r^{j \\cdot m \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{a-1}} = r^{j \\cdot m \\cdot 2^{a+6}}$.\n        The order of $r$ is $2^8 = 256$.\n        - If $a+6 \\ge 8$ (i.e., $a \\ge 2$), then $j \\cdot m \\cdot 2^{a+6}$ is a multiple of 256. So $(sr^j)^k = 1$.\n        In this case ($a \\ge 2$), $G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n        These are guaranteed to be subgroups. This gives us the power subgroups $\\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle=\\{1\\}$.\n        These correspond to $G^4, G^8, ..., G^{256}$. Note that for any $k=2^a m$ (with $m$ odd, $a \\ge 2$), $G^k=G^{2^a}$.\n\n        - If $a=1$ (i.e., $k=2m$ with $m$ odd), then $(sr^j)^k = r^{j \\cdot m \\cdot 2^7} = r^{128jm}$.\n        If $j$ is even ($j=2p$), $128jm = 128(2p)m = 256pm$, so $(sr^{2p})^k=1$.\n        If $j$ is odd ($j=2p+1$), $jm$ is odd. So $(sr^{2p+1})^k = r^{128 \\cdot (\\text{odd})} = r^{128}$ (since $r^{256}=1$).\n        So for $a=1$, the set of powers is $\\{1, r^{128}\\}$.\n        $G^k = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{1, r^{128}\\}$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, it is already in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n        Thus, for any $k=2m$ with $m$ odd, $G^k = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This corresponds to the power subgroup $G^2$.\n\n**Step 3: List all distinct power subgroups**\n\nBased on the analysis above, for any integer $k=2^a m$ (m odd), the set of powers $G^k$ is a subgroup and is determined solely by the value of $a$.\nSpecifically, $G^k = G^{2^a}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^{2^a} \\mid a \\ge 0\\}$.\n\nThe subgroups are:\n*   $a=0$: $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. Order 512.\n*   $a=1$: $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Order $256/2 = 128$.\n*   $a=2$: $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. Order $256/4 = 64$.\n*   $a=3$: $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. Order $256/8 = 32$.\n*   $a=4$: $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. Order $256/16 = 16$.\n*   $a=5$: $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. Order $256/32 = 8$.\n*   $a=6$: $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. Order $256/64 = 4$.\n*   $a=7$: $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Order $256/128 = 2$.\n*   $a=8$: $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. Order 1.\n\nFor $a > 8$, $G^{2^a}$ will also be the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\nThe list above contains 9 subgroups. Since their orders are all different ($512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$), they are all distinct.\n\nThus, there are 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512."
