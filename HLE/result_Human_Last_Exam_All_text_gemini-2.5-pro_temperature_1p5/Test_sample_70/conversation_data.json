    "This problem asks us to find which national flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. The key conditions are that flags are viewed as matrices and that the rank is maximized by the choice of values for the colors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark.**\n\n1.  **Visualize the Flag as a Matrix:** The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. If we imagine this flag as a matrix of pixels, each entry in the matrix would represent a color.\n2.  **Assign Values to Colors:** The problem states to \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we should treat each distinct color as a linearly independent entity. For example, we can let Red = R and White = W, where R and W are linearly independent non-zero vectors or algebraically independent variables. A simpler way is to assign distinct non-zero scalar values, e.g., R=1, W=2.\n3.  **Identify Linearly Independent Rows/Columns:**\n    *   Let's analyze the rows of the Danish flag matrix. There are only two distinct types of rows:\n        *   **Type A:** A row that is entirely white (from the horizontal bar of the cross). Let's represent this vector as `r_A = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n        *   **Type B:** A row that is red, but interrupted by the white vertical bar of the cross. Let's represent this as `r_B = [R, ..., R, W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`.\n    *   All rows in the flag's matrix are either of Type A or Type B. The entire row space of the matrix is therefore spanned by these two vectors, `r_A` and `r_B`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank is the dimension of the row space, which is the number of linearly independent vectors that span the space. We need to check if `r_A` and `r_B` are linearly independent.\n    *   Is one vector a scalar multiple of the other? Is `r_B = k * r_A`?\n    *   This would mean `[R, ..., R, W, ..., W, R, ..., R] = k * [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   Comparing the elements, this requires both `R = k*W` and `W = k*W`. Since W represents a color, its value is not zero, so `W = k*W` implies `k=1`. Substituting `k=1` into the first equation gives `R=W`.\n    *   This is a contradiction, as Red and White are distinct colors. Therefore, `r_A` and `r_B` are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify characteristics of flags with a rank of 2.**\n\nA flag will have a rank of 2 if its corresponding matrix has a row space (or column space) that is spanned by exactly two linearly independent vectors. Under the maximal rank assumption, this typically occurs with flags that have simple designs based on two fundamental patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** A monochrome flag (one color).\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   A bicolor flag with horizontal or vertical stripes.\n    *   A tricolor flag with only two distinct colors (e.g., an A-B-A pattern of stripes).\n    *   A flag whose design, although containing more than two colors, only generates two unique types of row or column vectors (e.g., the flags of Benin or Madagascar, as we will see).\n*   **Rank 3 or higher:**\n    *   A tricolor flag with three distinct colors.\n    *   A flag with a simple two-color background but with an emblem of a third color.\n    *   Flags with complex geometry like diagonals, triangles, or complex emblems, as these features create many unique row/column vectors that are linearly independent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the flags of African nations to find those with rank 2.**\n\nWe will now go through the flags of African nations, applying the logic from Step 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2 (Examples of Exclusions):**\n    *   **Three-color stripes:** Chad (vertical Blue-Yellow-Red), CÃ´te d'Ivoire (vertical Orange-White-Green), Gabon (horizontal Green-Yellow-Blue), Sierra Leone (horizontal Green-White-Blue). All have 3 distinct colors in simple stripes, leading to 3 linearly independent row/column vectors. **Rank = 3**.\n    *   **Emblem adding complexity:** Angola (horizontal Red/Black bicolor with a yellow emblem), Burkina Faso (horizontal Red/Green with a yellow star), Morocco (Red field with a green star). The base flag might have rank 1 or 2, but the emblem introduces a new color and/or new linearly independent row patterns. For instance, in Morocco's flag, we have all-Red rows and rows with Red and Green, and the shape of the star ensures at least two different kinds of Red-Green rows, making the rank at least 3.\n    *   **Complex Geometry:** South Africa, Seychelles, Namibia, DR Congo. These flags feature diagonal lines, multiple intersecting shapes, and many colors, resulting in a large number of unique, linearly independent rows. Their rank is much higher than 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank = 2 (Candidates):**\n    1.  **Nigeria:** The flag is a vertical tricolor of Green-White-Green.\n        *   **Column Analysis:** There are only two types of columns: all-Green columns and all-White columns.\n        *   These two column vectors, `c_G = [G, ..., G]^T` and `c_W = [W, ..., W]^T`, are linearly independent (since G and W are distinct colors).\n        *   The column space is spanned by these two vectors. Thus, the **rank is 2**.\n\n    2.  **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow over red) at the fly.\n        *   **Row Analysis:** There are two types of rows:\n            *   Type 1 (top half): A segment of green followed by a segment of yellow. `r_top = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`.\n            *   Type 2 (bottom half): A segment of green followed by a segment of red. `r_bot = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`.\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. If `r_top = k * r_bot`, then `G = k*G` (so `k=1`) and `Y = k*R` (so `Y=R`), which is a contradiction.\n        *   The row space is spanned by these two vectors. Thus, the **rank is 2**.\n\n    3.  **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (red over green) at the fly.\n        *   **Row Analysis:** This flag has the exact same structure as Benin's flag, with different colors. There are two types of rows:\n            *   Type 1 (top half): `r_top = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`.\n            *   Type 2 (bottom half): `r_bot = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`.\n        *   By the same logic as for Benin, these two row types are linearly independent.\n        *   The row space is spanned by these two vectors. Thus, the **rank is 2**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Danish flag is 2. After analyzing the flags of all African nations, we find three flags that also have a rank of 2 due to their simple geometric structure, which results in their matrix representations being spanned by exactly two linearly independent vectors.\n\nThe flags are:\n*   **Nigeria** (vertical Green-White-Green stripes)\n*   **Benin** (vertical green stripe with horizontal yellow and red stripes)\n*   **Madagascar** (vertical white stripe with horizontal red and green stripes)\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria>>>"
