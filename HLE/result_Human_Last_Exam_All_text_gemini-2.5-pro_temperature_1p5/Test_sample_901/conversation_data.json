    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The specific stereochemistry (1S, 2R) is crucial. Let's determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups. A (1S, 2R) configuration on a cyclohexane ring means the two substituents are on opposite faces of the ring, making them *trans* to each other.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-Butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base and a common solvent for such reactions.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **elimination reaction**. Specifically, it will be an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky nature of the base further favors elimination over substitution (SN2).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the hydrogen atom being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** requirement. Both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, on adjacent carbons, and pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. It can exist in two equilibrating chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A (Diequatorial):** The bulky methyl group and the bromo group both occupy the more stable equatorial positions. This will be the major conformer present at equilibrium. However, in this conformation, the bromo leaving group is equatorial. **An E2 reaction cannot occur from this stable conformation** because the leaving group is not axial.\n    *   **Conformation B (Diaxial):** The molecule must ring-flip into its less stable conformation where both substituents are in axial positions. In this conformation, the bromo group is axial, and the methyl group is also axial. **The E2 reaction must proceed through this minor, less stable conformation.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Possible Elimination Pathways from the Reactive Conformation**\n*   We must analyze Conformation B, where the Bromine on C1 is axial. For the reaction to happen, the base (tert-butoxide) needs to remove an axial β-hydrogen.\n*   The β-carbons (carbons adjacent to C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen on C2:** In the diaxial conformation (Conformation B), the methyl group on C2 is in the axial position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, it cannot be anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, **elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is impossible**. This would have been the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    *   **β-Hydrogen on C6:** Carbon C6 has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1. The tert-butoxide base can remove this axial hydrogen.\n*   **Conclusion:** The elimination can only occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\n*   The reaction removes the bromine from C1 and a hydrogen from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group remains on C2.\n*   To name the resulting alkene, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2 in the product). The methyl group will therefore be on carbon 3.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene), and in this case, it is the only possible product due to the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
