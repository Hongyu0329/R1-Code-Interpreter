    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, risk for a disease) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered simultaneously. It's the *upper limit* or the *total potential* variance that can be explained by a perfect linear model using all available SNP information. It is estimated using statistical methods (like GCTA-GREML) that look at genome-wide similarity between individuals.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool, not a theoretical limit. It is a single score calculated for an individual to predict their phenotype. The score is constructed by taking a sum of the individual's alleles at many different SNP locations, with each allele's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size. These effect sizes are typically derived from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (Variance Explained, or R²):** This measures how well the calculated PGS actually predicts the phenotype in a *new, independent set of individuals* (a test or target cohort). It is a measure of the PGS's real-world performance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship between the Concepts**\n\n1.  **SNP heritability is the target; PGS is the attempt.** Think of SNP heritability (h²_SNP) as the total amount of gold in a mine. It's the maximum amount you could possibly extract. The polygenic score's predictive ability (R²) is the amount of gold you *actually* extract with your current mining tools and technology.\n\n2.  **Why is the attempt (PGS) less successful than the potential (h²_SNP)?**\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The weights (effect sizes) used to build the PGS come from a GWAS of a *finite* sample size. Because the sample is not infinitely large, these estimated effect sizes are noisy and imperfect approximations of the true effect sizes. This \"noise\" in the weights directly reduces the predictive accuracy of the final score.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes and SNPs that are physically close on a chromosome tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon called Linkage Disequilibrium. This makes it difficult for a GWAS to pinpoint the exact causal SNP. The estimated effect of one SNP often includes the effects of its many correlated neighbors. Methods for building a PGS try to correct for this, but these corrections are imperfect, leading to a loss of predictive power.\n    *   **Differences between Populations:** A PGS is often built using data from one population (the discovery cohort) and then applied to another (the target cohort). If there are differences in genetic ancestry or LD patterns between these two groups, the PGS will be less accurate.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the statement's claim: \"is necessarily lower than\"**\n\nThe term \"necessarily\" implies that it is impossible for the predictive ability of a PGS to be equal to or greater than the SNP heritability.\n\n*   Can the PGS predictive ability be *greater than* the SNP heritability? No. In a properly conducted study with an independent validation sample, a predictor (the PGS) cannot explain more variance than is theoretically present in its component parts (the SNPs). That would violate the fundamental principle.\n\n*   Can the PGS predictive ability be *equal to* the SNP heritability? Only in a perfect, theoretical world where:\n    *   The GWAS sample size is infinite, leading to perfectly accurate effect size estimates (no estimation error).\n    *   We have perfect methods to account for LD.\n    *   The discovery and target populations are identical.\n\nSince these conditions are never met in practice, any real-world PGS will have its predictive power degraded by these factors. Therefore, its explained variance will be lower than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability. The gap between SNP heritability and the R² of the best possible PGS is sometimes called \"missing predictability.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe statement is correct. The SNP heritability represents the theoretical ceiling for prediction using SNPs. The polygenic score is a practical implementation that will always fall short of this ceiling due to real-world limitations, most importantly the error in estimating SNP effect sizes from finite study populations.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
