    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum number of stickers on the side faces of the top layer that must be observed to uniquely determine which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present. At the PLL stage, the top face is already solved (e.g., all yellow), so it provides no useful information for permutation. All the information comes from the 12 side stickers of the top layer (one on each of the 4 edge pieces, and two on each of the 4 corner pieces).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Small Numbers of Stickers\n*   **1 Sticker:** Looking at a single sticker is clearly insufficient. For example, seeing a green sticker on the front of the top-front edge piece only tells you that this piece is in its correct place. This situation occurs in many different PLL cases (like H, U, Z perms) as well as the solved state.\n*   **2 Stickers:** Looking at two stickers provides more information, often revealing a pattern like \"headlights\" (two corner stickers on a face are the same color) or a \"block\" (an edge and an adjacent corner on a face are the same color). However, many different PLL cases share these patterns.\n    *   **Headlights:** Found in U, H, Z, T, F, V, N, and G perms.\n    *   **Block:** Found in J, R, T, F, and G perms.\n    Since these patterns are not unique to a single PLL case, 2 stickers are not enough to guarantee identification.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case for 3 Stickers\nA common recognition method involves looking at the three stickers on one face. Let's analyze if this is always sufficient.\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to find a \"worst-case\" scenario. If we can find just two different PLL cases that can produce the exact same pattern on a chosen set of 3 stickers, then 3 stickers is not enough.\n*   **The U-Perm Counterexample:** Consider the Ua and Ub perms. These perms cycle three corners and three edges.\n    *   Both the Ua and Ub perms can be oriented to show a solid \"bar\" of color on one face. For example, if the front face is green, the front-facing stickers of the top-front-left corner, top-front edge, and top-front-right corner are all green.\n    *   If a solver looks only at these three stickers on the front face, they will see a `Green-Green-Green` pattern.\n    *   This pattern is identical for both Ua and Ub perms when they are in this orientation. The solver cannot distinguish between them.\n*   **Conclusion for 3 Stickers:** Since there is a situation where looking at 3 stickers is ambiguous, 3 is not the minimum number required to *fully and uniquely* identify any PLL case. The minimum must be greater than 3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Case for 4 Stickers\nNow we must check if 4 stickers are sufficient. We can use the same \"worst-case\" scenario that disproved the case for 3 stickers.\n*   **The Scenario:** The solver sees the `Green-Green-Green` bar on the front face and knows the case is either Ua or Ub. To resolve the ambiguity, they must look at at least one more sticker.\n*   **Observing a 4th Sticker:** Let's observe a fourth sticker on an adjacent face, for example, the right face (which we'll assume is red). A good choice is the sticker on the right face of the top-right edge piece (the UR piece).\n    *   **In the Ua-perm:** The edge cycle is (UL -> UB -> UR -> UL). The edge piece that lands in the UR slot comes from the UB (Up-Back) slot. Therefore, its sticker facing the right side will have the color of the back face (e.g., blue).\n    *   **In the Ub-perm:** The edge cycle is (UL -> UR -> UB -> UL). The edge piece that lands in the UR slot comes from the UL (Up-Left) slot. Therefore, its sticker facing the right side will have the color of the left face (e.g., orange).\n*   **Conclusion for 4 Stickers:** The color of this fourth sticker is different for the Ua and Ub perms. By observing it, the solver can distinguish between the two cases. Since 4 stickers are sufficient to resolve the ambiguity in this identified \"worst-case\" scenario, and 3 stickers are not, 4 is the minimum number required. No two PLLs are so similar that they cannot be differentiated by inspecting a carefully chosen set of 4 stickers.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n1.  **3 stickers are insufficient:** Proven by the Ua/Ub perm ambiguity when viewing a single face.\n2.  **4 stickers are sufficient:** Proven by showing that one additional sticker resolves the Ua/Ub ambiguity. This logic extends to all other cases, as no other pair of PLLs is more similar than Ua and Ub in this manner.\n\nTherefore, 4 non-top-facing stickers must be seen to guarantee full identification of any PLL case.\n\n<<<4>>>"
