    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine whose lectures Einstein cited in his 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific scientific paper:** The question refers to one of Albert Einstein's four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers published in 1905. The paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Define the term \"cite\":** In academic and scientific writing, to \"cite\" someone is to formally acknowledge their work by including a reference, typically in a footnote, endnote, or bibliography. This is distinct from being generally influenced by someone's ideas. The question specifically asks who was *cited*.\n\n3.  **Examine the structure and content of Einstein's 1905 papers:** A well-documented and famous characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers, including the one on Brownian motion and the one on special relativity, is their profound originality and striking lack of citations to the work of other contemporary physicists. He built his arguments from fundamental principles rather than by critiquing or extending the work of others.\n\n4.  **Inspect the 1905 Brownian motion paper for citations:** When one examines the original German publication of the paper in *Annalen der Physik*, it is evident that there are no footnotes or a list of references citing the work of any other scientist.\n\n5.  **Distinguish between influence and citation:** While Einstein's thinking was undeniably built upon the foundations of statistical mechanics laid by physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs, he did not formally cite their papers or any lecture notes from them in his 1905 Brownian motion paper. The question is about formal citation, not general influence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Paper:** It is crucial to focus only on the 1905 Brownian motion paper, not his doctoral dissertation (submitted the same year, which did have a few citations) or later papers where he did begin to cite relevant experimental work.\n*   **The Nature of the Question:** The question might seem to imply that there is a name to be found. The fact that there isn't one is the key point. It highlights the unique, self-contained nature of Einstein's reasoning in that paper.\n*   **Later Additions:** In later publications and compilations of his work on this topic, Einstein did add references to the experimental work that confirmed his theory. However, the original 1905 paper stands on its own without them.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a direct analysis of the specified 1905 paper, Albert Einstein did not include any citations. Therefore, he did not cite anyone's lectures.\n\n<<<No one. Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion contains no citations or references to the work of other scientists.>>>"
