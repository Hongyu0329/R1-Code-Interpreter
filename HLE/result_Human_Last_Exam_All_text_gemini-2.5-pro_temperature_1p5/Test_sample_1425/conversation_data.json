    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, is defined as the trace of the density operator $e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N})}$, where $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n\nIn the path integral formalism, this is expressed as an integral over all possible field configurations $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$ that are periodic or anti-periodic in imaginary time $\\tau$ over the interval $[0, \\beta]$.\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\nThe quantity $S_E$ is the Euclidean action, which is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N}$.\n\n**2. Interpret the Given Hamiltonian (Careful Point 1)**\n\nThe question provides the Hamiltonian as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This statement can be interpreted in two ways within the grand canonical ensemble context:\n\n*   **Interpretation A:** The system's intrinsic Hamiltonian is literally $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. In this case, the operator in the grand canonical exponent would be $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu\\hat{N} = (-\\mu\\hat{N}) - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$. This is a physically unusual scenario where a system's energy is defined by the chemical potential of the reservoir it's connected to.\n*   **Interpretation B:** The question is providing the full grand canonical operator directly, i.e., $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N}$ is given as $-\\mu\\hat{N}$. This implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is zero ($\\hat{H}=0$). This describes a system of non-interacting particles that have no kinetic or potential energy; their presence in the system is governed solely by the chemical potential.\n\nInterpretation B is the much more standard and physically sensible model, often used as a toy model for phenomena like adsorption. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**3. Formulate the Euclidean Action**\n\nFor a field theory, the Euclidean action corresponding to the operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N}$ is:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\phi^*(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) + \\mathcal{H}(\\phi^*,\\phi) - \\mu \\mathcal{N}(\\phi^*,\\phi) \\right]$\nwhere $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{N}$ are the densities for the Hamiltonian and particle number, respectively.\n\nUnder Interpretation B, $\\hat{H}=0$, so $\\mathcal{H}=0$. The particle number density is $\\mathcal{N} = \\phi^*\\phi$. The action simplifies to:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\phi^* \\partial_\\tau \\phi - \\mu \\phi^* \\phi \\right] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^* (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi$\n\n**4. Diagonalize the Action in a Suitable Basis**\n\nTo evaluate the path integral, we diagonalize the operator $O = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$. We expand the field $\\phi$ in a basis of single-particle energy-momentum eigenstates (labeled by $k$) and imaginary-time Fourier modes (Matsubara frequencies, $\\omega_n$).\nSince our operator has no spatial dependence (like a $\\nabla^2$ term), all single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are zero. The action becomes diagonal in the state index $k$.\nIn the basis of Matsubara frequencies, the derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes a sum over independent modes:\n$S_E = \\sum_{k, n} \\phi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\phi_{k,n}$\nThe sum $\\sum_k$ is over all single-particle states. As they are all degenerate ($\\epsilon_k=0$), we can denote the total number of such states by $M$.\n$S_E = \\sum_{k=1}^M \\sum_{n} \\phi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\phi_{k,n}$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Path Integral (Careful Point 2: Particle Statistics)**\n\nThe result of the path integral depends on whether the particles described by $\\phi$ are bosons or fermions. This was not specified in the question.\n\n**Case A: Bosons**\nFor bosons, the fields $\\phi, \\phi^*$ are commuting complex numbers. The Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$. The path integral is a product of Gaussian integrals.\n$Z_B = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E} \\propto \\prod_{k,n} \\frac{1}{(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)} = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$\nThe logarithm of the partition function is $\\ln Z_B = -\\sum_{k,n} \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\nUsing the standard result from thermal field theory, this sum is equivalent to the statistical mechanical trace calculation:\n$\\ln Z_B = - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)})$\nSubstituting our value $\\epsilon_k = 0$:\n$\\ln Z_B = - \\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}) = -M \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\nThus, the partition function for bosons is:\n$Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\nThis result is valid only for $e^{\\beta\\mu} < 1$, i.e., $\\mu < 0$. Otherwise, the partition function diverges, corresponding to an infinite occupation of the zero-energy states.\n\n**Case B: Fermions**\nFor fermions, the fields $\\psi, \\psi^*$ are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi / \\beta$. The path integral over Grassmann variables yields the determinant of the operator in the action.\n$Z_F = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E} = \\prod_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$\nThe logarithm of the partition function is $\\ln Z_F = \\sum_{k,n} \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$.\nThe corresponding standard result is:\n$\\ln Z_F = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)})$\nSubstituting our value $\\epsilon_k = 0$:\n$\\ln Z_F = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}) = M \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\nThus, the partition function for fermions is:\n$Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\nThis result is valid for any value of $\\mu$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. We present the results for both bosons and fermions, where M is the total number of degenerate single-particle states.\n\nFor bosons:\n$Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$, valid for $\\mu < 0$.\n\nFor fermions:\n$Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$.\n\nThese can be written in a compact form as $Z = (1 \\mp e^{\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp M}$, where the top sign (-) is for bosons and the bottom sign (+) is for fermions.\n\n<<<For bosons, $Z = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$. For fermions, $Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$. Here, M is the number of degenerate single-particle states and $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$.>>>"
