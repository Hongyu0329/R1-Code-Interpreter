    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Composition**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means the molecule contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**2. Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\nA basis set is a set of functions (called basis functions) used to build molecular orbitals. The notation \"6-31G\" describes how many and what type of functions are used for each atom. A \"contracted Gaussian function\" is a linear combination of one or more \"primitive Gaussian functions\" and is equivalent to a \"basis function\". We need to determine the number of these contracted functions for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n**3. Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set for a Carbon Atom (C)**\nCarbon is a second-row element (a \"heavy\" atom in this context). The notation is interpreted as follows:\n*   **'6'**: This describes the core electrons (1s orbital). The 1s atomic orbital is represented by a single **contracted** Gaussian function, which is formed by summing 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   Number of contracted functions for the core = 1.\n*   **'-31'**: This describes the valence electrons (2s and 2p orbitals). The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, an inner part and an outer part.\n    *   **'3' (Inner Valence)**: The inner part of the valence shell is described by one set of contracted functions. This set includes one s-type function and three p-type functions (px, py, pz). Each of these is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Number of contracted functions for the inner valence = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4.\n    *   **'1' (Outer Valence)**: The outer part of the valence shell is described by a second set of contracted functions. This set also includes one s-type function and three p-type functions. Each of these is represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Number of contracted functions for the outer valence = 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom**: Summing the functions for the core and valence shells:\n    *   Total C functions = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n**4. Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\nHydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence part of the notation applies.\n*   **'31'**: This describes the 1s valence orbital, which is split into two parts.\n    *   **'3' (Inner Valence)**: The inner part of the 1s orbital is represented by one contracted s-type function, formed from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   Number of contracted functions for the inner part = 1.\n    *   **'1' (Outer Valence)**: The outer part of the 1s orbital is represented by one contracted s-type function, which is a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Number of contracted functions for the outer part = 1.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom**: Summing the functions:\n    *   Total H functions = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C7H8)**\nNow, we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of each type in the molecule and sum the results.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon**:\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen**:\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total Contracted Functions**:\n    *   Total = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 functions.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Correct Atom Count**: Ensure the chemical formula (C7H8) is correctly identified and the atom count (7 C, 8 H) is accurate.\n*   **Basis Set Interpretation**: Distinguish between how the notation applies to \"heavy\" atoms (like C) versus hydrogen. Hydrogen lacks core electrons, so the first number ('6') does not apply to it.\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions**: The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions, not primitive ones. Each part of the basis set definition (e.g., '6', '3', '1') refers to the number of *primitive* Gaussians used to build one or more *contracted* functions.\n*   **p-orbitals**: Remember that a \"p\" shell in a basis set corresponds to three separate functions (px, py, pz).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nTotal Functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\nTotal Functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal Functions = 63 + 16\nTotal Functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
