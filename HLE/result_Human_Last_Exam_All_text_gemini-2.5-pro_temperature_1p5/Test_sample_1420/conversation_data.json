    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the theoretical framework**\nThe problem is set in the context of critical phenomena and is to be solved using Renormalization Group (RG) theory. Specifically, the method required is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. The system is in a spatial dimension $d=3$. The specific heat exponent is denoted by $\\alpha$.\n\n**2. Define the Epsilon Expansion**\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a powerful perturbative technique used in RG to calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n*   $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system.\n*   $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension, which is the dimension above which the predictions of mean-field theory for critical exponents become exact. For a wide range of systems described by a Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson $\\phi^4$ theory (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\nGiven the problem states $d=3$, the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$. Although the expansion is formally valid for infinitesimal $\\epsilon$, it often provides reasonably accurate results even for $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n**3. Identify the Key Physical Relation**\nThe scaling exponent for the specific heat, $\\alpha$, is not typically calculated directly but is found via its relationship with other exponents. The most useful relation here is the **hyperscaling relation**, which connects thermodynamic exponents to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\nThis relation is a key prediction of RG theory and is expected to hold for dimensions $d \\le d_c$. To find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**4. The Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\nThe correlation length exponent $\\nu$ describes how the correlation length $\\xi$ diverges near the critical temperature $T_c$: $\\xi \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\nu}$.\nUsing the RG analysis for the general $O(n)$ model (which describes systems with an $n$-component order parameter), one can calculate the critical exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$. To first order in $\\epsilon$, the exponent $\\nu$ is given by:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\nThis is a standard result from a one-loop RG calculation. The value of $n$ depends on the specific system:\n*   $n=1$: Ising model (scalar order parameter, e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnet).\n*   $n=2$: XY model (2D vector order parameter, e.g., superfluid transition in He-4).\n*   $n=3$: Heisenberg model (3D vector order parameter, e.g., isotropic ferromagnet).\n\n**5. Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$**\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$. We only need to keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n$2 - \\alpha = (4 - \\epsilon) \\nu = (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nLet's expand the right-hand side and keep terms up to $O(\\epsilon)$:\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - \\epsilon \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$\n\nCombine the terms with $\\epsilon$:\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\epsilon$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right) \\epsilon$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\left( \\frac{2n + 4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right) \\epsilon$\n$2 - \\alpha \\approx 2 + \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$:\n$-\\alpha \\approx \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon$\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon$\n\nThis is the general expression for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the $O(n)$ model.\n\n**6. List Careful Points**\n*   **Model Specification:** The question is generic and doesn't specify the universality class (i.e., the value of $n$). In the absence of specific information, the standard practice is to assume the simplest and most common case, the Ising model ($n=1$).\n*   **Approximation Level:** The calculation is performed to the first order in $\\epsilon$. This is an approximation. Higher-order terms in the expansion would provide a more accurate result.\n*   **Value of $\\epsilon$:** We are applying the expansion, which is formally valid for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, to the case of $d=3$, where $\\epsilon=1$. This extrapolation is standard but introduces inaccuracies. The result should be seen as a qualitative and semi-quantitative estimate.\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\nAssuming the question refers to the Ising universality class ($n=1$) and using the given dimension $d=3$ ($\\epsilon=1$), we can now calculate the final numerical value for $\\alpha$.\n\nSubstitute $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ into our derived formula:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot (1)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThus, the scaling exponent for the specific heat to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion is $1/6$.\n\n---\n<<<1/6>>>"
