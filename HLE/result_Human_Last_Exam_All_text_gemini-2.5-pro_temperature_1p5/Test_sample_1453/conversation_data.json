    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of a Coiled-Coil**\nCoiled-coils are formed by two or more alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, labeled `(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n`. The stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions. These residues form the hydrophobic core of the structure, where the helices interact.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\nWe need to find the correct phasing of the `a-b-c-d-e-f-g` repeat. The `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). By inspecting the sequence, we can see a recurring pattern of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L). Let's test alignments to place these residues at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nThe most chemically sensible alignment places Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position and Leucine (L) at the `a` position. Let's map this onto the sequence:\n\n*   Sequence:   `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Position:         `c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\nThis alignment starts the first `d` position at the third residue, `I(3)`.\n\n**Step 3: List the Residues at the Core `a` and `d` Positions**\nBased on the alignment above, we can identify all the core residues:\n*   **'a' positions:** `L(7)`, `L(14)`, `L(21)`, `L(28)` -> All are **Leucine (L)**.\n*   **'d' positions:** `I(3)`, `I(10)`, `I(17)`, `I(24)` -> All are **Isoleucine (I)**.\n\nSo, the hydrophobic core of this coiled-coil is consistently made of Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes)**\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how the side chains from one helix pack into the spaces on the adjacent helix. The size and shape of the `a` and `d` residues determine the optimal packing geometry and thus the number of helices (the oligomeric state).\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the `a` and `d` side chains (\"knobs\") from one helix pack into \"holes\" created by four side chains on the partner helix. This geometry comfortably accommodates large hydrophobic residues like Leucine and Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions. This `a=L, d=I` pattern allows for excellent, stable interdigitation of the side chains, maximizing hydrophobic interactions.\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the hydrophobic core is more crowded. While the `d` position can often accommodate a large residue like Isoleucine or Leucine (pointing towards the center), the `a` position is more sterically constrained. Placing a bulky residue like Leucine, and especially a beta-branched residue like Isoleucine, at the `a` position leads to steric clashes and poor packing efficiency. Trimers typically prefer a smaller residue like Alanine (A) at the `a` position.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Tetramers also have a tightly packed core. They often resolve steric issues by having a different type of packing, frequently requiring a pattern where the `a` position is large and hydrophobic (like I or L) but the `d` position is small (like A or T) or even polar. Having large residues at both `a` and `d` would result in an over-packed, unstable core.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\nThe observed pattern of **Leucine at all 'a' positions** and **Isoleucine at all 'd' positions** consists of large, bulky hydrophobic residues at both core positions. This specific combination is optimally suited for the packing geometry of a **dimeric (2-stranded)** coiled-coil. Any higher-order oligomer (trimer, tetramer, etc.) would suffer from significant steric hindrance and would therefore be energetically unfavorable.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
