    "An analysis of the problem is as follows, with a focus on creating the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The primary task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length. The output should be -1, 1, or 0, corresponding to the result of `string1 < string2`, `string1 > string2`, or `string1 == string2`, respectively.\n\n2.  **Core Constraint: Memory Efficiency:** The main challenge is to minimize the amount of memory used for variables in the C program. This means we should avoid declaring unnecessary variables or using larger data types when smaller ones suffice.\n\n3.  **Initial Thoughts & Naive Approach:** A straightforward approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays.\n    *   `char string1[101];` (Max length 100 + 1 for null terminator) -> 101 bytes.\n    *   `char string2[101];` -> 101 bytes.\n    *   A loop counter `int i;` -> 4 bytes.\n    *   Total memory: `101 + 101 + 4 = 206` bytes. This is likely not the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n4.  **Optimizing Memory:** The key to reducing memory is to avoid storing both strings simultaneously if possible. Since the input is sequential (first string, then a newline, then the second string), we cannot compare characters from both strings at the same time without storing at least one of them. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to:\n    *   Store the first string in a buffer.\n    *   Read the second string character-by-character.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it against the corresponding character in the stored first string.\n\n5.  **Developing the Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    *   **Step 1: Store the first string.** We need a character array. Since the maximum length is 100, we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the string and the null terminator (`\\0`) added by functions like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`.\n        *   Variable: `char s1[101];` -> **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Step 2: Process the second string.** We will read it one character at a time. We also need an index to keep track of our position in the first string (`s1`).\n    *   **Step 3: Choosing the I/O function.** We could use `getchar()` or `scanf()`.\n        *   **Using `getchar()`:** The function `getchar()` returns an `int` to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value. Using a `char` variable to store the result of `getchar()` is a common bug. This would require an `int` variable (typically 4 bytes).\n        *   **Using `scanf(\" %c\", ...)`:** This format string reads a single character. The leading space is important; it instructs `scanf` to skip any preceding whitespace, including the newline character left in the input buffer after reading the first string. This method works correctly with a `char` variable since we don't need to check for `EOF` (the loop will be controlled by the length of the first string).\n    *   **Step 4: Choosing the index variable.** The strings' lengths are at most 100, so the index will range from 0 to 99. The smallest integer data type in C that can hold this range is `unsigned char` (range 0-255).\n        *   Variable: `unsigned char i;` -> **1 byte**.\n    *   **Step 5: Choosing the character-input variable.** As determined in Step 3, using `scanf(\" %c\", ...)` allows us to use a `char` to store the incoming character from the second string.\n        *   Variable: `char c2;` -> **1 byte**.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Buffer Size:** A string of maximum length 100 requires a `char` array of size `101` to safely store the null terminator.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** At each step of the comparison, both characters (one from the stored string `s1` and one freshly read from input) must be converted to a common case (e.g., lowercase) using `tolower()` from the `<ctype.h>` library before comparing their values.\n3.  **Input Handling:** After reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", s1)`, a newline character (`\\n`) remains in the input stream. A robust method like `scanf(\" %c\", &c2)` must be used to correctly skip this newline and read the first character of the second string.\n4.  **Looping Mechanism:** The loop should continue as long as we haven't reached the end of the first string (i.e., until we hit the `\\0` null terminator). Since the problem guarantees strings of equal length, this is a safe way to ensure we compare all characters.\n5.  **Data Types:** Using the smallest possible data types for variables is crucial for memory efficiency. `unsigned char` (1 byte) for the index is better than `int` (4 bytes). Using `scanf` allows a `char` (1 byte) for the second string's character input, which is better than the `int` (4 bytes) required for a robust `getchar` loop.\n\n### Final Calculation of Memory Usage\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient approach identified:\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **Loop index variable:** `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  **Variable for character from the second string:** `char c2;`\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
