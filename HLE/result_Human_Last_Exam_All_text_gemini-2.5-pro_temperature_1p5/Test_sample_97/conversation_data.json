    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is not a simple one-step process. We must account for both the direct dissolution into ions (governed by K_sp) and the subsequent reaction of dissolved aluminum ions with hydroxide to form a complex ion (governed by K_f).\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium. In this case, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n3.  **Water Autoionization:** Since the process occurs in pure water, the autoionization of water (H₂O <=> H⁺ + OH⁻) is another equilibrium that must be considered, especially because the dissolution reactions consume or produce OH⁻, which will shift this equilibrium.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** To solve for the unknown concentrations, a charge balance equation is essential. The sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges in the solution.\n5.  **Derivation of a Combined Equilibrium:** It is useful to combine the K_sp and K_f expressions to describe the direct formation of the complex ion from the solid precipitate.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n1.  **Dissolution to ions:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the complex ion from dissolved Al³⁺:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n3.  **Direct dissolution to form the complex ion:** We can combine the two reactions above to find the equilibrium constant (let's call it K_c) for the reaction where the solid dissolves directly to form the complex ion.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)      (K_sp)\n    +  Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)   (K_f)\n    ------------------------------------------------------\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n\n    The constant for this combined reaction, K_c, is the product of the individual constants:\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    So, K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n4.  **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (assuming 25°C)\n\n**Step 2: Define solubility and express species concentrations.**\n\nThe total solubility, S, is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the aluminum species in terms of [OH⁻] using the equilibrium constants from Step 1:\nFrom K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³\nFrom K_c: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nThe ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The solution must be electrically neutral.\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the unknown concentration [OH⁻].**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [Al³⁺], [Al(OH)₄⁻], and [H⁺] (= K_w / [OH⁻]) into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_c * [OH⁻])\n\nMultiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_c*[OH⁻]⁴\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = (1 + K_c)*[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange into a standard polynomial form (this is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]²):\n(1 + K_c)*[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)*[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)*[OH⁻]² - 3*(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(58301)*[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)*[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nLet z = [OH⁻]². The equation becomes:\n58301*z² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)*z - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nSolve for z using the quadratic formula, z = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a. Since z must be positive, we only take the positive root.\nz = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + √((-1.0x10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(58301)(-1.59x10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 58301)\nz = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + √(1.0x10⁻²⁸ + 3.707x10⁻²¹)] / 116602\nThe first term under the square root (1.0x10⁻²⁸) is negligible compared to the second.\nz ≈ [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + √(3.707x10⁻²¹)] / 116602\nz ≈ [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + 6.089x10⁻¹¹] / 116602\nz ≈ (6.089x10⁻¹¹) / 116602\nz ≈ 5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = √z = √(5.222 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\n\nNow that we have [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and sum them to find the solubility S.\n\n[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000444 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001774 mol L⁻¹\nS = 1.774 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the initial constants:\nS = 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 x 10⁻³>>>"
