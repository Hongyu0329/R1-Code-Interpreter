    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Objects**\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface (or a smooth projective algebraic curve over the complex numbers) of genus `g = 3`.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. A point in X can be represented as a formal sum `D = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_15`, where `P_i` are points on C (not necessarily distinct). X is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated free abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** This is the rank of the Neron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number, denoted `ρ(X)`. We need to find the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(X)` as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. Relate the Neron-Severi Group of X to C**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is a standard result in the theory of algebraic curves that relates the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power `C^(n)` to the Jacobian variety of the curve `C`.\n\n*   **Jacobian Variety Jac(C):** For a curve C of genus g, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is a g-dimensional abelian variety that parameterizes line bundles of degree 0 on C. In our case, `g=3`, so `Jac(C)` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n*   **Abel-Jacobi Map:** There is a map `u_n: C^(n) -> Jac(C)` which sends an effective divisor `D` of degree `n` to the line bundle `O_C(D - nP_0)`, where `P_0` is a chosen base point on C.\n*   **Structure of NS(C^(n)):** The Neron-Severi group of the symmetric power `C^(n)` is closely related to the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C. The pullback map `u_n^*: NS(Jac(C)) -> NS(C^(n))` is injective. The cokernel is a free abelian group of rank 1. This leads to the fundamental formula for the ranks:\n    `ρ(C^(n)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`\n\nThis formula holds for any `n >= 1`. In our case, `n=15` and `g=3`, so we have:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, `ρ(Jac(C))`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Rank of NS(Jac(C))**\n\nThe rank `ρ(Jac(C))` depends on the structure of the endomorphism ring `End(Jac(C))`. The Neron-Severi group `NS(A)` of an abelian variety `A` can be identified with the group of symmetric endomorphisms in `End(A)` with respect to the Rosati involution (which is induced by a principal polarization, like the one on a Jacobian).\n\n*   **Case 1: The Smallest Possible Rank**\n    The smallest rank occurs for a *generic* curve C. A generic curve of genus `g > 1` has the property that its Jacobian has no extra endomorphisms beyond the trivial ones (multiplication by integers).\n    *   `End(Jac(C)) = Z`\n    *   In this case, `NS(Jac(C))` is generated by the class of the canonical principal polarization (the theta divisor, `Θ`).\n    *   Therefore, the rank is `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n    *   This gives the smallest possible rank for `NS(X)`:\n        `ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Case 2: The Largest Possible Rank**\n    The largest rank occurs for a *special* curve C, specifically one whose Jacobian has Complex Multiplication (CM). The endomorphism algebra `End^0(Jac(C)) = End(Jac(C)) ⊗ Q` is as large as possible.\n    *   For a principally polarized abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, the rank of its Neron-Severi group is bounded by `ρ(A) ≤ g^2`.\n    *   For our `Jac(C)`, `g = 3`, so the maximum possible rank is `ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n    *   This maximum is achieved if `Jac(C)` is of CM-type and is isogenous to the cube of a single CM elliptic curve, i.e., `Jac(C) ~ E^3` where `E` is an elliptic curve with `End(E)` being an order in an imaginary quadratic field.\n    *   We must ensure that such a curve C of genus 3 exists. Indeed, it does. A classic example is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 = 1`. This is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`.\n    *   For such a curve, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n    *   This gives the largest possible rank for `NS(X)`:\n        `ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The specific power n=15 is not critical:** The formula `ρ(C^(n)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1` is independent of `n` (for `n ≥ 1`). The same answer would be obtained for `C^(2)` or `C^(100)`.\n2.  **Generic vs. Special:** The range of possible ranks exists because the properties of a curve C are not fixed. A \"generic\" curve has the simplest possible structure for its Jacobian, leading to the minimum rank. \"Special\" curves, which form a lower-dimensional subset in the moduli space of curves, can have Jacobians with richer structures (like CM), leading to higher ranks.\n3.  **Existence of Extremal Curves:** It is crucial that curves realizing these minimal and maximal ranks actually exist. The set of generic curves is dense in the moduli space, so the minimum is attained. For the maximum, one must point to an explicit example or an existence theorem, like the Fermat curve, to show that the upper bound `g^2` is sharp for Jacobians.\n4.  **Formula `ρ(C^(n)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`:** This is the central fact. It arises because `Pic(C^(n))` is generated by the pullback of `Pic(Jac(C))` and one extra class, often denoted `x`, which is the class of the divisor `W_{n-1} = {D ∈ C^(n) | P_0 ∈ supp(D)}` for a fixed point `P_0`. The Neron-Severi group inherits this structure.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:** `ρ(Jac(C))_min = 1`. So, `ρ(X)_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Largest Rank:** `ρ(Jac(C))_max = 9`. So, `ρ(X)_max = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
