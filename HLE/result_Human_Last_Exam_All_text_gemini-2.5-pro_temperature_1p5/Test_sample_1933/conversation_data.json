    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema (or signature) $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate defines a property that an element of a domain can either possess or not.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a specific fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   $\\mathrm{FO}$: First-Order Logic.\n    *   $S$: The formulas are built using the 4 predicates from our schema.\n    *   $\\exists$: We can use the existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: We can use the logical conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: We can use the logical constants for True and False.\n    *   Crucially, connectives like negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), implication ($\\to$), and the universal quantifier ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a set of classifiers. In this context, our \"classifiers\" are the formulas of the given logic with one free variable, say $x$. For a given model (or structure) $M$ with domain $U$, a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a subset of the domain, $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$. The VC dimension is the size $d$ of the largest set of points $X \\subseteq U$ that can be **shattered**. A set $X$ is shattered if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic such that the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ intersects with $X$ to produce exactly $Y$. The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum such $d$ over all possible models $M$.\n\n**2. Characterize the Formulas (Classifiers)**\n\nWe are interested in formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. Let's analyze the structure of such formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n*   **Atomic Formulas**: The only atomic formulas with $x$ as a free variable are $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n*   **Conjunction**: We can combine formulas using $\\land$. So we can form formulas like $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n*   **Existential Quantifier**: We can use $\\exists$. For a formula with a free variable $x$, the quantifier must bind a different variable, say $y$. A typical quantified part would look like $\\exists y . \\psi(x, y)$. However, since our schema only has unary predicates, any atomic formula inside $\\psi$ can only have one variable. Thus, $\\psi(x, y)$ must be a conjunction of formulas of the form $P_i(x)$ and $P_j(y)$.\n    *   For example, consider $\\phi(x) = (\\exists y . (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))) \\land P_3(x)$. This can be rewritten as $(P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y . P_2(y))) \\land P_3(x)$.\n*   **General Form**: Any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic is logically equivalent to a formula of the form:\n    $$ \\Psi \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) $$\n    where $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and $\\Psi$ is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables). $\\Psi$ is itself a conjunction of existentially quantified formulas like $\\exists y . (\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(y))$.\n\n**3. Characterize the Definable Sets (The Concept Class)**\n\nThe VC dimension is determined by the collection of subsets that can be defined by the logic. Let's fix an arbitrary model $M$.\n\n*   A formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\Psi \\land (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x))$ defines a set $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n*   The truth of the sentence $\\Psi$ depends only on the model $M$, not on the specific element $a$.\n    *   If $M \\models \\neg \\Psi$ (i.e., $\\Psi$ is false in $M$), then $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $a$. The definable set is the **empty set, $\\emptyset$**.\n    *   If $M \\models \\Psi$ (i.e., $\\Psi$ is true in $M$), then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. The definable set is $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)\\}$, which is the intersection of the extensions of the predicates: $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n*   The key observation is that for any fixed model $M$, the collection of all possible definable sets, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}_M$, is a subset of $\\{\\emptyset\\} \\cup \\{\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\}$.\n*   In fact, this collection is *exactly* $\\{\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\}$. Why?\n    *   For any $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the formula $\\phi(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ is a valid formula in our logic (if $I=\\emptyset$, this is the formula $\\top$, which defines the whole domain). This formula does not need a non-trivial sentence part $\\Psi$.\n    *   Therefore, the existential quantifier $\\exists$ does not add to the variety of sets we can define within a fixed model; it only provides alternative ways to define either $\\emptyset$ or one of the basic intersection sets.\n*   This means our concept class is the class of **conjunctions over 4 features**, where the features are the predicates $P_1, \\ldots, P_4$.\n\n**4. Calculate the VC Dimension**\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of conjunctions over 4 features. It is a standard result in learning theory that the VC dimension of conjunctions over $k$ Boolean features is exactly $k$. Here, we have $k=4$.\n\n**Proof Sketch:**\n\n*   **VC dimension is at least 4 (VCdim $\\ge 4$)**: We must show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\n    *   Let's construct a model with a domain containing a set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n    *   Define the predicates on these points as follows: $M \\models P_i(x_j)$ if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n    *   Now, we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept (a formula) that picks out exactly $Y$.\n    *   Let $Y$ be any desired subset of $X$. Let $\\bar{Y} = X \\setminus Y$ be the set of points we want to exclude.\n    *   Let $I_Y = \\{j \\mid x_j \\in \\bar{Y}\\}$. This is the set of indices corresponding to the points to be excluded.\n    *   Consider the concept defined by the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_Y} P_j(x)$.\n    *   Let's see which points of $X$ satisfy this formula:\n        1.  Take any point $x_k \\in \\bar{Y}$. By definition of $I_Y$, the index $k$ is in $I_Y$. The formula requires $P_k(x_k)$ to be true. But by our construction, $P_k(x_k)$ is false. So, $x_k$ is not selected. This is correct.\n        2.  Take any point $x_m \\in Y$. By definition of $I_Y$, the index $m$ is not in $I_Y$. The formula requires $P_j(x_m)$ to be true for all $j \\in I_Y$. Since $j \\in I_Y$ implies $j \\neq m$, our construction guarantees that $P_j(x_m)$ is true. So, $x_m$ is selected. This is also correct.\n    *   This construction works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$. Thus, $X$ is shattered, and VCdim $\\ge 4$.\n\n*   **VC dimension is at most 4 (VCdim $\\le 4$)**: We must show that no set of 5 points can be shattered.\n    *   Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points in any model.\n    *   For each point $x_j$, we can associate a signature vector $v_j \\in \\{0,1\\}^4$, where the $i$-th component is 1 if $M \\models P_i(x_j)$ and 0 otherwise.\n    *   We have 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This set of vectors must be linearly dependent.\n    *   This means there exists a non-empty subset of indices $S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ such that $\\sum_{j \\in S} v_j = \\vec{0} \\pmod 2$.\n    *   This dependency implies that not all subsets of $X_S = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in S\\}$ can be generated by our concept class (conjunctions), which prevents $X_S$ (and therefore $X$) from being shattered. For example, consider a minimal dependent set $S$. For any $k \\in S$, the subset $X_S \\setminus \\{x_k\\}$ can only be generated if $|S \\setminus \\{k\\}|$ is an even number. If $|S \\setminus \\{k\\}|$ is odd, this subset cannot be generated, breaking the shattering property. Since this holds for any set of 5 points, the VC dimension cannot be 5.\n    *   Thus, VCdim $\\le 4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the VC dimension is both at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4."
