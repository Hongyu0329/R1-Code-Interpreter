    "This problem is a three-dimensional packing problem. We need to find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into a 15x15x15 cube.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints and dimensions**\n*   **Container:** A cube with side length L = 15. Its volume is V_cube = 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375.\n*   **Object to pack:** A rectangular block (cuboid) with dimensions 9 x 1 x 1. Its volume is V_block = 9 * 1 * 1 = 9.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the theoretical maximum (the volume ratio)**\nA common first step is to divide the volume of the container by the volume of the object. This gives an absolute upper limit on the number of blocks, as it assumes no space is wasted.\n*   Maximum number (theoretical) = V_cube / V_block = 3375 / 9 = 375.\n*   **Careful Point:** This number is almost always an overestimation in packing problems, because the shapes may not fit together perfectly to fill all the space. This is the case here since the cube's side length (15) is not a multiple of the block's longest side (9). So, the actual answer must be less than or equal to 375.\n\n**Step 3: Develop a practical packing strategy**\nWe can use a greedy approach where we fill a section of the cube as densely as possible, and then try to pack the remaining space. We should orient the blocks with their sides parallel to the cube's axes.\n\n*   **Packing Phase 1:**\n    Let the cube's axes be X, Y, and Z. Let's align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the X-axis.\n    *   Along the X-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the Y-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   The total number of blocks in this orientation is `1 * 15 * 15 = 225`.\n    *   These blocks occupy a volume of `(1 * 9) x (15 * 1) x (15 * 1)`, which is a `9 x 15 x 15` section of the cube.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This leaves a remaining empty slab of space with dimensions `(15 - 9) x 15 x 15`, which is `6 x 15 x 15`.\n\n*   **Packing Phase 2:**\n    Now we must try to fill the remaining `6 x 15 x 15` slab.\n    *   To fit a `9x1x1` block, we must align its 9-unit length along one of the 15-unit dimensions of the slab. Let's align it with the Y-axis.\n    *   Along the 6-unit dimension (X), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the 15-unit dimension (Y), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the 15-unit dimension (Z), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   The number of additional blocks we can fit is `6 * 1 * 15 = 90`.\n    *   These 90 blocks occupy a volume of `6 x 9 x 15` inside the slab.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This leaves a smaller remaining empty prism with dimensions `6 x (15 - 9) x 15`, which is `6 x 6 x 15`.\n\n*   **Packing Phase 3:**\n    Now we must try to fill the remaining `6 x 6 x 15` prism.\n    *   To fit a `9x1x1` block, we must align its 9-unit length with the only available dimension that is large enough: the 15-unit dimension (Z-axis).\n    *   Along the 6-unit dimension (X), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the 6-unit dimension (Y), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the 15-unit dimension (Z), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   The number of additional blocks is `6 * 6 * 1 = 36`.\n    *   These 36 blocks occupy a volume of `6 x 6 x 9`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This leaves a final remaining empty cube with dimensions `6 x 6 x (15 - 9)`, which is `6 x 6 x 6`.\n\n*   **Packing Phase 4:**\n    Can we fit any blocks into the final `6 x 6 x 6` cube?\n    *   The block's longest dimension is 9.\n    *   The largest dimension of the remaining space is 6.\n    *   Since 9 > 6, no more blocks can be fit.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of blocks**\nWe sum the number of blocks from each phase of the packing.\n*   Total blocks = (Blocks from Phase 1) + (Blocks from Phase 2) + (Blocks from Phase 3)\n*   Total blocks = 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\nThis layered, axis-aligned packing strategy is optimal for this type of problem. The total volume of the 351 blocks is 351 * 9 = 3159. The wasted volume is 3375 - 3159 = 216, which corresponds exactly to the `6x6x6` cube we couldn't use.\n\n<<<351>>>"
