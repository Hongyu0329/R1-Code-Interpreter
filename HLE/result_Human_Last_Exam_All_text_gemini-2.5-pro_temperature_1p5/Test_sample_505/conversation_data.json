    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the encoding capacity of a single surface code patch with holes.\nA surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. A simple, standard planar patch of surface code without any modifications (i.e., no holes) can encode one logical qubit. The logical operators are defined by strings of physical qubit operators that stretch between different boundaries of the patch.\n\nWhen holes are introduced into the surface code patch, the topology of the code changes. Each hole creates a new, distinct boundary within the patch. These new boundaries can be used to define additional logical operators.\n\nThe key principle for this problem is:\n**A single planar surface code patch with *n* holes can encode *n* logical qubits.**\n\n*   For example, a patch with one hole can encode one logical qubit. The logical Z operator can be a loop of Pauli-Z operations around the hole, and the logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operations connecting the hole's boundary to the outer boundary of the patch.\n*   Following this principle, a patch with **two holes** has one outer boundary and two inner boundaries (one for each hole). This topology allows for the definition of two independent logical qubits.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of logical qubits for one patch.\nThe question states that the surface code patches have \"two holes\".\nUsing the principle from Step 1:\n*   Number of holes per patch = 2\n*   Number of logical qubits per patch = 2\n\nTherefore, one such patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of **2 logical qubits**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of logical qubits for the entire system.\nThe question specifies \"two patches of surface code\". This implies we have two separate, independent systems. The total information capacity of a system composed of independent subsystems is the sum of their individual capacities.\n\n*   System consists of: Patch 1 and Patch 2.\n*   Patch 1: Has two holes, so it can encode 2 logical qubits.\n*   Patch 2: Also has two holes, so it can also encode 2 logical qubits.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\nTotal Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\nTotal Logical Qubits = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Holes and Logical Qubits:** The direct relationship between the number of holes and the number of logical qubits (`k=n_holes`) is a fundamental concept in this type of surface code architecture.\n2.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"two patches... with two holes\" is interpreted to mean that *each* of the two patches has two holes. This is the most standard reading of the grammar.\n3.  **Independence of Patches:** The problem describes two distinct \"patches,\" which are treated as independent systems. Therefore, their qubit capacities are additive. There is no mention of them being connected or interacting, which would change the calculation.\n4.  **The \"At Most\" Clause:** This confirms we should calculate the maximum possible number of logical qubits that can be encoded, which is achieved by using the topology (the holes) in the standard, most efficient way.\n\n### Conclusion:\nEach of the two patches can encode 2 logical qubits because each has two holes. Since the patches are separate systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch, which is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
