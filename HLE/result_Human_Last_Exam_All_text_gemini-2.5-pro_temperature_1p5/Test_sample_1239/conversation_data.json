    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u} $$\n    (Here, density $\\rho$ is set to 1 by absorbing it into the pressure term, and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity.)\n\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n\nThe variables are the independent variables: time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$; and the dependent variables: velocity components $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure $p$.\n\n### Step 2: Define and identify the symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that leaves the form of the equations invariant. The dimension of the group is the number of independent parameters that define these transformations. We can find these by identifying the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\nWe list the symmetries, the number of parameters for each, and their physical interpretation.\n\n**1. Time Translation**\nThe laws of physics are invariant with respect to a shift in the origin of time.\n*   Transformation: $t' = t + \\epsilon$\n*   Number of parameters: 1\n*   **Dimension: 1**\n\n**2. Space Translations**\nThe laws of physics are invariant with respect to a shift in the origin of spatial coordinates (homogeneity of space).\n*   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}\\epsilon$\n*   Number of parameters: 3 (one for each component of the constant vector $\\mathbf{c}$)\n*   **Dimension: 3**\n\n**3. Spatial Rotations**\nThe laws of physics are invariant under rotations of the coordinate system (isotropy of space). Both $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{u}$ transform as vectors.\n*   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix.\n*   The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), is a 3-parameter group.\n*   **Dimension: 3**\n\n**4. Galilean Boosts**\nThe equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity (Galilean relativity principle).\n*   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t\\epsilon$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0 \\epsilon$\n*   The pressure $p$ remains unchanged in this transformation.\n*   Number of parameters: 3 (one for each component of the constant velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}_0$)\n*   **Dimension: 3**\n\n**5. Pressure Shift**\nThe momentum equation only contains the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, shifting the pressure by a constant value does not change the equation.\n*   Transformation: $p' = p + \\epsilon$\n*   Number of parameters: 1\n*   **Dimension: 1**\n\n**6. Scaling Symmetry (Dilation)**\nThis is a non-trivial symmetry that is found by systematically searching for scaling transformations of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^d p$.\nSubstituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and requiring the form to be invariant for any $\\lambda$ leads to a set of linear equations for the exponents $a, b, c, d$. The solution (up to a common multiple) is:\n$a=2$, $b=1$, $c=-1$, $d=-2$.\nThis corresponds to the transformation:\n$t' = \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n*   This is a one-parameter family of transformations (parameterized by $\\lambda$).\n*   **Dimension: 1**\n\n### Step 3: Sum the dimensions\n\nTo find the total dimension of the Lie group, we sum the dimensions from each independent symmetry transformation.\n\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Pressure Shift: 1\n*   Scaling: 1\n\n**Total Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12.**\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The full Lie symmetry group of the Navier-Stokes equations is actually infinite-dimensional. The additional symmetries correspond to transformations to an arbitrarily accelerating reference frame.\n*   However, the question \"What is the dimension...\" is conventionally understood to be asking for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional* subalgebra of symmetries.\n*   The 12 symmetries listed above generate this maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra. This is a classic result from the symmetry analysis of differential equations.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the dimensions of these six types of symmetry transformations.\n\nFinal Answer: The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
