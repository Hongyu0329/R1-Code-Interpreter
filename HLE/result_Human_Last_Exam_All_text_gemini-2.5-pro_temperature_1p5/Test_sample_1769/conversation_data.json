    "This is a fascinating question that delves into the alternative history of the English language. To determine the likely modern word, we need to trace the evolution of the original Old English word, excluding the influence of Old Norse.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Words:**\n    *   The Modern English word is **\"sister\"**.\n    *   The word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse **\"systir\"**. The Vikings brought this word to England during their invasions and settlement between the 7th and 12th centuries.\n    *   The native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for the same concept was **\"sweostor\"**.\n    *   Both the Old Norse \"systir\" and the Old English \"sweostor\" originate from the same Proto-Germanic root, `*swestēr`. This is why they are so similar.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Norse Influence:**\n    *   In the parts of England where Norse and English speakers lived side-by-side (the Danelaw), the two languages heavily influenced each other.\n    *   The Old Norse \"systir\" was phonetically simpler than the Old English \"sweostor\". The hard /k/ sound (represented by the 's' in \"sister\" in modern pronunciation, but closer to the 'k' sound in Old Norse) eventually won out over the more complex `sw-` and `-eo-` sounds of the native word. The form \"sister\" gradually replaced \"sweostor\" throughout England.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize the Evolution of \"Sweostor\" without Norse Influence:**\n    *   If the Norse had never arrived, the native Old English word \"sweostor\" would have evolved according to the natural sound changes that occurred in English as it transitioned from Old to Middle and then to Modern English.\n    *   We can predict this evolution by looking at what happened to other Old English words with similar sounds.\n\n    *   **The Initial `sw-`:** The `sw-` sound at the beginning of a word was generally stable in English.\n        *   *swān* -> swan\n        *   *swete* -> sweet\n        *   *swimman* -> swim\n        *   Therefore, the `sw-` in *sweostor* would most likely have remained.\n\n    *   **The Medial Diphthong `-eo-`:** The short diphthong `-eo-` in Old English typically smoothed into a short `-e-` sound in Middle English.\n        *   *sweord* (sword) is a tricky example, but the vowel sound evolved into something like 'o'.\n        *   However, a more common path for this sound, especially before an `s`, was to become `e`.\n\n    *   **The Final Syllable `-or`:** In unstressed final syllables, the `-or` ending in Old English consistently became `-er` in Middle and Modern English.\n        *   *mōdor* -> mother\n        *   *brōþor* -> brother\n        *   *fæder* (not `-or`, but shows the vowel reduction) -> father\n        *   Following this pattern, the `-or` in *sweostor* would have become `-er`.\n\n4.  **Reconstruct the Hypothetical Word:**\n    *   Start with the Old English form: **sweostor**.\n    *   Apply the sound changes:\n        *   `sw-` remains `sw-`.\n        *   `-eo-` becomes `-e-`.\n        *   `-or` becomes `-er`.\n    *   This reconstruction gives us the hypothetical Middle English form **\"swester\"**.\n    *   This form would have likely carried through to Modern English as **\"swester\"**, rhyming with words like \"jester\" or \"fester\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Linguistic Certainty:** This is a reconstruction based on established patterns of linguistic evolution. While it is the most logical and evidence-based conclusion, it remains a hypothetical scenario.\n*   **Cognate Evidence:** Our conclusion is strongly supported by cognates in other West Germanic languages that did not experience the same Norse influence. The Modern German word is **\"Schwester\"**, and the Dutch word is **\"zuster\"**, both of which are very close to the reconstructed \"swester\".\n*   **The Existing Word:** The modern word \"sister\" is a direct result of language contact and borrowing. This analysis isolates the native English word from that specific historical event.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely have been \"swester\" if the Norse had never influenced the language's development.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
