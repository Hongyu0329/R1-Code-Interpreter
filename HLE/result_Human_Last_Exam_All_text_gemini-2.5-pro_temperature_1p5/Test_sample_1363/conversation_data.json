    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts in the question.**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to the left. It typically consists of a set number of steps and a standard amount of rotation.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure. For instance, turning 360 degrees when the standard is 270 degrees.\n*   **Disregarding the technique:** This is the most critical part. It means violating the foundational principles that define the character of a specific dance. This isn't about difficulty; it's about whether the action contradicts the core rules of the dance style.\n*   **Impossible:** This implies that the action cannot be performed while adhering to the essential techniques of the dance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technique of each dance style, focusing on rotation.**\nLet's examine how turns are executed in each of the listed dances and whether overturning is compatible with their core techniques.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:**\n    *   **Technique:** Characterized by fast, continuous rotation and constant movement around the floor. While there are standard amounts of turn, the nature of the dance requires adjusting rotation for floorcraft.\n    *   **Analysis:** Overturning a section of the Reverse Turn is not only possible but sometimes necessary to navigate a crowded floor. It doesn't violate the core principle of continuous rotation; it simply modifies its speed. Therefore, it's not impossible.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** (These can be analyzed together as they are both \"swing\" dances with similar core principles).\n    *   **Technique:** These dances are defined by CBM (Contra Body Movement), body swing, and, crucially, **Sway**. Sway is the inclination of the body away from the direction of movement, which is essential for maintaining balance during turns and creating a graceful, sweeping look.\n    *   **Analysis:** A standard Reverse Turn can be overturned. Advanced dancers frequently use overturned figures for choreographic effect. To maintain balance during a powerful, overturned rotation, dancers use sway. Using sway is a correct and advanced application of the technique, not a disregard for it. Therefore, overturning is possible within the technical framework.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:**\n    *   **Technique:** Another swing dance, but faster and more energetic. It incorporates CBM, swing, and sway, though the actions are quicker and sharper.\n    *   **Analysis:** Similar to Waltz and Foxtrot, overturning turns is a common feature in advanced Quickstep. The dynamic nature of the dance supports powerful rotations. Sway is used to control the momentum and balance. Thus, it's not impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn while adhering to the technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:**\n    *   **Technique:** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its core technique includes:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The movement is flat and grounded.\n        *   **No Sway:** This is a defining rule. The body is meant to stay upright and centered over the feet, without leaning or inclining into turns. The action is sharp, staccato, and stealthy.\n        *   **Action:** Turns are executed with a sharp rotation of the torso, not a pendular swing.\n    *   **Analysis:** Consider what is required to overturn a turn. It generates significant rotational force that pulls the dancers off their center. In all the other dances, sway is the technical tool used to counteract this force and maintain balance. Since sway is explicitly forbidden in Tango technique, there is no technical mechanism to control the balance of an overturned rotation. Attempting to overturn a Reverse Turn would force the dancers to either fall off balance or introduce sway. Introducing sway is a direct violation and \"disregard\" for the fundamental technique of Tango. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn the turn *without* disregarding the technique.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe European Tango is the only dance listed where a core technical rule (no sway) makes it technically impossible to manage the balance required for an overturned Reverse Turn. To perform the action, a dancer would have to break this fundamental rule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
