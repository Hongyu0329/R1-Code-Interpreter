    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: The Author:** The quote is attributed to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous and influential Russian poet. This strongly suggests the subject of the question is a figure of significance in Russian history or culture.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Description:** The man is called \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This is a metaphorical description. \"Sailor\" implies travel, exploration, or a connection to the sea. \"Joy-discovering\" suggests his travels led to a discovery of happiness, love, or something that brought joy to others, even if tragically.\n    *   **Clue 3: The Lost Grave:** Voznesensky's poem asks, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This tells us that at the time the poem was written, the man's burial place was unknown. This was a central part of his legacy.\n    *   **Clue 4: The Timeline:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is a crucial historical marker. It means that the location of the lost grave was discovered or identified during the period of *Glasnost* and *Perestroika* in the Soviet Union.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   The most direct way to solve this is to identify the work by Voznesensky. The quotes come from his poem \"Saga\" (1972). This poem formed the basis for the libretto of the iconic Russian rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"** (*Юнона и Авось*), for which Voznesensky was the lyricist.\n    *   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, explorer, and diplomat **Nikolai Rezanov** (1764-1807).\n    *   Let's check if Rezanov fits all the clues:\n        *   **\"Sailor\":** Rezanov was one of the first Russian circumnavigators of the Earth. He sailed from Russia to Alaska (then Russian America) and then to Spanish California on the ships *Juno* and *Avos*. The \"sailor\" description fits perfectly.\n        *   **\"Joy-discovering\":** While in California, Rezanov fell in love with and became engaged to Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Commandant of San Francisco. This passionate romance is the \"joy\" he discovered, and it is the central theme of the opera.\n        *   **Lost Grave:** Rezanov had to return to Russia to get the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic. He fell ill while crossing Siberia on horseback, died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and was buried there. His original gravesite and monument at the Voskresensky Cathedral were destroyed by the Soviets in the mid-20th century, and the exact location of his remains was lost. This directly corresponds to Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n        *   **Grave's location found in the late 1980s:** Fueled by the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" and the new openness of the Perestroika era (late 1980s), a public campaign began to find Rezanov's grave. The location was rediscovered, and in the following years, a new memorial was erected. Therefore, the \"answer\" to the question of his grave's location did indeed emerge in the late 1980s.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" is poetic, not a literal job title. It refers to the emotional heart of his story.\n*   The connection to a specific, famous poet (Voznesensky) is the key link to the cultural work (\"Juno and Avos\") that identifies the man.\n*   The \"late 1980s\" is a very specific clue that points to a historical re-examination that happened during the Perestroika era in the USSR.\n*   The \"answer\" emerging means the mystery was solved and became public knowledge, leading to concrete actions like establishing a new memorial.\n\nThe man who fits all these criteria is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
