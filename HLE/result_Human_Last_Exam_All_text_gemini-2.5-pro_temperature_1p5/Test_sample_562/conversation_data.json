    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\nFirst, we analyze the structure of the kanji 謄. It is a compound character formed by two parts arranged in a left-right configuration.\n*   The left part is: 言\n*   The right part is: 滕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, for characters with a left-right structure, the left-hand component is very often the radical, especially when it is a common radical form. This left-side radical is called a *hen* (偏).\n*   The left component, 言, is one of the 214 traditional Kangxi radicals and is a very common radical in Japanese kanji. It relates to \"speech,\" \"words,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The right component, 滕, acts as the phonetic component, indicating the sound of the character.\nTherefore, the classifying radical for 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Japanese Name of the Radical**\nEach radical has a specific name in Japanese, which can sometimes change depending on its position in the character.\n*   The radical is 言.\n*   When it appears on the left side of a character, it is called ごんべん (gonben).\n    *   ごん (gon) is a reading of the character 言.\n    *   べん (ben) is the voiced form of へん (hen), the word for a left-side radical.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using the standard Hepburn transcription system.\n*   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   In Hepburn romanization, this is written as \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correct Decomposition:** It's crucial to correctly identify the main components of the character. 謄 is clearly split into 言 and 滕.\n2.  **Radical Position:** The position of the radical component determines part of its name. Radicals on the left are called *hen* (へん), on the right *tsukuri* (つくり), on the top *kanmuri* (かんむり), etc. For 言, being on the left side is key to its name.\n3.  **Radical Naming Convention:** The name \"Gonben\" is specific to the radical 言 when it's used as a *hen*. If the character 言 were a radical at the bottom of a character (which is rare), it would have a different name.\n4.  **Romanization Accuracy:** The transcription must follow Hepburn rules. ご (go), ん (n), べ (be), ん (n) correctly combine to form \"Gonben\".\n\nFollowing these steps, the radical of 謄 is identified as 言, its Japanese name as a left-side radical is ごんべん, and its Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
