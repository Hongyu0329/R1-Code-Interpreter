    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nFirst, let's break down the user's question into its key components:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\" of the square.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** This happened in a specific year, \"1950\".\n*   **Agent:** The removal was done by the \"city administration\".\n\n**Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Eliminating Incorrect Possibilities**\n*   The feature must be something that was physically part of the square's structure or landscape.\n*   It cannot be the Pantheon itself, which is still there.\n*   It cannot be the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain in the center of the square) or the Egyptian obelisk on top of it. While the fountain was redesigned and the obelisk was added centuries ago, neither was removed in 1950. They are both still present today.\n*   The removal of the cluster of medieval houses and shops that used to be attached to the Pantheon happened much earlier, primarily during the Renaissance and then in the 19th century. This does not match the 1950 date.\n*   The feature needs to be something the \"city administration\" would be responsible for installing and removing, which points towards public works or infrastructure.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  The question's specificity, particularly the year 1950, suggests looking at changes related to 20th-century urban development in Rome.\n2.  The period after World War II was a time of significant modernization in many European cities, including changes to public transportation.\n3.  Historical research, including old photographs and city maps from the first half of the 20th century, reveals that an extensive tram network ran through the center of Rome.\n4.  These records show that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, with the tracks passing right in front of the Pantheon's portico. For a historic and ancient square, the presence of industrial-era tram tracks was a very distinct, and arguably incongruous, architectural feature of that time.\n5.  Following WWII, Rome's city administration made a policy decision to replace many of the central tram routes with more flexible bus lines. This led to the dismantling of many tram tracks in the historic center.\n6.  The removal of the tram line and its tracks from the Piazza della Rotonda fits the 1950 timeframe perfectly, as this was the peak period for this city-wide project. The removal significantly changed the square's appearance, restoring a more pedestrian and historically coherent feel.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on this analysis, the unique architectural feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 by the city administration was the set of tram tracks for the public transit system.\n\n<<<A set of tram tracks>>>"
