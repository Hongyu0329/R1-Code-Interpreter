Yes, the theory will not hold. The birefringent medium fundamentally changes the nature of the optical system. Initially, the system is polarization-preserving, and the problem can be treated as a scalar problem affecting only the spatial mode of one polarization. The birefringent medium, described by a non-trivial Jones matrix, couples the initial horizontal polarization into other polarization states (e.g., vertical or circular). This transforms the beam into a vector field where the spatial information is encoded across two coupled polarization channels. The original reversal theory, which was designed for a single scalar channel and uses only the inverse of the random medium `T_inv`, is incapable of disentangling the complex, polarization-dependent scrambling introduced by the birefringent element. It fails because it cannot account for the vector nature of the new system.
