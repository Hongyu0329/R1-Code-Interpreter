    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nThe general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($H_{16} - H_{14} = H_2$). This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The 's' indicates a singlet, meaning a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens). The chemical shift (>100 ppm) is characteristic of an sp² hybridized carbon, such as one involved in a C=C double bond.\n*   **112(t):** The 't' indicates a triplet, meaning a CH₂ group. The chemical shift (>100 ppm) is also characteristic of an sp² hybridized carbon. Specifically, this shift is typical for a terminal methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **48(t):** This is a triplet, indicating another CH₂ group. The shift in the 20-60 ppm range indicates it is an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n*   **27(d):** This is a doublet, indicating a CH group. This is an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n*   **22(q):** This is a quartet, indicating a CH₃ group (methyl group). This is an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n*   **21(q):** This is another quartet, indicating another CH₃ group. This is an sp³ hybridized carbon.\n\nThe presence of sp² carbons at 145 and 112 ppm confirms that the degree of unsaturation is due to a C=C double bond. The signals correspond to a `>C=CH₂` (vinylidene) group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Fragments**\nLet's account for all atoms based on the NMR data. We have 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens to place.\n-   From 145(s): 1 quaternary C atom.\n-   From 112(t): 1 CH₂ group (2 H atoms).\n-   From 48(t): 1 CH₂ group (2 H atoms).\n-   From 27(d): 1 CH group (1 H atom).\n-   From 22(q) and 21(q): We have two signals for methyl groups.\nLet's sum the atoms accounted for so far: C=1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6; H=0+2+2+1+3+3 = 11.\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (C₁H₃), which is exactly a methyl group.\nThis means one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\nSo, the full list of fragments is:\n*   One quaternary sp² carbon (>C=)\n*   One sp² methylene group (=CH₂)\n*   One sp³ methylene group (-CH₂-)\n*   One sp³ methine group (-CH-)\n*   One unique sp³ methyl group (-CH₃)\n*   Two equivalent sp³ methyl groups (2 x -CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\n1.  The two equivalent methyl groups (-CH₃) and the methine group (-CH-) combine to form an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n2.  The remaining sp³ fragments are a methylene (-CH₂-) and a methyl (-CH₃), which combine to form an ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃`.\n3.  The core of the molecule is the `>C=CH₂` group, derived from the sp² carbon signals. The quaternary carbon `>C=` has two available bonds.\n4.  The only way to connect all fragments is to attach both the isopropyl group and the ethyl group to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n```\n       CH(CH₃)₂  (isopropyl group)\n      /\n  H₂C=C\n      \\\n       CH₂CH₃  (ethyl group)\n```\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name this alkene, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes both carbons of the double bond.\n*   **Path 1:** Through the ethyl group, the chain is `CH₃-CH₂-C(=CH₂)-...`. This is a 4-carbon chain (a 1-butene skeleton). The substituent at position 2 is an isopropyl group. This would be named 2-isopropyl-1-butene. This naming path identifies one substituent on the parent chain.\n*   **Path 2:** Through the isopropyl group, the chain is `CH₃-CH(Me)-C(=CH₂)-...`. This is also a 4-carbon chain (a 1-butene skeleton). The substituents are an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 3. This naming path identifies two substituents on the parent chain.\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, when two potential parent chains are of equal length, the one with the greater number of substituents is chosen. Therefore, Path 2 is correct.\n\nThe parent chain is 1-butene. The substituents are an ethyl group on carbon 2 and a methyl group on carbon 3.\nThe correct IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Verification**\nLet's confirm the NMR data is consistent with 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\nStructure: `H₂C(1)=C(2)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)₂`\n*   `C1`: =CH₂, terminal alkene, gives a triplet (t). Corresponds to 112 ppm.\n*   `C2`: =C<, quaternary alkene carbon, gives a singlet (s). Corresponds to 145 ppm.\n*   `Ethyl -CH₂-`: attached to sp² carbon (C2), which is deshielding. Gives a triplet (t). Corresponds to 48 ppm.\n*   `Ethyl -CH₃-`: a standard methyl group, gives a quartet (q). Corresponds to 21 or 22 ppm.\n*   `Isopropyl -CH-` (C3): a methine group, gives a doublet (d). Corresponds to 27 ppm.\n*   `Isopropyl -CH₃`'s: C3 is bonded to two methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. Therefore, these two methyl groups are chemically equivalent and give a single quartet (q) signal representing two carbons. Corresponds to the other methyl signal (21 or 22 ppm).\nThe predicted spectrum (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q for 6 signals) perfectly matches the provided data.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
