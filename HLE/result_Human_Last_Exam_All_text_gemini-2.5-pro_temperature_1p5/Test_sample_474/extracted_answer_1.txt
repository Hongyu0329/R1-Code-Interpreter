No, this approach is not ecologically valid. The primary reason is that the visual system of humans is fundamentally different from that of the primary predators of bumblebees, such as birds. Many birds are tetrachromatic and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Bee color patterns often include UV signals that are a critical part of their warning coloration. By using human undergraduates and standard photographs (which don't capture UV), the study is testing similarity based on an incomplete and incorrect representation of the signal that is ecologically relevant. The resulting clusters would reflect human visual biases, not the perceptual groups that matter for predator learning and the function of the mimicry syndrome.
