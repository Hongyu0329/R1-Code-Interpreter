Here are the specific hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, isoform Î²1b, UniProt P54289-2) for interaction with and modulation of the human alpha-1 subunit.

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic Alpha-binding Pocket (ABP) that directly binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **W323** (Tryptophan at position 323)
*   **Y353** (Tyrosine at position 353)
*   **L374** (Leucine at position 374)
*   **W398** (Tryptophan at position 398)
*   **I409** (Isoleucine at position 409)
*   **L410** (Leucine at position 410)

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located outside the primary binding pocket and allosterically modulate channel function, particularly inactivation kinetics.

*   **Residues in the N-terminus (critical for slowing inactivation):**
    *   **K6** (Lysine at position 6)
    *   **R8** (Arginine at position 8)
*   **Residues on the surface of the GK domain (part of a non-canonical site involved in modulation):**
    *   **D289** (Aspartate at position 289)
    *   **D291** (Aspartate at position 291)
