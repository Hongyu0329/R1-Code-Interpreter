    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"First statute\":** This requires a chronological approach to identify the earliest law.\n    *   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** The search is confined to legislation enacted by the Knesset since the state's establishment in 1948. This includes original laws and \"New Versions\" (*Nusach Chadash*) of pre-state ordinances that were re-enacted by the Knesset in Hebrew.\n    *   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The statute's text must literally contain the Hebrew term for \"good faith,\" which is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). Laws based on related but distinct concepts, such as loyalty (*ne'emanut*), without using the specific term \"good faith,\" do not qualify.\n    *   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\":** This refers to the legal principle of honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\n\n2.  **Survey of Potential Statutes:**\n    Many people associate the principle of \"good faith\" in Israeli law with major pieces of legislation from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Key candidates often considered are:\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** Famous for establishing \"good faith\" as a foundational, \"umbrella\" principle governing all negotiations (Section 12) and performance of contracts (Section 39). However, its 1973 date makes it a later development.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This law explicitly uses \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in critical sections, such as Section 9, which resolves conflicts between competing transactions in land. This predates the Contracts Law but is likely not the first.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on an agent towards the principal. While closely related to good faith, the primary term used is not \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n3.  **Investigating Earlier Legislation (pre-1965):**\n    To find the *first* statute, we must look at legislation from the first two decades of the state. Much of the law in force during this period was inherited from the British Mandate. The Knesset initiated a process of replacing these Mandate Ordinances with Hebrew-language \"New Versions.\" This act of re-enactment makes them statutes of the State of Israel.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Statute:**\n    The search leads to the area of commercial law, specifically negotiable instruments.\n    *   The British Mandate's Bills of Exchange Ordinance was based on the English Bills of Exchange Act of 1882, which prominently featured the concept of a \"holder in due course\" who takes an instrument in \"good faith.\"\n    *   This Mandate-era law was adopted into the legal system of the new state in 1948.\n    *   In **1957**, the Knesset re-enacted this law as the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** (פקודת השטרות [נוסח חדש], תשי\"ז-1957).\n    *   This Israeli statute explicitly uses the Hebrew term \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*) in its text. For example, the definition of a \"holder in due course\" (אוחז כשורה) requires that the person took the bill \"in good faith\" (בתום לב).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Adopted Law vs. Israeli Statute:** While the principle of \"good faith\" existed in the legal system from 1948 via adopted Mandate law, the 1957 \"New Version\" represents the first time the Israeli legislature itself explicitly incorporated the Hebrew term *tom lev* into a statute it passed.\n*   **\"Explicit\" vs. \"Implicit\":** The Agency Law (1965) imposes a duty of \"loyalty,\" which is a core component of the good faith doctrine. However, the question asks for the *explicit* introduction of the term, making the Bills of Exchange Ordinance the correct answer because it uses the literal phrase *tom lev*.\n*   **Chronology:** The 1957 date of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] definitively precedes the other major laws that use the term, such as the Land Law (1969) and the Contracts Law (1973).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly use the Hebrew term for \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) was the re-enacted law governing negotiable instruments.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance"
