    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for the surname of an English poet. This surname appears under specific circumstances:\n*   It is in a Russian translation of an essay.\n*   The essay describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n*   The appearance of the surname is the key clue.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core puzzle**\nThis is a classic trivia question that relies on a linguistic pun or a specific cultural reference rather than a direct search. The fact that it occurs in a *translation* is a major hint. A translator might insert a well-known name that sounds like a word in the original description, creating a clever play on words.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the key phrases**\n*   **\"Wide boulevards\":** In Russian, \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy). The comparative form, \"wider,\" is \"шире\" (shire).\n*   **\"Vienna\":** A city famous for its Ringstrasse, a series of grand, wide boulevards.\n*   **\"English poet\":** We are looking for a famous English poet whose name can be part of the pun.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a hypothesis based on a pun**\nLet's focus on the Russian word for \"wider,\" which is \"шире\" (pronounced *shire*). This sounds very similar to the Russian transliteration of an English poet's name. Which poet?\n*   Percy Bysshe **Shelley**. In Russian, his name is written as **Шелли** (pronounced *Shelli*).\n\nA common Russian phrase to describe something getting progressively wider is \"шире и шире\" (*shire i shire*), meaning \"wider and wider.\" This sounds very close to \"Шелли, и Шелли\" (*Shelli, i Shelli*). This phonetic similarity is the basis of the pun.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the source of the pun**\nThis specific pun is a famous anecdote in Russian literary circles. It is attributed to the poet and translator Vera Inber. As told by the writer Yuri Olesha in his book \"No Day Without a Line\" (\"Ни дня без строчки\"), Inber was translating a text about Vienna. Faced with a phrase describing the boulevards as becoming \"wider and wider\" (\"шире и шире\"), she cleverly translated it with the line \"Здесь бульвары широки, как Шелли\" (\"Here the boulevards are wide as Shelley\"). This phrase not only conveys the meaning of width but also adds a layer of literary wit, as \"широки, как Шелли\" sounds phonetically similar to \"шире и шире\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **The importance of the translation:** The key is not what the original essay said, but how it was creatively rendered into Russian. The surname was likely not in the original text.\n2.  **The linguistic pun:** The solution hinges entirely on recognizing the phonetic similarity between the Russian word \"шире\" (wider) and the name \"Шелли\" (Shelley).\n3.  **The specific cultural reference:** This isn't a random connection; it's a known example of creative translation often cited in Russian literature and translation studies.\n4.  **The request for the English spelling:** The final answer must be the poet's surname in its original English form, not the Russian transliteration.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe English poet whose surname appears in the Russian translation is Percy Bysshe Shelley, due to a pun connecting the Russian word for \"wider\" (шире) with his name (Шелли).\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
