    "An elegant way to solve this problem involves using concepts from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers, specifically duality (polar bodies) and Minkowski's theorem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the condition mathematically\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain in the plane. The set of lines is given by `L = {l_{p,q} : px + qy = 1, \\text{where } p, q \\text{ are coprime integers}}`. The condition is that for every line `l \\in L`, the intersection `D \\cap l` is not empty.\n\n### Step 2: The role of symmetry\n\nThe set of lines `L` is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. If `l_{p,q}: px+qy=1` is in `L`, then so is `l_{-p,-q}: (-p)x+(-q)y=1`, which is the line `px+qy=-1`. Therefore, the domain `D` must intersect both `px+qy=1` and `px+qy=-1` for every coprime pair `(p,q)`.\n\nLet `D` be any convex set satisfying the condition. Consider its difference body, `D_s = \\frac{1}{2}(D - D) = \\{ \\frac{d_1 - d_2}{2} \\mid d_1, d_2 \\in D \\}`.\n*   `D_s` is a centrally symmetric convex set.\n*   By the Rogers-Shephard inequality, `Area(D_s) \\ge Area(D)`.\n*   If `D` satisfies the problem's conditions, so does `D_s`. If `D` intersects `px+qy=1` and `px+qy=-1`, then there exist `d_1, d_2 \\in D` such that `pd_{1x}+qd_{1y}=1` and `pd_{2x}+qd_{2y}=-1` (or vice-versa). Then the point `d_s = (d_1-d_2)/2 \\in D_s` satisfies `pd_{sx}+qd_{sy} = (1 - (-1))/2 = 1`. Thus, `D_s` also intersects all the required lines.\n\nThis implies that if a minimal area exists, it must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain. We can therefore restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains `D` centered at the origin.\n\n### Step 3: Using Support Functions and Polar Bodies\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex domain `D` centered at the origin, the condition that `D` intersects the line `px+qy=1` is equivalent to saying that the maximum value of the linear function `f(x,y) = px+qy` over `D` is at least 1. This maximum value is the value of the support function of `D`, denoted `h_D(p,q)`.\nSo, the condition is `h_D(p,q) \\ge 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\nLet's introduce the polar body `D*` of `D`:\n`D* = \\{ (u,v) \\mid xu + yv \\le 1 \\text{ for all } (x,y) \\in D \\}`.\nA fundamental property relating a set and its polar is `(u,v) \\in D*` if and only if `h_D(u,v) \\le 1`.\n\nOur condition `h_D(p,q) \\ge 1` for all coprime `(p,q)` means that no coprime integer point `(p,q)` can be in the *interior* of `D*`. The set of primitive integer points `Z^2_{prim}` must lie on or outside the boundary of `D*`.\n\n### Step 4: Connecting Area to the Dual Problem (Mahler's and Minkowski's Theorems)\n\nWe want to find the minimum `Area(D)`. Mahler's theorem for centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane states that:\n`Area(D) \\cdot Area(D*) \\ge 8`\nTo minimize `Area(D)`, we need to maximize `Area(D*)`.\n\nSo the problem is transformed into: **What is the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `D*` whose interior contains no coprime integer points?**\n\nLet `S` be the set of coprime integer points `(p,q)`. We need `int(D*) \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\nLet's consider an even larger set, the set of all non-zero integer points, `Z^2 \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}`. If the interior of `D*` contains no non-zero integer points, it certainly contains no coprime integer points.\nMinkowski's first fundamental theorem on the geometry of numbers states that any centrally symmetric convex set `K` with `Area(K) > 4` must contain at least one non-zero integer point in its interior.\nTherefore, for `int(D*)` to contain no non-zero integer points, we must have `Area(D*) \\le 4`.\n\nThis gives an upper bound on the area of `D*`.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Minimum Area\n\nUsing the results from the previous steps:\n`Area(D) \\ge \\frac{8}{Area(D*)}`\nSince `Area(D*) \\le 4`, we have:\n`Area(D) \\ge \\frac{8}{4} = 2`\n\nThis establishes that the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Minimum is Achievable\n\nWe now need to check if an area of 2 can actually be achieved. This occurs if we can find a centrally symmetric convex set `D` such that:\n1.  `Area(D) = 2`.\n2.  `D` intersects every line `px+qy=1` for coprime `p,q`.\n\nThis corresponds to finding a set `D*` where `Area(D*) = 4` and for which the equality `Area(D) \\cdot Area(D*) = 8` holds. Equality in Mahler's theorem holds if and only if `D` (and `D*`) is a parallelogram.\n\nLet's choose `D*` to be the square `[-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]`.\n*   It is a centrally symmetric convex set (a parallelogram).\n*   `Area(D*) = 2 \\times 2 = 4`.\n*   Its interior, `(-1, 1) \\times (-1, 1)`, contains no non-zero integer points, so it satisfies the condition derived from our problem.\n\nThe polar body `D` of this square `D*` is the diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| \\le 1`.\n*   This domain `D` is a parallelogram, so `Area(D) \\cdot Area(D*) = 8` holds.\n*   `Area(D) = 8 / Area(D*) = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n*   We must verify that this domain `D` satisfies the original condition. The support function of `D = \\{ (x,y) : |x|+|y| \\le 1 \\}` is `h_D(p,q) = \\max(|p|, |q|)`. For any coprime integers `p` and `q`, they cannot both be zero. Thus, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1, which means `h_D(p,q) = \\max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1`.\n\nThe condition is satisfied. Since we found a lower bound of 2 for the area and a specific domain that achieves this area, the minimal area is 2."
