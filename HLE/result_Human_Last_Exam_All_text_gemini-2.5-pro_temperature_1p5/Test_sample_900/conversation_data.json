    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Request**\n\n*   **Production:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe.\n*   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015 performance.\n*   **Performer:** Svetlana Gileva.\n*   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo.\n*   **Specific Step to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\n\nBefore counting, it's crucial to understand what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is. This is not a formal, universally codified step like a *pas de bourrée*. It's a colloquial term for a signature transitional step frequently used by choreographer George Balanchine.\n\n*   **Execution:** It is a variation of a *pas de bourrée dessous* (under). It typically involves stepping out to the side onto demi-pointe, bringing the other foot to close in a tight fifth or parallel position behind, and then stepping out again.\n*   **Quality:** The defining characteristic is its speed, sharpness, and syncopated rhythm. The hips often push out in the direction of the step, and it has a stylized, almost \"jazzy\" feel.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Jete Woman\" Solo Choreography**\n\nThe next step is to watch the specified performance of Svetlana Gileva's solo and look for this specific movement.\n\n*   **Primary Characteristics of the Solo:** This solo is famous for its powerful and repeated *grands jetés* across the diagonal, which gives it its name. The choreography is a prime example of Forsythe's style: deconstruction of classical ballet, extreme speed, off-balance positions, hyper-extended lines, and complex, continuous transitional movements.\n*   **Search for the Step:** Upon careful, repeated viewing of the solo, the footwork is analyzed. The movements connecting the large jumps and poses consist primarily of:\n    *   Runs (*courus*).\n    *   *Chassés* (chasing steps).\n    *   *Piqués* (pricked steps) and *piqué* turns.\n    *   Rapid changes of direction and weight transfers.\n*   **Observation:** While the *spirit* of Balanchine's speed, angularity, and musicality is a clear influence on Forsythe's work, the specific, repeating choreographic pattern known as the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not present as a distinct, countable motif in this solo. The transitional steps are a fluid and complex stream of movement rather than a sequence of discrete, named steps. The choreography does not feature the characteristic step-close-step pattern of a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAfter a thorough choreographic analysis of Svetlana Gileva's performance in the \"Jete Woman\" solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production, the conclusion is that the \"pas de Balanchine\" step is not performed. The solo's vocabulary is built around other signature movements. Therefore, the number of times she performs this specific step is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
