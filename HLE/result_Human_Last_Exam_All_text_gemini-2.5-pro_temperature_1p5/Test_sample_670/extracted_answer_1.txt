The program-expression graph for the instance of `a` consists of four nodes and four directed edges representing the data flow:
*   **Nodes:**
    1.  A constant node with the value `1`.
    2.  A `μ` node with `a` as its bound variable (labeled `μ a`).
    3.  A multiplication operator node (`*`).
    4.  A variable node for the loop counter `i`.
*   **Edges:**
    1.  From the constant node `1` to the `μ a` node (representing the initial value).
    2.  From the `μ a` node to the `*` node (representing the current value of `a` used as an operand).
    3.  From the variable node `i` to the `*` node (representing the other operand).
    4.  From the `*` node back to the `μ a` node (representing the feedback of the updated value for the next iteration).
