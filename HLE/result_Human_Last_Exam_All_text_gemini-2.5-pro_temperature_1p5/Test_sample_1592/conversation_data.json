    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec.\n*   Geographically, it is located on the south-eastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n*   Its approximate coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories**\n*   Looking at a map of Canada, the regions bordering this part of Quebec are:\n    *   **Ontario:** To the west and south of Waskaganish. The provincial border runs along the western shore of James Bay and then extends south on land.\n    *   **Nunavut:** To the north. The territory of Nunavut includes the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as Akimiski Island.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east. The border is located far to the east of Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate**\n*   The question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. We need to compare the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point in Ontario, Nunavut, and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n*   **Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario is located to the southwest of Waskaganish. By measuring on a map, the straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish to the closest point on the Ontario land border is relatively short, approximately 60-70 kilometers (about 37-43 miles). The distance directly west across James Bay to the Ontario mainland shoreline is further than this land border distance.\n\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which lies in the middle of James Bay. The distance from Waskaganish to the southeastern tip of Akimiski Island is significantly greater, roughly 200 kilometers (about 124 miles).\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is hundreds of kilometers to the east of Waskaganish, making it the most distant of the three candidates.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n*   Comparing the distances, the border with the province of Ontario is substantially closer to Waskaganish than the border with the territory of Nunavut or the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The shortest distance is to the land border with Ontario to the southwest.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question asks for a \"province or territory,\" so both types of jurisdictions must be considered.\n*   The location is the \"Waskaganish gathering place,\" which is taken to be the community of Waskaganish itself.\n*   The exclusion \"outside of Quebec\" is critical.\n*   The determination relies on comparing the shortest straight-line distance (as the crow flies) from Waskaganish to the border of each neighboring jurisdiction. Both land and water borders (islands belonging to Nunavut) must be evaluated.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the step-by-step analysis is that Ontario is the closest province.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
