To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the UV light should cause the table to contract or bend, mimicking the photoisomerization of the stable *trans*-azobenzene to the bent *cis*-azobenzene. When the sun sets, in the absence of UV light, the table must slowly relax and expand back to its original, more stable shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation of *cis*-azobenzene back to the *trans* form.
