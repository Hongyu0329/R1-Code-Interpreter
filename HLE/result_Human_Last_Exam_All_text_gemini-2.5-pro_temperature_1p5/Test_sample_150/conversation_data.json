    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Variable:** There is a single integer variable, `x`, initialized to 0.\n    *   **Operations:** `++` increments `x` by 1; `--` decrements `x` by 1.\n    *   **Statements:** A statement is a string containing exactly one operator (`++` or `--`) and one variable (`X`). The order can be pre-fix (`++X`, `--X`) or post-fix (`X++`, `X--`). So there are four possible valid statements.\n    *   **Input:** An integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing one of the four possible statements.\n    *   **Output:** The final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Submitted Java Program:**\n    *   The program initializes a result variable `tresult` to 0, correctly representing `x`.\n    *   It reads the number of statements `t` and loops `t` times.\n    *   Inside the loop, it reads each statement as a string `test`.\n    *   The core logic is:\n        ```java\n        if (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n        {\n            tresult++;\n        }\n        if (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n        {\n            tresult--;\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Flaw Identification:** This logic is incorrect because it only checks for pre-increment (`++X`) and pre-decrement (`--X`). It completely ignores the post-increment (`X++`) and post-decrement (`X--`) cases. For example, if the input is `X++`, neither `if` condition will be true, and `tresult` will not be updated. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly.\n\n3.  **Propose an Efficient C Solution:**\n    To solve the problem correctly and efficiently, we need a C program that handles all four cases. The key to efficiency is to find the simplest way to distinguish an increment operation from a decrement operation.\n    *   Increment statements: `++X`, `X++`. Both contain the `+` character.\n    *   Decrement statements: `--X`, `X--`. Both contain the `-` character.\n    *   We can read each 3-character statement into a character array (e.g., `char s[4];`).\n    *   Let's examine the character at index 1:\n        *   `++X`: `s[1]` is `+`.\n        *   `X++`: `s[1]` is `+`.\n        *   `--X`: `s[1]` is `-`.\n        *   `X--`: `s[1]` is `-`.\n    *   Brilliantly, the character at index 1 is *always* `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. Therefore, we can determine the operation with a single character comparison.\n\n    An efficient C implementation would look like this:\n    ```c\n    #include <stdio.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n        int x = 0;\n        char statement[4];\n        while (n--) {\n            scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n            if (statement[1] == '+') {\n                x++;\n            } else {\n                x--;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\n4.  **Analyze the Efficiency of the Proposed C Solution (for n=100):**\n    *   **Fastest (Smallest number of character comparisons):** The question asks for the number of character comparisons in the logic, not counting the `scanf` function's internal workings.\n        *   The core logic is `if (statement[1] == '+')`. This is exactly one character comparison per statement.\n        *   For 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n        *   This is the minimum possible, as each statement must be inspected at least once.\n        *   So, `x = 100`.\n\n    *   **Least Memory (Smallest memory size in Bytes):** We need to calculate the memory used by the variables in the `main` function's scope. We assume a common architecture where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n        *   `int n;`: To hold the number of statements and act as a loop counter. Size: 4 Bytes.\n        *   `int x;`: To store the final result. Size: 4 Bytes.\n        *   `char statement[4];`: A buffer to read the 3-character string plus the null terminator (`\\0`) added by `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` Size: 4 Bytes.\n        *   Total memory usage (`y`) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 Bytes.\n        *   While a solution using `getchar()` could theoretically reduce memory by 2 bytes (by not needing a 4-byte buffer), it would require more character comparisons to be logically sound, making it slower. The provided solution is the fastest, and its 12-byte memory footprint is minimal for such a clean and fast approach.\n        *   So, `y = 12`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The original program is incorrect. The answer starts with `N`.\n    *   The smallest number of character comparisons (`x`) for 100 inputs is 100.\n    *   The smallest memory size (`y`) in bytes for the most efficient (fastest) solution is 12.\n    *   The final answer format is `Nx+y`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nN100+12\n<<<N100+12>>>"
