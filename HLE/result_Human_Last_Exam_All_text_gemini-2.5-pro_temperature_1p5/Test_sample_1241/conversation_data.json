    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. This refers to the sum of the steady-state (or limiting) probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:** In the steady state, as time $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ no longer change. This means their derivatives with respect to time are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. By setting the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i$.\n\n3.  **The System of Equations:**\n    Replacing $P_i'(t)$ with 0 and $P_i(t)$ with $P_i$ gives:\n    (1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n    (2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n    (3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n    (4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n\n4.  **The Normalization Condition:** The sum of all probabilities must always be equal to 1. This gives us an additional, crucial equation:\n    (5) $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n5.  **Strategy for Solving:** The system of equations (1)-(4) is linearly dependent (summing them gives $0=0$). We can solve for the probabilities by using three of these equations along with the normalization equation (5). A common strategy is to express three of the probabilities in terms of the fourth one and then use the normalization equation to find the value of that fourth probability.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Steady-State Assumption:** The core of the solution lies in correctly applying the steady-state condition, $P_i'(t)=0$.\n*   **System of Equations:** Be careful when transcribing the equations and substituting the values of $\\lambda_{ij}$.\n*   **Redundancy:** Recognize that one of the balance equations is redundant and must be replaced by the normalization condition to get a unique solution.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** To avoid rounding errors, it's best to carry expressions algebraically as long as possible before performing the final numerical calculation.\n\n---\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Substitute the given numerical values into the steady-state equations.**\nThe given rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe system becomes:\n(1) $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n(3) $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n(4) $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n(5) $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Solve for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.**\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\nCombining these, we get a simple relationship: $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization equation to find the value of $P_1$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$ into equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\nTo simplify the coefficient, find a common denominator:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) P_1 = 1$\nSo, $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required sum $P_0 + P_1$.**\nFirst, we find an expression for $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\nNow, we can compute the sum:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final numerical value.**\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
