    "An analysis of the question step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nWe are given two sets, `A` and `B`, with the following properties:\n1.  `A` and `B` are subsets of the plane, `R^2`.\n2.  `A` is closed. `B` is closed.\n3.  `A` is connected. `B` is connected.\n4.  Their union is the square: `A U B = S`.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: A Naive Argument Using Algebraic Topology\n\nA common tool for problems involving unions and intersections of spaces is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Let's try to apply it. This sequence relates the homology groups of `A`, `B`, `A U B`, and `A ∩ B`. For this problem, we are interested in the number of connected components, which is related to the 0-th homology group, `H_0`. For a space `X`, the rank of the (reduced) 0-th Cech homology group `\\tilde{H}_0(X)` is `k-1`, where `k` is the number of connected components of `X`.\n\nThe relevant part of the Cech homology Mayer-Vietoris sequence is:\n`... -> \\tilde{H}_1(A U B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A) ⊕ \\tilde{H}_0(B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A U B) -> ...`\n\nLet's analyze each term based on the problem's conditions:\n*   `A U B = S` (the unit square). The square is contractible, so all its reduced homology groups are zero. Thus, `\\tilde{H}_1(S) = 0` and `\\tilde{H}_0(S) = 0`.\n*   `A` is connected. This means `k(A) = 1`, so `\\tilde{H}_0(A) = 0`.\n*   `B` is connected. This means `k(B) = 1`, so `\\tilde{H}_0(B) = 0`.\n*   Let `n` be the number of connected components of `A ∩ B`. We want to maximize `n`. The rank of `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B)` is `n-1`.\n\nSubstituting these into the sequence, we get:\n`... -> 0 -> \\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> 0 ⊕ 0 -> 0 -> ...`\n\nFor this sequence to be exact at the `\\tilde{H}_0(A) ⊕ \\tilde{H}_0(B)` term, the kernel of the map `\\tilde{H}_0(A) ⊕ \\tilde{H}_0(B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A U B)` must be equal to the image of the map `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A) ⊕ \\tilde{H}_0(B)`. Since the domain and codomain of the first map are both 0, the map is the zero map, its kernel is 0, and its image is 0.\n\nThis implies that the image of the map `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> 0 ⊕ 0` is 0. This is always true.\n\nFor exactness at the `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B)` term, the kernel of the map `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A) ⊕ \\tilde{H}_0(B)` must equal the image of the map `\\tilde{H}_1(A U B) -> \\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B)`.\n*   The map `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) -> 0` has its kernel being the entire group `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B)`.\n*   The image of the map `0 -> \\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B)` is the zero element.\n\nFor the sequence to be exact, we must have `\\tilde{H}_0(A ∩ B) = 0`. This means the rank is 0, so `n-1 = 0`, which implies `n=1`.\n\nThis powerful argument seems to suggest the answer is always 1.\n\n### Step 3: The Flaw in the Naive Argument\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence is not universally applicable to any pair of subsets. The version of the theorem most commonly taught in introductory algebraic topology requires an \"excision\" property, which is typically satisfied if the interiors of the sets `A` and `B` cover the space. That is, `Int(A) U Int(B) = A U B`.\n\nThis condition is not guaranteed by the problem statement and is often violated. For example:\n*   Let `A` be the left half of the square, `[0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`.\n*   Let `B` be the right half of the square, `[1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n*   `A` and `B` satisfy all the conditions. `A ∩ B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`, which has 1 component.\n*   However, `Int(A) = (0, 1/2) x (0, 1)` and `Int(B) = (1/2, 1) x (0, 1)`.\n*   `Int(A) U Int(B)` is the square *minus* the central line. This is not the whole square.\n\nBecause this crucial condition is not met, the conclusion from the naive argument is not necessarily valid. While there are more general versions of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence that hold for any pair of closed sets (like the one for Cech homology), their application and the nature of the connecting homomorphism can be very subtle for sets that are not \"nice\" (e.g., sets that are not locally connected or are otherwise \"pathological\"). The failure of the simple argument opens the possibility for a different answer.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing Counterexamples\n\nIt turns out that it is possible to construct sets `A` and `B` that satisfy the conditions and produce an intersection with any desired number of components.\nLet's sketch the idea for `n=2` components.\n1.  Let the desired intersection be two disjoint line segments, `C_1 = {1/3} x [1/3, 2/3]` and `C_2 = {2/3} x [1/3, 2/3]`.\n2.  Form a connected set `A_0` by joining `C_1` and `C_2` with a path in the upper part of the square (e.g., an inverted U-shape).\n3.  Form a connected set `B_0` by joining `C_1` and `C_2` with a path in the lower part of the square (e.g., a U-shape).\n4.  The set `K = A_0 U B_0` forms two loops. The complement of `K` within the square, `S \\ K`, consists of three connected regions (inside the top loop, inside the bottom loop, and the rest).\n5.  Now, the rest of the square, `S \\ (C_1 U C_2)`, must be partitioned between `A` and `B` in such a way that `A` and `B` remain connected, their union covers the square, and their intersection does not grow beyond `C_1 U C_2`. This is the difficult part. It can be done using so-called \"Wada-like\" constructions, where two sets `A` and `B` are built to share a complicated, disconnected boundary.\n\nThe full construction for an arbitrary integer `n` is quite technical and involves creating \"indecomposable continua\". However, the established result in topology is that for any integer `n ≥ 1`, one can construct sets `A` and `B` meeting the criteria such that `A ∩ B` has `n` connected components. It is even possible to construct an example where the intersection has infinitely many components.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince we can construct examples where the intersection has `n` components for *any* positive integer `n`, there is no upper bound on the number of components. The set of possible numbers of components is `{1, 2, 3, ...}`. This set does not have a largest element.\n\nTherefore, there is no largest number of components.\n\nThere is no largest number. If we must provide a numerical answer representing an unbounded quantity, it would be infinity.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
