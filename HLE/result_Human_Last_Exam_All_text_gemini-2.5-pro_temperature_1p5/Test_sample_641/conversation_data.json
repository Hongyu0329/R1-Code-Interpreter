    "An involution in a group G is a non-identity element `g` such that `g^2` is the identity element. We are looking for the number of such elements in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the group PSU(4, 997)**\nThe group in question is PSU(n, q), which is more standardly written as PSU(n, q^2). Here, n=4 and q=997. The group is defined over the finite field `GF(997^2)`.\n`PSU(4, 997^2) = SU(4, 997^2) / Z(SU(4, 997^2))`, where `SU(4, 997^2)` is the special unitary group and `Z` is its center.\n\n*   `SU(n, q^2)` is the group of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in `GF(q^2)` such that `A^σT * A = I` (unitary condition, where `σ` is the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`) and `det(A) = 1`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q^2))` is the center, which consists of scalar matrices `λI` that are also in `SU(n, q^2)`. This requires `λ^n=1` and `λ^(q+1)=1`. The order of the center is `gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center is `|Z| = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499` (and 499 is prime), `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe elements `λ` in `GF(997^2)` satisfying `λ^2=1` are `1` and `-1`. These also satisfy `λ^4=1` and `λ^998=1`. So, the center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**Step 2: Relating involutions in PSU to elements in SU**\nAn element `g = A*Z` in PSU is an involution if `g^2 = Z` (the identity in PSU) and `g ≠ Z`.\nThis means `(A*Z)^2 = A^2*Z = Z`, which implies `A^2` must be in the center `Z`.\nAlso, `A*Z ≠ Z` means `A` is not in the center.\nSo, we need to count the number of elements `A` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `A^2 ∈ {I, -I}` and `A ∉ {I, -I}`. Let this set of pre-images be `S`.\n\nEach involution in PSU corresponds to `|Z| = 2` distinct elements in `S`. Therefore, the number of involutions in PSU is `|S| / 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Counting the pre-images `S`**\nThe set `S` is the disjoint union of two sets:\n1.  `S₁ = {A ∈ SU | A² = I, A ≠ I, A ≠ -I}`\n2.  `S₂ = {A ∈ SU | A² = -I}` (If `A² = -I`, `A` cannot be `I` or `-I`, so no elements need to be excluded).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating |S₁|**\nWe first count all `A ∈ SU` such that `A²=I`. These are involutions in `SU` plus the identity matrix.\nSuch matrices are diagonalizable with eigenvalues `1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the number of eigenvalues equal to `-1`. Since `A` is in `SU(4, q^2)`, `det(A) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be an even integer. For `n=4`, `k` can be `0, 2, 4`.\n*   `k=0`: `A` is the identity matrix `I`. There is 1 such element.\n*   `k=4`: `A` is the matrix `-I`. There is 1 such element.\n*   `k=2`: `A` has two eigenvalues of 1 and two of -1. These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q^2)`. The size of this class is given by `|SU(4, q^2)| / |C_{SU}(A)|`, where `C_{SU}(A)` is the centralizer. This size is known to be `q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\nThe total number of matrices with `A²=I` is `1 + 1 + q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n`|S₁|` is this number minus the two matrices `I` and `-I`.\nSo, `|S₁| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating |S₂|**\nWe need to count `A ∈ SU` such that `A² = -I`.\nThe eigenvalues of `A` must be `i` or `-i`, where `i²=-1`.\nWe are working with `q=997`. Since `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, `-1` is a quadratic residue modulo 997, which means `i` and `-i` exist in the base field `GF(997)`.\nFor a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy `μ^(q+1)=1`. However, for `μ=i ∈ GF(q)`, `μ^(q+1) = i^(q+1) = i^q * i = i * i = -1`. This means the standard eigenspaces are totally isotropic (null) subspaces.\nFor `n=4`, this is only possible if the space splits into a direct sum of two 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces, which are the eigenspaces for `i` and `-i`. This means `A` must have two eigenvalues `i` and two eigenvalues `-i`.\n`det(A) = i² * (-i)² = 1`, so this is compatible with `SU`.\nThese elements form a single conjugacy class. The size of this class is `q^4(q+1)²(q² - q + 1)`.\nSo, `|S₂| = q^4(q+1)²(q² - q + 1)`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of pre-images is `|S| = |S₁| + |S₂|`.\n`|S| = q^4(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1) + q^4(q+1)²(q² - q + 1)`\nFactor out the common term `q^4(q² - q + 1)`:\n`|S| = q^4(q² - q + 1) * [(q² + 1) + (q+1)²]`\n`|S| = q^4(q² - q + 1) * [q² + 1 + q² + 2q + 1]`\n`|S| = q^4(q² - q + 1) * [2q² + 2q + 2]`\n`|S| = 2 * q^4(q² - q + 1)(q² + q + 1)`\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is `|S| / |Z| = |S| / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `q^4(q² - q + 1)(q² + q + 1)`.\nThis simplifies to `q^4(q^4 + q² + 1)`.\n\nNow, we substitute `q = 997`:\nNumber = `997^4 * (997^4 + 997² + 1)`\n*   `q² = 997² = 994,009`\n*   `q^4 = (994,009)² = 988,053,898,081`\n*   `q^4 + q² + 1 = 988,053,898,081 + 994,009 + 1 = 988,054,892,091`\n*   Number = `988,053,898,081 * 988,054,892,091`\n*   Number = `976,230,691,233,069,357,469,771`\n\n<<<976230691233069357469771>>>"
