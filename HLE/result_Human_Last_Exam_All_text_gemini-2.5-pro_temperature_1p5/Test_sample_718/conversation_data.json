    "Answering this question requires understanding concepts from category theory, homological algebra, and the representation theory of posets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the terminology**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\le)$ is an upper semilattice if for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their least upper bound (or join), denoted $j_1 \\vee j_2$, exists in $J$. We can view any poset as a small category where the objects are the elements of the poset, and there is a unique morphism from $j_1$ to $j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$.\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$ over the field $K$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$, and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects composition (i.e., if $j_1 \\le j_2 \\le j_3$, then the map for $j_1 \\to j_3$ is the composition of the maps for $j_1 \\to j_2$ and $j_2 \\to j_3$). The collection of all such functors forms an abelian category, often denoted $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ or $[J, \\text{Vect}_K]$.\n*   **n-resolvable:** An object $M$ in an abelian category is called **n-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $M$, denoted $\\text{pd}(M)$, is less than or equal to $n$. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that *any* tame functor $f$ is $n$-resolvable.\n*   **Tame Functor:** In the representation theory of algebras and posets, representations (functors) are classified into three types: finite, tame, and wild. A tame representation type means that, for any dimension $d$, the indecomposable representations of dimension $d$ can be classified and fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. This is a property of the functor $f$, but as we will see, a stronger property of the category $J$ is more important here.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the concepts using homological algebra**\n\nThe question is about the projective dimension of a specific type of functor (tame) in the category $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$. The homological properties of this functor category are determined by the combinatorial structure of the poset $J$. We need to find the global dimension of the category $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ when $J$ is an upper semilattice. The global dimension, $\\text{gl.dim}(\\mathcal{C})$, of a category $\\mathcal{C}$ is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n**Step 3: State the key theorem**\n\nThere is a fundamental result in the representation theory of posets that connects the structure of a finite poset $J$ to the global dimension of the category of its representations $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$.\n\n**Theorem:** For a finite poset $J$, the category of functors $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ has global dimension at most 1 (i.e., it is a **hereditary category**) if and only if $J$ does not contain a subposet isomorphic to the \"crown\" $(1<3, 1<4, 2<3, 2<4)$ or to a disjoint union of a one-point poset and a two-point chain.\n\nAn **upper semilattice** structure on $J$ imposes strong constraints. If we have elements $1, 2, 3, 4$ with relations $1<3$ and $2<3$, the existence of a join implies $1 \\vee 2 \\le 3$. This structure inherently prevents the formation of crowns and other forbidden subposets that would raise the global dimension. A more direct and well-established result is:\n\n**Key Result:** If $J$ is a finite upper semilattice, then the incidence algebra of $J$ over $K$ is a quasi-hereditary algebra, and the category $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ is a **hereditary category**.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the consequence of the key result**\n\nA category being hereditary means its global dimension is less than or equal to 1.\n$$ \\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Rep}_K(J)) \\le 1 $$\nBy definition, the global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category. Therefore, for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ (where $J$ is an upper semilattice), its projective dimension must satisfy:\n$$ \\text{pd}(f) \\le 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion**\n\n*   If $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$, this means that for any such functor $f$, there exists a projective resolution of length at most 1. That is, there is an exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where $P_1$ and $P_0$ are projective functors.\n*   This is precisely the definition of $f$ being **1-resolvable**.\n*   The condition that the functor is \"tame\" is actually a red herring. The property that $J$ is an upper semilattice is so strong that it guarantees *every* functor in $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ is 1-resolvable, regardless of whether it is simple, indecomposable, projective, tame, or wild (though wild functors cannot exist in this category type).\n*   Can $n=0$? A functor is 0-resolvable if it is itself projective. Not all functors on an upper semilattice are projective (for instance, simple functors are generally not projective). Therefore, $n=0$ is not a valid answer for *all* tame functors.\n*   Thus, the smallest integer $n$ for which any such functor is $n$-resolvable is $n=1$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **n-resolvable means `pd(f) <= n`:** Correctly interpret the homological algebra terminology.\n2.  **Focus on the Category's Properties:** The key is to analyze the properties of the entire functor category $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$, which are dictated by the structure of $J$.\n3.  **Upper Semilattice implies Hereditary:** The central fact is that $J$ being an upper semilattice makes the category $\\text{Rep}_K(J)$ hereditary.\n4.  **Hereditary implies `gl.dim <= 1`:** This is the definition of a hereditary abelian category.\n5.  **`gl.dim <= 1` implies `pd(f) <= 1` for all `f`:** The global dimension bounds the projective dimension of every object in the category.\n6.  **\"Tame\" is a Distractor:** The result holds for all functors, so the \"tame\" condition is extraneous. The framework is consistent, as posets whose representation categories are hereditary are known to be of finite or tame representation type.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, since any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is an upper semilattice has a projective dimension of at most 1, it is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
