    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure that can be used to color the figure eight knot. This is a question from knot theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding Knot Coloring:**\n    The coloring of a knot is a method used to create a knot invariant. The most common type is Fox n-coloring. A knot diagram is composed of arcs and crossings.\n    *   **Arcs:** The continuous segments of the knot between crossings.\n    *   **Colors:** We assign an integer from a set of `n` colors, typically `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`, to each arc.\n    *   **Coloring Rule:** At each crossing, there is one over-arc and two under-arcs. If the color of the over-arc is `a` and the colors of the two under-arcs are `b` and `c`, the following rule must be satisfied: `2a ≡ b + c (mod n)`.\n    *   **Nontrivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"nontrivial\" if it uses at least two different colors. The question implies we are looking for the smallest `n > 1` that allows for a nontrivial coloring.\n\n2.  **The Algebraic Structure:**\n    The set of `n` colors, combined with the operation defined by the coloring rule, forms an algebraic structure known as a **dihedral quandle**, denoted `R_n`. The question asks for the minimum number of elements (colors) in such a structure that can nontrivially color the figure eight knot.\n\n3.  **The Figure Eight Knot (Knot 4₁):**\n    We need to analyze the specific structure of the figure eight knot. It has 4 arcs and 4 crossings. Let's label the colors of the four arcs as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\n    A standard diagram of the figure eight knot gives the following relationships at the four crossings:\n    *   Crossing 1: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₂ (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 2: `2x₁ ≡ x₂ + x₃ (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 3: `2x₂ ≡ x₃ + x₄ (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 4: `2x₃ ≡ x₄ + x₁ (mod n)`\n\n4.  **Solving for `n` using the Knot Determinant:**\n    This system of homogeneous linear congruences always has the trivial solution where all `xᵢ` are equal. A nontrivial solution exists if and only if the determinant of a specific matrix is not coprime to `n`. This value is a knot invariant known as the **determinant of the knot**.\n\n    First, we write the system of equations in matrix form, `A * x = 0 (mod n)`:\n    *   `-x₁ - x₂ + 2x₄ ≡ 0`\n    *   `2x₁ - x₂ - x₃ ≡ 0`\n    *   `2x₂ - x₃ - x₄ ≡ 0`\n    *   `-x₁ + 2x₃ - x₄ ≡ 0`\n\n    The coefficient matrix `A` is:\n    ```\n    [-1  -1   0   2]\n    [ 2  -1  -1   0]\n    [ 0   2  -1  -1]\n    [-1   0   2  -1]\n    ```\n    The determinant of this `A` matrix for any knot is always 0. The knot determinant, `det(K)`, is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of any `(m-1) x (m-1)` submatrix of `A` (where `m` is the number of arcs).\n\n    Let's compute the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the last row and last column:\n    ```\n    M' = [-1  -1   0]\n         [ 2  -1  -1]\n         [ 0   2  -1]\n    ```\n    `det(M') = -1 * ((-1)(-1) - (-1)(2)) - (-1) * ((2)(-1) - (-1)(0)) + 0`\n    `det(M') = -1 * (1 + 2) + 1 * (-2)`\n    `det(M') = -1 * 3 - 2 = -5`\n\n    The determinant of the figure eight knot is `det(4₁) = |-5| = 5`.\n\n5.  **Finding the Smallest Number of Colors:**\n    A knot `K` is nontrivially n-colorable if and only if `n` and `det(K)` have a common prime factor. We want to find the smallest integer `n > 1` that allows for coloring. This will be the smallest prime factor of the knot's determinant.\n\n    *   `det(4₁) = 5`.\n    *   The prime factors of 5 are just 5.\n    *   The smallest prime factor is 5.\n\n    Therefore, the smallest `n` for which the figure eight knot is n-colorable is `n=5`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe smallest algebraic structure that allows for a nontrivial coloring of the figure eight knot is the dihedral quandle `R_5`. This structure has 5 elements (the colors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4})."
