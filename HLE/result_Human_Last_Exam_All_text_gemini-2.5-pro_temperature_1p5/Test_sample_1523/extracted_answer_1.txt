The inner product $(\phi, D\phi)$ is the functional $2S_E[\phi] = \int d^4x \, \phi(x)(-\partial^2+m^2)\phi(x)$. Its expectation value in the functional integral is the total number of degrees of freedom of the system, $N_{dof}$. This is a divergent quantity in the continuum limit, formally given by the sum over all modes: $N_{dof} = T\sum_{n}\int \frac{Vd^3p}{(2\pi)^3}$, where $V$ is the spatial volume and the sum is over all Matsubara frequencies.
