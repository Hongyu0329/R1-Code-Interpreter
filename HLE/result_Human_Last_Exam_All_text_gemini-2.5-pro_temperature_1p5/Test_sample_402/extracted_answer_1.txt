The strategy is to filter the differential expression results file to remove all genes that exhibit a log2 fold change more negative than a stringent, pre-defined threshold. A recommended starting threshold is -4, which corresponds to a 16-fold higher expression in the contaminated `CAR_only` group. This can be implemented on the command line using a tool like `awk` to parse the results file and retain only the genes where the log2 fold change is greater than -4, thereby removing the strong signal from the contaminating cancer genes.
