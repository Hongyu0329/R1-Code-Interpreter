    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Context:** HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) are being measured.\n    *   **Method:** The measurement is done by \"capturing beat-to-beat intervals\" using PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n    *   **Core Inquiry:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute HRV.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Heartbeat:** A single contraction of the heart.\n    *   **Beat-to-beat interval:** The time duration between two consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is not the interval itself, but the statistical measure of the *variation* in these intervals over time. A high HRV generally indicates a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** A technology that uses light to measure changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue. This detects the pulse wave, which is a result of the heartbeat.\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiography):** The \"gold standard\" method which measures the electrical activity of the heart. It produces a waveform with distinct peaks (P, Q, R, S, T).\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinction between the interval and the variability:** The question asks for the name of the interval itself, *not* the measure of variability (which is HRV).\n*   **Terminology based on technology (ECG vs. PPG):** The name for the interval can differ based on the measurement source.\n    *   With an **ECG**, the most distinct point of a heartbeat's electrical signal is the \"R-peak\". Therefore, the time between consecutive R-peaks is called the **R-R Interval (RRI)**. This is the most common and standard term in clinical and research settings.\n    *   With **PPG**, the signal reflects the blood pulse wave. The time between consecutive pulse peaks is technically called the **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n*   **Common Usage:** Although PPG measures PPI, it is used as a proxy for the gold-standard ECG measurement. For this reason, in the context of HRV analysis, the term **R-R Interval (RRI)** is very frequently used to refer to the beat-to-beat intervals, even if they were collected via PPG. Another common and more general term is **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**, which encompasses both RRI and PPI.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question describes the fundamental unit of data used to calculate HRV: the time between two heartbeats.\n2.  In the context of physiology and cardiology, the most widely recognized and standard term for this interval is the **R-R Interval**, derived from the R-peaks of an ECG waveform.\n3.  Even though the data is collected via PPG (which technically measures PPI), the term R-R Interval is often used interchangeably as it represents the same underlying physiological event: the time between cardiac cycles.\n4.  Therefore, the value between heartbeats that is used to compute HRV is most commonly and formally called the R-R Interval.\n\n<<<R-R Interval>>>"
