    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Molecule:** A 100 amino acid (aa) peptide. In terms of synthesis, a 100-mer is considered a long peptide or a small protein.\n    *   **Key Feature 1:** Its length (100 aa).\n    *   **Key Feature 2:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (X).\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time on a solid resin support. The process is automated and cycles through deprotection and coupling steps.\n        *   **Pros:** Excellent for incorporating UAAs. To add azido phenylalanine, one simply needs to use the corresponding protected building block (e.g., Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine-OH) in the appropriate cycle of the synthesis.\n        *   **Cons:** The efficiency of each cycle (coupling and deprotection) is not 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, there are approximately 199 chemical steps (99 couplings and 100 deprotections). Even with a very high efficiency of 99% per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.99)^199, which is approximately 13.5%. In practice, side reactions and incomplete couplings accumulate, making the final purification of the desired 100-mer from a complex mixture of shorter, deleted sequences nearly impossible. The practical limit for high-purity SPPS is typically considered to be around 50-60 amino acids. Therefore, direct SPPS for a 100-mer is not feasible.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Recombinant DNA Technology (in vivo expression)**\n        *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (like *E. coli*). The cell's machinery then transcribes and translates the gene to produce the peptide.\n        *   **Pros:** Can produce very large proteins in high quantities.\n        *   **Cons:** The standard genetic code only encodes for 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate azido phenylalanine, a highly complex method called \"amber stop codon suppression\" is required. This involves engineering an orthogonal tRNA-synthetase/tRNA pair that specifically recognizes the UAA and inserts it at a stop codon (e.g., UAG) in the mRNA. This is a sophisticated and technically demanding process, usually reserved for specialized research labs and is not a straightforward method for a one-off synthesis.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **How it works:** This is a powerful \"divide and conquer\" strategy.\n            1.  The target 100 aa peptide is conceptually broken down into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50 aa fragments).\n            2.  Each of these smaller fragments is synthesized efficiently using SPPS. The unnatural amino acid (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into its respective fragment during this SPPS step.\n            3.  For ligation, one peptide fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the adjoining fragment is synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine. The sequence provided conveniently contains a Cysteine (`C`), making it a potential ligation site.\n            4.  The purified fragments are then mixed in solution, where they selectively react (ligate) at the thioester-cysteine junction to form a native peptide bond, yielding the full-length 100 aa product.\n        *   **Pros:** It directly overcomes the length limitation of SPPS. By synthesizing smaller, high-purity fragments, the final ligation step produces the full-length 100-mer in much higher yield and purity than a single direct SPPS attempt. It fully retains the flexibility of SPPS for incorporating UAAs.\n        *   **Cons:** Requires a cysteine residue at the ligation site (though modern variations offer more flexibility). The synthesis is more complex than a single SPPS run, as it involves multiple fragment syntheses, purifications, and a final ligation step.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   Direct SPPS fails due to the length of the peptide.\n    *   Recombinant expression is overly complex due to the UAA.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the ideal choice. It leverages the power of SPPS for incorporating the UAA into manageable fragments and then joins them to create the long, final peptide. This is the state-of-the-art technique for chemically synthesizing proteins in the ~50 to ~300 aa range, especially those containing unnatural modifications.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Peptide Length:** 100 aa is the primary factor that makes direct SPPS impractical and points towards a fragment-based approach.\n*   **Unnatural Amino Acid:** The presence of a UAA makes chemical synthesis (SPPS, NCL) far more straightforward than biological synthesis (recombinant expression). The specific UAA, azido phenylalanine, is well-established and its protected building blocks for SPPS are commercially available.\n*   **Ligation Site:** The feasibility of NCL depends on the presence of a suitable ligation site. The classic NCL method requires a Cysteine. The partial sequence provided, `M...[KAVCLXVIGATR[...]A`, contains a Cysteine (`C`) right next to the UAA (`X`), making it an excellent candidate for a ligation junction. One could synthesize the `M...KAVC`-thioester fragment and the `X...A` fragment (with X as the N-terminal residue, post-ligation) and join them.\n*   **Combination of Techniques:** It's critical to understand that NCL is not a standalone synthesis method; it is a strategy that relies on SPPS to generate the necessary fragments.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the most helpful technique is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL), which uses Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) to create smaller fragments that are then joined together.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
