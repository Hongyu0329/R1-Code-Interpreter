A threshold signature scheme based on the BLS signature scheme can be designed to be tightly secure with a two-round signing protocol.

**Prerequisites:** A robust t-out-of-n Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol (like Pedersen VSS) must be run once to establish a group public key `PK`, and provide each of the `n` parties with a secret share `sk_i` and a public verification key `PK_i`.

**Signing Protocol (for a set `S` of `t` signers and message `m`):**

*   **Round 1: Commitment**
    1.  Each participating party `i ∈ S` computes its partial signature `σ_i = H(PK, m, S)^sk_i`. The hash function `H` must include the public key `PK`, message `m`, and signer set `S` for domain separation.
    2.  Each party `i` generates a random nonce `r_i` and computes a commitment `C_i = Hash(i, σ_i, r_i)`.
    3.  Each party `i` broadcasts its commitment `C_i` to all other participants.

*   **Round 2: Reveal and Aggregation**
    1.  Upon receiving all `t` commitments, each party `i` broadcasts its partial signature `σ_i` and nonce `r_i`.
    2.  Each party verifies the received partial signatures by checking `C_j == Hash(j, σ_j, r_j)` for all other participants `j ∈ S`. If any check fails, the protocol aborts.
    3.  If all partial signatures are valid, each party combines them using Lagrange interpolation in the exponent to compute the final signature: `σ = Π_{j∈S} (σ_j)^{L_j}`, where `L_j` are the Lagrange coefficients for the set `S`.

This design achieves tight security, provably reducible to the Co-CDH assumption, because the commitment round forces any adversary to commit to its attack before observing honest parties' contributions. This prevents adaptive strategies within a single signing execution, which is a common source of non-tightness in security proofs.
