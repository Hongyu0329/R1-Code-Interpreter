    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we must perform a careful, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Define \"Triple Crown\" in Baseball\nThe first careful point is to recognize that the term \"Triple Crown\" can refer to two different achievements in baseball: one for batters and one for pitchers. A comprehensive answer must account for both.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player leads their respective league (American League or National League) in batting average (AVG), home runs (HR), and runs batted in (RBI) in the same season. This is the more famous and rarer of the two.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A player leads their respective league in wins (W), earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts (SO) in the same season.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe need to count the number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Some players have won the award more than once (e.g., Rogers Hornsby, Ted Williams). The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., people), so each player should only be counted once.\n*   **List of Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n    3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    4.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    5.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    6.  Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    7.  Rogers Hornsby (won in 1922 & 1925)\n    8.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    9.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    10. Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    11. Joe Medwick (1937)\n    12. Ted Williams (won in 1942 & 1947)\n    13. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    14. Frank Robinson (1966)\n    15. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    16. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   **Count:** There are **16** unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown. In total, the batting Triple Crown has been achieved 18 times.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we count the number of unique pitchers who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Similar to the batting award, many pitchers have won the pitching Triple Crown multiple times (e.g., Sandy Koufax, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson). We must count each player only once.\n*   **Careful Point:** Shane Bieber's 2020 Triple Crown was won in a pandemic-shortened 60-game season, but it is officially recognized by MLB.\n*   **Count of Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** A historical review shows there are **26** unique pitchers who have accomplished this feat. The award has been won 39 times in total by these 26 pitchers.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Triple Crown Winners\nTo find the total number of winners, we need to sum the unique winners from both categories.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify if any player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists confirms that no player in MLB history has achieved this. Therefore, the two groups of winners are mutually exclusive.\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Unique Batting Winners: 16\n    *   Unique Pitching Winners: 26\n    *   Total Unique Winners = 16 + 26 = 42\n\nSo, there are 42 different players in MLB history who have won either a batting or a pitching Triple Crown.\n\n<<<42>>>"
