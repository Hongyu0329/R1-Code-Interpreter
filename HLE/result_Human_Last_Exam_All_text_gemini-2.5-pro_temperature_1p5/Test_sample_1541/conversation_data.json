    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The main goal is to reorder the numbers in a given sum so they are in non-decreasing (sorted ascending) order.\n2.  **Input Deconstruction**: The input is a string representing a mathematical sum.\n    *   The string consists of single-digit numbers and the `+` symbol.\n    *   The numbers involved are exclusively '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   The string is a valid sum, meaning it alternates between numbers and plus signs, like `d+d+d...`.\n    *   The maximum length of the input string is 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output Deconstruction**: The output should be a string in the same format as the input (e.g., \"1+1+2+3\"), representing the sorted sum.\n4.  **Core Task**: Extract the numbers from the string, sort them, and then reconstruct the sum string with the sorted numbers.\n5.  **Primary Constraint**: The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we should minimize the amount of memory used by variables.\n6.  **Final Requirement**: We need to calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this memory-efficient solution.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Number Range**: Since the numbers are limited to only 1, 2, 3, and 4, we don't need a general-purpose sorting algorithm like quicksort. A much more efficient method is **Counting Sort**. We can simply count the occurrences of each number.\n2.  **Memory Efficiency**: To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire input string in a large array if possible. Reading the input character by character (e.g., using `getchar()`) is preferable to reading it all at once (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`), as the latter would require a buffer of at least 1001 bytes. Similarly, we should print the output character by character (`putchar()`) rather than building it in a memory buffer.\n3.  **Variable Sizes**: To minimize memory, we should use the smallest possible C data types for our variables that can safely hold the required range of values.\n    *   The maximum number of summands (numbers) in a 1000-character string is 500 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\" of length 999). Therefore, our counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be able to hold a value up to 500. An `unsigned char` (0-255) is too small, but an `unsigned short` (0-65535, typically 2 bytes) is perfect.\n    *   The variable used to read from `getchar()` must be an `int`, not a `char`, to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value.\n    *   Loop counters and flags should also use the smallest appropriate types, such as `char` for small ranges.\n4.  **Printing Separators**: Logic is needed to correctly place the `+` symbols between the numbers in the output. A simple flag can track whether the term being printed is the first one or not.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer (m)\n\nBased on the points above, the most memory-efficient C program would operate as follows:\n\n1.  **Variable Declaration**: Declare the necessary variables using minimal data types.\n    *   An array to count the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'. Maximum count is 500.\n        `unsigned short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(unsigned short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**.\n    *   A variable to read input characters one by one. It must be an `int` for `getchar()`.\n        `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n    *   A flag to manage printing the `+` separator. A `char` is sufficient.\n        `char is_first_term;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   Loop variables for printing. The outer loop runs 4 times (for 1, 2, 3, 4), and the inner loop runs up to 500 times.\n        *   Outer loop counter: `char i;` (range 0-3) -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n        *   Inner loop counter: `unsigned short j;` (range up to 500) -> `sizeof(unsigned short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Execution**:\n    *   Initialize `counts` array to all zeros.\n    *   Read the input string character by character using `getchar()` in a loop.\n    *   If the character is a digit ('1'-'4'), increment the corresponding counter in the `counts` array. Ignore '+' characters.\n    *   After reading all input, use a nested loop to print the result.\n    *   The outer loop iterates from `i=0` to `3`.\n    *   The inner loop iterates `counts[i]` times.\n    *   Inside the inner loop, check the `is_first_term` flag. If it's not the first term, print a `+`. Then, print the number itself (`i + '1'`). Finally, update the flag.\n\n3.  **Total Memory Calculation (m)**:\n    Sum the memory usage of all declared variables:\n    *   `counts` array: 8 bytes\n    *   `c` variable: 4 bytes\n    *   `is_first_term` flag: 1 byte\n    *   `i` loop counter: 1 byte\n    *   `j` loop counter: 2 bytes\n\n    Total Memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **16 bytes**.\n\nThis approach avoids large memory buffers for both input and output and uses the most compact data types possible for its logic, resulting in a highly memory-efficient solution.\n\n<<<16>>>"
