According to the local student legend, the way for a student to "fix" the bad luck of having climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation is to perform a counter-ritual. The student must go to the Baptistery of St. John (the large, round domed building also in the Piazza dei Miracoli) and run a number of laps around its base. The specific number of laps is equal to the number of points their graduation mark is away from the top score of 110. For example, if their projected score is 106, they must run 4 laps to counteract the curse.
