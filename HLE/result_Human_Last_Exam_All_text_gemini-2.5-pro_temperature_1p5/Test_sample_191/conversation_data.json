    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific protein.\n    *   **Action on the Protein:** It is \"broken down\" (cleaved or degraded).\n    *   **Result of the Action:** This breakdown \"allows for\" or enables a specific biological process.\n    *   **The Process:** Macrophage engulfment. Macrophages are immune cells that perform phagocytosis (engulfing debris, pathogens, or other materials). In the context of the brain, the primary macrophages are called microglia.\n    *   **The Target of Engulfment:** Amyloid, which typically refers to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** The question is asking for the identity of a protein whose destruction or removal from a cell surface lifts an inhibitory signal, thereby permitting macrophages (microglia) to clear amyloid plaques.\n\n2.  **Identify the Cellular Context:**\n    *   The process described occurs in the brain during neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n    *   The key players are **microglia** (the brain's resident macrophages) and **amyloid-beta plaques**.\n    *   Microglia have a dual role: they can be protective by clearing plaques, but they can also become dysfunctional and contribute to neuroinflammation.\n    *   The question points to a mechanism that controls the \"clearing\" function of these cells.\n\n3.  **Investigate the \"Brake\" on Amyloid Clearance:**\n    *   For macrophages to be \"allowed\" to engulf something, it implies there was previously a signal preventing them from doing so—an inhibitory signal or a \"brake.\"\n    *   Research into Alzheimer's disease has focused on identifying such \"brakes\" on microglial phagocytosis.\n    *   One key pathway involves the **complement system**, a part of the innate immune system. The protein **Complement component 1q (C1q)** is known to bind to amyloid plaques.\n    *   This plaque-bound C1q then interacts with a receptor on the surface of microglia.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Protein that is Broken Down:**\n    *   The receptor on the microglia that binds to C1q is known as **Complement C1q Binding Protein (C1qbp)**. It is also called p33 or globular C1q receptor (gC1qR).\n    *   Crucially, the interaction between plaque-bound C1q and the microglial C1qbp receptor **inhibits** the microglia's ability to engulf the amyloid plaque. It acts as a powerful brake on the clearance process.\n    *   To release this brake, the C1qbp protein must be removed from the microglial surface.\n    *   This removal happens via proteolytic cleavage, which is a form of being \"broken down.\" An enzyme cleaves C1qbp, causing its ectodomain (the part outside the cell) to be shed.\n    *   When C1qbp is broken down and removed, the inhibitory signal is lost.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Protein:** Complement C1q Binding Protein (C1qbp).\n    *   **Location:** On the surface of macrophages/microglia.\n    *   **Function:** It acts as a receptor for C1q that is attached to amyloid plaques.\n    *   **Effect of Binding:** This interaction inhibits the macrophage from engulfing the amyloid.\n    *   **The \"Breakdown\":** When C1qbp is proteolytically cleaved (broken down), the inhibitory signal is removed.\n    *   **Final Result:** The macrophage/microglia is now disinhibited and \"allowed\" to engulf the amyloid plaque.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of Macrophage:** While the question uses the general term \"macrophage,\" in the context of amyloid in the brain, the primary cell type is the **microglia**.\n*   **The \"Brake\" vs. \"Go\" Signal:** This mechanism is about removing a \"brake\" (an inhibitory signal), which is different from activating a \"go\" signal (like the TREM2 receptor pathway, which actively promotes phagocytosis). The question specifically asks what is broken down to *allow* the process.\n*   **Multiple Names:** The protein has several names (C1qbp, gC1qR, p33), which can be confusing. C1qbp is the official gene name and a common way to refer to it.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the protein that is broken down to allow for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is C1qbp.\n\n<<<Complement C1q Binding Protein (C1qbp)>>>"
