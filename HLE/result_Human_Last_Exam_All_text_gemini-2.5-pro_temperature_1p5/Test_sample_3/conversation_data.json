    "Answering the question: \"What is the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$?\" requires analyzing the possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over this specific number field.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of torsion subgroups\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of $K$-rational points, $E(K)$, is a finitely generated abelian group. Its torsion part, $E(K)_{tors}$, is a finite abelian group.\nThe structure of $E(K)_{tors}$ is always of the form $\\mathbb{Z}_m \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_n$ for positive integers $m, n$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n*   The group is **cyclic** if $m=1$.\n*   The group is **non-cyclic** if $m>1$.\nThe order of this group is $mn$. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $mn$ under the condition that $m>1$, for an elliptic curve defined over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 2: Utilize the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields\nThe problem of classifying possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a major topic in number theory. For quadratic fields (number fields of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$), such as $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the classification is complete. We need to identify all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over this specific field.\n\n### Step 3: Apply conditions specific to $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nA crucial constraint provided by the theory of elliptic curves (specifically, the Weil pairing) is that if an elliptic curve $E$ over $K$ has a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_m \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_m$ in $E(K)$, then the field $K$ must contain the $m$-th roots of unity, denoted $\\mu_m$.\n\nFor our field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ where $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ is a primitive 6th root of unity. Therefore, $K$ contains the 6th roots of unity, $\\mu_6$. This means $K$ also contains $\\mu_2$ and $\\mu_3$. However, it does not contain $\\mu_n$ for any $n$ that does not divide 6 (e.g., $n=4, 5, 8, \\dots$).\n\nThis condition significantly restricts the possibilities. For example, groups like $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_5 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_5$, which can appear over other quadratic fields, are impossible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 4: List the possible non-cyclic torsion groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nBased on the complete classification theorems (from work by Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and others, as surveyed by authors like F. Najman), the non-cyclic groups that are known to occur as torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (Order: 4)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (Order: 8)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (Order: 12)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (Order: 24)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (Order: 9)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (Order: 18)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_9$ (Order: 27)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (Order: 36)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (Order: 36)\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  This list is specific to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Other quadratic fields admit different sets of possible torsion groups.\n2.  The groups $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_9$, $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ are particularly special as they are only known to occur as torsion subgroups over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ among all quadratic fields.\n3.  Each group on this list has been proven to exist. For instance, $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ can be the torsion subgroup for an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ (i.e., with $j$-invariant 0), while $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ occurs for certain non-CM curves.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the largest order\nBy examining the orders of the groups listed in Step 4, we can find the maximum.\n*   Orders: 4, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 27, 36.\nThe largest value in this set is 36. This order is achieved by two different group structures: $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n\nSince the question asks for the largest order, and we have confirmed that groups of this order exist, the answer is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
