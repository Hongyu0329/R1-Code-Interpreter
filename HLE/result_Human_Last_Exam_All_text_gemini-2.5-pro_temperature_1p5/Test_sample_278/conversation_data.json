    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve.**\nThe curve is defined in two pieces based on the value of the parameter `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: `t ∈ [0, π]`**\n    In this interval, `b = 1`. The parametric equations are:\n    `x = cos(t)`\n    `y = sin(t)`\n    These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Squaring and adding them gives `x² + y² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`.\n    As `t` varies from `0` to `π`:\n    *   At `t=0`, `(x, y) = (1, 0)`.\n    *   At `t=π/2`, `(x, y) = (0, 1)`.\n    *   At `t=π`, `(x, y) = (-1, 0)`.\n    Since `sin(t) ≥ 0` for `t ∈ [0, π]`, this part of the curve is the **upper half of the unit circle** centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Part 2: `t ∈ (π, 2π)`**\n    In this interval, `b = 5`. The parametric equations are:\n    `x = cos(t)`\n    `y = 5sin(t)`\n    We can write `x = cos(t)` and `y/5 = sin(t)`. Squaring and adding gives `x² + (y/5)² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    As `t` varies from `π` to `2π`:\n    *   As `t` approaches `π`, `(x, y)` approaches `(-1, 0)`.\n    *   At `t=3π/2`, `(x, y) = (0, 5sin(3π/2)) = (0, -5)`.\n    *   As `t` approaches `2π`, `(x, y)` approaches `(1, 0)`.\n    Since `sin(t) ≤ 0` for `t ∈ (π, 2π)`, this part of the curve is the **lower half of the ellipse** `x² + (y/5)² = 1`.\n\nThe complete figure is a closed shape formed by joining the upper unit semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse at the points `(-1, 0)` and `(1, 0)`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum values for the `x` and `y` coordinates. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x-coordinates:**\n    For the entire curve, `t` varies from `0` to `2π`. The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)`. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1 over this interval.\n    *   `x_max = 1`\n    *   `x_min = -1`\n    The width of the figure is `Width = x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n*   **Range of y-coordinates:**\n    We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For `t ∈ [0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. The maximum value is `sin(π/2) = 1`. The minimum is `sin(0) = sin(π) = 0`. The range is `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t ∈ (π, 2π)`, `y = 5sin(t)`. The minimum value is `5 * sin(3π/2) = 5 * (-1) = -5`. The maximum value is `0` (as `t` approaches `π` or `2π`). The range is `[-5, 0)`.\n    Combining these two ranges, the overall y-range for the figure is `[-5, 1]`.\n    *   `y_max = 1`\n    *   `y_min = -5`\n    The height of the figure is `Height = y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. An enclosing square must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of this rectangle.\n\n*   Side length of the smallest enclosing square, `s = max(Width, Height)`.\n*   `s = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is `s²`.\n\n*   `Area = 6² = 36`.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The function is piecewise, so each part must be analyzed for its contribution to the overall shape and size.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" is non-standard but is interpreted as \"encloses\" or \"circumscribes\".\n*   The smallest enclosing square is assumed to be axis-aligned, which is the standard interpretation for such problems unless rotation is specified. The side of this square is determined by the larger of the figure's total width and height.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  The figure consists of an upper semi-circle (radius 1) and a lower semi-ellipse (semi-axes 1 and 5).\n2.  The horizontal extent (width) is determined by `x = cos(t)`, which ranges from -1 to 1. Width = 2.\n3.  The vertical extent (height) is determined by `y = sin(t)` on `[0, π]` (range `[0, 1]`) and `y = 5sin(t)` on `(π, 2π)` (range `[-5, 0)`). The total y-range is `[-5, 1]`. Height = 6.\n4.  The smallest axis-aligned square enclosing a `2 x 6` shape must have a side length of 6.\n5.  The area of this square is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\n<<<36>>>"
