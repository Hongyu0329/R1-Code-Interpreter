    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the goal.**\nThe given differential equation is an autonomous, first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x $$\nThe goal is to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of this equation.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term inside the parentheses is a perfect square trinomial: $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n$x = 0$ or $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x = 1$.\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points.**\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we can use the first derivative test (linearization) or phase line analysis.\n\n**Method A: First Derivative Test**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can often be determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, $f'(x^*)$.\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   For $x_1 = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   For $x_2 = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method for this point.\n\n**Method B: Phase Line Analysis**\nThis method analyzes the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals separated by the equilibrium points.\nThe equilibrium points $x=0$ and $x=1$ divide the number line into three intervals: $(-\\infty, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, \\infty)$.\n*   **Interval $(-\\infty, 0)$:** Let's choose a test point, e.g., $x = -1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = (1)(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    So, for $x<0$, $x'(t) > 0$, which means $x(t)$ is increasing. (Arrow points right $\\rightarrow$)\n*   **Interval $(0, 1)$:** Let's choose a test point, e.g., $x = 0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = -(0.5)(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    So, for $0<x<1$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. (Arrow points left $\\leftarrow$)\n*   **Interval $(1, \\infty)$:** Let's choose a test point, e.g., $x = 2$.\n    $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    So, for $x>1$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. (Arrow points left $\\leftarrow$)\n\nLet's summarize the phase line:\n`---(+)---> [0] <---(-)--- [1] <---(-)---`\n\nNow, let's determine stability from the phase line:\n*   **Equilibrium point $x=0$**: The arrows on both sides of $x=0$ point towards it ($\\rightarrow 0 \\leftarrow$). This indicates that any solution starting near $x=0$ will converge to it. Therefore, $x=0$ is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point.\n*   **Equilibrium point $x=1$**: To the right of $x=1$, solutions move towards 1 ($\\leftarrow$). However, to the left of $x=1$, solutions move away from 1 ($\\leftarrow$). Because trajectories starting from one side (the left side) move away from the equilibrium, it is not stable. This type of equilibrium is called semi-stable. Semi-stable points are not classified as stable.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of stable equilibria, $m$.**\nBased on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final value.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
