No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial. Due to the Sun's rotation and the outward flow of the solar wind, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral, which at the L1 point's distance is typically oriented at about 45 degrees to the radial (Sun-spacecraft) direction.

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (instead of the physically correct local magnetic field direction) is primarily one of convenience and practicality, especially in large statistical studies. Analyzing data in a fixed coordinate system (like RTN - Radial-Tangential-Normal) is much simpler than continuously calculating the local field direction and rotating the data into a field-aligned frame, particularly when averaging over long periods where the field direction fluctuates. However, this is an approximation. Calculating helicity in a non-field-aligned frame results in a projected, and therefore less accurate, measurement of the wave's true polarization, making it more difficult to identify specific wave modes like AIC waves with high fidelity. For a rigorous physical analysis of a specific wave event, one should always use a coordinate system aligned with the local magnetic field.
