    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film identified by a key scene. The core elements of the scene are:\n    *   A character is boarding a bus (or a vehicle analogous to a bus, like an airport shuttle).\n    *   The character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This specific act \"seals his fate,\" meaning it triggers a disastrous or near-disastrous outcome by revealing something crucial about the character.\n    *   The film must have been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Filtering:** The phrase \"seals his fate\" suggests a thriller, spy film, or drama with high stakes. The requirement for an Oscar nomination significantly narrows the possibilities. We need to recall famous scenes involving buses and fatal mistakes.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The scene described occurs in the 2012 film **Argo**.\n    *   **Oscar Nomination:** *Argo* was not only nominated for seven Academy Awards but also won three, including the prestigious award for Best Picture. This fits the criteria perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Specific Scene in *Argo***:\n    *   **Context:** The climax of the film involves six American diplomats, posing as a Canadian film crew, trying to get through security at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran to escape Iran during the hostage crisis.\n    *   **The \"Bus\":** After passing through the main security checks, the group boards an airline shuttle bus to be transported from the terminal to the airplane on the tarmac. This matches the \"boarding a bus\" element.\n    *   **The Character and the Action:** On the shuttle, a suspicious member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who has been observing them, approaches one of the diplomats, Joe Stafford. The guard speaks to him in Farsi. Joe Stafford, not understanding the language but trying to be polite and end the tense confrontation, responds with one of the few Farsi words he was taught: \"Merci\" (meaning \"Thank you\").\n    *   **\"Seals his fate\":** This is the critical mistake. A real Canadian would be expected to speak English or maybe French, but not Farsi. By politely saying \"Thank you\" in the local language, Stafford inadvertently confirms the guard's suspicion that the group is not who they claim to be. This immediately blows their cover and causes the guards to alert their superiors, which triggers the frantic, last-minute chase to stop the Swissair plane from taking off with the diplomats on board. While they ultimately escape, this single action is what nearly leads to their capture and certain death, thus \"sealing their fate\" within the context of the escape plan's secrecy.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The film *Argo* contains a scene that precisely matches every detail provided in the question. A character (Joe Stafford) on a shuttle bus says \"Thank you\" (in Farsi), which exposes his identity and nearly foils the entire escape mission.\n\n<<<Argo>>>"
