Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) group will very likely solve the precipitation problem. The original probe's precipitation is due to its poor aqueous solubility, caused by the large, hydrophobic thioxanthone core and the hydrophobic 6-chlorohexyl chain. PEG is a highly hydrophilic polymer, and its incorporation into the probe's structure (a process known as PEGylation) is a standard chemical strategy to significantly increase the water solubility of hydrophobic molecules. This will prevent the probe from aggregating and precipitating out of the aqueous cell culture medium.
