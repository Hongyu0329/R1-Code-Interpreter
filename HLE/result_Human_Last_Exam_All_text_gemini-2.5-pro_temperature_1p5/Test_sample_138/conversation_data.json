    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of integral quadratic forms and the classification of lattices. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Properties of the Lattice\n\nWe are looking for the number of positive definite even lattices `L` with the following properties:\n*   **Dimension:** `n = 17`. This is the rank of the lattice as a free Z-module.\n*   **Positive Definite:** The quadratic form `Q(x) = (x, x)` is positive for all non-zero vectors `x` in the lattice. This implies the signature of the lattice is `(17, 0)`, so `n_+ = 17` and `n_- = 0`. The signature difference is `σ = n_+ - n_- = 17`.\n*   **Even Lattice:** `Q(x) = (x, x)` is an even integer for all `x ∈ L`. Such lattices are also called Type II lattices.\n*   **Determinant:** `det(L) = 2`. The determinant is the determinant of the Gram matrix of any basis of the lattice. It is also the order of the discriminant group `L*/L`, where `L*` is the dual lattice.\n\n### Step 2: Genus of the Lattice\n\nIn the theory of classification of lattices, lattices are grouped into *genera*. All lattices in a genus are \"locally equivalent\" everywhere. For a definite lattice, the genus is determined by its dimension, signature, and its structure over the `p`-adic integers for all primes `p`.\n\n1.  **Discriminant Group:** The determinant of the lattice is `d=2`. The discriminant group `D = L*/L` is an abelian group of order `d`, so `D ≅ Z/2Z`.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Form:** The discriminant group is equipped with a quadratic form `q_L: D -> Q/Z` (or `Q/2Z` for even lattices) defined by `q_L(x + L) = (x, x) (mod 2Z)`.\n\n3.  **Uniqueness of the Genus:** The genus of an even lattice is determined by its dimension `n`, signature `σ`, and the discriminant form. There is a fundamental constraint relating the signature `σ` to the discriminant form. For a lattice with determinant `d=2`, the discriminant group is denoted `2_k`, where `k` is an odd integer defined modulo 8. This `k` is determined by the signature via the congruence:\n    `σ ≡ k (mod 8)`\n\n    In our case, the lattice is positive definite of dimension 17, so the signature is `σ = 17`.\n    Plugging this into the congruence:\n    `17 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`\n\n    This implies `k=1`. So, the discriminant form must be of type `2_1`.\n\nSince the dimension `n=17`, the signature `σ=17`, and the discriminant form type `2_1` are all fixed by the problem statement, there is only **one possible genus** of lattices satisfying these conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Class Number of the Genus\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic lattices with the given properties. This is equivalent to asking for the number of distinct isomorphism classes of lattices within this unique genus. This number is called the **class number** of the genus.\n\nCalculating the class number from first principles is highly non-trivial and involves the Siegel mass formula. However, the class numbers for lattices of small dimension and determinant have been computed and are tabulated in standard references.\n\nWe are looking for the class number of the genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 with determinant 2. In the notation of Conway and Sloane, this genus can be denoted as `II_{17,1}(2_1)`.\n\nAccording to the classification tables of lattices (for example, Table 16.7 in Conway and Sloane's \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\"), the class number for this genus is **2**.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Lattices (for completeness)\n\nThe two lattices in this genus are:\n1.  **A decomposable lattice:** This is the direct sum of known lattices. Specifically, it is `E_8 ⊕ E_8 ⊕ A_1(2)`.\n    *   `E_8` is the 8-dimensional even unimodular root lattice. `E_8 ⊕ E_8` is a 16-dimensional even unimodular lattice.\n    *   `A_1(2)` is the 1-dimensional lattice generated by a vector of norm 2. `det(A_1(2)) = 2`.\n    *   The total dimension is `8 + 8 + 1 = 17`.\n    *   The total determinant is `det(E_8) * det(E_8) * det(A_1(2)) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2`.\n    *   It is even and positive definite.\n\n2.  **An indecomposable lattice:** There is a second lattice with the same properties that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-trivial sublattices. Its existence is established via the mass formula and explicit constructions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe properties of being a positive definite even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2 uniquely specify a genus. The class number for this genus is known to be 2. Therefore, there are exactly two such non-isomorphic lattices."
