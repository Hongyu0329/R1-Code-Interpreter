    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is, in turn, connected to a nitrogen atom. This -C(=O)N< group is the primary functional group and defines the numbering of the ring, with the carbon attached to it being C1.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. So, the amide group is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to the benzene ring at the C3 position (meta to the amide group).\n\n    The structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(Et)₂ group at position 1 and a -N(Me)₂ group at position 3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents of the First Step:**\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organolithium base. In the presence of an aromatic compound with heteroatom-containing substituents, its primary role is to deprotonate an acidic proton on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it a stronger base. More importantly, it participates in stabilizing the lithiated intermediate, which facilitates and directs the deprotonation.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** This is a standard aprotic ether solvent for organometallic reactions.\n    *   **Overall Reaction Type:** The combination of a strong organolithium base with a substrate containing suitable directing groups points to a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. This reaction involves the deprotonation (lithiation) of the position *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation):**\n    The starting material has two powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation:\n    *   **The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1. This group directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6. The lithium ion coordinates strongly with the carbonyl oxygen. This is one of the most effective directing groups.\n    *   **The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at C3. This group directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4. The lithium ion coordinates with the nitrogen's lone pair.\n    *   **Cooperative Directing Effect:** The proton at the C2 position is unique because it is *ortho to both* directing groups. The proton at C4 is ortho only to the -NMe₂ group, and the proton at C6 is ortho only to the -CONEt₂ group. The synergistic effect of two directing groups makes the C2 proton significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** sec-BuLi will selectively abstract the proton from the C2 position. This forms a new carbon-lithium bond at C2, creating an aryllithium intermediate: **2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Step:**\n    *   **Reagent:** **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (at C2) and a strong base. Methyl iodide is an electrophile, with the carbon atom being susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The aryllithium will act as a nucleophile and attack the methyl group of CH₃I.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic C2 of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I in an Sₙ2-like reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃) becomes attached to the C2 position of the benzene ring, replacing the lithium atom (which was originally a hydrogen atom).\n    *   The substituents on the starting molecule, the N,N-diethylamide and the 3-dimethylamino groups, remain unchanged.\n    *   The final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n\n*   Recognize that the reaction conditions (sec-BuLi/TMEDA and a substrate with directing groups) indicate a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM).\n*   Identify all potential directing groups (-CONEt₂ and -NMe₂) on the aromatic ring.\n*   Determine the most reactive site by considering the additive effects of the directing groups. The position ortho to two powerful directing groups (C2) is the most activated and will be deprotonated.\n*   Understand that the aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile.\n*   Recognize that methyl iodide is an electrophile that will be attacked by the nucleophilic aryllithium to form a new C-C bond.\n*   Correctly assemble the structure of the final product by adding the methyl group to the site of lithiation.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
