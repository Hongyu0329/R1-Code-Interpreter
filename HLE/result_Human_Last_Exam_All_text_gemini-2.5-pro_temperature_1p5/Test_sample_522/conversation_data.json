    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Input and Output Format\nThe input and output are strings representing a grid of numbers. Each row of the grid is separated by a comma. The grid contains the digits '0', '1', and '2'. The goal is to find the transformation rule that converts the input grid into the output grid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Example A\n\n*   **Input_A:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n\n**Careful Points & Observations:**\n1.  We can represent the grid using (row, column) coordinates, starting from (0, 0) at the top-left.\n2.  In `Input_A`, the digit '2' is at position `(1, 1)`.\n3.  In `Output_A`, the '2' has moved to `(0, 0)`, and its original position `(1, 1)` has become '0'.\n4.  The value at `(0, 0)` in `Input_A` was '0'.\n5.  The move from `(1, 1)` to `(0, 0)` is a diagonal move, one step up and one step left (Up-Left).\n6.  Let's check the other potential move directions from the '2'. The Up-Right position is `(0, 2)`. In `Input_A`, the value at `(0, 2)` is '1'. Since it's not a '0', the '2' cannot move there. This suggests the '2' can only move into empty spaces ('0').\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in Example B\n\n*   **Input_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n**Careful Points & Observations:**\n1.  In `Input_B`, the '2' is at `(3, 6)`.\n2.  In `Output_B`, the '2' has moved to `(2, 7)`, and its original position `(3, 6)` has become '0'.\n3.  The value at `(2, 7)` in `Input_B` was '0'.\n4.  The move from `(3, 6)` to `(2, 7)` is also a diagonal move, one step up and one step right (Up-Right).\n5.  Let's check the other diagonal move direction. The Up-Left position is `(2, 5)`. In `Input_B`, the value at `(2, 5)` is also '0'.\n6.  Here, both Up-Left and Up-Right moves were possible, but the piece chose Up-Right. This implies a priority or a tie-breaking rule.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Transformation Rule\nBased on the analysis of both examples, we can deduce a consistent rule:\n\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: Find the coordinates `(r, c)` of the '2'.\n2.  **Check Potential Moves**: The '2' attempts to move diagonally upwards to either `(r-1, c-1)` (Up-Left) or `(r-1, c+1)` (Up-Right). A move is only possible if the target cell is within the grid boundaries and contains a '0'.\n3.  **Apply Priority Rule**:\n    *   The '2' prefers to move **Up-Right**. First, check if a move to `(r-1, c+1)` is possible. If yes, perform this move.\n    *   If the Up-Right move is not possible, check if a move to **Up-Left** `(r-1, c-1)` is possible. If yes, perform this move.\n    *   If neither move is possible, the grid remains unchanged.\n4.  **Execute the Move**: If a move is made, the target cell's value becomes '2', and the original cell `(r, c)`'s value becomes '0'.\n\nThis rule explains both A and B:\n*   In A, only the Up-Left move was possible, so it was taken.\n*   In B, both Up-Left and Up-Right were possible. Due to the preference for Up-Right, that move was taken.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C\n\n*   **Input_C:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: The '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  **Check Up-Right Move**:\n    *   The target coordinates are `(r-1, c+1) = (0, 5)`.\n    *   This is within the grid boundaries.\n    *   The value at `(0, 5)` is '0'.\n    *   Therefore, the Up-Right move is possible.\n3.  **Apply Priority Rule**: Since the preferred Up-Right move is possible, the '2' will move to `(0, 5)`. We do not need to check the Up-Left move.\n4.  **Execute the Move and Construct the Output**:\n    *   The value at `(0, 5)` changes from '0' to '2'. The first row becomes `000002`.\n    *   The value at `(1, 4)` changes from '2' to '0'. The second row becomes `011100`.\n    *   The third row `111111` is unchanged.\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation**: Combine the modified rows into the final output string.\n    *   `000002,011100,111111`\n\nThe value of `MISSING` is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
