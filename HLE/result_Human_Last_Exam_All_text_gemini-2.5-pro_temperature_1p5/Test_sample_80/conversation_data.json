    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the board and edge squares**\nA standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid of 64 squares.\nThe \"edge squares\" are all the squares in the first and last rows (ranks 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (files 'a' and 'h').\n*   Rank 1 has 8 squares.\n*   Rank 8 has 8 squares.\n*   File 'a' has 8 squares, but the top and bottom ones (a1, a8) are already counted in the ranks. So, 6 new squares.\n*   File 'h' also has 6 new squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the rules for placing bishops**\nThe main rule is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks any square along the two diagonals on which it stands.\nA crucial point for bishop placement puzzles is that bishops on white squares can only attack other pieces on white squares, and bishops on black squares can only attack pieces on black squares. This allows us to consider the white squares and black squares as two separate problems.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the edge squares by color**\nOut of the 28 edge squares, we need to determine how many are white and how many are black. By counting them or by using the symmetry of the board, we find:\n*   There are 14 white edge squares.\n*   There are 14 black edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize bishops on white edge squares**\nThe problem is now to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on the 14 available white edge squares.\n*   The maximum number of non-attacking bishops of one color on a full 8x8 board is 7. This is because there are 7 distinct diagonals of that color in one direction, so you cannot place more than one bishop on each.\n*   Since we are limited to a subset of all white squares (the 14 on the edge), the maximum number we can place is at most 7.\n*   We need to confirm if placing 7 bishops just on the edge squares is possible. One such arrangement is to place bishops on squares: b1, d1, f1, h1, a4, c8, and g8. All of these are white edge squares, and you can verify that none of them attack each other.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize bishops on black edge squares**\nWe now solve the same problem for the 14 black edge squares.\n*   The chessboard's coloring has rotational symmetry. The problem for black squares is identical to the problem for white squares.\n*   By the same logic as in Step 4, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 32 black squares of the board is 7.\n*   Because of the board's symmetry, it is also possible to place these 7 bishops entirely on the 14 black edge squares.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is also 7.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of placed bishops**\nThe total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board is the sum of the maximums for each color.\n*   Total Bishops = (Max on White Squares) + (Max on Black Squares)\n*   Total Bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the number of empty edge squares**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops if the maximum number were placed.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Edge squares with bishops = 14\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops = Total edge squares - Edge squares with bishops\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\nAfter placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would have bishops, and 14 would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
