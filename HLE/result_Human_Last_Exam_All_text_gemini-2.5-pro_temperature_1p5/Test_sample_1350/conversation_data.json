    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n*   **Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n*   **Character Trait 1:** The character must have visited a Roman city.\n*   **Character Trait 2:** The character describes Roman religious practices or founding myths.\n*   **Specific Detail:** The description must contain a clear allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context of the Novel**\n*The House of the Wolfings* is a fantasy romance that pits a Germanic tribe, the Wolfings, against an invading Roman army. The narrative is told from the perspective of the Wolfings, who view the Romans as their enemies. Therefore, any character with intimate knowledge of Roman cities and customs would likely have acquired it under special circumstances, such as being a captive or a traveler.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Characters and Scenarios**\nThe most likely scenario for such a description to occur is during a council or meeting where the Wolfings discuss the nature of their Roman adversaries. They would need to understand the enemy's culture and beliefs. We need to look for a character who has been inside Roman territory and has returned to the Wolfings. A warrior might know of Roman tactics, but someone who lived among them would know their stories.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Specific Passage and Character**\nIn Chapter VI, \"Of the House of the Wolfings and its Roof-Tree and its Kindreds,\" there is a scene where the tribe is gathered in their great hall. A man who was once a captive among the Romans speaks to the assembly. This character is known simply as **\"the Thrall\"** (a thrall being a slave or servant). Because he was a captive in Roman cities, he possesses firsthand knowledge of their society.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Character's Description**\nDuring his speech, the Thrall's specific purpose is to explain the Romans to his kin. He contrasts the Wolfings, who see the wolf as a noble totem animal, with the Romans, who have a different relationship to the wolf in their founding myth. He says the following, which directly references the Romulus and Remus story:\n\n> \"...for they have a tale of their first fathers, that they were twin-brethren, and that a she-wolf gave them suck when they were babies, and that thereafter they built a city, which is the mightiest of all cities.\"\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Analysis**\nThis passage perfectly matches all the requirements of the question:\n*   The speaker is **the Thrall**.\n*   He gained his knowledge by being a captive (\"thrall\") in Roman cities.\n*   He describes a foundational Roman \"tale\" (religious/mythological practice).\n*   The tale is explicitly that of twin brothers nursed by a she-wolf, a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\nTherefore, the character who fits the description is the Thrall.\n\n<<<The Thrall"
