    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician, historian, and leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets) in the early 20th century. The context is his criticism of contemporary culture, which he specifically labeled a \"stagnant swamp\".\n\n2.  **Analyze Milyukov's Intellectual Position:** Pavel Milyukov was a product of 19th-century Russian intellectual tradition. He was a rationalist, a positivist, and a firm believer in social progress. He believed that culture, literature, and art should serve a civic purpose and contribute to the enlightenment and betterment of society. This put him in direct opposition to new artistic movements that were emerging at the turn of the century.\n\n3.  **Identify the Target of Milyukov's Criticism:** The cultural movement that Milyukov famously attacked was **Russian Symbolism**. This movement, which flourished from the 1890s to around 1910, was part of the broader European \"fin de siècle\" and modernist trend. It rejected realism and positivism in favor of mysticism, individualism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and the exploration of subjective spiritual states. Leading figures included writers and poets like Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Zinaida Gippius, Valery Bryusov, and Andrei Bely.\n\n4.  **Connect Milyukov's Quote to Symbolism:** Milyukov saw the Symbolists' focus on the otherworldly, the irrational, and the purely aesthetic as a betrayal of the Russian intelligentsia's traditional role. From his perspective, their work was self-indulgent, obscure, and detached from the pressing social and political problems of Russia. He considered it a decadent and unhealthy trend. The specific phrase \"stagnant swamp\" (in Russian: застойное болото, *zastoynoye boloto*) was one of his most famous pejorative descriptions for the Symbolist movement, capturing his view that it was lifeless, murky, and unproductive.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on \"X-Y\":** Based on historical accounts of the cultural debates of the Russian Silver Age, the group that Pavel Milyukov denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" was the **Symbolists**. The format \"X-Ys\" in the question is a placeholder for this specific group.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of Criticism:** Milyukov was not against all \"Western culture.\" As a liberal, he was heavily influenced by Western political and social thought. His attack was aimed very specifically at the modernist and \"decadent\" trends in culture, represented by Symbolism, which had roots in Western Europe (e.g., French Symbolism).\n*   **Ideological Clash:** The conflict was not just about artistic taste. It was a fundamental clash of worldviews between the 19th-century rationalist, socially-engaged tradition and the new 20th-century modernist focus on subjectivity, spirituality, and aesthetics.\n*   **The \"X-Y\" Placeholder:** The question uses a generic \"X-Ys\" format. The historical target is a single-word group, \"the Symbolists\". This format shouldn't distract from the specific identity of the group being condemned.\n*   **Impact of the Quote:** Milyukov's harsh criticism was well-known and highlighted the deep divisions within the Russian intelligentsia on the eve of the revolution.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify X-Y.\n\n<<<the Symbolists>>>"
