  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal**\nThe primary goal is to determine the maximum possible length of a secret message. The length of the message is measured in the number of characters it contains.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Provided Information**\nLet's break down the information into relevant pieces and filter out the irrelevant ones.\n\n*   **The Message's Alphabet:** The secret message is written using a specific set of characters. The problem states this is \"the 120 most common Chinese characters\" found in the book Shu.\n    *   *Key Point:* The alphabet from which the message is constructed has a size of 120.\n\n*   **The Encoding Medium:** The message is encrypted using symbols from the book Ching. The Ching contains \"exactly 9999 symbols\".\n    *   *Key Point:* We have a total of 9999 symbols to work with for the encryption.\n\n*   **The Nature of the Encoding Symbols:** The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   Yinyang has 2 states (Yin, Yang).\n    *   Wuxing (The Five Elements) has 5 states (Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, Earth).\n    *   A single symbol is a combination of these, like \"yin-water\". Therefore, the number of unique types of symbols is 2 (states of yinyang) ร 5 (states of wuxing) = 10 unique symbol types.\n    *   *Careful Point:* It is crucial to distinguish between the total count of symbols (9999) and the number of unique *types* of symbols (10). The 10 types are the building blocks of our code, like the digits 0-9 in the decimal system.\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information (Red Herrings):**\n    *   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\" This is the total length of the Shu, not the size of its alphabet. The size of the alphabet is explicitly given as 120.\n    *   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\" This information relates to the technology used for analysis but does not impact the logical structure of the message's encoding.\n    *   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\" This is extraneous technical detail with no bearing on the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Encoding Scheme**\nWe need to represent 120 different characters using a vocabulary of 10 unique symbol types. This is an encoding problem. We must determine how many symbols are required to represent a single character of the message. We are looking for the maximum message length, so we should assume the most efficient possible encoding.\n\n*   Let `N` be the number of symbols from the Ching needed to encode one character of the message.\n*   Since there are 10 unique symbol types, with `N` symbols, we can represent `10^N` different combinations.\n*   We need to find the smallest integer `N` such that the number of combinations is greater than or equal to the number of characters we need to represent (120).\n\n*   If `N = 1`: We can represent `10^1 = 10` characters. This is less than 120, so it's not enough.\n*   If `N = 2`: We can represent `10^2 = 100` characters. This is still less than 120, so it's not enough.\n*   If `N = 3`: We can represent `10^3 = 1000` characters. This is greater than 120, so it is sufficient.\n\n*   *Careful Point:* To ensure every one of the 120 characters can be uniquely represented, we must use a sequence of at least 3 symbols for each character.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Message Length**\nNow that we know the \"cost\" of encoding each character, we can calculate the total number of characters that can be encoded using the available symbols.\n\n*   Total symbols available in the Ching: 9999\n*   Symbols required per character of the message: 3\n*   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols required per character)\n*   Maximum message length = 9999 / 3\n\n**Calculation:**\n9999 รท 3 = 3333\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
