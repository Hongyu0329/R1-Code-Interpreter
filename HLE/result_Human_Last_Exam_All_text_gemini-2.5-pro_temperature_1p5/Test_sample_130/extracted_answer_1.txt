The edges of the image will become progressively smoother as sharp corners are rounded and concave regions are filled in. This process causes the shapes defined by the edges to shrink and simplify their geometry over time. Eventually, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, any bounded shape will be completely eliminated, and the image will converge to a single uniform color (either all black or all white).
