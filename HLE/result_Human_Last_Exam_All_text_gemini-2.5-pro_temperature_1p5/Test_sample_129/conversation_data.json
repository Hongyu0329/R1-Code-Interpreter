    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Constraints\n1.  **Symbols allowed:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n2.  **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n3.  **Validity:** The expression must be a syntactically valid boolean expression.\n4.  **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to `True`.\n5.  **Operator Precedence:** The order of evaluation is `!`, then `&`, then `|`. Parentheses `()` can be used to override this precedence.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate All Possible Syntactic Structures (Skeletons)\nWe need to find all possible valid arrangements of 5 symbols that form a boolean expression. We can categorize these structures by the number of literals (`T` or `F`) they contain. An expression must contain at least one literal.\n\n#### Case 1: Expressions with 3 Literals\nTo have 3 literals, we need 2 other symbols. These must be binary operators (`&` or `|`) to connect the literals.\n*   **Structure:** `L1 op1 L2 op2 L3` (e.g., `T & F | T`)\n    *   This structure uses 5 symbols. We need to consider the 4 combinations of operators (`&&`, `&|`, `|&`, `||`) and the `2^3 = 8` combinations of truth values for `L1, L2, L3`.\n    1.  `L1 & L2 & L3`: Parsed as `(L1 & L2) & L3`. This is true only if all three literals are `T`. So, only `T & T & T` is true. (Count: **1**)\n    2.  `L1 & L2 | L3`: Parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3`. This is true if `L3` is `T` (4 combinations for `L1,L2`) or if `L1` and `L2` are `T` and `L3` is `F` (1 combination). Total true expressions: 4 + 1 = **5**.\n    3.  `L1 | L2 & L3`: Parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`. This is true if `L1` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `L2` and `L3` are `T` and `L1` is `F` (1 combination). Total true expressions: 4 + 1 = **5**.\n    4.  `L1 | L2 | L3`: Parsed as `(L1 | L2) | L3`. This is false only if all three literals are `F`. So, there are `8 - 1 = 7` true expressions. (Count: **7**)\n*   **Total for 3-literal structures: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18**\n\n#### Case 2: Expressions with 2 Literals\nTo have 2 literals, we need 3 other symbols.\n*   **Structure Group A: Using `op`, `(`, `)`**\n    1.  `(L1 op L2)`: e.g., `(T & F)`.\n        *   `&`: `(T & T)` is the only true expression. (Count: **1**)\n        *   `|`: `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` are true. (Count: **3**)\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n    2.  `L1 op (L2)`: e.g., `T & (F)`. This is a distinct string from the one above.\n        *   `&`: `T & (T)` is the only true expression. (Count: **1**)\n        *   `|`: `T | (T)`, `T | (F)`, `F | (T)` are true. (Count: **3**)\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n    3.  `(L1) op L2`: e.g., `(T) & F`. Symmetric to the previous case.\n        *   Total: **4**.\n*   **Structure Group B: Using `op`, `!`, `!`**\n    1.  `!L1 op !L2`: e.g., `!T & !F`. Parsed as `(!L1) op (!L2)`.\n        *   `&`: True only if `!L1` is T and `!L2` is T, which means `L1` is F and `L2` is F. `!F & !F`. (Count: **1**)\n        *   `|`: False only if `!L1` is F and `!L2` is F, meaning `L1` is T and `L2` is T. Thus, 3 are true. (Count: **3**)\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n    2.  `!!L1 op L2`: e.g., `!!T & F`. Parsed as `(!!L1) op L2`, which simplifies to `L1 op L2`.\n        *   `&`: True for `T & T` (`!!T & T`). (Count: **1**)\n        *   `|`: True for 3 cases. (Count: **3**)\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n    3.  `L1 op !!L2`: e.g., `T & !!F`. Symmetric to the previous case.\n        *   Total: **4**.\n*   **Total for 2-literal structures: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24**\n\n#### Case 3: Expressions with 1 Literal\nTo have 1 literal, we need 4 other symbols, which must be combinations of `!` and `()`.\n1.  `!!!!L`: e.g., `!!!!T`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (Count: **1**)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n2.  `!!(L)`: e.g., `!!(T)`.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `!(!T)` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. (Count: **1**)\n3.  `!(!L)`: e.g., `!(!T)`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `!(F)` -> `T`. (Count: **1**)\n4.  `(!!L)`: e.g., `(!!T)`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)` -> `T`. (Count: **1**)\n*   **Total for 1-literal structures: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4**\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Counts\nThe structures analyzed are all syntactically distinct strings, so there is no overlap. We can sum the counts from all cases.\n\n*   From 3-literal structures: 18\n*   From 2-literal structures: 24\n*   From 1-literal structures: 4\n\nTotal true expressions = 18 + 24 + 4 = 46."
