    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core of the question:** The goal is to find the name of a \"book of manners\" that was physically preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n2.  **Identify the specific \"Sir Launfal\":** The question refers to the Middle English romance poem \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre around the late 14th century.\n\n3.  **Locate the manuscript:** The poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre survives in a single, unique manuscript. This manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is part of the Cotton collection now housed in the British Library.\n\n4.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it's a collection of many different works bound together. It contains a variety of texts, including romances (like *Sir Launfal*, *Sir Orfeo*, and *Emare*), religious poetry, and didactic or instructional works.\n\n5.  **Search for a \"book of manners\" within the manuscript:** To answer the question, we must look at the list of the manuscript's contents and identify a work that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" The manuscript contains several such works, most notably:\n    *   *Stans Puer ad Mensam* (A Boy Standing at the Table): A poem by John Lydgate about table manners for a page.\n    *   *How the Wise Man taught his Son*: A poem giving moral and practical advice from a father to his son.\n    *   ***How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter***: A didactic poem where a mother gives her daughter extensive advice on behavior, social conduct, household management, and being a good wife.\n\n6.  **Select the most fitting answer:** All three of the works listed above could be considered books of manners or conduct. However, ***How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter*** is a very prominent and classic example of a \"courtesy book\" from the period. It is frequently highlighted by scholars when discussing the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript because it perfectly illustrates the blend of entertainment (romances) and practical, moral instruction that defines the collection. The pairing of a romance like \"Sir Launfal\" with a domestic guide like *How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter* gives insight into the interests and values of the manuscript's intended audience.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** The fact that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only one manuscript makes the answer definitive. All accompanying works are known.\n*   **Definition of \"Alongside\":** The term \"alongside\" means within the same bound volume (the manuscript), not necessarily on the page directly next to \"Sir Launfal\". The works are part of the same collection.\n*   **Genre Title:** The term \"book of manners\" is interchangeable with \"courtesy book\" or \"conduct book,\" a popular genre in the late Middle Ages. *How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter* is a prime example of this genre for a female audience.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most direct and representative answer is *How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter*.\n\n<<<How the Goode Wife taught her Daughter>>>"
