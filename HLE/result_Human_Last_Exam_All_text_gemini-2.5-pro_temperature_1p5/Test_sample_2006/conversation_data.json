    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and its components.**\nThe problem presents a riddle in three parts:\n1.  **The Title/Question:** \"The Bays\". This is the question we need to answer, and the plural form suggests the answer will be a list of more than one bay.\n2.  **The Clue (Haiku):** The three-line poem provides the information needed to identify \"The Bays\".\n    *   *An August tempest*\n    *   *Twice fifteen brings winds of change*\n    *   *A divine one yields*\n3.  **The Instruction:** \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\" This tells us the final output must be a list sorted alphabetically.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the haiku's central theme.**\nA literal interpretation of the haiku about a specific storm in August is unlikely to resolve all the clues cohesively. The language is highly symbolic. The haiku is best understood as an allegory for the biblical story of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to look beyond the surface meaning of the words. \"August\" can mean majestic, and \"tempest\" can mean turmoil, not just a literal storm.\n*   Numerical clues like \"Twice fifteen\" are often very direct and important.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each line of the haiku based on the allegorical theme.**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This line sets the scene of majestic (\"august\") turmoil (\"tempest\"). The betrayal and crucifixion of Jesus is a story of immense and pivotal chaos.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line also provides the keyword **\"Storms\"** (a synonym for tempest), which will point to one of the bays.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15 = 30`. This is a direct reference to the 30 pieces of **silver** that Judas received for betraying Jesus. This payment was the catalyst for the \"winds of change\" (the subsequent arrest and crucifixion).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This gives us our second keyword: **\"Silver\"**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This refers to Jesus, considered \"a divine one,\" who yields to his fate and is handed over by Judas. The person who commits this act is a **\"traitor.\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This gives us our third keyword: **\"Traitors\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the keywords from the haiku to the question, \"The Bays\".**\nThe keywords derived from the haiku—Storms, Silver, and Traitors—are the names of actual, real-world bays.\n\n*   **Storms** -> **Storms Bay** (located in Tasmania, Australia)\n*   **Silver** -> **Silver Bay** (multiple locations exist, including in Minnesota and Alaska, USA)\n*   **Traitors** -> **Traitors Bay** (*Baie des Traîtres* in French, located in Vanuatu)\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final answer according to the instructions.**\nThe instruction is to list the answer in alphabetical order. We take the names of the three bays we have identified and sort them.\n\n1.  Silver Bay\n2.  Storms Bay\n3.  Traitors Bay\n\nThe alphabetized list is the final answer to the question \"The Bays\".\n\n<<<Silver Bay, Storms Bay, Traitors Bay>>>"
