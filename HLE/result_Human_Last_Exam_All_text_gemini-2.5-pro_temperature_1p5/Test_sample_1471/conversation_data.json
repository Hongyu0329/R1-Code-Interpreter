    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Roman Numerals**\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Roman numeral in the equation to its modern (Arabic) number equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   X represents 10.\n    *   IV represents 4 (V is 5, and placing I before it means 5 - 1).\n    *   So, XXIV = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24.\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   C represents 100.\n    *   So, CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\n*   **CCCXCIX**:\n    *   CCC represents 300.\n    *   XC represents 90 (C is 100, and placing X before it means 100 - 10).\n    *   IX represents 9 (X is 10, and placing I before it means 10 - 1).\n    *   So, CCCXCIX = 300 + 90 + 9 = 399.\n\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the subtractive notation in Roman numerals (like IV, IX, XC). A smaller value numeral placed before a larger value numeral means subtraction.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\n\nNow we can substitute the modern numbers back into the original equation:\n`24 / 300 - 399 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe must follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we perform division before subtraction.\n\n1.  **Division:** Calculate `24 / 300`.\n    *   24 ÷ 300 = 0.08\n\n2.  **Subtraction:** Now substitute the result of the division back into the equation.\n    *   0.08 - 399\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   0.08 - 399 = -398.92\n\n**Careful Point:** Remember to perform the division first. A common mistake would be to subtract 300 from 399 first, which would be incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe solution to the equation is -398.92.\n\n<<<-398.92>>>"
