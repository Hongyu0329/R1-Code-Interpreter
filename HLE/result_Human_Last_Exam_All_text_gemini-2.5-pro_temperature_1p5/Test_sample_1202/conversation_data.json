    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism that explains what happens after a gene is duplicated in a eukaryote's genome. Specifically, it focuses on the outcome where both copies of the gene are kept (retained) instead of one being lost, and these two copies evolve to become different from each other (divergence).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, such as the two copies of a duplicate gene. This process tends to make the two copies more similar, not more different. It works against divergence, although it can contribute to the long-term maintenance of gene families (concerted evolution). It is not the primary driver of divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. One copy maintains the original function, while the second, redundant copy is not under selective pressure and accumulates disabling mutations, eventually becoming a non-functional \"pseudogene\". This process explains divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes), but it does not explain the *retention* of two *functional* genes. Therefore, it is not the mechanism responsible for keeping both copies active.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy keeps the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then favor keeping both copies: one for the old function and one for the new. This model explains both **retention** (both copies are beneficial) and **divergence** (the second copy must change to acquire the new function). This is a plausible and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model applies when the original, single-copy gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, degenerative mutations can disable different subfunctions in each copy. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete set of ancestral functions. This process explains both **retention** (both copies are needed through complementation) and **divergence** (the sequences diverge as they specialize and accumulate different mutations).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes a macroevolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species, often filling different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not the molecular mechanism that acts on the genes themselves to cause their retention and divergence within a genome. The scale is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the most plausible options (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization).**\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n*   **Probability of occurrence:** Neofunctionalization depends on a relatively rare event: the occurrence of a beneficial mutation that creates a new function before the redundant gene copy is silenced by more common, disabling mutations (pseudogenization).\n*   **Probability of occurrence:** Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, depends on the much more common occurrence of degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. It provides a passive route to preserving both gene copies. If the ancestral gene had multiple functions, it's quite likely that the two copies will accumulate different disabling mutations, locking them both into the genome by necessity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) compared to the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more common or \"likely\" mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicated genes. It effectively rescues the duplicate pair from the much more common fate of pseudogenization, setting the stage for long-term retention and divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
