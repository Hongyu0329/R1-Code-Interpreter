    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and Identify the Singularity**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nThe parameter $\\epsilon$ is small and positive ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nWe need to find an approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ is positive for $x \\ge 0$.\nThe function $g(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$ is zero only at $x=0$ within the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the term $\\epsilon + g(x)$ approaches zero only when $x$ is close to 0.\nThis causes the integrand to become very large in a small region near $x=0$.\nThis type of behavior indicates that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the neighborhood of $x=0$. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n**2. Approximate the Integrand for Small x**\n\nNear $x=0$, the function $g(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\n\nThus, for small $x$, the integral is dominated by the behavior of:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\delta} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\nwhere $\\delta$ is a small number. The contribution from the rest of the interval $[\\delta, 15]$ is expected to be smaller than the contribution from the $[0, \\delta]$ interval.\n\n**3. Use Scaling to Evaluate the Dominant Contribution**\n\nThe integral's behavior is determined by the region where the two terms in the denominator are of the same order, i.e., $\\epsilon \\sim 9x^5$.\nThis suggests a change of variables (scaling) to a new variable $y$ where this balance is manifest. Let's set:\n$9x^5 = \\epsilon y \\implies x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon y}{9} \\implies x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon y}{9}\\right)^{1/5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} y^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}}$.\n\nThen, we find the differential $dx$:\n$dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} y^{1/5 - 1} dy = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} y^{-4/5} dy$.\n\nNow we substitute this into our approximate integral. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the contribution from the region near $x=0$ becomes dominant. We can extend the upper limit of integration to $\\infty$ because the contribution from large $x$ (and hence large $y$) is negligible.\nThe integral becomes:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\nSubstituting $x$ and $dx$ in terms of $y$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon y} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} y^{-4/5} \\right) dy$\n\n**4. Simplify and Evaluate the Resulting Integral**\n\nFactor out $\\epsilon$ from the denominator:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + y)} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} y^{-4/5} \\right) dy$\n\nNow, we collect the terms involving $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{y^{-4/5}}{1+y} dy = \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{y^{-4/5}}{1+y} dy$\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1+t} dt = B(z, 1-z) = \\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z)$\nwhere $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\n\nFor our integral, we have $z-1 = -4/5$, which implies $z=1/5$.\nSo the integral evaluates to:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{y^{-4/5}}{1+y} dy = \\Gamma(1/5) \\Gamma(1-1/5) = \\Gamma(1/5) \\Gamma(4/5)$\n\nUsing Euler's reflection formula, $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, we get:\n$\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. This formula captures the dominant singular behavior of the integral. The higher-order terms in $g(x)$ (i.e., $5x^6$ and $9x^8$) and the finite integration limit (15.00) provide smaller corrections to this leading term.\n\nThe final analytical formula is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nCareful Points:\n- The core of the method is identifying that the integral's value for small $\\epsilon$ is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$.\n- The specific powers and coefficients in $g(x)$ beyond the leading term ($9x^5$) affect the higher-order terms in the asymptotic expansion of $I(\\epsilon)$, but not the leading term derived here.\n- The finite upper limit of integration (15.00) also only affects higher-order terms. For the leading-order term, extending the limit to infinity is a valid approximation.\n- The change of variables (scaling) is a crucial step that transforms the integral into a form where the dependence on $\\epsilon$ is factored out, leaving a standard integral that can be evaluated.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe derived formula provides an excellent approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$ when $\\epsilon$ is small. It shows that the integral diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ with a power law of $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi \\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n<<<I(epsilon) = (pi/(5*9**(1/5)*sin(pi/5)))*epsilon**(-4/5)>>>"
