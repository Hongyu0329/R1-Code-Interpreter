    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe test for simple algebraic roots. Let's try $x=\\sqrt{2}$.\n$f(\\sqrt{2}) = (\\sqrt{2})^7 - 2(\\sqrt{2})^5 - 9(\\sqrt{2})^3 + 3(\\sqrt{2})^2 + 18(\\sqrt{2}) - 6$\n$= 8\\sqrt{2} - 2(4\\sqrt{2}) - 9(2\\sqrt{2}) + 3(2) + 18\\sqrt{2} - 6$\n$= 8\\sqrt{2} - 8\\sqrt{2} - 18\\sqrt{2} + 6 + 18\\sqrt{2} - 6 = 0$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root and the coefficients of $f(x)$ are rational, its conjugate $-\\sqrt{2}$ must also be a root.\nThus, $(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2}) = x^2 - 2$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\nWe perform polynomial long division to find the other factor:\n$(x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6) \\div (x^2 - 2) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nSo, we have the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields**\nLet $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe polynomial $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a Galois extension with $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$.\n\nThe polynomial $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=3$:\n- $3$ does not divide the leading coefficient $1$.\n- $3$ divides the other coefficients $0, 0, -9, 3$.\n- $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term $3$.\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $g(x)$**\nThe Galois group of $g(x)$, let's call it $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$ because $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5.\nTo identify the group, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\n$g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the real roots of $5x^4=9$, which are $x = \\pm (9/5)^{1/4}$.\nLet $x_0 = (9/5)^{1/4}$. The values of $g(x)$ at the critical points are:\n$g(x_0) = x_0^5 - 9x_0 + 3 = (9/5)x_0 - 9x_0 + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}x_0$. Since $1 < x_0 < 2$, $g(x_0) < 3 - 36/5 < 0$.\n$g(-x_0) = (-x_0)^5 - 9(-x_0) + 3 = -x_0^5 + 9x_0 + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}x_0 > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots. The other two roots are a complex conjugate pair.\nAn irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has Galois group $S_5$.\nThus, $G_g \\cong S_5$, and $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors: $K = K_h K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})K_g$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}][K_g:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_h \\cap K_g : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nWe need to determine the intersection $K_h \\cap K_g$. $K_h=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. The intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\n$K_g$ is a Galois extension with Galois group $S_5$. Its subfields correspond to subgroups of $S_5$. Quadratic subfields correspond to normal subgroups of index 2. The only normal subgroup of $S_5$ of index 2 is $A_5$. Thus, $K_g$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (1-n)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4(-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe unique quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nFor this to be equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $-14863419 / 2$ to be a square of a rational number, which is impossible as it's negative.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subseteq K_g$, and the intersection is $K_h \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince both $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ are Galois extensions and their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of their Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=240$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the degrees of normal intermediate fields**\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these degrees are $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$ where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\nWe need to find all such normal subgroups $H$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include:\n1.  **Product subgroups**: $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$.\n    The proper, non-trivial product normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n    - $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: order $2$. Index $240/2 = 120$.\n    - $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: order $60$. Index $240/60 = 4$.\n    - $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: order $120$. Index $240/120 = 2$.\n    - $C_2 \\times A_5$: order $2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index $240/120 = 2$.\n2.  **Diagonal subgroups**: These arise when the factors $G_1, G_2$ have a common quotient group. Here, $C_2$ and $S_5$ share the common quotient group $C_2$ (since $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$). This gives rise to another normal subgroup. Let $c$ be the non-identity element of $C_2$.\n    - $N = \\{(x, g) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g)=1 \\text{ if } x=e, \\text{ and } \\text{sgn}(g)=-1 \\text{ if } x=c\\}$. This can be written as $N = (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cup (\\{c\\} \\times (S_5 \\setminus A_5))$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$. Its index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe orders of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are 2, 60, and 120.\nThe possible degrees of the corresponding normal intermediate extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups:\n- For subgroups of order 2, the degree is $240/2 = 120$.\n- For subgroups of order 60, the degree is $240/60 = 4$.\n- For subgroups of order 120, the degree is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThus, the set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
