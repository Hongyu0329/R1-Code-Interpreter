    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Molecule:** The starting molecule is glucose. It is specifically labeled with the heavy isotope of carbon, ¹³C, at positions 1 and 4. We can represent this as 1,4-¹³C glucose.\n    *   Glucose is a 6-carbon sugar. The carbons are numbered C1 to C6.\n    *   In this molecule: C1 is ¹³C, C2 is ¹²C, C3 is ¹²C, C4 is ¹³C, C5 is ¹²C, and C6 is ¹²C.\n\n2.  **Identify the Metabolic Pathway:** The molecule undergoes glycolysis.\n\n3.  **Define Glycolysis:** Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. It is a sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions.\n    *   The overall chemical equation for glycolysis is:\n        Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate (C₃H₃O₃⁻) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\n4.  **Analyze the Carbon Balance of Glycolysis:** The key to answering this question is to look at what happens to the carbon atoms during the pathway.\n    *   The starting molecule, glucose, has 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final products of glycolysis are two molecules of pyruvate. Each pyruvate molecule has 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of carbon atoms in the products is 2 molecules × 3 carbons/molecule = 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   Since the number of carbon atoms at the start (6 in glucose) is equal to the total number of carbon atoms at the end (6 in two pyruvates), no carbon atoms are lost during the process.\n\n5.  **Check for CO₂ Production in Glycolysis:** The release of CO₂ is a type of reaction called decarboxylation, where a carboxyl group (-COOH) is removed from a molecule, releasing a carbon atom as CO₂. We need to check if any of the 10 steps of glycolysis involve a decarboxylation reaction.\n    *   Step 1: Phosphorylation (Hexokinase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 2: Isomerization (Phosphoglucose isomerase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 3: Phosphorylation (Phosphofructokinase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 4: Cleavage (Aldolase) - No CO₂ release. (A 6C molecule becomes two 3C molecules).\n    *   Step 5: Isomerization (Triose phosphate isomerase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 6: Oxidation and Phosphorylation (G3P Dehydrogenase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 7: Substrate-level phosphorylation (Phosphoglycerate kinase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 8: Mutase reaction (Phosphoglycerate mutase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   Step 9: Dehydration (Enolase) - No CO₂ release. (Water is removed, not CO₂).\n    *   Step 10: Substrate-level phosphorylation (Pyruvate kinase) - No CO₂ release.\n    *   **Conclusion:** None of the reactions in the glycolytic pathway release CO₂.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The question asks how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released. Since glycolysis does not release *any* CO₂ molecules at all, the number of labeled CO₂ molecules released must be zero.\n\n### Careful Points and Potential Traps\n\n*   **Distractor Information:** The labeling of the glucose at positions C1 and C4 is critical information for problems involving pathways *after* glycolysis (like the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction or the citric acid cycle), where decarboxylation does occur. For a question strictly about glycolysis, this information is a distractor. One must know that glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂.\n*   **Scope of the Question:** It is crucial to interpret \"goes through glycolysis\" literally. It refers to the specific pathway from glucose to pyruvate. It does not imply subsequent steps like fermentation or aerobic respiration unless explicitly stated.\n    *   *For context (but not for the answer):* If the process continued to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction (Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + CO₂), the CO₂ would come from the C1 (carboxyl) carbon of pyruvate. The tracing of the ¹³C labels shows that 1,4-¹³C glucose produces one pyruvate labeled at C1 and one pyruvate labeled at C3. Therefore, this subsequent step would release exactly one molecule of ¹³CO₂. However, this is outside the scope of the question asked.\n\n### Final Conclusion based on Analysis\n\nThe process is glycolysis. Glycolysis converts a 6-carbon glucose molecule into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. There is no loss of carbon atoms in this pathway. Therefore, no CO₂ is produced during glycolysis. Consequently, no ¹³C-labeled CO₂ can be released.\n\n<<<0>>>"
