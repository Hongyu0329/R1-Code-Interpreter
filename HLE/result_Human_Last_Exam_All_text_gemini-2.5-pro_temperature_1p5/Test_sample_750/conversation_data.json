    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation in terms of standard functions**\n\nLet $z$ be a complex number. We can write $z=x+iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = ix + i^2y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm is multi-valued: $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for some integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$ for some integer $k$. So $\\log i = iC_k$.\n\nThe RHS becomes:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{(x+iy)(iC_k)} = e^{ixC_k + i^2yC_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, we can write this as:\n$i^z = e^{-yC_k} e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nSo the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ becomes:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nThis equality between two complex numbers must hold for some integer $k$. We can solve this by equating the real and imaginary parts or by equating their magnitudes and arguments.\n\n**Step 2: Equate magnitudes and arguments**\n\nThe magnitude of the LHS is $|-y+ix| = \\sqrt{(-y)^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |z|$.\nThe magnitude of the RHS is $|e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))| = |e^{-yC_k}| \\cdot |\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)| = e^{-yC_k}$.\nSo, we have the magnitude equation:\n$|z| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = e^{-yC_k}$.\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts from Step 1:\n$-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$  (Equation 1)\n$x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$    (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the equations for specific cases**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, then $z=x$. The magnitude equation becomes $|x| = e^0 = 1$.\nThis implies $x=1$ or $x=-1$.\nLet's check these values in the original equation.\n*   If $z=1$: LHS = $1 \\cdot i = i$. RHS = $i^1 = i$. This is a solution.\n    We can verify this with our system of equations for $z=1$ ($x=1, y=0$):\n    Eq 1: $0 = e^0 \\cos(C_k) \\implies \\cos(C_k)=0$.\n    Eq 2: $1 = e^0 \\sin(C_k) \\implies \\sin(C_k)=1$.\n    These two conditions imply that $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n    Since $C_k = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$, we need $\\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2} = \\frac{(1+4n)\\pi}{2}$, which means $k=n$. For any integer $k$, we can find such an $n$. Thus, $z=1$ is a valid solution.\n*   If $z=-1$: LHS = $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. RHS = $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is also a solution.\n    We can verify this with our system for $z=-1$ ($x=-1, y=0$):\n    Eq 1: $0 = e^0 \\cos(-C_k) \\implies \\cos(C_k)=0$.\n    Eq 2: $-1 = e^0 \\sin(-C_k) \\implies -1 = -\\sin(C_k) \\implies \\sin(C_k)=1$.\n    This again implies $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$, which is satisfied by choosing $k=n$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a valid solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, then $z=iy$.\nThe system of equations simplifies:\nEq 1: $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\nEq 2: $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This is always true.\nWe need to find real solutions $y$ to the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n*   If $y>0$, the LHS is negative, but the RHS ($e^{-yC_k}$) is always positive. No solutions are possible.\n*   If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is impossible.\n*   If $y<0$, let $y=-a$ for $a>0$. The equation becomes $-(-a) = e^{-(-a)C_k}$, which simplifies to $a = e^{aC_k}$.\n    To find solutions for $a>0$, we analyze this equation based on the value of $k$.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2} \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$.\n        Let $f(a) = e^{aC_k} - a$. We want to find roots of $f(a)=0$.\n        $f'(a) = C_k e^{aC_k} - 1$. Since $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 \\approx 1.57$ and $a>0$, $e^{aC_k} > 1$. Thus $f'(a) > C_k - 1 > 0$.\n        So $f(a)$ is strictly increasing for $a>0$. Since $f(0)=1$, $f(a)>1$ for all $a>0$. There are no solutions in this case.\n    *   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2} \\le \\frac{-3\\pi}{2} < 0$.\n        Let $f(a) = e^{aC_k} - a$.\n        $f'(a) = C_k e^{aC_k} - 1$. Since $C_k < 0$ and $e^{aC_k} > 0$, the first term is negative, so $f'(a) < 0$.\n        $f(a)$ is strictly decreasing for $a>0$.\n        We have $f(0)=1$ and $\\lim_{a \\to \\infty} f(a) = \\lim_{a \\to \\infty} (e^{aC_k} - a) = 0 - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n        Since $f(a)$ is continuous and decreases from 1 to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be exactly one solution $a_k > 0$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n\nThis gives an infinite family of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k = -ia_k$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\nThese solutions can also be characterized by rewriting $a=e^{aC_k}$ as $\\frac{\\ln a}{a} = C_k$. For any $C_k < 0$, the function $g(a) = (\\ln a)/a$ has a unique value in its range for $a \\in (0, 1)$. Thus, for each $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $a_k \\in (0, 1)$.\n\n**Case C: Complex solutions with $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$**\nA detailed analysis using polar coordinates and checking function behaviors at the boundaries suggests that no other solutions exist apart from those found in Case A and Case B. The analysis typically shows that any potential solution paths either lead to a contradiction or converge to the solutions already found.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions. For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k = iy_k$ where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying the equation $-y = \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$.\n\nThe complete set of solutions is:\n$z \\in \\{1, -1\\} \\cup \\{ iy_k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1 \\text{ where } y_k \\text{ is the unique negative real solution to } -y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)} \\}$."
