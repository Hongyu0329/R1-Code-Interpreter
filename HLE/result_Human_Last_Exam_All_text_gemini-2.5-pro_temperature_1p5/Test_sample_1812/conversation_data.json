    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary goal is to compute the determinant of a given 3x3 matrix, denoted as A.\n\n2.  **Identify the Matrix:** The matrix is explicitly provided in the question:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contextual Information:** The question mentions \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   A **quiver** is a directed graph. Its **adjacency matrix** represents the connections.\n    *   The **Markov equation** is \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \\), and its integer solutions are related to a mathematical structure that can be described using quivers and cluster algebras.\n    *   The term \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) likely refers to a specific element or parameter within the theory of Markov numbers or related fields.\n    *   **Crucially**, the problem does not ask us to derive the matrix from this information. Instead, it *defines* the matrix `A` for us. Therefore, this contextual information, while interesting, is not needed for the calculation itself. We can treat it as background information that specifies which matrix we are working with. The problem boils down to calculating the determinant of the matrix `A` as given.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Focus on the Given Matrix:** Do not get distracted by the terminology \"Markov quiver\" or the specific value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\). The matrix `A` is explicitly defined, and that is the only object we need to analyze.\n2.  **Choose an Efficient Method:** There are several standard methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    *   The Rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.\n    *   Using row or column operations to simplify the matrix to a triangular form.\n    *   Checking for linear dependence among the rows or columns.\n3.  **Accuracy in Calculation:** Whichever method is chosen, arithmetic must be performed carefully. A small error can lead to a completely different result.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nWe will use two different methods to compute the determinant and verify the result.\n\n**Method 1: Checking for Linear Dependence (Most Efficient)**\n\n*   **Concept:** The determinant of a square matrix is zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent. Linear dependence means that one column can be written as a linear combination of the others, or equivalently, that a non-trivial linear combination of the columns equals the zero vector.\n*   **Application:** Let's denote the columns of matrix `A` as \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\).\n    \\[\n    C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   Let's check if their sum is the zero vector:\n    \\[\n    C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   Since \\(C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\mathbf{0}\\), the columns are linearly dependent.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the determinant of matrix `A` must be 0.\n\n**Method 2: Cofactor Expansion (Standard Formula)**\n\n*   **Concept:** For a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[\n    M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    the determinant is \\( \\det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n*   **Application:** For our matrix `A`, we have:\n    *   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n    *   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n    *   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n*   **Calculation:**\n    \\begin{align*} \\det(A) &= 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1 \\cdot ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1 \\cdot ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 - (-2)) \\\\ &= 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3) \\\\ &= 6 - 3 - 3 \\\\ &= 0 \\end{align*}\n*   **Conclusion:** This method confirms that the determinant of `A` is 0.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The information regarding the Markov quiver simply serves to identify the matrix in question.\n\n<<<0>>>"
