    "Answering this question requires finding the maximum possible density $c$ of a subset $A$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem and formalizing it.\nLet $S = \\{k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$ be the set of perfect squares. We are looking for a subset $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$. We want to find the maximum value of $c$ such that there exists such a set $A$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$, which means $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a lower bound for c using modular arithmetic.\nA powerful method to construct such a set $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. Let's fix a modulus $m$. We can define $A$ as the set of integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that fall into a specific set of residue classes $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\nSo, $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$.\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum modulo $m$ will be in the set $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$.\n\nLet $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $m$. If we can choose $R$ and $m$ such that the set of residue classes of sums, $R+R$, and the set of residue classes of squares, $S_m$, are disjoint (i.e., $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$), then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the sum $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square. This is because if $a_1+a_2 = k^2$ for some integer $k$, then it would imply $(a_1+a_2) \\pmod m \\in S_m$. But we chose $R$ such that $(a_1+a_2) \\pmod m \\in R+R$, and we ensured $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe density of the set $A$ constructed this way is $|R|/m$. Our goal is to maximize this value.\n\nLet's test some moduli $m$:\n*   **Case m = 3:**\n    The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$, $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1$. So, $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    The set of non-squares modulo 3 is $\\{2\\}$.\n    We need to find a set $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n    If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This works, since $\\{2\\} \\cap \\{0, 1\\} = \\emptyset$.\n    The size of $R$ is 1. The density is $|R|/m = 1/3$.\n    So, we can take $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 = 2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to 2 mod 3, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a square.\n    The size of this set $A$ is approximately $N/3$. Thus, we have found a construction that shows $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Case m = 4:**\n    The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0, 1^2 \\equiv 1, 2^2 \\equiv 0, 3^2=9\\equiv 1$. So, $S_4 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    The non-squares are $\\{2, 3\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If $R = \\{r\\}$, then $2r \\in \\{2, 3\\}$. $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ implies $r=1$ or $r=3$.\n    If $R = \\{1\\}$, $R+R=\\{2\\}$. This works. Density is $1/4$.\n    If $R = \\{3\\}$, $R+R=\\{6\\} \\equiv \\{2\\}$. This works. Density is $1/4$.\n    If we try to find a larger set $R$, e.g., $R=\\{1,3\\}$, then $R+R=\\{2, 4\\equiv 0, 6\\equiv 2\\}=\\{0,2\\}$. But $0 \\in S_4$, so this doesn't work.\n    The maximum density from $m=4$ is $1/4$, which is less than $1/3$.\n\n*   **Case m = 9:**\n    The squares modulo 9 are $S_9 = \\{0^2,1^2,2^2,3^2,4^2\\} \\pmod 9=\\{0,1,4,0,16\\equiv 7\\}$, so $S_9 = \\{0, 1, 4, 7\\}$.\n    The non-squares are $\\{2, 3, 5, 6, 8\\}$. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3, 5, 6, 8\\}$.\n    Consider the set $R = \\{1, 4, 7\\}$. This set consists of all residues that are $1 \\pmod 3$.\n    Let's find the sumset $R+R$:\n    $1+1=2$, $1+4=5$, $1+7=8$\n    $4+4=8$, $4+7=11\\equiv 2$\n    $7+7=14\\equiv 5$\n    So, $R+R = \\{2, 5, 8\\}$. This is a subset of the non-squares modulo 9.\n    The size of $R$ is 3. The density is $|R|/m = 3/9 = 1/3$.\n    The set $A$ constructed from this choice is $\\{n \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1, 4, \\text{or } 7 \\pmod 9\\}$. This is exactly the same set as $\\{n \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. So this gives the same lower bound $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nThese constructions show that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Step 3: Arguing that 1/3 is the maximum value (upper bound).\nThis is the more difficult part of the analysis. A full rigorous proof is very advanced, relying on results from analytic number theory or ergodic theory (like extensions of Roth's Theorem). However, we can provide a strong heuristic argument.\n\nLet's see why it might be impossible to have $c>1/3$. Assume there is a set $A$ with density $c > 1/3$. Let's analyze the elements of $A$ based on their residues modulo 3. Let $A_i = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv i \\pmod 3\\}$ for $i=0, 1, 2$. Then $|A| = |A_0|+|A_1|+|A_2|$.\nThe sumset $A+A$ contains sums of the form $A_i+A_j = \\{a_i+a_j \\mid a_i \\in A_i, a_j \\in A_j\\}$.\nThe sums' residues modulo 3 are:\n*   $A_1+A_1 \\equiv 1+1 = 2 \\pmod 3$. These sums are never squares. (Safe)\n*   $A_0+A_2 \\equiv 0+2 = 2 \\pmod 3$. These sums are never squares. (Safe)\n*   $A_0+A_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Must avoid squares that are multiples of 3 (e.g., 9, 36, 81...).\n*   $A_2+A_2 \\equiv 2+2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Must avoid squares not divisible by 3 (e.g., 1, 4, 25...).\n*   $A_0+A_1 \\equiv 0+1 = 1 \\pmod 3$. Must avoid squares not divisible by 3.\n*   $A_1+A_2 \\equiv 1+2 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Must avoid squares that are multiples of 3.\n\nThe construction giving $c=1/3$ used only elements from $A_1$. Let's try to add an element $a \\in A_2$ to the set $A_1 = \\{n \\le N \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nThe sums $a_1+a$ with $a_1 \\in A_1$ must not be squares. The sum is $a_1+a \\equiv 1+2 = 0 \\pmod 3$. For such a sum to be a square, it must be of the form $(3k)^2 = 9k^2$.\nSo we need to check if $a_1+a = 9k^2$ has solutions with $a_1 \\in A_1$. This is equivalent to checking if $a_1 = 9k^2 - a$ is in $A_1$. For $a_1$ to be in $A_1$, it must satisfy $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Let's check the residue of $9k^2-a$:\nSince $a \\in A_2$, $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n$9k^2 - a \\equiv 0 - 2 \\equiv -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nSo, for any choice of $a \\in A_2$, and any integer $k$, the number $9k^2 - a$ is always congruent to 1 mod 3. For any sufficiently large $N$, we can choose $k$ such that $1 \\le 9k^2-a \\le N$. This means that $a_1 = 9k^2-a$ is an element of the full set $A_1=\\{n \\le N, n\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nThen, $a_1+a = (9k^2-a)+a = 9k^2=(3k)^2$, which is a square.\nThis means that if we take the entire set of numbers congruent to 1 mod 3, we cannot add any number congruent to 2 mod 3 without creating a square in the sumset (for large N).\n\nA similar argument shows that we cannot add any element $a \\in A_0$ to the full set $A_1$. For such a sum to be a square, we need $a_1+a = (3k\\pm1)^2$. We would need to check if $a_1 = (3k\\pm1)^2-a$ is in $A_1$. $a_1 \\pmod 3 \\equiv (1)^2-0 = 1 \\pmod 3$. So for any $a \\in A_0$, there is a potential conflict.\n\nThis indicates that the set $\\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ is 'maximal' in the sense that it cannot be augmented by any element from other residue classes without violating the square-free sumset condition. While this is not a complete proof that no other construction could yield a higher density, it provides very strong evidence. More advanced results in number theory confirm that any set of integers with upper density greater than 0 must contain a solution to $x+y=k^2$, unless it's specifically constructed to avoid it (like by residue classes). These arguments lead to the conclusion that a density of $1/3$ cannot be exceeded.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe construction using numbers congruent to 1 mod 3 gives a set $A$ with density $c=1/3$ such that $A+A$ has no squares. Arguments based on number theory suggest that this density cannot be improved upon. Therefore, the largest such number $c$ is $1/3$."
