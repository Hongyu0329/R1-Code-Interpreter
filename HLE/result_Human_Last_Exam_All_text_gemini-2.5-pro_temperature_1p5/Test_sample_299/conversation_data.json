    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Properties of the Function `f`\n\nLet the given functional equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying the function $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $y = e^x$ is strictly increasing, it is injective (one-to-one). Therefore, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    This shows that $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f:**\n    A key theorem in real analysis states that a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We can analyze these two cases separately.\n\n### Step 2: Case Analysis based on Monotonicity\n\n**Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing.**\n\n1.  **Existence of a Fixed Point:**\n    Let's consider if $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    Define a new function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous, $g(x)$ is also continuous.\n    Since $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing, for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.\n    Consider $g(x_1) - g(x_2) = (f(x_1) - x_1) - (f(x_2) - x_2) = (f(x_1) - f(x_2)) - (x_1 - x_2)$.\n    Since $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ and $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) - f(x_2) > 0$ and $-(x_1-x_2) > 0$. Thus, $g(x_1) > g(x_2)$, which means $g(x)$ is also strictly decreasing.\n\n2.  **Limits of `g(x)`:**\n    As $x \\to \\infty$, $x$ grows without bound. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ is either a finite constant or $-\\infty$. In either scenario, $g(x) = f(x) - x \\to -\\infty$.\n    As $x \\to -\\infty$, $-x$ grows without bound. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ is either a finite constant or $+\\infty$. In either scenario, $g(x) = f(x) - x \\to +\\infty$.\n\n3.  **Contradiction:**\n    Since $g(x)$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ with $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = -\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, the range of $g(x)$ is all of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, there must exist a unique $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0) = 0$.\n    This implies $f(x_0) - x_0 = 0$, so $f(x_0) = x_0$. This unique point $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n\n    Now, let's use the original equation at this fixed point:\n    $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$.\n    Since $f(x_0) = x_0$, we have $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    This leads to the equation $x_0 = e^{x_0}$.\n\n    However, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions. This can be seen by analyzing the function $h(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $h'(x) = e^x - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. The minimum value of $h(x)$ is at $x=0$, which is $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. So, $e^x - x \\ge 1 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are **no strictly decreasing continuous functions** that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing.**\n\n1.  **Properties of `f` in this case:**\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f(f(x))$ is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with the right-hand side, $e^x$, which is strictly increasing.\n\n2.  **Range of `f`:**\n    For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(f(x)) = e^x > 0$. Let $y = f(x)$. Then $y$ is a value in the range of $f$. The equation implies that for any $y$ in the range of $f$, we have $f(y) > 0$.\n    Since $f$ is continuous, if it ever took a non-positive value, its range would have to include non-positive numbers. But we've just shown that $f$ must be positive on its range. Let's see if $f$ can be non-positive anywhere. Assume $f(z) \\le 0$ for some $z$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, its range is an open interval. Let the range be $(a,b)$. Then $f(y) > 0$ for all $y \\in (a,b)$. This implies $a \\ge 0$. So the range of $f$ is a subset of $(0, \\infty)$. Therefore, $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Construction of Solutions:**\n    We can construct solutions by defining $f$ on a specific interval and then extending the definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the given equation.\n    *   Let $f(0) = a$. Then $f(f(0)) = f(a) = e^0 = 1$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $0 < a$, we must have $f(0) < f(a)$, which implies $a < 1$. Also, since $f(x) > 0$, we have $a > 0$. So, $a \\in (0, 1)$.\n    *   The construction proceeds as follows:\n        1.  **Choose `a`**: Pick any real number $a \\in (0, 1)$. This value will be $f(0)$.\n        2.  **Define `f` on `[0, a]`**: Define $f$ on the interval $[0, a]$ to be any strictly increasing continuous function $g(x)$ such that $g(0) = a$ and $g(a) = 1$.\n        3.  **Extend `f`**: Now, we can extend this definition to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n            *   For $x \\in [a, 1]$, $x$ can be written as $x=g(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [0, a]$. We must define $f(x) = f(g(t)) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{g^{-1}(x)}$. This defines $f$ on $[a, 1]$.\n            *   For $x \\in [1, e^a]$, $x$ can be written as $x = f(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [a, 1]$. We must define $f(x) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{f^{-1}(x)}$.\n            *   This process can be continued indefinitely to cover all positive numbers. We can also extend it to negative numbers. For example, for $x \\in [\\ln a, 0)$, $e^x \\in [a, 1)$, so we can define $f(x) = g^{-1}(e^x)$.\n\n4.  **Cardinality of the Set of Solutions:**\n    A unique solution is generated by:\n    a) The choice of the number $a \\in (0, 1)$. The set of possible values for $a$ is the interval $(0, 1)$, which has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., of $\\mathbb{R}$).\n    b) For a fixed $a$, the choice of the strictly increasing continuous function $g: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ with $g(0)=a, g(a)=1$.\n        *   Let's find the cardinality of the set of these functions $g$. Consider a point $x_0 \\in (0, a)$, for instance $x_0 = a/2$. The value $g(x_0)$ must satisfy $g(0) < g(x_0) < g(a)$, so $a < g(x_0) < 1$. We can choose $g(x_0)$ to be any value $y_0$ in the interval $(a, 1)$. For each such choice of $y_0$, we can define a valid function $g$ by, for example, connecting the points $(0, a)$, $(x_0, y_0)$, and $(a, 1)$ with two line segments. Since the interval $(a, 1)$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ different choices for the function $g$.\n        *   The total number of continuous functions from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. So, the number of choices for $g$ is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n        *   Therefore, for each choice of $a$, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $g$.\n\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $a$ and the number of choices for $g$.\n    Total Cardinality = (Number of choices for $a$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $g$ for a fixed $a$)\n    Total Cardinality = $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** The function $f$ must be one-to-one because its composition with itself, $e^x$, is one-to-one.\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This is a crucial theorem that splits the problem into two distinct cases.\n3.  **Fixed Point Argument:** The argument for the non-existence of decreasing solutions relies on proving that any such function must have a unique fixed point $x_0$, which would then have to satisfy the impossible equation $x_0 = e^{x_0}$.\n4.  **Positivity:** For increasing solutions, $f(x)$ must be strictly positive for all $x$. This is because the range of $f \\circ f$ is $(0, \\infty)$, which forces the range of $f$ to be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$.\n5.  **Constructive Proof:** The existence of increasing solutions is demonstrated by construction. The construction highlights the degrees of freedom available.\n6.  **Cardinality Calculation:** The final cardinality is determined by counting the number of choices available in the construction. The result relies on the cardinality properties of the real numbers, namely that the interval $(0,1)$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, and the set of continuous functions on an interval also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Finally, we use the cardinal arithmetic rule $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions. However, there is a set of strictly increasing continuous solutions whose cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is therefore $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
