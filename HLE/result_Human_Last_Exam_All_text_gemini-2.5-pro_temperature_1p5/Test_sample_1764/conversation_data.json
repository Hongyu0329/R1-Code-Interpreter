    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the terms\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space over the field of real or complex numbers. Its cardinality is denoted by $K$. Note that if the dimension of $B$ is greater than 0, its cardinality $K$ is at least continuum ($c=|\\mathbb{R}|$). If the dimension is 0, $B = \\{0\\}$ and $K=1$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, meaning for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$ holds, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the norm in $B$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where $N(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$, and the minimum is taken over all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all possible Banach spaces $B$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the possible values for the number of embeddings\n\nThe number of embeddings, $N(X, B)$, must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value must be greater than or equal to zero. Let's investigate if the number of embeddings can be zero.\n\n### Step 3: Search for a case where the number of embeddings is zero\n\nTo show that the minimum is 0, we need to find at least one pair $(X, B)$ where $X$ is a finite ultrametric space and $B$ is a Banach space, for which there are no isometric embeddings.\n\nLet's select a specific Banach space and a specific finite ultrametric space.\n\n1.  **Choose a Banach space B:** Let's take the simplest non-trivial Banach space, the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value as the norm, i.e., $B = (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$. This is a Banach space of cardinality $K=c$.\n\n2.  **Choose a finite ultrametric space X:** Let's consider a simple ultrametric space. An equilateral space is a space where the distance between any two distinct points is the same constant. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ be a set of three points. Define the distance $d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$, and $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$.\n    *   **Is this an ultrametric space?** We must check the strong triangle inequality: for any distinct $i,j,k$, we have $d(x_i, x_k) = 1$ and $\\max(d(x_i, x_j), d(x_j, x_k)) = \\max(1, 1) = 1$. Since $1 \\le 1$, the inequality holds. So, this space is indeed a finite ultrametric space.\n\n3.  **Attempt to find an isometric embedding:** An isometric embedding of this $X$ into $B=\\mathbb{R}$ would be a function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$. Let $y_1 = f(x_1)$, $y_2 = f(x_2)$, and $y_3 = f(x_3)$. The isometry condition requires that for all $i \\neq j$:\n    $\\|f(x_i) - f(x_j)\\| = d(x_i, x_j) = 1$.\n    This means we need to find three points $y_1, y_2, y_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n    $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$\n    $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$\n    $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$\n\n4.  **Show that no such embedding exists:** Let's try to place these points on the real line.\n    *   Without loss of generality, we can translate our configuration so that $y_1 = 0$.\n    *   From $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$, we have $|0 - y_2| = 1$, which means $y_2$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n    *   From $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$, we have $|0 - y_3| = 1$, which means $y_3$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n    *   Now we must satisfy the third condition, $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$. Let's check the possibilities for $y_2$ and $y_3$:\n        *   Case 1: $y_2 = 1$ and $y_3 = 1$. Then $|y_2 - y_3| = |1 - 1| = 0 \\neq 1$.\n        *   Case 2: $y_2 = 1$ and $y_3 = -1$. Then $|y_2 - y_3| = |1 - (-1)| = 2 \\neq 1$.\n        *   Case 3: $y_2 = -1$ and $y_3 = 1$. Then $|y_2 - y_3| = |-1 - 1| = 2 \\neq 1$.\n        *   Case 4: $y_2 = -1$ and $y_3 = -1$. Then $|y_2 - y_3| = |-1 - (-1)| = 0 \\neq 1$.\n    In all possible cases, the condition $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$ is not satisfied. Therefore, there are no such three points in $\\mathbb{R}$. This proves that there is no isometric embedding of this particular space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the minimum value\n\n*   We have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings $N(X, B)$ is exactly 0.\n*   The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer.\n*   Since we have found a situation where the number is 0, and it cannot be smaller than 0, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Generality:** The argument does not depend on the specific choice of the distance (we could have chosen any $d>0$) or the specific Banach space (other choices like $B=\\mathbb{R}^2$ with certain norms, or even $B=\\mathbb{C}$, can be shown to fail for a 4-point equilateral space).\n*   **Implicit assumptions:** The question is phrased in a way that does not presuppose the existence of such embeddings. It simply asks what is the smallest possible number. If the question intended to ask for the minimum non-zero number of embeddings, it would have been phrased differently, e.g., \"Given that an isometric embedding exists...\".\n*   **Is 1 a possible number?** Yes. For $X = \\{x_0\\}$ (a single point space) and $B = \\{0\\}$ (the trivial Banach space of cardinality $K=1$), there is exactly one function $f:X \\to B$, and it is an isometric embedding. So, 1 is a possible number of embeddings. However, since 0 is also a possible number, 0 is the minimum.\n\nFinal conclusion remains that the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
