    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré derrière is a fundamental ballet movement involving a bend of the upper body backward from the waist. The goal is to create an elegant arch in the back while maintaining balance and proper alignment according to the specific technique being used.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Vaganova Method's Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, emphasizes precision, strength, and a harmonious coordination of the entire body. Key points for a Vaganova cambré derrière include:\n*   **Hip Stability:** The primary rule is to keep the hips square and directly over the supporting leg(s). Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the vertical alignment and is believed to place undue stress on the lower back.\n*   **Initiation:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum toward the ceiling before arching back.\n*   **Alignment:** The body is meant to maintain a clean, unbroken line. The strength of the core and back extensors is used to control the bend without displacing the pelvis.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Balanchine Method's Approach**\nThe Balanchine method, or Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, musicality, and neoclassical lines. It often extends and exaggerates classical positions for greater dynamic and visual effect. Key points for a Balanchine cambré derrière include:\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the most significant point of divergence. To achieve a deeper, more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine technique deliberately instructs the dancer to **push the hips forward**.\n*   **Aesthetic Goal:** This forward displacement of the hips acts as a counterbalance, allowing the upper body to bend further back and creating a distinct, sweeping, \"broken\" line that is a hallmark of the style.\n*   **Dynamics:** The movement often has a quicker, more \"off-balance\" quality, which is intentional.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nLet's analyze the given choices based on the comparison above:\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be stylistic nuances in the arms (port de bras), the fundamental placement and movement of the arms (e.g., opening from fifth to second) is similar. The *quality* of the allongé might differ, but it's not the primary structural difference.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most crucial and defining difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and back, while Balanchine requires pushing the hips forward. This is a fundamental divergence in the mechanics of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré in either technique can be performed at various tempos depending on the music and choreography. Speed is a quality of performance, not a core technical difference in how the position is formed.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. The Balanchine hip placement facilitates a visually deeper backbend, but a highly flexible Vaganova dancer can also achieve a deep bend while maintaining correct hip alignment. The core difference is *how* the bend is achieved, which is through the hip placement.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. The principle is the same. The exact angle may differ slightly due to the overall depth of the bend, but it's not the foundational technical difference.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe most fundamental, taught, and visually distinct difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the intentional forward thrust of the hips in the Balanchine style versus the stable, non-displaced hips in the Vaganova technique.\n\n<<<B>>>"
