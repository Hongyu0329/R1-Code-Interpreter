    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo each prime power factor of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThere are two main conditions on $\\chi$ that we need to satisfy:\n1.  **Conductor:** The conductor of $\\chi$ is $N$. This is true if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a *primitive* character modulo $p^k$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is $6$. The order of the product character is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n    $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing Each Component Character**\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$, must be a divisor of 6. Let $n_d(m)$ denote the number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $d$. We need to find these numbers for our factors.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has two characters: the principal character of order 1 (conductor 1) and a non-principal character of order 2. A character modulo 4 is primitive if its conductor is 4. The principal character is not primitive. The character of order 2 is primitive.\n    So, for $\\chi_4$, it must be primitive, meaning its order must be 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: $n_2(4) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. There are $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The characters that are not primitive are induced by characters modulo 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters (of order 1 and 2).\n    The remaining $6-2=4$ characters are primitive modulo 9. The orders of characters in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. Since the imprimitive characters have orders 1 and 2, the primitive characters must have orders 3 and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(9) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(9) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders, 3 and 6, divide 6. So the total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it's not the principal character.\n    The possible orders of primitive characters are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$, except 1. So, orders can be 2, 3, 6. All of these divide 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10, except 1. So, orders can be 2, 5, 10.\n    We need the order to divide 6. Of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$ is 1.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12, except 1. So, orders can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are {2, 3, 6}.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $n_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $n_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $n_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**Step 4: Combining the results**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nFrom our analysis in Step 3, the possible orders for each primitive component (that also divide 6) are:\n- $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4) \\in \\{2\\}$\n- $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9) \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n- $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n- $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}) \\in \\{2\\}$\n- $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet $L$ be the lcm of the orders. Since every possible order for each component divides 6, their lcm, $L$, must also divide 6.\nNow let's check if $L$ must be 6.\n- The choice for $\\chi_4$ requires its order to be 2. So, $2$ must divide $L$.\n- Any choice for $\\chi_9$ requires its order to be 3 or 6. In either case, its order is a multiple of 3. So, $3$ must divide $L$.\n\nSince $L$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nWe have shown $L | 6$ and $6 | L$, which means $L=6$ for any combination of allowed choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5.\n\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
