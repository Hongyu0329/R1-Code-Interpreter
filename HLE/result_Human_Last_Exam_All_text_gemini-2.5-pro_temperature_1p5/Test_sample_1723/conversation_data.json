    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a single, specific mushroom *genus* based on one unique characteristic: a \"distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n2.  **Understand Key Terms:**\n    *   **Genus:** A formal rank in the taxonomic classification of organisms, sitting above species and below family.\n    *   **Spore Print:** A deposit of microscopic spores from a mushroom's gills or pores, collected on a surface. The color of the print is a crucial feature for identification and is generally consistent across a genus.\n    *   **Distinctly Blue:** This specifies the color. Most spore prints are in shades of white, cream, pink, brown, or black. Blue is extremely unusual.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A frequent point of confusion is the Indigo Milk Cap, whose scientific name is *Lactarius indigo* (or *Lactifluus indigo*). While the mushroom itself—its cap, gills, and the \"milk\" or latex it bleeds—is a striking indigo blue, its **spore print is actually yellowish-white to cream-colored**. Therefore, the genus *Lactarius* (or *Lactifluus*) is incorrect.\n    *   Other mushrooms can be vividly blue, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri* from New Zealand. However, the entire *Entoloma* genus is characterized by a pink to pinkish-brown spore print.\n    *   Some species in the massive genus *Cortinarius* are also violet-blue, but all *Cortinarius* species produce a rusty-brown spore print.\n\n4.  **Research the Specific Trait:** A search through mycological literature for the extremely rare trait of a blue spore print leads to a particular group of fungi. While most mycologists state that a pure blue spore print is virtually non-existent, there is one genus where species have been officially described as having blue, or at least strongly blue-tinted, spore prints.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Genus:** This research points to the genus **Calocybe**.\n    *   The species *Calocybe blematosa* (which has also been placed in the genus *Rugosomyces*) is specifically described in mycological literature as producing a sky-blue spore print.\n    *   Another species, *Calocybe fallax*, has been described as having a spore print that is white with a notable lilac or pale blue tint.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the documented evidence of blue-spored species within it, and the lack of credible candidates in other genera, *Calocybe* is the single genus known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Spore Print vs. Mushroom Color:** The most critical point is to differentiate the color of the spores themselves from the color of the mushroom's fruiting body or any liquid it exudes.\n*   **Genus vs. Species:** The question asks for the genus, not a specific species. The answer is *Calocybe*, which contains the species with the blue spore print.\n*   **Rarity:** This is an exceptionally rare characteristic, which is why it is often a point of confusion and a good trivia question. Most field guides will not list \"blue\" as a standard spore print color.\n*   **Taxonomic Fluidity:** The species *Calocybe blematosa* has been moved between genera (*Calocybe*, *Rugosomyces*, *Lyophyllum*). However, *Calocybe* is the most common and accepted modern placement for the group containing species with this trait.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can confidently identify the correct genus.\n\n<<<Calocybe>>>"
