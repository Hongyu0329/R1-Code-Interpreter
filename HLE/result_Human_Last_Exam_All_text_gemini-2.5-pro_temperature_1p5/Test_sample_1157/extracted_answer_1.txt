The appropriate management involves a multi-phased approach, starting with immediate medical referral to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) and stabilize her systemic health. Emergency dental care includes wound debridement of the avulsed tooth sockets (#22, #23, #24), suturing, and prescription of antibiotics and analgesics. An interim removable denture should be provided for aesthetics during the healing phase.

The cells of interest in the healing process are neutrophils and macrophages (for immune response), and fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells (for tissue regeneration), all of which are negatively impacted by uncontrolled diabetes. The periodontal ligament (PDL) cells of the avulsed teeth are necrotic.

For definitive replacement, the most appropriate choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy framework** with acrylic base and teeth. This is the safest and most predictable option given her systemic condition and Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88Â°).

The **abutment teeth** for this RPD would be:
1.  **Left Second Premolar:** As the primary abutment adjacent to the gap.
2.  **Right Canine and Right First Molar:** As secondary abutments for cross-arch stabilization.
**Reasoning:** This tripod design provides essential support, stability, and retention, preventing rotational forces and ensuring the denture is functional and comfortable, which is especially important given the challenging Class III occlusion.
