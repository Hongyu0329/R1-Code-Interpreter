    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object X**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension $2$.\n*   As a real manifold, $X$ has dimension 4.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the homotopy groups of X to its complement**\nLet $U = \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X$ be the complement of $X$. Let $N$ be the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We can take a tubular neighborhood $T$ of $X$, which is diffeomorphic to the total space of $N$. The boundary of this neighborhood is the sphere bundle $S(N)$.\nThe complement $U$ deformation retracts onto the boundary of the tubular neighborhood, so $\\pi_k(U) \\cong \\pi_k(S(N))$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, consider the long exact sequence in homotopy for the sphere bundle fibration $S^1 \\to S(N) \\to X$. Note that the fiber is $S^1$ because the normal bundle $N$ is a complex line bundle.\nThe sequence is:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(S^1) \\to \\pi_k(S(N)) \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(S^1) \\to \\dots $$\nFor $k=3$, we look at the segment:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_3(S^1) \\to \\pi_3(S(N)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_2(S^1) \\to \\dots $$\nSince $\\pi_3(S^1) = 0$ and $\\pi_2(S^1) = 0$, this part of the sequence becomes:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_3(S(N)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that the map $\\pi_3(S(N)) \\to \\pi_3(X)$ is an isomorphism.\nCombining with the deformation retraction, we get a key relation:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(S(N)) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X) $$\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the rank of $\\pi_3$ of the complement of $X$.\n\n**Step 3: State the relevant theorem**\nThere is a known result in the topology of algebraic varieties, due to Libgober, concerning the homotopy groups of complements of hypersurfaces. For a smooth surface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ of degree $d \\ge 5$, the third homotopy group of its complement, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X)$, is a free abelian group whose rank is given by $b_2(X) - 1$, where $b_2(X)$ is the second Betti number of $X$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X)) = b_2(X) - 1 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the second Betti number, $b_2(X)$**\nTo find $b_2(X)$, we can first compute the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$.\nThe Euler characteristic of a smooth hypersurface of dimension $n-1$ is given by integrating its second Chern class: $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_{n-1}(T_X)$. For a surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, this is $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$.\n\nThe Chern classes of $X$ can be computed from the normal bundle sequence:\n$0 \\to T_X \\to T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X \\to N_X \\to 0$.\nThis implies $c(T_X) = c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) / c(N_X)$.\nLet $H$ be the hyperplane class in $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H_X$ be its restriction to $X$.\nThe total Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+H)^4 = 1 + 4H + 6H^2 + 4H^3$.\nThe normal bundle $N_X$ is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(5)$, so its Chern class is $c(N_X) = 1 + 5H_X$.\nRestricting to $X$, we get:\n$c(T_X) = \\frac{1 + 4H_X + 6H_X^2}{1 + 5H_X} = (1 + 4H_X + 6H_X^2)(1 - 5H_X + 25H_X^2 - \\dots)$\n$c(T_X) = 1 + (4-5)H_X + (6 - 20 + 25)H_X^2 + \\dots = 1 - H_X + 11H_X^2 + \\dots$\nSo, the second Chern class is $c_2(T_X) = 11H_X^2$.\nThe Euler characteristic is the degree of this class:\n$\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11H_X^2 = 11 \\int_X H_X^2$.\nThe integral $\\int_X H_X^2$ represents the self-intersection number of a hyperplane section on $X$, which is the number of points in $X \\cap H_1 \\cap H_2$. This is the degree of the hypersurface $X$, which is 5.\nSo, $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n*   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, $X$ is connected, so $b_0=1$.\n*   The Lefschetz theorem also implies $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, so $b_1 = \\text{rank}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})) = 0$.\n*   By Poincar√© duality on the 4-manifold $X$, $b_3 = b_1 = 0$ and $b_4=b_0=1$.\n*   Plugging these into the formula for $\\chi(X)$:\n    $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n*   Solving for $b_2(X)$, we find $b_2(X) = 53$.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation**\nUsing the theorem from Step 3, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_2(X) - 1 = 53 - 1 = 52 $$\nThe group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a free abelian group of this rank."
