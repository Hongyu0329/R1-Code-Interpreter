    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Correct Musical Work and Section**\nThe question specifies Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\". We need to find the musical score for this symphony and navigate to the very end of the final (fourth) movement. The part we must focus on is that of the first violins (Violino I).\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Score for the First Violin Part**\nUpon consulting the full orchestral score, we look at the last few measures of the symphony for the Violino I line. The symphony ends in the key of B Major.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Three Notes**\nThe musical action for the first violins at the very end is concentrated in the final two measures:\n*   **Penultimate Measure (Second-to-last bar):** The first violins play two notes. The first note is an F# (specifically F#5, played as a half note). The second note is a B (specifically B5, also played as a half note).\n*   **Final Measure (Last bar):** The first violins play a single, long note to conclude the piece. This note is a B (B5, played as a whole note).\n\n**Step 4: List the Sequence and Determine the Lowest Note**\nFollowing the score, the sequence of the last three notes played by the first violin is:\n1.  F#\n2.  B\n3.  B\n\nTo find the lowest of these three notes, we compare the pitches F# and B. In the musical scale, F# is lower in pitch than B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to look at the first violin part specifically, not the entire orchestra's final chord.\n*   The question asks for the \"lowest one\" among the last three notes played sequentially, not the notes of the final chord played by the violins (which would be more ambiguous).\n*   Different editions of the score could have minor variations, but the principal notes at such a climactic moment are standard. The analysis is based on widely available editions (e.g., Breitkopf & Härtel).\n\nTherefore, the lowest of the last three notes is F#.\n\n<<<F#>>>"
