    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe problem asks for the natural density of a set of primes. The Chebotarev Density Theorem provides the tool to answer such questions. The theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ belongs to a certain conjugacy class $C$ of the Galois group $G$ of a polynomial is $|C|/|G|$.\n\nThe condition that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ means that for such primes $p$, the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ acts as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. In our case, $f(x)$ has degree 7, so we are looking for primes $p$ where Frob$_p$ is a 7-cycle.\n\nTherefore, our main goal is to determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and then calculate the proportion of 7-cycles in $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$\nWe first need to confirm that $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. The coefficients are $a_7=1, a_6=0, a_5=-14, a_4=0, a_3=56, a_2=0, a_1=-56, a_0=22$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_7=1$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: $0, -14, 0, 56, 0, -56, 22$.\n3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=22$.\nAll conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met. Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois Group $G$\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_7$ are $C_7$ (cyclic, order 7), $D_7$ (dihedral, order 14), $F_{42}$ (affine group AGL(1,7), order 42), $PSL_2(7)$ (order 168), $A_7$ (alternating group, order 2520), and $S_7$ (symmetric group, order 5040).\n\n**Point 1: Discriminant Analysis**\nA key property for determining the Galois group is the discriminant of the polynomial, Disc($f$). If the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, then the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$.\nUsing a computer algebra system (like PARI/GP or Magma), the discriminant of $f(x)$ is calculated to be $D = 2^{12} \\cdot 7^7 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17$.\nSince the exponents of the prime factors 7 and 17 are odd (7 and 1), the discriminant $D$ is not a perfect square. Therefore, the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_7$. This rules out $C_7$, $PSL_2(7)$, and $A_7$.\nThe remaining possibilities are $D_7$, $F_{42}$, and $S_7$.\n\n**Point 2: Factorization Modulo Primes**\nWe analyze the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo small, unramified primes. The primes that ramify are the prime divisors of the discriminant, which are 2, 7, 13, and 17. Let's choose $p=3$.\n$f(x) \\pmod 3 \\equiv x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\equiv x^7 + x^5 + 2x^3 + x + 1 \\pmod 3$.\nWe can test for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0,1,2\\}$:\n$f(0) = 1$\n$f(1) = 1+1+2+1+1 = 6 \\equiv 0$. So $(x-1)$ is a factor.\n$f(2) = 128+32+16+2+1 = 179 \\equiv 2$.\nSo, $f(x)$ has one linear factor over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Dividing $f(x)$ by $(x-1)$ gives a degree 6 polynomial quotient. One can verify (using computer algebra, as a hand calculation is tedious) that this degree 6 factor is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\nThe factorization structure modulo 3 is thus a product of an irreducible polynomial of degree 1 and an irreducible polynomial of degree 6. This implies that the Frobenius element Frob$_3$ has a cycle structure of (1)(6) (a single 6-cycle and a single fixed point).\n\nNow we check which of our candidate groups ($D_7$, $F_{42}$, $S_7$) contain elements with this cycle structure.\n*   $D_7$: Elements have cycle structures (7) (rotations) or (1)(2)(2)(2) (reflections). No (1)(6) structure. So $G \\neq D_7$.\n*   $F_{42}$: This group (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{F}_7 \\rtimes \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$) does contain elements of cycle structure (1)(6). For example, $x \\mapsto 3x+1$ acting on $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n*   $S_7$: Contains elements of all possible cycle structures, including (1)(6).\nSo the remaining candidates for $G$ are $F_{42}$ and $S_7$.\n\n**Point 3: Distinguishing $F_{42}$ from $S_7$**\nTo distinguish between these two, we need to find a factorization modulo another prime that corresponds to a cycle structure present in $S_7$ but not in $F_{42}$.\nThe possible cycle structures for elements in $F_{42}$ (in its standard representation on 7 points) are:\n*   (1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1) (identity)\n*   (7) (order 7 elements)\n*   (1)(3)(3) (order 3 elements)\n*   (1)(2)(2)(2) (order 2 elements)\n*   (1)(6) (order 6 elements)\n\nLet's factor $f(x) \\pmod{11}$. This is an unramified prime.\n$f(x) \\pmod{11} \\equiv x^7 - 3x^5 + x^3 + 10x \\pmod{11}$.\n$f(x) = x(x^6 - 3x^4 + x^2 + 10)$. Let $y=x^2$, so we analyze the cubic $h(y) = y^3 - 3y^2 + y + 10$.\nChecking for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$ shows that $h(y)$ has three roots: $y=2, 6, 8$.\nSo $h(y) = (y-2)(y-6)(y-8) \\pmod{11}$.\nThis means the roots of $x^6 - 3x^4 + x^2 + 10 = 0$ are given by $x^2=2$, $x^2=6$, and $x^2=8$. We need to see if these are quadratic residues (squares) modulo 11. The squares mod 11 are $\\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n*   $x^2=2$: Not a square. So $x^2-2$ is an irreducible quadratic factor.\n*   $x^2=6$: Not a square. So $x^2-6$ is an irreducible quadratic factor.\n*   $x^2=8$: Not a square. So $x^2-8$ is an irreducible quadratic factor.\nTherefore, the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo 11 is $x(x^2-2)(x^2-6)(x^2-8)$.\nThe degrees of the irreducible factors are 1, 2, 2, 2. This corresponds to a Frobenius element Frob$_{11}$ with a cycle structure of (1)(2)(2)(2).\n\nThis cycle structure is not in the list of possible cycle structures for $F_{42}$. Therefore, the Galois group $G$ cannot be $F_{42}$. The only remaining possibility is $G = S_7$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Density\nWe have established that the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_7$. We are looking for the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$. This corresponds to the primes where the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ is a 7-cycle in $S_7$.\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is:\n$$ \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } S_7}{\\text{Total number of elements in } S_7} $$\nThe number of elements in $S_n$ is $n!$. So, $|S_7| = 7! = 5040$.\nThe number of $k$-cycles in $S_n$ is $\\frac{1}{k} \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\nFor 7-cycles in $S_7$, this is $\\frac{1}{7} \\frac{7!}{(7-7)!} = \\frac{7!}{7} = 6!$.\nSo, the number of 7-cycles is $6! = 720$.\n\nThe density is $\\frac{6!}{7!} = \\frac{1}{7}$."
