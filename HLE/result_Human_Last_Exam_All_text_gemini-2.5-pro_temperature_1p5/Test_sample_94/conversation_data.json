    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a specific physicist. We can break down the identifying clues provided in the question:\n    *   **Clue 1: Physicist.** The person is a physicist by profession.\n    *   **Clue 2: Better known for work in the microscopy field.** This person's primary contribution or fame lies in the area of microscopy, even if they worked in other areas.\n    *   **Clue 3: Discovered an optical effect in real imagery.** The discovery relates to optics and the formation of real images (images formed by the actual convergence of light rays).\n    *   **Clue 4: The discovery was accidentally observed by a custodial worker.** This is a very specific historical anecdote.\n    *   **Clue 5: The observation involved cleaning concave mirrors.** This detail pinpoints the context of the accidental discovery.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Careful Points:**\n    *   The most unique and searchable clue is the story involving the custodial worker and the concave mirrors. This anecdote is not common and is likely tied to a specific famous discovery.\n    *   The connection to \"microscopy\" is a crucial filter. The physicist in question is not just any physicist who worked with optics, but one whose legacy is defined by their contributions to microscopes.\n    *   Concave mirrors are used to form real images, which aligns with the clue about the discovery being in \"real imagery\".\n\n3.  **Acquire the Answer through Analysis:**\n    *   **Start with the most specific clue:** The story about the custodial worker. This historical anecdote is famously associated with the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n    *   **Verify the story:** Zernike was studying diffraction gratings ruled onto concave mirrors. He noticed that imperfections in the ruling process created faint secondary images called \"ghosts.\" A laboratory custodian, while cleaning, looked at the setup and commented that he could see the grating lines twice. This seemingly simple observation prompted Zernike to think more deeply about the nature of these \"ghost\" images.\n    *   **Connect to the optical effect:** Zernike's investigation revealed that these faint ghost images were out of phase with the primary image by a quarter wavelength (90 degrees). This gave him a revolutionary idea.\n    *   **Connect to microscopy:** He realized that many biological specimens, like living cells, are transparent. They don't absorb much light, but they do slightly alter the phase of the light passing through them. The human eye cannot detect these phase shifts. Zernike reasoned that if he could artificially create a similar quarter-wavelength phase shift between the direct light and the light diffracted by the specimen in a microscope, he could convert the invisible phase differences into visible amplitude (brightness) differences.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This insight led directly to his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**, a tool that allows scientists to see unstained, transparent specimens. For this invention, Frits Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953. This confirms he is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n\nTherefore, all the clues in the question point directly to Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
