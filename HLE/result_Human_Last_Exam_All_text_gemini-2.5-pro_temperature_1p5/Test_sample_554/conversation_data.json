    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the name \"perfluoronanocar\"**\n*   **NanoCar**: This is the base molecule. The term \"NanoCar\" generally refers to a specific molecule class, with the most famous example being the one synthesized by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University in 2005. We will use this original NanoCar as our reference structure.\n*   **Perfluoro-**: This is a chemical prefix meaning \"fully fluorinated.\" In the context of an organic molecule, it signifies that all the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon framework have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the original NanoCar**\nThe NanoCar consists of three main parts:\n1.  **Chassis and Axles**: A rigid organic framework that forms the body and axles.\n2.  **Wheels**: Four buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀) molecules.\n3.  **Linkages**: The chemical bonds that connect the wheels to the axles.\n\nTo find the number of fluorine atoms in a \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to find the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard NanoCar. The fluorine atoms will replace these hydrogens one-for-one.\n\n**Step 3: Count the hydrogen atoms on the chassis/axle precursor**\nThe organic framework (chassis and axles before the wheels are attached) of the original NanoCar is a molecule named **3',5'-diethynyl-4,4'-bis(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,1'-biphenyl**. Let's count the hydrogen atoms on this structure:\n\n*   **Biphenyl Core**: This is the central part, consisting of two linked benzene rings (let's call them Ring A and Ring A').\n    *   **Ring A**: It is substituted at two positions (the link to Ring A' and the link to a `(4-ethynylphenyl)` group). A benzene ring has 6 positions, so 6 - 2 = 4 hydrogen atoms remain on Ring A.\n    *   **Ring A'**: It is substituted at four positions (the link to Ring A, two `ethynyl` groups, and one `(4-ethynylphenyl)` group). So, 6 - 4 = 2 hydrogen atoms remain on Ring A'.\n*   **Two `(4-ethynylphenyl)` Groups**: These are attached at positions 4 and 4' of the biphenyl core. Each group consists of a phenyl ring and a terminal ethynyl group (`-C≡CH`).\n    *   The phenyl ring in each group is substituted at two positions (para-substitution), leaving 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The terminal ethynyl group (`-C≡CH`) in each has 1 hydrogen atom.\n    *   So, each `(4-ethynylphenyl)` group has 4 + 1 = 5 hydrogens. With two such groups, we have 2 * 5 = 10 hydrogens.\n*   **Two `ethynyl` Groups**: These are attached at positions 3' and 5' of the biphenyl core. Each is a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`) and has 1 hydrogen atom. So, 2 * 1 = 2 hydrogens.\n\n**Total hydrogens on the precursor molecule**: 4 (from Ring A) + 2 (from Ring A') + 10 (from the two `(4-ethynylphenyl)` groups) + 2 (from the two `ethynyl` groups) = **18 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Step 4: Account for the attachment of the wheels**\nThe NanoCar has four C₆₀ fullerene wheels. The fullerenes themselves contain no hydrogen atoms. They are attached to the four \"axles,\" which are the four terminal ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups on the chassis precursor. The chemical reaction that attaches a wheel to an axle removes the terminal hydrogen from that axle.\n\n*   Number of axles = 4\n*   Number of hydrogens removed = 4\n\nThe number of hydrogens in the final, fully assembled NanoCar molecule is:\n18 (hydrogens on precursor) - 4 (hydrogens removed for wheel attachment) = **14 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Careful Point**: These remaining 14 hydrogens are all attached to the aromatic rings of the chassis (4 on Ring A, 2 on Ring A', and 4 on each of the two phenyl rings in the `(4-ethynylphenyl)` groups).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar**\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen atom in the NanoCar is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n*   Number of hydrogens in NanoCar = 14\n*   Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar = 14\n\n<<<14>>>"
