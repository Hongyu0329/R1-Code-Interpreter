    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Mathematical Object:**\n    The question concerns the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$). This is a key condition, as the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity is drastically different from the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity). The category of finite-dimensional representations is no longer semisimple.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Objects of the Category C:**\n    The category $C$ is defined as the category of *indecomposable* finite-dimensional representations. An object (representation) is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero subrepresentations. We need to classify all such objects up to isomorphism.\n\n3.  **Classifying Irreducible Representations:**\n    Irreducible (or simple) representations are the fundamental building blocks of all finite-dimensional representations via composition series. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity (here $l=3$), there are exactly $l$ non-isomorphic simple modules. Let's denote them by $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n    *   $L_1$: The trivial representation (dimension 1).\n    *   $L_2$: A 2-dimensional representation.\n    *   $L_3$: The Steinberg representation (dimension 3).\n    So, there are **3** irreducible objects in our category.\n\n4.  **Classifying All Indecomposable Representations:**\n    The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $l=3$ is known to be of **tame representation type**. This means that its indecomposable modules can be classified, but there are infinitely many of them. The classification includes:\n    *   The 3 simple modules ($L_1, L_2, L_3$).\n    *   The indecomposable projective modules ($P_1, P_2, P_3$).\n    *   Infinite families of indecomposable modules, often organized into \"tubes\" in the Auslander-Reiten quiver. These modules are parameterized by continuous parameters (from $\\mathbb{C}$) and a discrete parameter (an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$).\n    Since there is an infinite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations, the set of objects in C is infinite.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the \"Percentage\" Question:**\n    The question asks for the percentage of objects in C that are irreducible. If we take the sets literally, we have:\n    *   Number of irreducible objects: 3\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects: $\\infty$\n    The ratio is $3 / \\infty = 0$. This gives a percentage of **0%**.\n\n6.  **Considering a Deeper Interpretation:**\n    While 0% is the literal answer, questions of this nature in mathematics, especially in a specialized field, often imply a focus on a specific, significant finite subset of the objects, assuming the question is not a simple \"trick\". A common practice is to analyze a distinguished class of objects that forms a basis for understanding the entire category. The most natural and important such class is the set of **indecomposable projective modules**. Projective modules are fundamental as they are used to build projective resolutions for any module. Let's re-evaluate the question under the charitable assumption that \"the objects of C\" implicitly refers to the indecomposable projective modules.\n\n7.  **Analyzing the Indecomposable Projective Modules:**\n    For each simple module $L_i$, there is a corresponding indecomposable projective module $P_i$, called its projective cover. So there are 3 indecomposable projective modules: $P_1, P_2, P_3$. We need to determine which of these are themselves irreducible.\n    *   $P_1$: The projective cover of $L_1$. It is known to have dimension $2l = 2 \\times 3 = 6$. Since its dimension is not 1, it cannot be $L_1$. In fact, it has a more complex structure, with composition factors involving both $L_1$ and $L_2$. It is **not irreducible**.\n    *   $P_2$: The projective cover of $L_2$. It also has dimension $2l=6$. It is **not irreducible**.\n    *   $P_3$: The projective cover of $L_3$. The Steinberg module $L_3$ is a special case. It is known to be both simple and projective. Therefore, its projective cover is itself: $P_3 = L_3$. This module **is irreducible**.\n\n8.  **Calculating the Final Percentage:**\n    Under the interpretation that we are considering the set of indecomposable projective modules, we have:\n    *   Total number of objects in this set: 3 (namely $P_1, P_2, L_3$).\n    *   Number of irreducible objects in this set: 1 (namely $L_3$).\n    *   The percentage is $(1/3) \\times 100\\% = 33.33... \\%$.\n\nThis interpretation leads to a non-zero, meaningful answer that relies on the structure of the representation category. Given the context of such problems, this is the most likely intended solution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis hinges on the interpretation of the question. A literal interpretation, acknowledging the infinite number of indecomposable representations, yields an answer of 0. However, a more nuanced interpretation, common in representation theory, restricts the focus to the fundamentally important class of indecomposable projective modules.\n\nFollowing this second, more insightful path:\n1.  There are 3 simple (irreducible) modules: $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n2.  There are 3 corresponding indecomposable projective modules: $P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n3.  $P_1$ and $P_2$ are not simple.\n4.  The Steinberg module $L_3$ is projective, so $P_3 = L_3$. It is simple.\n5.  Thus, among the 3 indecomposable projective modules, exactly 1 is simple.\n\nThe percentage is $1/3$."
