    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Toroidal Board and Attacks**\n    *   A 5x5 toroidal board is a grid where the edges wrap around. The row after row 5 is row 1, and the column after column 5 is column 1. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(x, y)` where `x, y` are integers from 0 to 4.\n    *   A queen at `(x1, y1)` attacks a square `(x2, y2)` if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   On a toroidal board, this means:\n        1.  **Row attack:** `x1 = x2`\n        2.  **Column attack:** `y1 = y2`\n        3.  **Main diagonal attack:** `x1 - y1 ≡ x2 - y2 (mod 5)`\n        4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `x1 + y1 ≡ x2 + y2 (mod 5)`\n    *   We need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens such that no two queens attack each other.\n\n2.  **Relating the 4-Queens Problem to the 5-Queens Problem**\n    *   This problem is an instance of placing `n-1` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board, with `n=5`.\n    *   Let's analyze the relationship between solutions for `n-1` queens and `n` queens. Let `W_k` denote the number of ways to place `k` non-attacking queens.\n\n    *   **From 5 queens to 4 queens:**\n        Consider a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens. In such a solution, every row, column, main diagonal, and anti-diagonal must be occupied exactly once. If we remove any one of the 5 queens, the remaining 4 queens will still not attack each other (as they originally didn't). Since there are 5 distinct queens to remove, each 5-queen solution gives rise to 5 different 4-queen solutions.\n\n    *   **From 4 queens to 5 queens (Completing a solution):**\n        Now, consider a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens. These 4 queens must occupy 4 different rows, 4 different columns, 4 different main diagonals, and 4 different anti-diagonals.\n        *   This leaves exactly one unused row, `R_u`.\n        *   Exactly one unused column, `C_u`.\n        *   Exactly one unused main diagonal, `D_u`.\n        *   Exactly one unused anti-diagonal, `A_u`.\n\n        Can we always place a 5th queen to complete the set? This 5th queen would have to be placed at the intersection of the unused row and column, i.e., at `(R_u, C_u)`. For this to be a valid 5-queen solution, this new queen must also occupy the unused diagonals. The conditions are:\n        1.  `R_u - C_u ≡ D_u (mod 5)`\n        2.  `R_u + C_u ≡ A_u (mod 5)`\n\n        It's a known result in combinatorics that for a toroidal board of size `n x n` where `n` is an odd prime (like 5), these conditions are always met. Any `n-1` non-attacking queen configuration can be uniquely extended to an `n`-queen configuration.\n\n3.  **Establishing the Formula**\n    *   The above analysis shows that there is a perfect correspondence. Every 4-queen solution can be obtained by removing a queen from exactly one 5-queen solution. Conversely, removing any queen from any 5-queen solution results in a valid 4-queen solution.\n    *   This establishes a relationship: The total number of 4-queen placements is 5 times the total number of 5-queen placements.\n    *   `W_4 = 5 * W_5`\n\n4.  **Counting the Number of 5-Queen Solutions (`W_5`)**\n    *   The problem is now reduced to finding the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n    *   Solutions to the `n`-queens problem on an `n x n` toroidal board exist if and only if `gcd(n, 6) = 1`. For `n=5`, `gcd(5, 6) = 1`, so solutions exist.\n    *   For a prime `n >= 5`, all solutions are of the form of placing queens at coordinates `(i, p(i))` where `p(i)` is a linear permutation `p(i) = a*i + b (mod n)`.\n    *   The coefficient `a` must satisfy `a \\not\\equiv 0`, `a \\not\\equiv 1`, and `a \\not\\equiv -1 (mod n)`.\n        *   `a \\ne 0` because `p(i)` must be a permutation.\n        *   `a \\ne 1` because if `a=1`, then `i - p(i) = i - (i+b) = -b`, meaning all queens lie on the same main diagonal.\n        *   `a \\ne -1` because if `a=-1`, then `i + p(i) = i + (-i+b) = b`, meaning all queens lie on the same anti-diagonal.\n    *   For `n=5`, the values for `a` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` that are not allowed are `0`, `1`, and `4 (since 4 \\equiv -1 mod 5)`.\n    *   Thus, the allowed values for `a` are `2` and `3`. (2 choices)\n    *   The coefficient `b` can be any value from `0` to `4`. (5 choices)\n    *   Therefore, the number of 5-queen solutions is `W_5 = (\\text{choices for a}) * (\\text{choices for b}) = 2 * 5 = 10`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   Using the formula from Step 3 and the result from Step 4:\n    *   `W_4 = 5 * W_5 = 5 * 10 = 50`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly interpreting the \"toroidal\" condition for diagonals is key.\n*   The most critical step is realizing the one-to-one correspondence between a 4-queen placement and a pair (5-queen placement, a chosen queen to remove).\n*   The validity of this correspondence relies on `n=5` being an odd prime, which ensures any `n-1` solution is completable.\n*   Counting the `n`-queen solutions requires knowing the specific constraints on linear permutations (`p(i) = ai+b`) that form solutions.\n\nThe number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
