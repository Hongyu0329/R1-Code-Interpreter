    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its main character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Polish author Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Identify the primary female character:** The most significant character in Adam Zamoyski's new life is Angelika Inviolata d’Umbrose. She is a post-human entity known as a \"phoebe\" (Standard Model Human) who is assigned as his guide and protector.\n\n3.  **Analyze the concept of \"marriage\" within the novel's context:** The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a far-future, post-human civilization where traditional human concepts like marriage do not exist in the same way. Therefore, the question should be interpreted as: \"With which character does the main character form a final, permanent, marriage-like union?\"\n\n4.  **Trace the development of the relationship:** The relationship between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika Inviolata d’Umbrose is central to the plot. It evolves from a formal arrangement (guide and subject) to a deep emotional bond and a strategic partnership for survival. Angelika becomes Adam's most trusted confidant and ally.\n\n5.  **Examine the novel's conclusion:** At the end of the book, Adam Zamoyski undergoes a profound transformation, transcending his physical form to become a \"stoch,\" a powerful entity existing on a higher plane of reality. In achieving this state, he creates a permanent, inseparable union with Angelika, integrating her into his new existence as his eternal partner. This transcendent fusion is the narrative's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n6.  **Conclude the name:** Based on this analysis, the character that Adam Zamoyski \"marries\" by forming this ultimate bond is Angelika Inviolata d’Umbrose.\n\n<<<Angelika Inviolata d’Umbrose>>>"
