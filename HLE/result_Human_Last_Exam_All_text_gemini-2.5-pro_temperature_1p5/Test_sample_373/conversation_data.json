    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck\" edge.\n*   **Node Distribution:** The total number of nodes is 10. For a standard, symmetric barbell graph, the nodes are split equally between the two cliques.\n    *   Clique A: A complete graph (K5) with 5 nodes.\n    *   Clique B: Another complete graph (K5) with 5 nodes.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. Let's call the nodes connected by this edge `u` (from Clique A) and `v` (from Clique B). The bottleneck edge is `e_b = (u, v)`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degree of Each Node\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In this graph, there are two types of nodes.\n*   **Bridge Nodes (`u` and `v`):**\n    *   Each of these nodes is connected to the other 4 nodes within its own K5 clique.\n    *   Each is also connected to the other bridge node via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   So, the degree of a bridge node is `deg(u) = deg(v) = 4 (internal) + 1 (bridge) = 5`.\n    *   There are **2** such nodes in the graph.\n*   **Internal Nodes (all other nodes):**\n    *   These are the remaining 4 nodes in Clique A and the remaining 4 nodes in Clique B.\n    *   Each of these nodes is only connected to the other 4 nodes within its own clique.\n    *   So, the degree of an internal node is `4`.\n    *   There are **8** such nodes in the graph.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Sampling Process\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This is a node-centric process. For the purpose of finding the probability of sampling an edge in a single step, the process is modeled as:\n    1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the entire set of 10 nodes to act as the \"sender\".\n    2.  The sender node then selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to send a message to.\n*   **\"Sampling an edge\"** means that this sender-neighbor pair forms the sampled edge. The \"uniform weights\" clause signifies that each neighbor has an equal chance of being selected (i.e., the probability is `1/degree`).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nWe want to find the probability that the sampled edge is the bottleneck edge, `e_b = (u, v)`. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `u` is selected as the sender, and it chooses `v` as its neighbor.\n2.  Node `v` is selected as the sender, and it chooses `u` as its neighbor.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each case:\n\n*   **Case 1: `u` sends to `v`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` as the sender (out of 10 total nodes) is `1/10`.\n    *   Given `u` is the sender, the probability of it choosing neighbor `v` is `1/deg(u)`. Since `deg(u) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for Case 1 is: `P(u -> v) = P(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `v` sends to `u`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` as the sender is also `1/10`.\n    *   Given `v` is the sender, the probability of it choosing neighbor `u` is `1/deg(v)`. Since `deg(v) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for Case 2 is: `P(v -> u) = P(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n\n`P(e_b) = P(u -> v) + P(v -> u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe probability simplifies to:\n`2/50 = 1/25`\n\nAs a decimal, this is 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
