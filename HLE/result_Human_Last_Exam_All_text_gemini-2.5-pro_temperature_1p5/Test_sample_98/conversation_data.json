    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices where 5 faces meet at each vertex.\n*   **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n*   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the geometric shape of the water's surface. The surface of a liquid at rest in a container is always a horizontal plane. Therefore, the question is asking for the shape of the horizontal cross-section that cuts the icosahedron into two equal volumes.\n\n**Step 2: Use Symmetry to Locate the Water Surface**\n*   A regular icosahedron is a highly symmetric object. A key property is that it has a **center of symmetry** (or a center of inversion). This means for any point within the icosahedron, the point directly opposite through the center is also within the icosahedron.\n*   Any plane passing through this center of symmetry will divide the icosahedron into two identical pieces of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water level must be precisely at the height of the icosahedron's geometric center. The water surface is therefore the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section Using Symmetry**\nWe need to find the shape of the cross-section created by a plane that is:\n    a) Passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n    b) Parallel to one of its faces (since it's a horizontal plane and the base is a face).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetries of this specific cross-section:\n\n1.  **Central Symmetry:** Because the cutting plane passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry, the resulting 2D shape must also be centrally symmetric. If you draw a line from any point on the shape's boundary, through the center, it will meet another point on the boundary at the same distance.\n\n2.  **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron stands on a face, the vertical axis passing through the center of the base face and the center of the icosahedron is an axis of **3-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Since the horizontal cutting plane is perpendicular to this axis, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Combining Symmetries:** Now we have a 2D shape that must have both central symmetry and 3-fold rotational symmetry. Let's see what this implies.\n    *   Having 3-fold symmetry means if we rotate the shape by 120°, it looks the same.\n    *   Having central symmetry is equivalent to a 180° rotation.\n    *   If a shape has both 3-fold (120°) and 2-fold (180°) rotational symmetry, it must also have 6-fold (60°) rotational symmetry. A rotation of 60° can be achieved by first rotating by 180° and then by -120° (which is +240°). The combination of symmetries in the group forces the existence of a 60° rotation.\n\n4.  **Final Shape:** The water surface must be a convex polygon (since it's a slice of a convex solid). A convex polygon that has 6-fold rotational symmetry can only be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Visualizing the cross-section:** The plane at the center cuts through the \"equator\" of the icosahedron when it is oriented with a face on the bottom. This plane does not pass through any vertices. Instead, it slices through 6 of the 30 edges. These 6 edges form a zig-zagging band around the middle of the icosahedron, and the plane cuts them exactly at their midpoints. These 6 midpoints form the vertices of the regular hexagon.\n*   **Convexity:** The cross-section of any convex solid (like an icosahedron) by a plane is always a convex polygon. This rules out star-shaped polygons (like a hexagram), which might also exhibit 6-fold symmetry but are not convex.\n*   **Half-volume vs. Half-height:** For a shape like a cone or pyramid, the half-volume mark is not at half the height. However, for a centrally symmetric object like an icosahedron, the plane through the center divides the volume exactly in half.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
