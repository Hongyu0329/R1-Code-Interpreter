    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific person based on a description attributed to the author Kurt Vonnegut. The key quote is that this person \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the constraints on the answer.**\nThe answer must be:\n*   The name of a man.\n*   Composed of two words.\n*   Both words must start with the same letter.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the source of the quote.**\nThe specific phrase \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures\" needs to be traced back to its origin in Kurt Vonnegut's writings. While Vonnegut uses similar imagery elsewhere (like describing a figure in a painting as a \"porcupine of arrows\" in *Breakfast of Champions*), the exact quote in the question points to a specific non-fiction work. The quote can be found in Vonnegut's 1974 collection of essays, *Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the person being described in the source.**\nIn the essay titled \"Brief Encounters on the Inland Waterway,\" Vonnegut writes about the Romanian-American artist and illustrator, famous for his work in *The New Yorker*. Vonnegut is describing this man's appearance in photographs, likely referring to his spiky hair and sharp features which mirrored his drawing style.\n\n**Step 5: State the name of the man and verify it against the constraints.**\nThe man Vonnegut was describing is **Saul Steinberg**.\n*   **Is it a man's name?** Yes.\n*   **Is it two words?** Yes, \"Saul\" and \"Steinberg\".\n*   **Do both words start with the same letter?** Yes, both start with the letter 'S'.\n\nAll conditions are met. Therefore, Saul Steinberg is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Saul Steinberg>>>"
