    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the GCRD and the Method**\n\nThe Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s), is a polynomial matrix G(s) that is a right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s), and any other common right divisor D(s) is also a right divisor of G(s).\n\nA standard method to compute the GCRD is the matrix Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is a square matrix. This resulting matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n**2. Set up the Stacked Matrix**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nLet's write down the stacked matrix M(s):\n```\n     [ s^2 + s , -s      ]  (Row 1)\nM(s)=[ -s^2 - 1, s^2     ]  (Row 2)\n     [ s       , 0       ]  (Row 3)\n     [ -s - 1  , 1       ]  (Row 4)\n```\n\n**3. Perform Row Reductions**\n\nOur goal is to use elementary row operations to create zero rows at the bottom of the matrix.\n\n*   **Step 1: Simplify using Row 4.**\n    Let's use Row 4 to simplify other rows, particularly by targeting the second column. We can eliminate the `-s` in Row 1 by adding `s` times Row 4 to Row 1.\n    \n    `Row 1_new = Row 1 + s * Row 4`\n    `Row 1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `Row 1_new = [s^2 + s + s(-s-1), -s + s*1]`\n    `Row 1_new = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s]`\n    `Row 1_new = [0, 0]`\n\n    This is a significant simplification. The matrix becomes:\n    ```\n         [ 0       , 0       ]\n    M(s)=[ -s^2 - 1, s^2     ]  (Row 2)\n         [ s       , 0       ]  (Row 3)\n         [ -s - 1  , 1       ]  (Row 4)\n    ```\n    We now need to reduce the remaining 3x2 matrix formed by rows 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Step 2: Simplify Row 2 using Row 4.**\n    We can eliminate the `s^2` in the second column of Row 2 by subtracting `s^2` times Row 4 from Row 2.\n\n    `Row 2_new = Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4`\n    `Row 2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `Row 2_new = [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2]`\n    `Row 2_new = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0]`\n    `Row 2_new = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    ```\n         [ 0       , 0   ]\n    M(s)=[ s^3 - 1 , 0   ]  (Row 2_new)\n         [ s       , 0   ]  (Row 3)\n         [ -s - 1  , 1   ]  (Row 4)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: Simplify Row 2_new using Row 3.**\n    Now we can use Row 3 `[s, 0]` to reduce the degree of Row 2_new `[s^3-1, 0]`. We perform polynomial division: `(s^3-1) / s = s^2` with a remainder of `-1`. So, we subtract `s^2` times Row 3 from Row 2_new.\n\n    `Row 2_newer = Row 2_new - s^2 * Row 3`\n    `Row 2_newer = [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0]`\n    `Row 2_newer = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0]`\n    `Row 2_newer = [-1, 0]`\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    ```\n         [ 0       , 0   ]\n    M(s)=[ -1      , 0   ]  (Row 2_newer)\n         [ s       , 0   ]  (Row 3)\n         [ -s - 1  , 1   ]  (Row 4)\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 4: Final cleanup.**\n    Now we use the very simple row `[-1, 0]` to eliminate the first elements in Row 3 and Row 4.\n\n    `Row 3_new = Row 3 + s * Row 2_newer`\n    `Row 3_new = [s, 0] + s * [-1, 0]`\n    `Row 3_new = [s - s, 0]`\n    `Row 3_new = [0, 0]`\n\n    `Row 4_new = Row 4 - (s+1) * Row 2_newer`\n    `Row 4_new = [-s-1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0]`\n    `Row 4_new = [-s-1 - (-s-1), 1 - 0]`\n    `Row 4_new = [-s-1 + s+1, 1]`\n    `Row 4_new = [0, 1]`\n\n    The matrix now contains the following non-zero rows: `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. Let's collect them and put the zero rows at the bottom:\n    ```\n         [ -1, 0 ]\n         [ 0, 1  ]\n         [ 0, 0  ]\n         [ 0, 0  ]\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 5: Normalize the GCRD.**\n    The resulting GCRD matrix is G(s) = `[-1, 0; 0, 1]`. We can make this even simpler by multiplying the first row by the constant `-1`.\n\n    G_final(s) = `[1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\n    This is the identity matrix, `I`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe reduction process results in the identity matrix. A GCRD that is unimodular (i.e., its determinant is a non-zero constant) implies that the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**. The identity matrix `I` is the standard representation for the GCRD of right coprime matrices.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
