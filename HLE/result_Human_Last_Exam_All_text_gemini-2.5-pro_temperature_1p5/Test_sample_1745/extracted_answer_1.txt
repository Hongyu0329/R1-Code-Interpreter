The expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution $\psi(y)$ is given by:
$\psi(y) = \zeta_1 \frac{\sinh(k(H/2 - y))}{\sinh(kH)}$
where $\zeta_1$ is the zeta potential of the bottom surface, $k$ is the Debyeâ€“Huckel parameter, $H$ is the channel height, and the coordinate $y$ is measured from the center of the channel (from $-H/2$ to $+H/2$).
