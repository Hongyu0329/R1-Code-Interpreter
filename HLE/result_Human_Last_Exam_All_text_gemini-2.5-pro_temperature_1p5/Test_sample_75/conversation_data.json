    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Second Great War\"**: In StarCraft lore, the Second Great War refers to the series of conflicts that take place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*).\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date**: The war begins with the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**. This is established as being four years after the end of the Brood War (which concluded in 2500).\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date**: The war's main conflict concludes with the defeat of the dark god Amon. This happens in the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled *Into the Void*. According to the official timeline, these events take place in the year **2506**. The final cutscene of the epilogue, which shows events \"two years later,\" occurs *after* the war has already ended and does not count towards its duration.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   The war starts sometime in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends sometime in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict spans across parts of three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   The total elapsed time is therefore greater than one year but less than three years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 2 months.\n    *   The consensus in the lore community is that the war lasted for \"approximately two years\". However, since it starts in 2504 and ends in 2506, the actual duration is very likely slightly *more* than two full years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question requires the answer to be in years and **rounded up**.\n    *   If the duration is exactly 2 years, rounding up would result in 2.\n    *   If the duration is any value greater than 2 years (e.g., 2 years and 1 day, 2.1 years, etc.), rounding it up to the next whole number gives 3.\n    *   Given that the conflict's events are spread across three separate calendar years, it is almost certain that the total duration exceeded a perfect 2.0 years. Therefore, we must round up to the next integer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506. This gives it a duration of approximately 2+ years. When rounding this value up to the nearest whole year, the result is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
