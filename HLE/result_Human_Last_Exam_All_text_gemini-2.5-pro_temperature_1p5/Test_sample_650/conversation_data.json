    "An elegant explanation of the method to solve the problem is as follows.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initialization (Step 1)**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    *   This step involves a fixed number of elementary operations: two assignments, one division, one multiplication, one subtraction, and another assignment.\n    *   Assuming these operations take constant time, the complexity of this step is O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the `while` Loop (Step 2)**\n    *   The main computation happens inside the `while q > 0` loop. To find the time complexity, we must determine how many times this loop iterates.\n    *   The loop's execution depends on the value of `q`. Let's trace how `q` changes.\n    *   Initially, before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, the variable `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Let's denote the value of `q` before the `k`-th iteration of the loop as `q_{k-1}`.\n        *   Before iteration 1: `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   Before iteration 2: The loop sets `x = q_0`, so `q_1 = ⌊q_0/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   Before iteration `k`: The value of `q` will be `q_{k-1} = ⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^k⌋ = 0`.\n    *   The condition `⌊n/c^k⌋ = 0` is true if and only if `n/c^k < 1`.\n    *   Rearranging the inequality, we get `n < c^k`.\n    *   To find the number of iterations, we can take the logarithm base `c` on both sides: `log_c(n) < k`.\n    *   The loop runs as long as `q > 0`, which means it runs as long as `⌊n/c^k⌋ ≥ 1`. This implies `k ≤ log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations `k` is `floor(log_c(n))`. The number of times the loop body executes is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n    *   The body of the loop (Step 2.1) consists of `i := i + 1`, an assignment, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. These are a constant number of operations. So, the work done in each iteration is O(1).\n    *   The total time for the loop is (number of iterations) × (work per iteration) = `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Return Statement (Step 3)**\n    *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1} a_{0}))`\n    *   This step returns the array or sequence of digits. The length of this sequence is `i+1`, where `i` is the final number of iterations, `floor(log_c(n))`. This step's complexity can be considered O(1) if we only return a pointer, or `O(log_c(n))` if we consider the time to construct the output sequence. In either case, it does not exceed the complexity of the loop.\n\n4.  **Overall Complexity**\n    *   The total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of each part:\n        T(n) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n        T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))\n    *   The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    *   According to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, we ignore constant factors.\n    *   Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** This analysis assumes the uniform cost model, where basic arithmetic operations on integers that fit in a machine word are O(1). This is standard for such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is given in terms of the magnitude of the input integer `n`.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** The base of the logarithm (`c`) does not affect the asymptotic complexity class, so `O(log_c n)` is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n*   **Loop Analysis:** The key to the solution is correctly identifying that the loop variable `q` decreases by a factor of `c` in each iteration, which leads to a logarithmic number of iterations.\n\nThe final computational time complexity is determined by the `while` loop, which runs a number of times proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`. This number is `floor(log_c(n)) + 1`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
