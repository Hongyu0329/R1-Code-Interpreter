    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Terminology:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum (HIC):** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n    *   **Composant:** In a continuum $Z$, the composant of a point $p \\in Z$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $Z$ that contain $p$.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a locally compact Hausdorff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace, with the property that any continuous function from $Y$ to any compact Hausdorff space $K$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous function from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, this is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of the Remainder ($R$):**\n    *   The space $X$ can be viewed as the one-point compactification of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. This means there is a continuous map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that is the identity on $Y$ and maps the entire remainder $R$ to the single point $\\{x\\}$.\n    *   The properties of the remainder $R$ are deeply connected to the topological properties of the space $X$ around the point $x$.\n    *   A key result by H. Cook (1967) provides a precise characterization. **Cook's Theorem:** Let $X$ be a continuum and $p \\in X$. The Stone-Cech remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum if and only if $p$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $X$.\n\n3.  **Apply Properties of Hereditary Indecomposable Continua:**\n    *   We are given that $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum. This is a very strong condition.\n    *   By definition, any subcontinuum of $X$ is itself indecomposable.\n    *   Let's check the condition from Cook's theorem for our point $x \\in X$. We need to know if $x$ can be a cut point of any subcontinuum of $X$.\n    *   Let $K$ be an arbitrary subcontinuum of $X$ that contains $x$. Since $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, $K$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   A fundamental property of indecomposable continua is that they have no cut points. If a point $p$ were a cut point of an indecomposable continuum $K$, then $K \\setminus \\{p\\}$ would be a union of two disjoint non-empty open sets $A$ and $B$. Then $K$ would be the union of the two proper subcontinua $\\overline{A} \\cup \\{p\\}$ and $\\overline{B} \\cup \\{p\\}$, which contradicts the definition of indecomposability.\n    *   Therefore, the point $x$ cannot be a cut point of any subcontinuum $K$ of $X$ (as any such $K$ is indecomposable).\n\n4.  **Conclude the Nature of the Remainder ($R$):**\n    *   Since the condition for Cook's theorem is satisfied for any point $x$ in any HIC $X$, we can conclude that the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an **indecomposable continuum**.\n    *   This result holds for *any* HIC $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Composants:**\n    *   Now we need to find the number of composants of the indecomposable continuum $R$.\n    *   A standard theorem in continuum theory states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants.\n    *   More precisely, the number of composants is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Each composant is a dense $F_\\sigma$ subset of the first category, and since the entire space is of the second category, it cannot be covered by a countable number of them.\n    *   The remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate continuum (if it were a single point, $\\beta Y$ would be the one-point compactification $X$, which is not generally true).\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   For any choice of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   The number of composants of such a remainder is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. Since the number is always fixed at $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the maximum value is this same number.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum is often written as $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
