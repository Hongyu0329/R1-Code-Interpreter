    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n2.  **Define the Input and Target Sequences:**\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   The new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   We need to find `Y(k) = DFT{y(n)}`.\n\n3.  **Careful Point: Determine the length of the DFT.**\n    The question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. This is highly likely a typo. The standard procedure for such problems is to compute the N-point DFT for an N-point sequence. Therefore, we will calculate the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n\n4.  **Derive the relationship between `Y(k)` and `X(k), H(k)`:**\n    The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is defined as:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^{nk}`, where `W_N = e^{-j2\\pi/N}`.\n\n    We can split the summation into even and odd indices:\n    *   For even indices `n = 2m`: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   For odd indices `n = 2m+1`: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n    Substituting these into the DFT formula:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^{k(2m)} + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^{k(2m+1)}`\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^{2mk} + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^{(2m+1)k}`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Twiddle Factors:**\n    *   `W_8^{2mk} = (e^{-j2\\pi/8})^{2mk} = (e^{-j2\\pi/4})^{mk} = W_4^{mk}`.\n    *   `W_8^{(2m+1)k} = W_8^{2mk} * W_8^k = W_4^{mk} * W_8^k`.\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m)W_4^{mk} + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m)W_4^{mk}`\n\n    The summations are the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The result is periodic with period 4, so we denote them `X(k \\pmod 4)` and `H(k \\pmod 4)`.\n    `Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k * H(k \\pmod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n6.  **Formulate Calculation for `Y(k)`:**\n    We can split the calculation into two ranges for `k`:\n    *   **For k = 0, 1, 2, 3:**\n        `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    *   **For k = 4, 5, 6, 7:** We let `k = K+4` where `K = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n        `Y(K+4) = X(K) + W_8^{K+4} * H(K)`\n        Since `W_8^{K+4} = W_8^K * W_8^4 = W_8^K * (-1) = -W_8^K`, we have:\n        `Y(K+4) = X(K) - W_8^K * H(K)`\n\n7.  **Calculate Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`:**\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = e^{-j\\pi/4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = e^{-j3\\pi/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}`\n\n8.  **Calculate the values of `Y(k)`:**\n\n    *   **k = 0:**\n        `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n        `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n    *   **k = 1:**\n        Product term: `W_8^1 H(1) = (\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}) * (1+j) = \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}`\n        `Y(1) = X(1) + \\sqrt{2} = j + \\sqrt{2}`\n        `Y(5) = X(1) - \\sqrt{2} = j - \\sqrt{2}`\n\n    *   **k = 2:**\n        Product term: `W_8^2 H(2) = (-j) * (1) = -j`\n        `Y(2) = X(2) + (-j) = -1 - j`\n        `Y(6) = X(2) - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n    *   **k = 3:**\n        Product term: `W_8^3 H(3) = (\\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}) * (1-j) = \\frac{-1(1-j)-j(1-j)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1+j-j+j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}`\n        `Y(3) = X(3) + (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j - \\sqrt{2}`\n        `Y(7) = X(3) - (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j + \\sqrt{2}`\n\n9.  **Final Answer Compilation:**\n    Combining the calculated values for `Y(k)` from `k=0` to `k=7`:\n    `Y(0) = 1`\n    `Y(1) = \\sqrt{2} + j`\n    `Y(2) = -1 - j`\n    `Y(3) = -\\sqrt{2} - j`\n    `Y(4) = 1`\n    `Y(5) = -\\sqrt{2} + j`\n    `Y(6) = -1 + j`\n    `Y(7) = \\sqrt{2} - j`\n\nThe resulting 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`[1, \\sqrt{2}+j, -1-j, -\\sqrt{2}-j, 1, -\\sqrt{2}+j, -1+j, \\sqrt{2}-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
