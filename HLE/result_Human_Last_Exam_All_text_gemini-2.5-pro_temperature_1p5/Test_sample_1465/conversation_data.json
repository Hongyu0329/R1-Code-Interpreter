    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the `(abcdefg)` heptad repeat. Different combinations of core residues favor different packing arrangements.\n\nA key first step is to correctly identify the heptad repeat frame for each sequence by locating the pattern of hydrophobic residues.\n\n**1. Analysis of Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame.** We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. The most prominent hydrophobic residues are `I` and `L`. Let's check their positions: `I` is at position 2, and `L` is at position 6. The spacing is `i, i+4`. This corresponds to the `d` and `a` positions in a heptad repeat (`d-e-f-g-a`). We will assign `I` to the `d` position and `L` to the `a` position.\n    *   Frame assignment: `c d e f g a b`\n*   **Step 2: Identify Core Residues.** Using this frame, we can identify the residues at all 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    *   `d` positions (2, 9, 16, 23): I, I, I, I\n    *   `a` positions (6, 13, 20, 27): L, A, L, L\n*   **Step 3: Predict Oligomeric State.** The core is predominantly composed of `(a=L, d=I)` pairs. This `Leucine-Isoleucine` core is characteristic of a classic leucine zipper, which forms a **dimer (2)**. The single `Alanine` at an 'a' position is a small substitution and is unlikely to change the overall dimeric state preferred by the three other `(L,I)` pairs.\n*   **Conclusion: Dimer (2)**\n\n**2. Analysis of Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame.** The main hydrophobic residues are `I` (position 2) and `L` (position 5). The spacing is `i, i+3`, which corresponds to the `a` and `d` positions (`a-b-c-d`). We assign `I` to 'a' and `L` to 'd'.\n    *   Frame assignment: `g a b c d e f`\n*   **Step 2: Identify Core Residues.**\n    *   `a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23): I, I, N, I (Note the key substitution of Asn (N) for I)\n    *   `d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26): L, L, L, L\n*   **Step 3: Predict Oligomeric State.** The core is predominantly `(a=I, d=L)`, which is a canonical dimeric motif. Furthermore, the presence of a polar `Asn` (N) residue at an 'a' position is a very strong determinant for dimerization. The Asn side chain forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond with another Asn from the partner helix, specifically enforcing a dimeric structure.\n*   **Conclusion: Dimer (2)**\n\n**3. Analysis of Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame.** The sequence is rich in `I` and `A`. Let's check the spacing of the most hydrophobic residues, the two `Isoleucines` at positions 2 and 5. The spacing is `i, i+3`, corresponding to an `a,d` frame.\n    *   Frame assignment: `g a b c d e f`\n*   **Step 2: Identify Core Residues.**\n    *   `a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23): I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26): I, I, I, I\n*   **Step 3: Predict Oligomeric State.** The core at all layers is composed of `(a=I, d=I)`. This `Isoleucine-zipper` motif is a well-characterized structure that specifically favors the packing of four helices.\n*   **Conclusion: Tetramer (4)**\n\n**4. Analysis of Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame.** The hydrophobic residues are `I` (position 2) and `L` (position 6), with a spacing of `i, i+4`. As with sequence 1, this indicates a `d,a` frame.\n    *   Frame assignment: `c d e f g a b`\n*   **Step 2: Identify Core Residues.**\n    *   `d` positions (2, 9, 16, 23): I, I, I, I\n    *   `a` positions (6, 13, 20, 27): L, L, W, L (Note the Trp (W) substitution)\n*   **Step 3: Predict Oligomeric State.** The core is predominantly `(a=L, d=I)`, a canonical dimeric motif. The substitution of one `L` with a bulky `Trp` at an 'a' position can be accommodated within a dimeric structure. The strong preference of the other three layers for dimerization will dictate the final state.\n*   **Conclusion: Dimer (2)**\n\n**5. Analysis of Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame.** The key core-determining residues are `I` (beta-branched, hydrophobic) at position 2 and `T` (beta-branched, polar) at position 5. The `i, i+3` spacing indicates an `a,d` frame.\n    *   Frame assignment: `g a b c d e f`\n*   **Step 2: Identify Core Residues.**\n    *   `a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23): I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26): T, T, T, T\n*   **Step 3: Predict Oligomeric State.** The core is composed entirely of `(a=I, d=T)` pairs. A core containing `Threonine` (T) is known to form a specific hydrogen-bond network between the polar -OH groups of the threonine side chains. This specific network geometry is highly favorable in a parallel trimeric arrangement.\n*   **Conclusion: Trimer (3)**\n\n**Final Summary of Oligomeric States:**\n*   Sequence 1: 2 (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 2: 2 (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: 4 (Tetramer)\n*   Sequence 4: 2 (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 5: 3 (Trimer)\n\nThe final sequence of oligomeric states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
