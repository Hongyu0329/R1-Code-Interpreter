    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `A` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b \\in A`, their product `ab` is not in `A`. This can be written as `A \\cdot A \\cap A = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set (MFS):** A product-free set `A` is maximal if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set in `G`.\n*   **A set `A` fills `G`:** A subset `A` generates the group `G`, i.e., `<A> = G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called filled if every maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\n### **Step 2: Find a usable criterion for a group to be filled**\n\nThe definition of a filled group is cumbersome to work with directly. We will use a known characterization of filled groups, established by L. Babai and I. Pak (2001).\n\n**Theorem (Characterization of Filled Groups):**\nA finite group `G` is filled if and only if one of the following conditions holds:\n1.  The order of `G` is odd.\n2.  `G` is the cyclic group `C_2`.\n3.  `G` has a unique element of order 2 (an involution), let's call it `z`, and the set `S = \\{g \\in G \\mid g^2 = z\\}` generates `G` (i.e., `<S> = G`).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the structure of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`**\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian filled groups `G` where `|G| = 2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m \\ge 1`.\n\n*   The order `|G| = 2q^m` is even. Therefore, condition (1) of the theorem does not apply.\n*   Since `q` is an odd prime and `m \\ge 1`, `q^m \\ge 3`. Thus, `|G| = 2q^m \\ge 6`. This means `G` cannot be `C_2`, so condition (2) does not apply.\n*   Therefore, if such a group `G` exists, it must satisfy condition (3) of the theorem.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of `G` using Sylow's theorems.\n*   Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. `n_q` must divide 2 and `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}`. Since `q` is an odd prime (`q \\ge 3`), `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}` implies `n_q \\ne 2`. Thus, `n_q` must be 1. This means there is a unique Sylow `q`-subgroup, which must be a normal subgroup. Let's call this normal subgroup `Q`. We have `|Q| = q^m`.\n*   Let `P` be any Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P|=2`. So `P` is a cyclic group of order 2.\n*   Since `Q` is a normal subgroup, `Q \\cap P = \\{1\\}` and `G = QP`, the group `G` is a semidirect product `G = Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2`.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the conditions for a filled group**\n\nWe now apply condition (3) from the theorem to our group `G = Q \\rtimes C_2`.\n\n**Part A: `G` must have a unique involution.**\n\n*   An element of `G` has order 2 if and only if it is an involution.\n*   The number of involutions is related to the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, `n_2`. If `n_2 > 1`, `G` has more than one subgroup of order 2, and thus more than one involution.\n*   For `G` to have a unique involution, it must have a unique subgroup of order 2. This means `n_2` must be 1.\n*   If `n_2 = 1`, the Sylow 2-subgroup `P` is normal in `G`.\n*   We have that both `Q` and `P` are normal subgroups of `G`. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial (`Q \\cap P = \\{1\\}`). In any group, if two normal subgroups intersect trivially, their elements commute.\n*   This implies that for any `k \\in Q` and `p \\in P`, we have `kp=pk`. This means the semidirect product is a direct product.\n*   So, for `G` to have a unique involution, it must be isomorphic to the direct product `G \\cong Q \\times P \\cong Q \\times C_2`.\n*   In `G = Q \\times C_2`, an element `(k, p)` has order 2 if `(k,p)^2 = (k^2, p^2) = (1_Q, 1_{C_2})` and `(k,p) \\ne (1_Q, 1_{C_2})`. Since `|Q|=q^m` is odd, `k^2=1_Q` implies `k=1_Q`. So, the only elements of order 2 are of the form `(1_Q, p)` where `p^2=1_{C_2}` and `p \\ne 1_{C_2}`. There is only one such element in `C_2`.\n*   Thus, `G = Q \\times C_2` has a unique involution, namely `z = (1_Q, p)` where `p` is the non-identity element of `C_2`. The condition that `G` is nonabelian implies that `Q` must be a nonabelian group.\n\n**Part B: `<S> = G` where `S = \\{g \\in G \\mid g^2=z\\}$**\n\n*   We have established that any potential nonabelian filled group of this order must be of the form `G = Q \\times C_2`, and its unique involution is `z = (1_Q, p)`.\n*   Now we must check the second part of condition (3): the set `S` of \"square roots\" of `z` must generate `G`.\n*   Let `g = (k, c)` be an element of `G`, where `k \\in Q` and `c \\in C_2 = \\{1, p\\}`.\n*   We want to find all `g` such that `g^2=z`.\n    `g^2 = (k,c)^2 = (k^2, c^2)`.\n    `g^2 = z = (1_Q, p)`.\n*   This requires `k^2 = 1_Q` and `c^2 = p`.\n*   In the group `C_2 = \\{1, p\\}`, the squares are `1^2=1` and `p^2=1`. There is no element `c` such that `c^2=p`.\n*   Therefore, the condition `c^2=p` has no solution for `c` in `C_2`.\n*   This means there are no elements `g` in `G` such that `g^2=z`. The set `S` is empty.\n*   The subgroup generated by the empty set is the trivial subgroup, `<s> = <\\emptyset> = \\{1_G\\}`.\n*   This is not equal to `G`, as `|G| \\ge 6`.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nA nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` must be of the form `G = Q \\times C_2` to satisfy the unique involution property required for a filled group. However, such a group fails the second property, as the set of square roots of the unique involution is empty and cannot generate `G`.\nTherefore, no nonabelian group of order `2q^m` can be a filled group.\n\nThe set of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` is the empty set.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
