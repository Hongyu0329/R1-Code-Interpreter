    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval [a, b], a circle, a sphere, or a square.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. The interval [0, 1] is nondegenerate, while the single point {0} is degenerate.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum which is itself a continuum. For example, [0, 1/2] is a subcontinuum of [0, 1].\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. Two points `p` and `q` are in the same composant if and only if there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. The set of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Number of Composants to the Structure of the Continuum\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum depends critically on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, say `X = A ∪ B`.\n    *   **Key Property:** If a continuum `X` is decomposable, it has exactly **one** composant. This is because for any two points `p, q` in a decomposable continuum, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both. Therefore, all points belong to the same composant, which must be the entire space `X`.\n\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable. A famous example is the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Key Property:** For an indecomposable continuum `X`, the composants are pairwise disjoint, dense subsets of `X`. The number of composants is equal to the cardinality of the space, `|X|`.\n    *   **Cardinality of a Nondegenerate Continuum:** Any nondegenerate continuum is a compact connected metric space with at least two points. Such a space must have the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by **c** (the size of the set of real numbers). This is because it is a perfect set (no isolated points) and separable, which implies its cardinality is **c**.\n\nSo, to find the number of composants of a product `X × Y`, we first need to determine if `X × Y` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Decomposability of a Product Space\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem concerning the decomposability of a product of continua:\n\n**Theorem:** The product `X × Y` of two continua `X` and `Y` is decomposable if and only if at least one of the factor spaces, `X` or `Y`, is decomposable.\n\nThis means the product `X × Y` is indecomposable if and only if *both* `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Possible Cases to Find the Maximum\n\nWe want to find the *largest possible* number of composants for the product `Z = X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\n**Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\nLet's assume `X` is decomposable. By the theorem from Step 3, the product `Z = X × Y` is also decomposable.\nAs established in Step 2, any decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\nAn example is `X = [0, 1]` and `Y = [0, 1]`. Both are decomposable, so their product, the unit square, is decomposable and has only 1 composant.\n\n**Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\nThe problem asks for the *largest possible* number, so we must consider this case. We can choose `X` and `Y` to be any two nondegenerate indecomposable continua (for instance, two pseudo-arcs).\n*   According to the theorem in Step 3, since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, their product `Z = X × Y` is also indecomposable.\n*   As established in Step 2, the number of composants of an indecomposable continuum is equal to its cardinality.\n*   We need to find the cardinality of `Z = X × Y`.\n    *   Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua, their cardinalities are `|X| = c` and `|Y| = c`.\n    *   The cardinality of the Cartesian product is `|X × Y| = |X| × |Y| = c × c = c`.\n*   Therefore, the number of composants of `Z = X × Y` in this case is **c**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the two possible cases, we found that the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua can be either 1 or **c**. The question asks for the largest possible number. Comparing 1 and **c**, the largest value is **c**.\n\n---\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
