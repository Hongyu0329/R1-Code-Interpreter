    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a fundamental concept in fixed-point theory, particularly for systems of nonlinear equations. Finding the conditions for its existence involves extending classical fixed-point theorems to a system of three functions over three different spaces.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine these conditions.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nGiven three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, and three functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note the specific order of the variables in the arguments of each function. This structure is crucial for the analysis. `G` takes its primary variable `y` as both its first and third argument, while `H` takes its arguments in the order `z, y, x`.\n\n### **Step 2: Reframe the Problem using an Operator on a Product Space**\n\nThe core strategy to solve this is to transform the problem of finding a tripled fixed point for three functions into a standard fixed-point problem for a single operator on a product space. This allows us to use well-known theorems like the Banach Contraction Principle.\n\n1.  **Define the Spaces:** We assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are **complete metric spaces**. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point within the space.\n2.  **Define the Product Space:** Construct the Cartesian product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n3.  **Define a Metric on the Product Space:** We can equip `W` with a metric. A common and convenient choice is the **maximum metric**:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = max{ d_X(x₁, x₂), d_Y(y₁, y₂), d_Z(z₁, z₂) }`\n    If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(W, d_W)` is also a complete metric space.\n4.  **Define a Single Operator:** Define an operator `T: W → W` that encapsulates the entire system:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ W` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is precisely the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Banach Contraction Principle**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the conditions under which the operator `T` has a fixed point. The **Banach Contraction Principle** provides a powerful set of sufficient conditions. It states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point.\n\nA mapping `T` is a **contraction** if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` (called a contraction constant) such that for any two points `w₁`, `w₂` in the space `W`:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's translate this condition into requirements for our functions `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\nLet `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`.\nThe left-hand side of the inequality is:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) = max{ d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)), d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)), d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) }`\n\n### **Step 4: Formulate the Contraction Conditions for F, G, and H**\n\nWe need to impose conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H` such that the combined operator `T` becomes a contraction. A standard way to do this is to assume each function is a Lipschitz-type mapping with respect to its arguments.\n\nAssume there exist non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that for all relevant inputs:\n1.  **For F:** `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  **For G:** `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, v₁), G(y₂, x₂, v₂)) ≤ b₁d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₃d_Y(v₁, v₂)`\n3.  **For H:** `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the distance calculation for `T`:\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n`d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ b₁d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₃d_Y(y₁, y₂) = b₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + (b₁+b₃)d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n`d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\nLet `δ = d_W(w₁, w₂) = max{d_X(x₁, x₂), d_Y(y₁, y₂), d_Z(z₁, z₂)}`. This implies `d_X ≤ δ`, `d_Y ≤ δ`, and `d_Z ≤ δ`.\nUsing this, we can bound each term:\n*   `d_X(F(...)) ≤ a₁δ + a₂δ + a₃δ = (a₁ + a₂ + a₃)δ`\n*   `d_Y(G(...)) ≤ b₂δ + (b₁ + b₃)δ = (b₁ + b₂ + b₃)δ`\n*   `d_Z(H(...)) ≤ c₁δ + c₂δ + c₃δ = (c₁ + c₂ + c₃)δ`\n\nSo, `d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂))` is the maximum of these three terms:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ max{ (a₁ + a₂ + a₃)δ, (b₁ + b₂ + b₃)δ, (c₁ + c₂ + c₃)δ }`\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ max{ (a₁ + a₂ + a₃), (b₁ + b₂ + b₃), (c₁ + c₂ + c₃) } * δ`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, its contraction constant `k` must be less than 1. Therefore, we require:\n`k = max{ (a₁ + a₂ + a₃), (b₁ + b₂ + b₃), (c₁ + c₂ + c₃) } < 1`\n\n### **Final Conditions**\n\nBased on the analysis above, a sufficient set of conditions for the functions F, G, and H to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is as follows:\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are non-empty **complete metric spaces**.\n\n2.  **Contraction Conditions:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` are continuous and satisfy the following Lipschitz-type conditions for some non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ`:\n    *   For `F`: For all `(x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂) ∈ X × Y × Z`,\n        `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   For `G`: For all `(y₁, x₁, v₁), (y₂, x₂, v₂) ∈ Y × X × Y`,\n        `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, v₁), G(y₂, x₂, v₂)) ≤ b₁d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₃d_Y(v₁, v₂)`\n    *   For `H`: For all `(z₁, y₁, x₁), (z₂, y₂, x₂) ∈ Z × Y × X`,\n        `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Constant Condition:** The sum of the coefficients for each function must be such that their maximum is strictly less than 1:\n    `max{ (a₁ + a₂ + a₃), (b₁ + b₂ + b₃), (c₁ + c₂ + c₃) } < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are met, the Banach Contraction Principle guarantees that there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty, complete metric spaces.\n2.  The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a joint contraction mapping condition on the product space `X × Y × Z`.\nA sufficient realization of this condition is that there exist non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that for all inputs:\n    a) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, v₁), G(y₂, x₂, v₂)) ≤ b₁d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₃d_Y(v₁, v₂)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  The contraction constant `k = max{ (a₁+a₂+a₃), (b₁+b₂+b₃), (c₁+c₂+c₃) }` must be strictly less than 1.>>>"
