    "An HSS (Hierarchical Semi-Separable) matrix has a recursive block `2x2` structure. A matrix `A` corresponding to a node in the HSS tree is partitioned as:\n`A = [ A_11  A_12 ]`\n    `[ A_21  A_22 ]`\nwhere `A_11` and `A_22` are the diagonal blocks (which are themselves HSS matrices), and `A_12` and `A_21` are the off-diagonal blocks, which are represented in a low-rank format (e.g., `A_12 = U_1 * V_2^T`).\n\nThe problem asks for the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two HSS matrices, `C = A * B`, where the associated tree has a depth of 4. We interpret \"submatrices accessed\" as the number of block matrix multiplications performed in the standard fast algorithm for HSS matrix multiplication.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the Tree Structure and Problem:**\n    *   A tree of depth `d=4` has `d+1=5` levels of nodes, which we can index from `l=0` (root) to `l=4` (leaves).\n    *   A node at level `l < 4` corresponds to an HSS submatrix.\n    *   A node at level `l = 4` (a leaf) corresponds to a standard dense matrix block.\n    *   The overall problem is to find the number of block multiplications to compute `C = A * B`, where `A` and `B` are HSS matrices corresponding to the root of a depth-4 tree.\n\n2.  **Formulate Recurrence Relations:**\n    The fast HSS multiplication algorithm is recursive. We can define two recurrence relations:\n    *   Let `M(k)` be the number of multiplications required to multiply two HSS matrices whose corresponding tree has depth `k`.\n    *   Let `V(k)` be the number of multiplications for the product of a depth-`k` HSS matrix and a dense matrix (like a generator `U` or `V`).\n\n3.  **Derive the Recurrence for V(k):**\n    Consider the multiplication `Y = H_k * X`, where `H_k` is an HSS matrix of depth `k` and `X` is a dense matrix. Partitioning `H_k` and `X`, we get:\n    `Y = [ Y_1 ] = [ H_{k-1}   U_1 V_2^T ] * [ X_1 ]`\n        `[ Y_2 ]   [ U_2 V_1^T   H'_{k-1} ]   [ X_2 ]`\n    This expands to:\n    `Y_1 = H_{k-1} * X_1 + U_1 * (V_2^T * X_2)`\n    `Y_2 = H'_{k-1} * X_2 + U_2 * (V_1^T * X_1)`\n    Counting the multiplications:\n    *   Two recursive calls for HSS-dense product: `H_{k-1} * X_1` and `H'_{k-1} * X_2`, contributing `2 * V(k-1)`.\n    *   Four dense matrix multiplications involving the generators: `(V_2^T * X_2)`, `U_1 * (...)`, `(V_1^T * X_1)`, and `U_2 * (...)`. This adds 4 multiplications.\n    The recurrence is `V(k) = 2 * V(k-1) + 4`.\n    **Base Case (k=0):** A depth-0 HSS matrix is a single dense block `D`. The product `D * X` is one multiplication. So, `V(0) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Recurrence for M(k):**\n    Consider the multiplication `C_k = A_k * B_k`. The `2x2` block multiplication is:\n    `C_11 = A_{11} * B_{11} + A_{12} * B_{21}`\n    `C_12 = A_{11} * B_{12} + A_{12} * B_{22}`\n    And similarly for `C_21` and `C_22`.\n    Let's count the multiplications for `C_k`:\n    *   **Diagonal Blocks (`C_11`, `C_22`):**\n        *   The terms `A_{11} * B_{11}` and `A_{22} * B_{22}` are recursive HSS multiplications of depth `k-1`, contributing `2 * M(k-1)`.\n        *   The terms `A_{12} * B_{21}` and `A_{21} * B_{12}` are products of low-rank blocks. For instance, `A_{12} * B_{21} = (U_{A1}V_{A2}^T) * (U_{B2}V_{B1}^T) = U_{A1} * (V_{A2}^T U_{B2}) * V_{B1}^T`. This requires one multiplication of small (`rank x rank`) matrices. There are two such terms, one for `C_11` and one for `C_22`. This adds 2 multiplications.\n    *   **Off-Diagonal Blocks (`C_12`, `C_21`):**\n        *   Consider `C_12`. The term `A_{11} * B_{12} = A_{11} * (U_{B1}V_{B2}^T) = (A_{11} * U_{B1}) * V_{B2}^T` requires one HSS-dense multiplication (`A_{11} * U_{B1}`), contributing `V(k-1)`.\n        *   The term `A_{12} * B_{22} = (U_{A1}V_{A2}^T) * B_{22} = U_{A1} * (V_{A2}^T * B_{22})` also requires one HSS-dense multiplication, contributing `V(k-1)`.\n        *   Thus, computing `C_12` costs `2 * V(k-1)`. The same applies to `C_21`.\n        *   Total for off-diagonal blocks is `4 * V(k-1)`.\n    The full recurrence is `M(k) = 2 * M(k-1) + 4 * V(k-1) + 2`.\n    **Base Case (k=0):** The multiplication `A_0 * B_0` is a single dense block product `D_A * D_B`. So, `M(0) = 1`.\n\n5.  **Solve the Recurrences for Depth d=4:**\n    We need to compute `M(4)`.\n    *   **Solving for V(k):**\n        *   `V(0) = 1`\n        *   `V(1) = 2 * V(0) + 4 = 2 * 1 + 4 = 6`\n        *   `V(2) = 2 * V(1) + 4 = 2 * 6 + 4 = 16`\n        *   `V(3) = 2 * V(2) + 4 = 2 * 16 + 4 = 36`\n        *   `V(4) = 2 * V(3) + 4 = 2 * 36 + 4 = 76`\n\n    *   **Solving for M(k):**\n        *   `M(0) = 1`\n        *   `M(1) = 2*M(0) + 4*V(0) + 2 = 2*1 + 4*1 + 2 = 8`\n        *   `M(2) = 2*M(1) + 4*V(1) + 2 = 2*8 + 4*6 + 2 = 16 + 24 + 2 = 42`\n        *   `M(3) = 2*M(2) + 4*V(2) + 2 = 2*42 + 4*16 + 2 = 84 + 64 + 2 = 150`\n        *   `M(4) = 2*M(3) + 4*V(3) + 2 = 2*150 + 4*36 + 2 = 300 + 144 + 2 = 446`\n\nThe total number of submatrix multiplications for a depth 4 tree is `M(4)`.\n\n<<<446>>>"
