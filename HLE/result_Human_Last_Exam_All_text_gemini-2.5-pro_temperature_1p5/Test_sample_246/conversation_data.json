    "Answering this question requires combining several results from knot theory and the study of branched covers. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the manifold and the relevant formula for its fundamental group.\n\nThe manifold in question, let's call it $M$, is the **double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil**.\n\n*   Let $K_0$ be the trefoil knot ($3_1$) in $S^3$.\n*   Let $K = \\tau_5(K_0)$ be the 2-knot in $S^4$ obtained by 5-twist-spinning the trefoil knot.\n*   The manifold $M$ is the 2-fold (or double) branched cover of $S^4$ with branch set $K$. We denote this by $M = \\Sigma_2(S^4, K)$.\n\nFor a 2-knot $K$ in $S^4$, the fundamental group of its $n$-fold cyclic branched cover $M_n = \\Sigma_n(S^4, K)$ can be computed from the Alexander module of $K$. The Alexander module of $K$, denoted $A_K$, is a module over the ring of Laurent polynomials $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]$. The fundamental group is given by the formula:\n$$ \\pi_1(M_n) \\cong A_K / (t^n-1)A_K $$\nIn our case, $n=2$ (a double cover), so we have:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong A_K / (t^2-1)A_K $$\nThe Alexander module $A_K$ is defined as $H_1(C)$, the first homology of the infinite cyclic cover of the knot complement $S^4 \\setminus K$. For most knots, including this one, $A_K$ is a quotient of the ring $\\Lambda$, namely $A_K \\cong \\Lambda / \\langle \\Delta_K(t) \\rangle$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of the 2-knot $K$.\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for $\\pi_1(M)$, we find that $\\pi_1(M)$ is isomorphic to the additive group of the following quotient ring:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}] / \\langle \\Delta_K(t), t^2-1 \\rangle $$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Alexander polynomial of the 5-twist-spun trefoil.\n\nWe need to find the Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_K(t)$ of the 2-knot $K = \\tau_5(3_1)$.\nThere is a formula for the Alexander polynomial of a twist-spun knot derived from a fibered knot. The trefoil knot is a fibered knot.\nThe formula, given by Teragaito, states that for a fibered knot $K_0$ with Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_{K_0}(t)$ and leading coefficient $\\sigma$, the Alexander polynomial of its $m$-twist spin $\\tau_m(K_0)$ is:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\tau_m(K_0)}(t) = \\Delta_{K_0}(t) \\cdot \\frac{t^m - \\sigma}{t - \\sigma} $$\n1.  **Alexander polynomial of the trefoil ($K_0=3_1$)**: The standard (non-symmetrized) Alexander polynomial of the (left-handed) trefoil is $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t^2 - t + 1$.\n2.  **Leading coefficient**: The leading coefficient is $\\sigma = 1$.\n3.  **Number of twists**: We are given $m=5$.\n\nPlugging these into the formula, we get the Alexander polynomial for our 2-knot $K = \\tau_5(3_1)$:\n$$ \\Delta_K(t) = (t^2 - t + 1) \\cdot \\frac{t^5 - 1}{t - 1} $$\nSince $\\frac{t^5 - 1}{t - 1} = t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta_K(t) = (t^2 - t + 1)(t^4 + t^3 + t^2 + t + 1) $$\n\n### Step 3: Compute the fundamental group.\n\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is an abelian group, whose structure we can determine from the quotient ring $\\mathbb{Z}[t] / \\langle \\Delta_K(t), t^2-1 \\rangle$. The order of this group is given by the absolute value of the resultant of the two polynomials, $\\Delta_K(t)$ and $t^2-1$. This can be calculated as:\n$$ |\\pi_1(M)| = |\\text{Resultant}(\\Delta_K(t), t^2-1)| = |\\Delta_K(1) \\cdot \\Delta_K(-1)| $$\nLet's compute these values:\n*   $\\Delta_K(1) = ((1)^2 - 1 + 1) \\cdot (1+1+1+1+1) = 1 \\cdot 5 = 5$.\n*   $\\Delta_K(-1) = ((-1)^2 - (-1) + 1) \\cdot ((-1)^4 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (-1) + 1) = (1+1+1) \\cdot (1-1+1-1+1) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3$.\n\nSo, the order of the fundamental group is:\n$$ |\\pi_1(M)| = |5 \\cdot 3| = 15 $$\nSince $\\pi_1(M)$ is an abelian group of order 15, and $15=3 \\cdot 5$ is a product of distinct primes, the group must be cyclic and isomorphic to the group of integers modulo 15:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{15} $$\n\n### Step 4: Find the minimal number of generators.\n\nThe final step is to determine the minimal number of generators for the group $\\mathbb{Z}_{15}$. A cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is, by definition, generated by a single element (any element coprime to $n$). Therefore, the minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_{15}$ is 1.\n\nFinal conclusion: The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 1."
