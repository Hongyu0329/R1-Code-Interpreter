    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl Compound:** Pivalaldehyde, which is also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The carbonyl group is an aldehyde.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This is the P(C₆H₅)₃ (or PPh₃) part, with phosphorus in the +5 oxidation state characteristic of an ylide.\n        *   `ethylidene`: This refers to a two-carbon chain attached via a double bond to the phosphorus, so P=CH-CH₃.\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: This indicates that a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene chain.\n        *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is: PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chlorine is at the 2-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Type of Wittig Reagent:**\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on whether the ylide is stabilized or non-stabilized.\n    *   An ylide is stabilized if the carbon atom bearing the negative charge (in the resonance form Ph₃P⁺-C⁻R₂) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, CO₂R).\n    *   In our ylide, PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), the carbon attached to the phosphorus is a CH group. This carbon is not adjacent to any electron-withdrawing or resonance-stabilizing group. (The phenyl ring is on the β-carbon, not the α-carbon, so it does not stabilize the carbanion via resonance).\n    *   Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\n3.  **Predict the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The general rule for Wittig reactions is:\n        *   **Non-stabilized ylides** react under kinetic control to predominantly form the **(Z)-alkene** (cis).\n        *   **Stabilized ylides** react under thermodynamic control to predominantly form the **(E)-alkene** (trans).\n    *   Since we have a non-stabilized ylide, the major product will be the (Z)-alkene.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Reaction and Product:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen (O) of the aldehyde with the alkylidene portion (=CR¹R²) of the ylide.\n    *   Reactants: (CH₃)₃C-CH=**O** + **Ph₃P=CH**-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n    *   The reaction will form a new double bond between the aldehyde carbon and the ylide carbon.\n    *   The by-product is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n    *   Product skeleton: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The alkene product is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n    *   We need to assign the correct stereochemistry, which we determined to be (Z).\n    *   To assign Z/E configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the substituents on each carbon of the double bond:\n        *   On one carbon: A tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) and a hydrogen atom (-H). The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n        *   On the other carbon: A 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)) and a hydrogen atom (-H). The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority.\n    *   In the **(Z)-isomer**, the two higher-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-chlorobenzyl) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the major product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Correct Interpretation of Nomenclature:** Accurately translating the chemical names into structures is the crucial first step. The name of the Wittig reagent is complex and must be parsed carefully.\n*   **Ylide Classification:** The distinction between stabilized and non-stabilized ylides is the key to predicting the stereochemical outcome. The position of substituents relative to the P=C bond is critical.\n*   **Stereochemistry Rules:** Remembering that non-stabilized ylides lead to (Z)-alkenes is fundamental. While steric hindrance (from the bulky tert-butyl group) can sometimes reduce the selectivity, the (Z)-isomer is still the expected major product under standard conditions.\n*   **Product Naming:** The final IUPAC name must correctly reflect the structure, including the chain numbering, substituent positions, and the stereochemical descriptor (Z).\n\n**Final Product:** The reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane yields (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene as the major product.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
