    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino acid repeating pattern, denoted `abcdefg`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core interface where the helices pack together. To determine the oligomeric state, we first need to correctly assign this pattern to the given sequence.\n\nSequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nLet's test possible registers (or frames) for the heptad repeat by looking for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. A hydrophobic residue at position `x` in the `a` role would be followed by another hydrophobic residue at `x+3` in the `d` role.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Let's assume the Alanine (A) at position 4 is in an `a` position.\n    *   Position 4 -> `a`\n    *   Position 4+3 = 7 (Leucine, L) -> `d`\n    *   Position 4+7 = 11 (Alanine, A) -> `a`\n    *   Position 7+7 = 14 (Leucine, L) -> `d`\n    *   Position 11+7 = 18 (Alanine, A) -> `a`\n    *   Position 14+7 = 21 (Leucine, L) -> `d`\n    *   Position 18+7 = 25 (Alanine, A) -> `a`\n    *   Position 21+7 = 28 (Leucine, L) -> `d`\n\nThis assignment creates a perfectly consistent hydrophobic core. A, A, A, A are at the `a` positions, and L, L, L, L are at the `d` positions. Alanine and Leucine are both classic hydrophobic core residues. This is a very strong candidate for the correct register.\n\nLet's map out all positions based on this register (`a` at position 4):\n\n| Heptad Position | Residues in the Sequence                                     |\n| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`a` (core)**  | A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25)                                   |\n| **`d` (core)**  | L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28)                                   |\n| `b` (exposed)   | Q(5), K(12), W(19), Q(26)                                   |\n| `c` (exposed)   | S(6), S(13), S(20), S(27)                                   |\n| `e` (flanking)  | K(8), K(15), K(22), K(29)                                   |\n| `f` (exposed)   | E(2), E(9), E(16), E(23)                                    |\n| `g` (flanking)  | I(3), I(10), I(17), I(24)                                   |\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d`) for Packing Propensity**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state due to packing constraints (\"knobs-into-holes\").\n\n*   **`a` positions are all Alanine (Ala, A).** Alanine is a small, non-branched hydrophobic residue.\n*   **`d` positions are all Leucine (Leu, L).** Leucine is a larger, branched hydrophobic residue.\n\nLet's consider the established rules for oligomerization based on core residues:\n*   **Dimers (State = 2):** Often have Leucine at the `d` position (as in a \"Leucine Zipper\"). The `a` position can be a variety of hydrophobic residues. The combination of a small residue like Alanine at `a` and a larger one like Leucine at `d` packs very efficiently in a parallel dimeric coiled-coil. The small Alanine \"knobs\" fit neatly into the holes created by the surrounding residues without steric hindrance.\n*   **Trimers (State = 3):** Are strongly favored when a beta-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) is at the `a` position (e.g., `a`=Ile, `d`=Leu). The branching at the β-carbon creates steric bulk that fits better in the geometry of a trimer than a dimer. This sequence has Alanine at `a`, which lacks this steric property and thus does not favor a trimer.\n*   **Tetramers (State = 4):** Are often stabilized by patterns like `a`=Ile, `d`=Ile or `a`=Leu, `d`=Ile. Again, this highlights the importance of the bulky, β-branched Isoleucine, which is absent from the core `a` and `d` positions in our sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Flanking Residues (`e` and `g`)**\n\nThe `e` and `g` positions flank the hydrophobic core and can influence stability and specificity through electrostatic (salt bridge) or additional hydrophobic interactions.\n\n*   `g` positions are all Isoleucine (Ile, I).\n*   `e` positions are all Lysine (Lys, K).\n\nThe `g` positions are occupied by a strongly hydrophobic, beta-branched residue (Isoleucine). In a dimeric structure, the `g` residue is positioned on the edge of the hydrophobic interface, where its side chain can contribute to the overall hydrophobic stabilization. While hydrophobic residues at `g` can sometimes favor higher-order oligomers, this is usually in concert with core (`a`, `d`) residues that are also permissive or favorable for that state. Here, the `a`=Ala core strongly disfavors a trimer, making it highly unlikely that the `g`=Ile would override this.\n\nThe `g-e'` interaction (between a `g` residue on one helix and an `e` residue on the opposing helix) is also important. Here it would be an Ile-Lys interaction, which is a mix of hydrophobic and charged character, providing some stability but not a strong driving force for a specific oligomeric state like a complementary Glu-Lys salt bridge would.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Most Likely Oligomeric State**\n\nThe primary determinant is the `a`=Ala, `d`=Leu core. This combination strongly favors a dimeric structure due to optimal packing efficiency. The small Alanine at the `a` position does not provide the necessary steric bulk to favor a trimer or tetramer. The other residues are consistent with a stable, parallel dimeric coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the protein would most likely form a dimer, which corresponds to an oligomeric state of 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
