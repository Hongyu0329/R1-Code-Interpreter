    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of Ming Dynasty rule over Vietnam (then known as Jiaozhi) and the subsequent Vietnamese rebellion. The most significant conflict during this time was the Lam Sơn Uprising, led by Lê Lợi from 1418 to 1427. General Mu Sheng (沐晟) was one of the key Ming commanders tasked with suppressing this uprising.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:** Mu Sheng participated in the initial Ming invasion in 1406-1407, which was successful. The \"defeat\" mentioned in the question must refer to the later Lam Sơn Uprising. During this period, the Ming forces suffered several major losses. We need to identify the one that was Mu Sheng's first major personal defeat as a commanding general.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Other Major Defeats:** A catastrophic defeat for the Ming army occurred at the **Battle of Tốt Động–Chúc Động** in November 1426. However, the Ming commander in that battle was Wang Tong (王通), not Mu Sheng. Therefore, this is not the correct event.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Decisive Campaign of 1427:** In late 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two massive relief armies to break the Vietnamese siege of Đông Quan (modern Hanoi).\n    *   Army 1: Led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), advancing from Guangxi.\n    *   Army 2: Led by General **Mu Sheng**, advancing from Yunnan.\n    This was Mu Sheng's most significant command during the war.\n\n5.  **Identify Mu Sheng's Defeat:**\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was famously ambushed and annihilated at the **Battle of Chi Lăng–Xương Giang**. This was a huge defeat for the Ming, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat, not Mu Sheng's.\n    *   Simultaneously, Mu Sheng's army was advancing from Yunnan. The Vietnamese forces, under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, were sent to intercept him. They blocked Mu Sheng's path at the strategic locations of **Lãnh Câu** and **Khâu Cấp**.\n    *   When news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction reached Mu Sheng's camp, his army's morale collapsed. Fearing a similar fate, Mu Sheng abandoned the campaign and ordered a panicked retreat back to Yunnan. During this retreat, his army was pursued and attacked by the Vietnamese, suffering heavy losses.\n\n6.  **Characterize the Event as a \"Major Defeat\":** The complete failure of his relief expedition, the inability to engage the enemy on his own terms, the panicked retreat, and the significant casualties suffered during the pursuit collectively constitute a \"major defeat\" for Mu Sheng as the commanding general. This was his first such definitive failure in a major campaign during this war.\n\n7.  **Locate the Battlefield in Modern Vietnam:** The key locations where Mu Sheng's army was stopped and his defeat began were the passes at Lãnh Câu and Khâu Cấp. Historical-geographical sources place these sites in the territory of modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between generals:** It's crucial to differentiate between the defeats of different Ming generals. The most famous Ming defeat at Chi Lăng was Liu Sheng's, not Mu Sheng's.\n*   **Defining \"defeat\":** Mu Sheng's defeat was not a single, pitched battle where his army was routed, but rather the strategic failure of his entire campaign, initiated by being blocked and culminating in a disastrous retreat with heavy losses. This is still considered a major military defeat.\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Geography:** The final step is to accurately map the historical battlefield names (Lãnh Câu, Khâu Cấp) to a current Vietnamese province.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe campaign in late 1427 was Mu Sheng's major command in the war. He was decisively stopped by Vietnamese forces, and upon learning of the other Ming army's demise, his force collapsed and was routed during its retreat. This series of events, beginning with the interception at Lãnh Câu and Khâu Cấp, constitutes his first major defeat. These historical locations are in what is now Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
