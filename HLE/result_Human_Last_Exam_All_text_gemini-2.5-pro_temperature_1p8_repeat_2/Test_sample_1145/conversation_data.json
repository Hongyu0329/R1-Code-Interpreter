    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n*   **Box Dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle in the specific, narrow interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Wave Function:** The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n    For the `n = 2` state, the wave function is:\n    `ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`\n\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle per unit length at a position `x` is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψn(x)|²`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\n*   **Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being within a certain interval `[x₁, x₂]`, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    `Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx = ∫[x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**3. Careful Point: Analyze the Interval and State**\n\n*   The interval is `[0.495a, 0.505a]`.\n*   The center of this interval is `(0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small fraction of the total box length `a`.\n*   For the `n = 2` state, let's check the value of the wave function at the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`:\n    `ψ₂(0.5a) = √(2/a) * sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = √(2/a) * sin(π) = 0`.\n*   This means `x = 0.5a` is a **node**. The probability density `P(x)` is exactly zero at this point. Since the interval is centered on a point of zero probability, we expect the total probability to be very small, but not exactly zero (unless the interval width is zero).\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Integral**\n\nWe need to compute:\n`Prob = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`.\nHere, `θ = 2πx/a`, so `2θ = 4πx/a`.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n`Prob = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [1/2 * (1 - cos(4πx/a))] dx`\n`Prob = (1/a) * ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx`\n\nNow, perform the integration:\n`∫ (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx = x - (a/4π) * sin(4πx/a)`\n\nEvaluate the definite integral:\n`Prob = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π) * sin(4πx/a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n`Prob = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }`\n`Prob = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }`\n\nFactor out `a`:\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n\n**5. Evaluate the Sine Terms and Final Calculation**\n\nWe use the properties of the sine function: `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`.\n*   `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n*   `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstitute these back into the expression for the probability:\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]`\n`Prob = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\nSince `0.02π` is a small angle, we can use the Taylor series approximation for sine: `sin(θ) ≈ θ - θ³/6`. Let `δ = 0.02π`.\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * (δ - δ³/6)`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * (0.02π - (0.02π)³/6)`\n`Prob ≈ 0.01 - [0.01 - (0.02π)²/12]`\n`Prob ≈ (0.02π)² / 12 = (0.0004π²) / 12 = π² / 30000`\n\nNow, we calculate the final numerical value:\n`Prob ≈ (3.14159)² / 30000 ≈ 9.8696 / 30000 ≈ 0.00032898...`\n\nThis is the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final answer is the numerical value we just calculated.\n`Prob ≈ 0.000329`\n\n<<<0.000329>>>"
