    "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The set of all automorphisms of a graph $\\gamma$ forms a group, denoted $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. We are looking for the smallest number of edges $e$ in a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ for which $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\nLet the automorphism group be $G = \\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. We are given that $|G|=3$. Since 3 is a prime number, $G$ must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $C_3$. Let $\\phi$ be a generator of this group, so $\\phi$ is an automorphism of order 3, and the three automorphisms are the identity ($id$), $\\phi$, and $\\phi^2$.\n\nThe group $G$ acts on the set of vertices $V$. The vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into orbits under this group action. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, orbits can have size 1 (fixed points) or size 3.\n\nLet's try to construct such a graph with a small number of vertices and edges.\nA known result by Babai states that the minimum number of vertices for a graph with automorphism group $C_3$ is 9. Let's denote the minimum number of vertices for a group $G$ by $\\nu(G)$, so $\\nu(C_3)=9$. Let's assume this result.\n\nSince the graph must have at least 9 vertices, let's analyze the structure of such a graph.\nA graph on 9 vertices must be connected. A connected graph with $|V|=9$ vertices must have at least $|V|-1=8$ edges. A graph with 9 vertices and 8 edges is a tree.\n\nCould the graph be a tree?\nAny automorphism of a tree must fix a central vertex or a central edge.\nIf there is a fixed vertex $c$, it's an orbit of size 1. The remaining 8 vertices must be partitioned into orbits of size 3. This is not possible ($8$ is not divisible by 3).\nIf there is a fixed edge $\\{u, v\\}$, this edge as a set is fixed.\nIf $\\phi(u)=u$ and $\\phi(v)=v$, then both are fixed points. This leads to the same contradiction.\nIf $\\phi(u)=v$ and $\\phi(v)=u$, then $\\phi$ would be of order 2, which is not possible in $C_3$.\nTherefore, a graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$ cannot be a tree.\n\nSo, the graph must contain at least one cycle. A connected graph on 9 vertices that contains a cycle must have at least 9 edges. A connected graph on 9 vertices with 9 edges is called a unicyclic graph (it has exactly one cycle).\nLet's see if we can find a graph with $e=9$.\n\nConsider a graph with $|V|=9$. Since there are no fixed points, the vertices must be partitioned into orbits of size 3. Let the vertex set be $V = U \\cup V \\cup W$, where $U=\\{u_0,u_1,u_2\\}$, $V=\\{v_0,v_1,v_2\\}$, and $W=\\{w_0,w_1,w_2\\}$ are the three orbits. The non-trivial automorphism $\\phi$ acts as a 3-cycle on each orbit. We can set $\\phi(x_i) = x_{i+1 \\pmod 3}$ for $x \\in \\{u,v,w\\}$.\n\nTo make the graph specific and break unwanted symmetries (like reflections), the orbits should be distinguishable. We can achieve this by having vertices in different orbits have different degrees.\nLet's construct a graph with $e=9$:\n1.  Form a 3-cycle with the vertices of $U$: Edges $E_U = \\{\\{u_0,u_1\\}, \\{u_1,u_2\\}, \\{u_2,u_0\\}\\}$. This uses 3 edges.\n2.  Connect vertices of $W$ to vertices of $U$: Edges $E_{WU} = \\{\\{w_0,u_0\\}, \\{w_1,u_1\\}, \\{w_2,u_2\\}\\}$. This uses 3 edges.\n3.  Connect vertices of $V$ to vertices of $W$: Edges $E_{VW} = \\{\\{v_0,w_1\\}, \\{v_1,w_2\\}, \\{v_2,w_0\\}\\}$. This is a \"twisted\" connection, using 3 edges.\n\nThe graph $\\gamma=(V, E_U \\cup E_{WU} \\cup E_{VW})$ is simple. The total number of edges is $e=3+3+3=9$.\nLet's check if it's connected. A path from any $v_i$ or $w_i$ to the cycle $U$ makes the graph connected. Example: $v_0-w_1-u_1$. All vertices are connected to $U$, which is connected. So the graph is connected.\n\nLet's compute the degrees of the vertices:\n*   $\\deg(u_i)$: 2 edges in the cycle $E_U$ and 1 edge from $E_{WU}$. So $\\deg(u_i)=3$ for $i=0,1,2$.\n*   $\\deg(w_i)$: 1 edge from $E_{WU}$ and 1 edge from $E_{VW}$. So $\\deg(w_i)=2$ for $i=0,1,2$.\n*   $\\deg(v_i)$: 1 edge from $E_{VW}$. So $\\deg(v_i)=1$ for $i=0,1,2$.\n\nSince the vertices in different orbits have different degrees, any automorphism must map each orbit to itself. So any automorphism $\\psi$ must be of the form $\\psi(u_i)=u_{\\pi_U(i)}$, $\\psi(v_i)=v_{\\pi_V(i)}$, $\\psi(w_i)=w_{\\pi_W(i)}$ for some permutations $\\pi_U, \\pi_V, \\pi_W$ of the indices $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\n\nThe edges must be preserved under the action of $\\psi$:\n*   From $E_U$, $\\pi_U$ must be an automorphism of a 3-cycle, so $\\pi_U \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(C_3) \\cong D_3$. The group $D_3$ has 6 permutations: 3 rotations (including identity) and 3 reflections.\n*   From $E_{WU}$, $\\{\\psi(w_i), \\psi(u_i)\\} = \\{w_{\\pi_W(i)}, u_{\\pi_U(i)}\\}$ must be an edge. The edges are $\\{w_j, u_j\\}$, so we must have $\\pi_W(i) = \\pi_U(i)$ for all $i$. So $\\pi_W = \\pi_U$.\n*   From $E_{VW}$, $\\{\\psi(v_i), \\psi(w_{i+1})\\} = \\{v_{\\pi_V(i)}, w_{\\pi_W(i+1)}\\}$ must be an edge. The edges are $\\{v_j, w_{j+1}\\}$, so we must have $\\pi_V(i) = j$ and $\\pi_W(i+1) = j+1$ for some $j$. This means $\\pi_W(i+1) = \\pi_V(i)+1$.\n\nSince we must have $\\pi_U = \\pi_W = \\pi$ for some permutation $\\pi \\in D_3$, the last condition from $E_{VW}$ (with $\\pi_V = \\pi_U = \\pi_W = \\pi$) becomes $\\pi(i+1) = \\pi(i)+1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nLet's test which permutations $\\pi \\in D_3$ satisfy this condition. The elements of $D_3$ acting on $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ are:\n*   Rotations: $\\pi(i)=i+c \\pmod 3$ for $c=0,1,2$.\n    *   Let's check: $(i+c)+1 = (i+1)+c$. This is true for all $c$. So the three rotations are possible automorphisms.\n*   Reflections: $\\pi(i)=-i+c \\pmod 3$ for $c=0,1,2$.\n    *   Let's check: $\\pi(i+1) = -(i+1)+c = -i-1+c$.\n    *   $\\pi(i)+1 = (-i+c)+1$.\n    *   We need $-i-1+c = -i+c+1$, which means $-1=1 \\pmod 3$, or $2=0 \\pmod 3$. This is false.\n    *   So, no reflection can be an automorphism.\n\nTherefore, the only possible automorphisms are induced by the rotational permutations, which form the group $C_3$.\nThe automorphism group of this graph is $C_3$, so $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\nWe have constructed a simple, connected graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges, whose automorphism group is $C_3$. We argued that any such graph must have at least 9 vertices, and if so, it must have at least 9 edges to have a cycle (which it must). Thus, the smallest possible number of edges is 9."
