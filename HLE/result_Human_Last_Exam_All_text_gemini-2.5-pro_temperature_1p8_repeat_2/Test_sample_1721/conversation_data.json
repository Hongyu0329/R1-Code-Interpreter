    "An analysis of the problem to find the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which $A+A$ contains no square numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are looking for a subset $A$ of the first $N$ integers that is as large as possible, measured by its density $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} |A|/N$. The condition is that the sum of any two elements in $A$ (including an element with itself) is never a perfect square. That is, for all $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\neq k^2$ for any integer $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Simple Constructions using Modular Arithmetic**\nA powerful method to construct such sets is to use congruences. We can define $A$ as the set of numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that belong to certain residue classes modulo a chosen integer $m$.\nLet $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$, where $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\nIf $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, then $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod m$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod m$ for some $r_1, r_2 \\in R$.\nThen $a_1+a_2 \\equiv r_1+r_2 \\pmod m$.\nLet $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of square residues modulo $m$. If we choose $R$ such that the set of sums $R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ has no elements in common with $S_m$, i.e., $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$, then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\pmod m$ is not a square residue. This implies $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a square number. The density of such a set $A$ is $|R|/m$.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Modular Method**\n*   **Modulo 3:** The squares modulo 3 are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. The only non-square residue is 2. We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$. If we choose $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R=\\{1+1\\}=\\{2\\}$. This is disjoint from $S_3$.\n    So, let $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to 2 mod 3, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a square. The size of this set is $|A| \\approx N/3$, which implies $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4:** The squares modulo 4 are $S_4=\\{0,1\\}$. Non-square residues are $\\{2,3\\}$. Let $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{2\\}$. This gives $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$. The density is $1/4$.\n    Let $R=\\{3\\}$, then $R+R = \\{6 \\equiv 2\\}$. This gives $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$. The density is $1/4$.\n    A set like $R=\\{1,3\\}$ does not work as $1+3=4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, which is a square residue.\n\n*   **Modulo 6:** The squares modulo 6 are $S_6=\\{0,1,3,4\\}$. The non-square residues are $\\{2,5\\}$. Let $R=\\{1,4\\}$. Then $R+R=\\{1+1, 1+4, 4+4\\} \\pmod 6 = \\{2,5,8\\equiv 2\\}=\\{2,5\\}$. This set of sums is disjoint from $S_6$. The corresponding set is $A=\\{n \\mid n\\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 4 \\pmod 6\\}$. The density is $|R|/m = 2/6 = 1/3$.\n\nThe simple modular construction yields a density of $c=1/3$. For a long time, it was conjectured that this was the highest possible density.\n\n**Step 4: Advanced Constructions and Known Results**\nThe constraint that $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$ is sufficient, but not necessary. It is possible for $a_1+a_2$ to fall into a square residue class modulo $m$, but still not be a square itself.\nFor example, if we have a set of numbers congruent to $r \\pmod m$, say $a_1=k_1 m+r$ and $a_2=k_2 m+r$, their sum is $(k_1+k_2)m+2r$. This might equal $s^2$ for some integer $s$, even if $2r \\pmod m$ is a square residue. By carefully selecting numbers (or removing a small number of \"bad\" ones), one might build a denser set. This is a \"filtered\" modular construction.\n\nThis problem is a known topic in combinatorial number theory.\n1.  Erdos and Freud asked about the maximum size of such a set.\n2.  I. Z. Ruzsa showed that the limit is greater than $1/3$. He provided a construction with density $3/8 = 0.375$.\n3.  The construction for $c \\ge 3/8$ can be sketched as follows:\n    Let $A = A_1 \\cup A_2$, where $A_1 = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ and $A_2 = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 18 \\pmod{24}\\}$.\n    The set $A_1$ has density $1/3$. The set $A_2$ has density $1/24$.\n    Since $18 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, the sets of residue classes $\\{n:n\\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\}$ and $\\{n:n\\equiv 18\\pmod{24}\\}$ are disjoint, so the density of $A$ is $1/3 + 1/24 = 9/24 = 3/8$.\n\n    We check the sums:\n    *   $a,b \\in A_1 \\implies a+b \\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. Not a square.\n    *   $a,b \\in A_2 \\implies a,b \\equiv 18 \\pmod{24}$. So $a+b \\equiv 36 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}$. Sums are of the form $24k+36 = 12(2k+3)$. For this to be a square, $2k+3$ must be of the form $3m^2$. This is possible for certain $k$, so there can be squares in $A_2+A_2$.\n    *   $a \\in A_1, b \\in A_2 \\implies a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3, b \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. So $a+b \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. This can be a square.\n\n    However, it has been shown that the number of elements that must be removed from this construction of $A$ to eliminate all square sums is of order $o(N)$. For instance, the number of pairs $(a,b)$ in $A_2 \\times A_2$ that sum to a square is very small. Removing one element from each such pair (e.g., the larger element) results in a set $A'_2 \\subset A_2$ with $|A'_2|=|A_2|-o(N)$ such that $A'_2+A'_2$ has no squares. A similar argument applies to sums from $A_1+A_2$. The total size of the resulting set is still $(3/8+o(1))N$.\n\n4.  The value of $c$ is still an open problem. The bound has been improved several times since Ruzsa's result. For example, S. Konyagin got $11/28 \\approx 0.392$, and as of recent results, the record is slightly above $0.4$. However, the construction for $3/8$ is a significant and widely cited classical improvement over the simple $1/3$.\n\nGiven the nature of the question, the intended answer is likely the best-known result that comes from a relatively simple conceptual leap from the basic modular arguments. That value is $3/8$."
