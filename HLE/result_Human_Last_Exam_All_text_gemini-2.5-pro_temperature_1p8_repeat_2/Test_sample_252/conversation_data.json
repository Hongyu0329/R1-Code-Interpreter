    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This means determining the object's properties in three spatial dimensions (`x`, `y`, `z`) and one spectral dimension (`λ`), resulting in a 4D data cube `f(x, y, z, λ)`.\n    *   **Constraint:** The reconstruction must be performed from a \"single image\", which means a single 2D snapshot from a sensor like a CCD or CMOS camera.\n    *   **Method:** The specified tools are \"diffraction gratings,\" and the framework is \"computed tomography\" (CT).\n\n2.  **Understand the Core Problem:**\n    The challenge is to encode 4D information `(x, y, z, λ)` onto a 2D detector `(u, v)` in a way that it can be uniquely decoded. This is a highly multiplexed imaging problem. The \"computed tomography\" aspect implies that the system must capture multiple \"projections\" or \"views\" of the object simultaneously on the single sensor, which are then used to reconstruct the full volume.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of the Diffraction Gratings:**\n    *   An imaging lens system handles the mapping from the object's lateral spatial coordinates `(x, y)` to the detector coordinates `(u, v)`.\n    *   A diffraction grating disperses light based on its wavelength `λ`, shifting the position of the image on the detector. The amount of shift is proportional to `λ`.\n    *   To also encode the depth (`z`), the dispersive effect of the grating(s) must be made dependent on `z`. This is achieved by placing the gratings at specific locations within the optical system (e.g., away from the pupil plane) such that the defocus associated with object depth `z` alters the effective dispersion.\n    *   Crucially, real gratings produce multiple diffraction orders (`m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...`). The `m=0` order is the undispersed image. The higher orders (`m≠0`) are the dispersed images. A system with multiple gratings will create a complex 2D pattern of spots on the detector for each point source in the object. This pattern of spots (corresponding to different combinations of diffraction orders from all gratings) acts as the set of \"projections\" needed for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Minimum Number of Gratings Necessary:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: One Grating**\n        A single point in the object `(x, y, z)` emitting light of wavelength `λ` will be imaged to a series of points on the detector, all lying on a single line. The displacement `s` of a spot in a given diffraction order `m` from the central `m=0` position will be proportional to `λ * c(z)`, where `c(z)` is the depth-dependent dispersion factor. We have one measured quantity, the displacement `s`, which depends on two unknowns, `λ` and `z`. It's impossible to solve for both variables uniquely from this single relationship. Therefore, **1 grating is not sufficient.**\n\n    *   **Case 2: Two Gratings**\n        With two gratings oriented along non-parallel axes (e.g., perpendicular to each other), a single object point will create a 2D grid of spots on the detector. Let's consider the first-order spots. One spot's position will depend on `λ * c₁(z)`, and the other's will depend on `λ * c₂(z)`. Here, `c₁(z)` and `c₂(z)` are the distinct depth-dependent factors for each grating (achieved by placing them at different axial locations). This gives a system of two measurements for the two unknowns (`λ`, `z`). In principle, this system can be solved. However, detailed analysis shows that for a standard system where the gratings are placed perpendicular to the optical axis, there are certain conditions (singularities) where the system cannot distinguish between a change in depth and a change in wavelength. The mapping from `(z, λ)` to the measured spot pattern becomes non-invertible. Thus, a standard 2-grating system is fundamentally flawed for robust reconstruction.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Three Gratings**\n        Introducing a third grating provides a third, independent, depth-dependent dispersion measurement proportional to `λ * c₃(z)`. This creates an overdetermined system for finding `λ` and `z`. The extra information provided by the third grating is crucial for breaking the singularities and ambiguities inherent in the 2-grating system. It ensures that the mapping from the 4D object space to the 2D detector space is unique and invertible under general conditions. A foundational paper on this technique (Volumetric CTIS) proved that for a standard configuration, **3 gratings are the minimum necessary** for a robust, non-singular reconstruction.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   The term \"computed tomography\" here does not mean a conventional scanner that rotates around an object. It refers to the mathematical reconstruction from multiple projections, which are in this case generated optically by the diffraction orders and captured simultaneously.\n*   The problem asks for the minimum number \"necessary to construct,\" which implies a robust and generally workable system, not one that works only under very specific, non-standard conditions (like using tilted gratings to make a 2-grating system viable).\n*   The standard and most cited implementation of this specific tomographic imaging technique requires three gratings.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, while 2 gratings provide the bare minimum number of constraints, such a system has inherent mathematical singularities in its standard configuration. To create a robust system that can reliably reconstruct the 4D volume by removing these ambiguities, a minimum of 3 gratings is necessary.\n\n<<<C>>>"
