    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we must consider the total amount of each gas in the entire Earth system—the atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), and lithosphere (crust, mantle, core)—not just its concentration in the atmosphere. The year 2002 is specified, but the relative abundances of these gases do not change on human timescales, so this detail does not alter the answer.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of the Stable Noble Gases**\nMost noble gases are found primarily in the Earth's atmosphere. Their atmospheric abundances, from most common to rarest, are:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% of the atmosphere. It is the third most abundant gas in our air. It is also produced in the Earth's crust by the radioactive decay of potassium-40, making it relatively common.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm. While constantly produced by radioactive decay in the crust, its low mass allows it to escape Earth's gravity into space, keeping its atmospheric concentration low.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this, of the *stable* noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest. Now we must consider the final noble gas, Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Case of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Origin and Nature:** Radon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases. It is not a primordial element left over from Earth's formation. Instead, it is a radioactive element that is continuously formed as an intermediate step in the radioactive decay chains of uranium and thorium, which are found in rocks and soil.\n*   **Half-life:** All isotopes of Radon are radioactive, meaning they decay into other elements. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Equilibrium and Accumulation:** Because of its extremely short half-life, Radon cannot accumulate in the environment. It decays almost as quickly as it is produced. This results in a \"secular equilibrium,\" where the total amount of Radon present on Earth at any given moment is incredibly small, despite its constant production.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Total Mass of Xenon and Radon**\n*   **Xenon Mass:** The mass of Earth's atmosphere is about 5.15 x 10^18 kg. The mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is roughly 2 x 10^12 kg (two trillion kilograms). This does not even count any Xenon potentially trapped in the Earth's crust and mantle.\n*   **Radon Mass:** Scientific estimates place the total amount of Radon in the entire Earth system (atmosphere, oceans, crust) at any given moment at only a few hundred kilograms. The vast majority of uranium atoms will never decay into radon at the same time.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nComparing the total amounts, the mass of Radon (~10^2 kg) is many billions of times smaller than the mass of Xenon (~10^12 kg). Therefore, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\nCareful points to note:\n1.  The question is about the entire Earth (\"terrestrial matter\"), not just the atmosphere.\n2.  Radon must be included as it is a naturally occurring noble gas.\n3.  The key to Radon's rarity is its short radioactive half-life, which prevents it from ever building up to significant quantities.\n4.  While Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, Radon is significantly rarer.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
