    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Target Associated with CHEMBL4803817**\n\nFirst, we need to determine what `CHEMBL4803817` represents in the ChEMBL database.\n*   **Querying ChEMBL:** A query for `CHEMBL4803817` reveals that it is not a small molecule but a protein target.\n*   **Target Details:**\n    *   **ChEMBL ID:** CHEMBL4803817\n    *   **Preferred Name:** Nuclear receptor ROR-gamma\n    *   **Synonyms:** RORC, RAR-related orphan receptor C, NR1F3\n    *   **Target Type:** SINGLE PROTEIN\n    *   **Organism:** *Homo sapiens* (Human)\n*   **Function:** This nuclear receptor plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the development and function of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Because of its involvement in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, it is a significant drug discovery target.\n\n**Step 2: Methodology for Finding Interacting Small Molecules (Ligands)**\n\nTo find small molecules that interact with ROR-gamma, we must search the ChEMBL database for bioactivity data linked to this specific target. The process involves:\n1.  **Searching for Bioassays:** Identify all experimental assays conducted on the target `CHEMBL4803817`.\n2.  **Filtering for Small Molecules:** Isolate the results that involve \"Small molecule\" type compounds.\n3.  **Analyzing Activity Data:** Examine the reported bioactivity measurements from these assays. These measurements, such as IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration), EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration), Ki (inhibition constant), or Kd (dissociation constant), provide quantitative evidence of a protein-ligand interaction. The interaction can be inhibitory, activating (agonism), or inverse agonistic (reducing basal activity).\n\n**Step 3: List of Representative Interacting Small Molecules**\n\nBased on the data available in ChEMBL for the target ROR-gamma (`CHEMBL4803817`), a large number of small molecules have been shown to interact with it. Below is a representative list of these molecules, highlighting different types of modulators.\n\n1.  **Hydroxycholesterol (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL269226)**\n    *   **Type of Molecule:** Endogenous sterol (a natural ligand).\n    *   **Interaction:** Acts as an **agonist** of ROR-gamma, meaning it activates the receptor. This is an example of a naturally occurring molecule that binds to the target.\n\n2.  **Ursodiol (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3621742)**\n    *   **Type of Molecule:** A bile acid, also used as a pharmaceutical drug (Actigall).\n    *   **Interaction:** Has been reported to be an **inverse agonist** of ROR-gamma. It suppresses the constitutive activity of the receptor and inhibits Th17 cell differentiation.\n\n3.  **VPR-66 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3833215)**\n    *   **Type of Molecule:** A synthetic small molecule developed as a research tool.\n    *   **Interaction:** It is a potent and selective **inverse agonist** for ROR-gamma. For example, it has a reported pIC50 value of 8.2 (translating to an IC50 in the low nanomolar range), indicating a very strong interaction.\n\n4.  **TMP-778 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3707328)**\n    *   **Type of Molecule:** A synthetic small molecule and a known ROR-gamma modulator.\n    *   **Interaction:** Also acts as a potent **inverse agonist**. It is frequently used in research to study the function of ROR-gamma in inflammatory models.\n\n5.  **BI-7190 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4297672)**\n    *   **Type of Molecule:** A synthetic small molecule designed for therapeutic purposes.\n    *   **Interaction:** This is a **dual inhibitor**, targeting both ROR-gamma and BET proteins. It demonstrates a strong inhibitory effect on ROR-gamma activity, with a reported pIC50 of 7.9 against the target.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Target vs. Ligand:** It is crucial to correctly identify `CHEMBL4803817` as the protein target, not the ligand. The question is asking for the ligands that bind to this target.\n*   **Nature of \"Interaction\":** The term \"protein-ligand interaction\" is broad. The examples above show this can include activation (agonism), inhibition of an activator (antagonism), or reduction of the protein's baseline activity (inverse agonism). The molecules listed are primarily inverse agonists, as this is a major area of drug discovery research for ROR-gamma.\n*   **Data Source:** The list is based on publicly available bioactivity data from the ChEMBL database. The number of known ligands for this popular target is in the thousands; this list provides only a small, representative sample.\n*   **Experimental Context:** Bioactivity values like IC50 are dependent on the specific experimental conditions of the assay used. Therefore, direct comparison of values from different sources should be done with caution.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with Nuclear receptor ROR-gamma (CHEMBL4803817) include natural ligands, existing drugs, and synthetic modulators developed for research and therapeutic purposes. A list of their ChEMBL IDs represents the final answer.\n\n<<<CHEMBL269226, CHEMBL3621742, CHEMBL3833215, CHEMBL3707328, CHEMBL4297672>>>"
