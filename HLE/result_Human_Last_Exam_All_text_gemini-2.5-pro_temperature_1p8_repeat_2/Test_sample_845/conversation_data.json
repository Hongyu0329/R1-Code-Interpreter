    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurement.\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **The Key Question:** What is the name of the value computed/measured between consecutive heartbeats that is used to determine HRV?\n\n2.  **Understand the Physiology and Technology:**\n    *   A heartbeat causes a pulse of blood to travel through the arteries.\n    *   An Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart's electrical activity. The most prominent part of the signal for a single beat is the \"R\" peak. The time between two consecutive \"R\" peaks is the gold standard for measuring the beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   PPG measures changes in blood volume in the peripheral circulation (e.g., at the wrist or fingertip). Each heartbeat creates a pulse wave that PPG detects as a peak.\n    *   The time between the peaks of two consecutive pulse waves detected by PPG is a very close approximation of the time between two heartbeats.\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology for the Interval:**\n    *   The time measured between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point for all HRV calculations.\n    *   In the context of ECGs, this is universally called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   Because PPG is a proxy for the same cardiac cycle, the term **R-R interval** is very commonly used even when the data comes from a PPG sensor.\n    *   Another very common and technically accurate term, especially in the context of PPG and consumer wearables, is the **Inter-beat Interval** or **IBI**. It is sometimes also referred to as the Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval or Pulse-to-Pulse interval.\n\n4.  **Connect the Interval to HRV:**\n    *   HRV is not the interval itself. A single R-R interval or IBI gives you an instantaneous heart rate (Instantaneous HR = 60,000 / IBI in milliseconds).\n    *   HRV is a measure of the *variation* in the lengths of these intervals over a period of time.\n    *   To calculate HRV, you first need a series of consecutive R-R intervals (or IBIs). Then, statistical methods (e.g., SDNN, RMSSD) are applied to this series of values to quantify the variability.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the *value* that is measured between heartbeats.\n    *   This value is the duration of the time interval.\n    *   The most precise and widely accepted technical name for this interval is the **R-R interval**. The term **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is also correct and frequently used.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HRV vs. Interval:** It is crucial not to confuse the R-R interval itself with HRV. The interval is the raw measurement; HRV is a calculated metric describing the *variability* of those measurements.\n*   **ECG vs. PPG:** While the term \"R-R interval\" originates from ECGs (which detect the 'R' wave), it is now common practice to use it for intervals derived from PPG as well, as they represent the same underlying physiological event.\n*   **Data Quality:** The accuracy of HRV metrics depends heavily on the precise detection of each beat's timing. Artifacts or missed beats in the PPG signal can significantly skew HRV calculations. Therefore, algorithms often filter the series of intervals to remove erroneous data points (these filtered intervals are sometimes called NN intervals, for Normal-to-Normal).\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate and common term for the value measured between heartbeats is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval (or Inter-beat Interval/IBI)>>>"
