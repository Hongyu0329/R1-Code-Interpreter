    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts in the question.**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in the five International Standard ballroom dances. It is a turn directed to the dancer's left.\n*   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the prescribed amount of rotation for a given figure or step. For example, if a step requires a 3/8 turn, overturning would mean turning 1/2 or more.\n*   **Technique:** This refers to the specific, established rules of how a dance should be performed. This includes posture, frame, footwork, CBM (Contra Body Movement), CBMP (Contra Body Movement Position), sway, rise and fall, and the specific character of the dance.\n*   **The central question:** In which dance does the act of overturning a reverse turn inherently violate the fundamental technique of that dance, making it \"impossible\" to do correctly?\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technique of the Reverse Turn in each dance style.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The technique is based on continuous rotation and momentum. The Reverse Turn is a constantly rotating figure. While there are standard amounts of turn, the continuous nature allows for slight adjustments (overturning or underturning) to navigate the dance floor. Doing so does not fundamentally violate the dance's core technique of continuous rotation and sway.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is a \"swing\" dance, characterized by Rise and Fall, body sway, and continuous, flowing movement. A standard Reverse Turn has a prescribed amount of turn (e.g., 3/8 over the first three steps). However, for navigational purposes (like going around a corner), dancers can and do \"overturn\" the figure slightly. This is achieved by increasing the body sway and CBM. While extreme overturning would be poor dancing, a slight overturn is compatible with the dance's core technical principles of swing and sway. It is not \"impossible\" without breaking technique.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, Foxtrot is a swing dance characterized by continuous, smooth, gliding movement. Its technique is built on CBM and continuous flow. Similar to the Waltz, a Reverse Turn can be slightly overturned to navigate the floor. The technique is flexible enough to accommodate this without being fundamentally disregarded.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a dynamic and fast swing dance. It shares the principles of CBM, sway, and movement with Waltz and Foxtrot, albeit with a different rhythm and energy. Overturning a Reverse Turn, especially at speed to get around a corner, is a common piece of floorcraft and is achievable within the bounds of Quickstep technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The technique of Tango is fundamentally different from the other four \"swing\" dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** Tango is danced flat, with bent knees, \"into the floor\".\n    *   **No Sway:** The upper body frame is held firm, without the side-to-side sway seen in the swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movement is sharp, clipped, and decisive, not smooth or flowing. Turns happen as sharp swivels or pivots, typically between steps, rather than continuously throughout them.\n    *   **The Turn:** A Tango Reverse Turn is executed with this sharp, staccato action. The feet are placed deliberately, and the turn happens quickly. To \"overturn\" it, one would need to add a continuous, flowing rotation. This continuous rotation is the absolute antithesis of Tango technique. It would force the dancers to introduce sway, lose the staccato feeling, and potentially add rise and fall. In short, to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn, you have to dance it like a Foxtrot or a Waltz, thereby completely disregarding the core Tango technique. The rigid and staccato nature of the technique itself makes smooth overturning impossible.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings and conclude.**\nIn the four swing dances (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep), the core technique involving continuous motion and sway is flexible enough to allow for slight overturning as a part of floorcraft. However, in the European Tango, the core technique is defined by its very lack of continuous rotation and sway. Therefore, attempting to overturn a turn would require abandoning the fundamental staccato technique, making it the one dance where it is impossible to do so without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
