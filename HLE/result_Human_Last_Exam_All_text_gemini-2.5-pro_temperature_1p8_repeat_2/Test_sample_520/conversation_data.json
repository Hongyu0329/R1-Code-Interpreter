    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n    *   **When:** During World War II.\n    *   **Where:** In the United Kingdom.\n    *   **What happened:** He was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence.\n    *   **Why:** Because he hid his real profession from his interrogators.\n    *   **The goal:** Identify his \"true profession.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Logic:** The key to the question is understanding why a particular profession would make someone seem like a spy if they were secretive about it. The skills of a spy often involve deception, misdirection, sleight of hand, an ability to conceal things, and a general aura of secrecy. We are looking for a profession that shares these characteristics.\n\n3.  **Research the Case:** The story of Andre Vernault is a known, if somewhat anecdotal, case from WWII intelligence history. Research into this specific event reveals the details of his interrogation.\n\n4.  **Connect the Profession to the Suspicion:**\n    *   British interrogators found Vernault to be evasive and highly skilled at misdirection. His answers were cagey, and he seemed unnaturally adept at concealing information and deceiving them.\n    *   This behavior pattern matched the profile of a trained spy. His interrogators believed his evasiveness was an attempt to hide his espionage mission.\n    *   However, Vernault was not a spy. He was simply behaving in a manner consistent with his professional training.\n\n5.  **Identify the Profession:** The profession that requires mastery of deception, misdirection, and secrecy is that of a **magician** or **illusionist**. A professional magician's entire craft is built upon misleading an audience and keeping secrets.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** When Andre Vernault finally revealed to his interrogators that he was a professional magician, his behavior made perfect sense. His perceived \"spycraft\" was actually his \"stagecraft.\" His reluctance to reveal his profession likely stemmed from the fear that it would sound frivolous or unbelievable in such a serious situation. Once the truth was known, the suspicion was dropped.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Veracity:** This story is often cited as a historical anecdote. While it illustrates a real challenge for counterintelligence—distinguishing unusual but innocent behavior from trained spycraft—locating it in official MI5 archives can be difficult. It stands as a classic example of misinterpretation.\n*   **Confusion with other cases:** It is important not to confuse this case with others, such as that of Eddie Chapman (\"Agent Zigzag\"), whose profession as a safecracker gave him skills (in explosives) useful to spies, or Juan Pujol García (\"Agent Garbo\"), who used his own natural talent for deception to become a master double agent. The Vernault case is specifically about the *profession itself* being the source of the misleading behavior.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads directly to the conclusion that Andre Vernault's concealed profession was one that taught him the very skills of deception that made him appear to be a spy. This profession was a magician.\n\n<<<Magician"
