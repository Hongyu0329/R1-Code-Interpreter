    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest subset $A$ of $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$. This is a classic hitting set problem on the set of cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of G and its cyclic subgroups.**\n    *   The group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. $G$ is an abelian group of order $(49)^{2024} = 7^{4048}$.\n    *   The order of an element $g \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components. In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the possible orders of elements are the divisors of 49, which are 1, 7, and 49.\n    *   Therefore, any element $g \\in G$ must have an order of 1, 7, or 49.\n    *   This means that the cyclic subgroups of $G$, $\\langle g \\rangle$, can only have order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n2.  **Identify the relationship between different types of cyclic subgroups.**\n    *   **Order 1:** There is only one subgroup of order 1, the trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0\\}$. For $A$ to intersect $H_0$, it must contain the only element of $H_0$, so $0 \\in A$.\n    *   **Order 7:** These are subgroups of the form $H_7 = \\langle h \\rangle$ where $ord(h)=7$.\n    *   **Order 49:** These are subgroups of the form $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $ord(g)=49$.\n    *   Let's consider the inclusion relationship. A subgroup of order 49, $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$, contains a unique subgroup of order 7, namely $\\langle 7g \\rangle$. This is because the subgroup lattice of a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is isomorphic to the divisor lattice of $n$. For $\\mathbb{Z}_{49}$, there is a unique subgroup of order 7.\n    *   This observation is key: any cyclic subgroup of order 49 contains a cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n3.  **Simplify the problem.**\n    *   The problem is to find a minimal set $A$ that \"hits\" every cyclic subgroup.\n    *   Based on the point above, if a set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it automatically intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n    *   Let's verify this. Suppose $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be an arbitrary cyclic subgroup of order 49. This subgroup contains a subgroup $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. By our assumption, $A \\cap H_7 \\neq \\emptyset$. Since $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$, it follows that $A \\cap H_{49} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimal size of a set $A$ that intersects the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ and all cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n\n4.  **Construct the minimal hitting set.**\n    *   As established, we must have $0 \\in A$ to hit the trivial subgroup.\n    *   Let $\\mathcal{C}_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$. We need to make sure $A$ intersects every $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$.\n    *   An important property of distinct subgroups of prime order (in this case, order 7) is that their intersection is the trivial subgroup. That is, for any two distinct $H_1, H_2 \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, we have $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   This means that the non-zero elements of these subgroups are all distinct.\n    *   To intersect a subgroup $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, $A$ must contain at least one element from $H$. To minimize $|A|$, we should pick one element for each subgroup. Since we must already have $0 \\in A$, we can satisfy the condition by adding one non-zero element from each $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$ to our set $A$.\n    *   Since the non-zero elements of any two distinct subgroups in $\\mathcal{C}_7$ are disjoint, we need a separate non-zero element for each subgroup.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of non-zero elements we need in $A$ is exactly the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7, which is $|\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n    *   The total minimal size of $A$ is $1 + |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.**\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 7 consists of the identity element and 6 elements of order 7 (its generators).\n    *   So, $|\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7 in } G}{\\phi(7)} = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7 in } G}{6}$.\n    *   Let's count the number of elements $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ with order dividing 7. This condition is equivalent to $7g = 0$, which means $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\n    *   In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the solutions to $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ are $x \\in \\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such solutions.\n    *   Since there are 2024 components, and each can be any of these 7 values, the total number of elements in $G$ with order dividing 7 is $7^{2024}$.\n    *   These elements form a subgroup $G[7] = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0\\}$, which is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is a vector space of dimension 2024 over the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    *   The elements of order 7 are all the non-zero elements in this vector space. Their number is $7^{2024} - 1$.\n    *   The number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in this vector space. This is given by the well-known formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n    *   Here $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, $|\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n6.  **Final Answer.**\n    *   The smallest size of the set $A$ is $1 + |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n    *   $|A| = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n    *   We can simplify this expression:\n        $|A| = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} = \\frac{6 + 7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$."
