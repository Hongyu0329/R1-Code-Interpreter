    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThis line is an iambic senarius from the Roman playwright Plautus. Plautine meter is known for its flexibility and frequent use of resolution (substituting longer syllables with multiple shorter ones).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Syllables and Natural Quantities**\nFirst, we determine the length of each syllable based on vowel length (long by nature) or position (long if followed by two consonants or a double consonant like x, z).\n\n*   `et`: Long. It's a closed syllable (ends in a consonant). **(L)**\n*   `ti-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. `ti` (S), `bi` (S). **(S S)**\n*   `be-ne`: Both vowels are naturally short. `be` (S), `ne` (S). **(S S)**\n*   `es-se`: The syllable `es-` is long by position because the vowel `e` is followed by the double consonant `ss`. The final syllable `-se` is short. **(L S)**\n*   `so-li`: In the ablative singular of `solus`, both the `o` and the `i` are long by nature. **(L L)**\n*   `quom`: This is an old spelling of `cum`. The syllable is closed by `m`, making it long by position. **(L)**\n*   `si-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. `si` (S), `bi` (S). **(S S)**\n*   `sit`: The syllable is closed by `t`, making it long by position. **(L)**\n*   `ma-le`: Both vowels are short by nature. The final syllable `-le` is at the end of the line and is considered `syllaba anceps` (can be long or short), but its natural quantity is short. We will scan it to fit the final iambic foot. **(S S)**\n\n**Step 2: Apply Elision**\nWhen a word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, elision occurs.\n*   `bene esse`: The final `-e` of `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`.\nThe line is phonetically read as: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`.\nThis reduces the syllable count from 15 to 14.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Word Formed by Elision**\nThe new phonetic word `benesse` is syllabified as `be-nes-se`.\n*   `be-`: An open syllable with a short vowel. **(S)**\n*   `-nes-`: A syllable where the vowel `e` is followed by `ss`, making it long by position. **(L)**\n*   `-se`: An open syllable with a short vowel. **(S)**\nThus, `benesse` is scanned as `S L S`.\n\n**Step 4: Form the Full Sequence of Syllable Lengths**\nCombining all the parts, we get a 14-syllable line with the following pattern:\n`et(L) ti(S) bi(S)  be(S) nes(L) se(S)  so(L) li(L)  quom(L)  si(S) bi(S)  sit(L)  ma(S) le(S)`\nFull Sequence: `L S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n**Step 5: Divide the Sequence into Six Metrical Feet**\nThe iambic senarius has six feet. We use resolution, where a standard foot can be replaced by a foot with more syllables of equivalent time value.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` (`L S S`). This is a **dactyl**, a valid resolution for a spondee in the first foot.\n*   **Foot 2:** `be nes` (`S L`). This is a perfect **iamb**.\n*   **Foot 3:** `se so` (`S L`). This is also a perfect **iamb**.\n*   **Foot 4:** `li quom` (`L L`). This is a **spondee**. While strict classical rules prefer an iamb in the even-numbered feet, Plautus frequently allows spondees in the fourth foot.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` (`S S L`). This is an **anapest**, a valid substitution in the fifth foot.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` (`S L`). This is an **iamb**, with the naturally short final syllable `-le` being treated as long to fit the metrical pattern (`syllaba anceps`).\n\n**Final Scansion:**\nPutting the feet together with spaces in between gives the final answer.\n\nL S S S L S L L S S L S L\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L S S L S L>>>"
