    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system of differential equations.**\nThe system is given by:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe analyze the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u' = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u = 0:**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case u = 1:**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are equilibrium points.\n\nThe system has three equilibrium points in the region $u \\ge 0$: (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points by linearization.**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 - 3 + 4 & -4 - 3 + 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative, the point **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate fixed point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the separatrices.**\nSeparatrices are special trajectories that divide the phase plane into regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We will find these manifolds for the saddle point (1, -1).\n\n**Step 5: Look for simple invariant manifolds (trajectories).**\nAn invariant manifold is a curve $d=f(u)$ (or $u=c$) such that any trajectory starting on the curve stays on the curve.\nLet's test for simple polynomial curves.\n\n*   **Vertical lines, u = constant:**\n    For $u$ to be constant, we need $u'=u^2(u-1)=0$, which implies $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    The line **u = 1** is an invariant manifold. Let's analyze the flow on this line.\n    The equation for $d$ becomes $d' = 2d(d+1)$. The equilibria are $d=0$ and $d=-1$.\n    For $d \\in (-1, 0)$, $d'<0$, so trajectories move from $d=0$ towards $d=-1$.\n    For $d<-1$, $d'>0$, so trajectories move from $d \\to -\\infty$ towards $d=-1$.\n    Thus, the line $u=1$ is the stable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). It is a separatrix.\n\n*   **Curves of the form d = f(u):**\n    Let's test for a simple polynomial solution, for instance $d = au^2$.\n    The derivative of $d$ with respect to time is $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{d}{du}(au^2) \\frac{du}{dt} = (2au) \\cdot (u^3-u^2) = 2au^4 - 2au^3$.\n    Substitute $d = au^2$ into the first ODE:\n    $d' = 2(au^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(au^2) - u^3+u^4$\n    $d' = 2a^2u^4 -3au^3+5au^4 + u^4-u^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (-3a-1)u^3$.\n    For this to be an invariant manifold, the two expressions for $d'$ must be identical:\n    $2au^4 - 2au^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (-3a-1)u^3$.\n    Equating the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\n    1.  Coefficient of $u^3$: $-2a = -3a-1 \\implies a = -1$.\n    2.  Coefficient of $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2+5a+1$.\n    Let's check if $a=-1$ satisfies the second equation:\n    $2(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 1$\n    $-2 = 2 - 5 + 1$\n    $-2 = -2$.\n    The equation is satisfied. So, the curve **d = -u^2** is an invariant manifold.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the found invariant curve.**\nThe invariant curve $d = -u^2$ passes through two equilibrium points:\n*   At $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. It passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   At $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. It passes through the degenerate point (0, 0).\n\nA trajectory connecting a saddle point to another equilibrium point is a separatrix. This is a heteroclinic orbit. To determine if it is the stable or unstable manifold, we check its tangent at the saddle point.\nThe slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At the saddle point $(1, -1)$, the slope is $-2$.\nLet's find the eigenvector for the unstable manifold at (1,-1), which corresponds to eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$.\n$(J - 1 \\cdot I)v_1 = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, so $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector can be chosen as $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope is $v_d/v_u = -2$.\nSince the slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at the saddle matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector, this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth the line $u=1$ (the stable manifold) and the parabola $d=-u^2$ (the unstable manifold) are separatrices for the saddle point (1,-1). Typically, when asked for \"the separatrix,\" the question seeks the equation of one of these fundamental dividing curves. The curve $d = -u^2$ is a non-trivial solution that defines a heteroclinic connection and separates the plane into regions where trajectories either converge to the origin or escape to infinity. This is a strong candidate for the intended answer.\n\nThe equation of the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
