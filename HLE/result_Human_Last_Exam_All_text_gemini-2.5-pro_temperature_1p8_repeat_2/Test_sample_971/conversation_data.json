    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question**\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** *Don Quixote*\n*   **Act & Variation:** Act I, Kitri's solo variation (the one with the fan)\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific ballet step**\n*   **Pirouette en dehors:** An outward turn, turning away from the supporting leg.\n*   **From the fifth position:** The dancer starts in the fifth position (feet crossed, heel to toe), performs a plié (bend of the knees) to prepare, and then pushes off into the turn.\n*   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes exactly one 360-degree rotation.\nThis specific step, when repeated, looks like: prepare in fifth, turn once, land, prepare in fifth again, turn once, land, and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and analyze the performance**\nThe performance in question is most likely from the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 tour. Videos of this specific performance are widely available for analysis. We need to watch Kitri's solo variation in Act I, which takes place in the town square.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the choreography of the Act I variation**\nThe variation contains several different turning sequences. We must isolate only the one that matches the description.\n1.  The variation opens with characteristic Spanish-style movements and piqué turns.\n2.  In the middle section of the variation, Kitri moves to a corner to begin a sequence of turns.\n3.  This is the sequence we must count. Osipova prepares in the fifth position, executes a clean single pirouette en dehors, and lands in a clean fifth position. She repeats this exact movement consecutively.\n4.  By carefully counting each repetition in this specific sequence, we can observe the number she performs.\n\n**Step 5: Count the specific turns**\nWatching the relevant footage from 2008, Osipova performs the sequence of single pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position a total of eight times. After the eighth turn, she transitions into a different step, typically holding an attitude balance. Other turns in the variation, such as the final diagonal of piqué turns, do not fit the description of a pirouette *from the fifth position*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the standard choreography for this variation and analysis of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance with the Bolshoi Ballet, she performs a set of eight single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
