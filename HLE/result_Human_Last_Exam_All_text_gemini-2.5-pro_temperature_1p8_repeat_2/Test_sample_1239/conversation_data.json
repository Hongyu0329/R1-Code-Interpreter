    "This question asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To answer this, we need to perform a step-by-step analysis using Lie's symmetry method or rely on established results from the literature.\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nThe equations describe the motion of an incompressible fluid. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the equations are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we've set the constant density $\\rho=1$. The symmetries of these equations are transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that map solutions to other solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Symmetries**\n\nThe standard Lie symmetry analysis yields the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group. These generators form a Lie algebra, and its dimension is the dimension of the Lie group.\n\nThe well-known, finite-dimensional part of the symmetry algebra is generated by the following transformations:\n\n*   **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit time dependence). This gives one generator.\n    *   $t' = t + s$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$ (1 generator)\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are homogeneous (no explicit space dependence). This gives three generators.\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$ (3 generators)\n*   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are isotropic (covariant under rotations). The group of rotations is SO(3).\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = R \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = R \\mathbf{u}$ for $R \\in \\text{SO(3)}$\n    *   Generators: $x_j \\partial_{x_k} - x_k \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_k} - u_k \\partial_{u_j}$ (3 generators)\n*   **Galilean boosts:** The equations obey the principle of Galilean relativity.\n    *   $t' = t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$\n    *   Generators: $t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ (3 generators)\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations have a specific scaling symmetry due to the balance of the nonlinear term and the viscous term.\n    *   $t' = a^2 t, \\mathbf{x}' = a \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p' = a^{-2} p$\n    *   Generator: $2t\\partial_t + \\sum_i x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_i u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$ (1 generator)\n\nSumming these up gives $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$ generators. These generators form a closed 11-dimensional Lie algebra, let's call it $A_{11}$. This algebra is a well-established result and is often what is considered the \"physical\" symmetry algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n**Step 3: The Role of Pressure and Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries**\n\nA careful point in the analysis is the role of the pressure term. Since pressure only appears as a gradient ($\\nabla p$) in the momentum equation, the equations are also invariant under the transformation:\n*   **Pressure shifts:** $p'(t, \\mathbf{x}) = p(t, \\mathbf{x}) + h(t)$, where $h(t)$ is an *arbitrary* function of time.\n\nThe generator for this transformation is $h(t)\\partial_p$. Since $h(t)$ can be any smooth function, the set of these generators $\\{h(t)\\partial_p\\}$ forms an infinite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra.\n\nThis infinite-dimensional algebra of pressure shifts forms an ideal within the full Lie symmetry algebra. This means that the commutator of any symmetry generator with a pressure shift generator results in another pressure shift generator. Therefore, the full Lie algebra of point symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional.\n\n**Step 4: Interpreting the Question**\n\nThe question asks for \"the dimension\", implying a single finite number. This is a common situation for equations with such \"gauge-like\" symmetries. There are two main conventions to arrive at a finite number:\n\n1.  **Quotient Algebra:** One considers the quotient algebra of the full symmetry algebra by its infinite-dimensional ideal. This effectively \"removes\" the gauge-like pressure symmetries and considers only the symmetries acting non-trivially on the spatio-temporal and velocity variables. The dimension of this quotient algebra is 11, corresponding to the generators listed in Step 2. This is the interpretation followed in major textbooks like P. J. Olver's \"Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations\".\n\n2.  **\"Maximal\" Finite Subalgebra:** Some authors, notably Fushchich et al. (1983), have argued for a \"maximal\" finite-dimensional algebra of dimension 12. This algebra, $A_{12}$, is obtained by adding only the generator for constant pressure shifts ($\\partial_p$, which corresponds to $h(t)=\\text{const.}$) to the 11 generators from Step 2. However, a deeper analysis reveals that there is no *unique* maximal finite-dimensional symmetry algebra, as one can form a $(11+N+1)$-dimensional algebra for any integer $N \\geq 0$ by including pressure shifts polynomial in time up to degree $N$. This undermines the claim of maximality for the 12-dimensional algebra.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most standard and mathematically robust interpretation is to consider the dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie algebra that remains after quotienting out the infinite-dimensional ideal of pressure symmetries. This corresponds to the physically significant symmetries of space-time, rotations, boosts, and scaling.\n\nThe dimension of this algebra is the sum of the number of generators found in Step 2:\nDimension = 1 (time transl.) + 3 (space transl.) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) = 11."
