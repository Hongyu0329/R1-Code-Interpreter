    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next number.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis and Pattern Search**\nThe given sequence is:\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\n\nA first glance reveals no simple arithmetic progression (e.g., constant difference or ratio). The numbers vary, and there are many repetitions, suggesting a more complex or non-mathematical pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Repeating Sub-patterns**\nA careful examination reveals distinct groups of repeating numbers within the sequence. Specifically, there are groups of three identical numbers.\n- `... 67, 67, 67, ...`\n- `... 36, 36, 36, ...`\n- `... 124, 124, 124, ...`\n\nLet's look at the number that immediately follows each of these triplets.\n- The triplet `67, 67, 67` is followed by `93`.\n- The triplet `36, 36, 36` is followed by `124`.\n- The triplet `124, 124, 124` is followed by `36`.\n\n**Step 3: Discovering the Underlying Rule for the Sub-patterns**\nLet's test for a relationship between the repeating number (let's call it `x`) and the number that follows the triplet (let's call it `y`).\n- For `x = 67`, `y = 93`. Let's check their sum: 67 + 93 = 160.\n- For `x = 36`, `y = 124`. Let's check their sum: 36 + 124 = 160.\n- For `x = 124`, `y = 36`. Let's check their sum: 124 + 36 = 160.\n\nA consistent rule emerges: **`x + y = 160`**, or **`y = 160 - x`**.\nThis strongly suggests that the sequence is partly constructed from blocks of the form `(x, x, x, 160 - x)`.\n\n**Step 4: Structuring the Sequence into Blocks**\nUsing this rule, we can parse the latter part of the sequence into logical blocks:\nThe sequence ends with: `... 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`\n\nLet's group this part according to our `(x, x, x, y)` pattern.\n- The sequence part `36, 36, 36, 124` fits the pattern for `x = 36`. We can call this Block A. (`160 - 36 = 124`).\n- The sequence part `124, 124, 124, 36` fits the pattern for `x = 124`. We can call this Block B. (`160 - 124 = 36`).\n\nSo, the end of the sequence can be structured as: `... (some other numbers), Block A, Block B, 124`.\n\n**Step 5: Deducing the Pattern of Progression between Blocks**\nNow, let's analyze how the blocks are connected.\n- Block A has `x_A = 36` and `y_A = 124`.\n- Block B has `x_B = 124` and `y_B = 36`.\n\nNotice that the `x` value of Block B is the `y` value of Block A (`x_B = y_A = 124`). This suggests a chaining rule where the fourth element of one block determines the repeating element of the next block.\n\n**Step 6: Predicting the Next Number**\nFollowing this discovered logic:\n1. The last complete block was Block B: `(124, 124, 124, 36)`.\n2. The `y` value for this block is `y_B = 36`.\n3. According to the chaining rule, the next block (Block C) should be based on `x_C = y_B`, which means `x_C = 36`.\n4. Therefore, the next block of numbers should be `(36, 36, 36, 160-36)`, which is `(36, 36, 36, 124)`.\n\nThe sequence given is `... Block B, 124`. After Block B, a new block should start. The first number of this new block should be `36`. The final `124` in the given sequence seems anomalous or part of a more complex pattern (`...y, x` echo), but the most logical start for the subsequent main block is based on the chaining rule. Therefore, the number to follow the current sequence is the first number of the next logical block.\n\nThe next number is **36**.\n\n<<<36>>>"
