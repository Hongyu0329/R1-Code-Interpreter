    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between the 1-incidence rate ratio and per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This is a hypothetical type of vaccine that works perfectly for some people but not at all for others. If you are in the protected group, you are completely immune. If you are in the unprotected group, you are just as susceptible as someone who was never vaccinated. Let's denote the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected as `VE`. The remaining fraction, `1-VE`, receives no protection.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p):** This is the percentage reduction in the risk of infection from a *single* exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated person compared to an unvaccinated person.\n*   **Incidence Rate (IR):** This measures the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over time (e.g., new cases per person-year). We'll use `IR_u` for the unvaccinated group and `IR_v` for the vaccinated group.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n*   **The Estimand:** The question is about the quantity `1 - IRR`. This is the standard formula used in clinical trials to calculate overall vaccine efficacy.\n\n### Step 2: Define the \"True\" Per-Exposure Efficacy in this Model\n\nLet's figure out what the true `VE_p` is for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n*   For an unvaccinated person, let the probability of infection upon one exposure be `P`.\n*   For a vaccinated person, there are two possibilities:\n    1.  They are in the protected group (with probability `VE`). Their risk of infection per exposure is `0`.\n    2.  They are in the unprotected group (with probability `1-VE`). Their risk of infection per exposure is `P`, the same as an unvaccinated person.\n*   The *average* risk of infection per exposure for a randomly selected vaccinated person is a weighted average: `(VE * 0) + ((1-VE) * P) = (1-VE)P`.\n*   Per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`) is the proportional reduction in this average risk:\n    `VE_p = (Risk_unvacc - Risk_vacc) / Risk_unvacc = (P - (1-VE)P) / P`\n*   Simplifying this gives: `VE_p = P(1 - (1-VE)) / P = 1 - 1 + VE = VE`.\n*   So, in an all-or-nothing model, the true per-exposure efficacy is exactly equal to `VE`, the fraction of people who are fully protected.\n\n### Step 3: Model the Incidence Rates in a Population\n\nNow, let's see what a clinical trial would measure.\n*   Let `λ` (lambda) be the force of infection, or the hazard rate for an unvaccinated person. This is the instantaneous risk of infection. The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group is therefore `IR_u = λ`.\n*   The vaccinated population is a mix of protected and unprotected people:\n    *   The `VE` fraction who are protected have a hazard rate of `0`.\n    *   The `1-VE` fraction who are unprotected have a hazard rate of `λ`.\n*   The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is the weighted average of the rates in these two subgroups:\n    `IR_v = (VE * 0) + ((1-VE) * λ) = (1-VE)λ`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Estimand `1 - IRR`\n\nUsing the standard formula for vaccine efficacy from a trial, we calculate `1 - IRR`.\n*   First, find the IRR:\n    `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = ((1-VE)λ) / λ`\n*   The `λ` term cancels out:\n    `IRR = 1-VE`\n*   Now, calculate the estimand:\n    `Estimand = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-VE) = VE`\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the True Value and Conclude\n\n*   From Step 2, we determined that the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) for an all-or-nothing vaccine is `VE`.\n*   From Step 4, we calculated that the estimand `1 - IRR` is also equal to `VE`.\n\nSince the calculated value (`1 - IRR`) is exactly equal to the true per-exposure efficacy parameter (`VE`), the `1-incidence rate ratio` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Model Specificity:** This conclusion is specific to the \"all-or-nothing\" model. The result would also hold for a \"leaky\" vaccine (where everyone gets partial protection), but the relationship can become more complex with other models, such as those including waning immunity or heterogeneity in exposure risk.\n2.  **No Confounding:** This analysis assumes an ideal randomized controlled trial where the only systematic difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups is the vaccination itself. Factors like behavior change (e.g., vaccinated people taking more risks) or differences in underlying health are assumed to be absent or controlled for.\n3.  **Constant Hazard:** The model assumes the force of infection (`λ`) is constant over the observation period for the unvaccinated and unprotected individuals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
