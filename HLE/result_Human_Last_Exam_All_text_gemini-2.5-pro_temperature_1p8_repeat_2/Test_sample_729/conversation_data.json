    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** This group has order $4n$ and is defined by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. For a size of 128, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. So, the group in question is $Q_{128}$ with the presentation:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup. It is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of the group.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 2: Partition the Elements of the Group**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be divided into two disjoint sets (excluding the identity element):\n1.  Elements within the cyclic subgroup generated by $x$, which is $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are elements of the form $x^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 63$.\n2.  Elements outside the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are elements of the form $x^k y$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 63$.\n\nWe will find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Subgroups Generated by Elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, isomorphic to $C_{64}$.\nA key theorem in group theory states that for any cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of subgroups is therefore equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$.\n\n*   The order is $m = 64$.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since $64 = 2^6$, the divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\n\nTherefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. Each of these is generated by a power of $x$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Subgroups Generated by Elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThese elements are of the form $g_k = x^k y$, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$. Let's determine the order of these elements.\n\n*   $(g_k)^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k (yx^k) y$.\n*   Using the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\implies yx = x^{-1}y$, we can show by induction that $yx^k = x^{-k}y$.\n*   Substituting this back: $(g_k)^2 = x^k (x^{-k}y) y = (x^k x^{-k}) y^2 = y^2$.\n*   From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $(g_k)^2 = x^{32}$ for any $k$.\n*   To find the order of $g_k$, we calculate further powers: $(g_k)^4 = ((g_k)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Since $(g_k)^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of any element $g_k = x^k y$ is exactly 4.\n\nNow, we need to count how many *distinct* subgroups are generated by these 64 elements of order 4.\n\n*   Let $H_k = \\langle g_k \\rangle = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$. The elements of this subgroup are $\\{1, x^k y, (x^k y)^2, (x^k y)^3\\}$.\n*   This simplifies to $H_k = \\{1, x^k y, x^{32}, x^{k+32}y\\}$.\n*   A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (the element and its inverse). The generators of $H_k$ are $x^k y$ and $(x^k y)^3 = x^{k+32}y$.\n*   Two subgroups $H_k$ and $H_j$ are the same if and only if $g_j = x^j y$ is one of the generators of $H_k$. This means either $x^j y = x^k y$ or $x^j y = x^{k+32}y$.\n*   This implies that $j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\n*   So, the 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ form pairs, where each pair generates the same subgroup. The pairs are $\\{x^k y, x^{k+32}y\\}$.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the number of such pairs, which is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the 7 subgroups found in Step 3, as they contain elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Subgroups**\n\nTo find the total number of power subgroups, we sum the numbers from the two disjoint cases.\n\nTotal number = (Subgroups from inside $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups from outside $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
