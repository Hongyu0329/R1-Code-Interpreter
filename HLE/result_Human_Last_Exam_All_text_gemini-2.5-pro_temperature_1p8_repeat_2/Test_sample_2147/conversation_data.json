    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of X-Y.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The central figure is Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a prominent Russian historian, publicist, and liberal politician. He was a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and served as Foreign Minister in the Russian Provisional Government of 1917.\n\n2.  **Analyze Milyukov's Position:** Milyukov was known as a \"Westernizer.\" He admired Western European political institutions, legal systems, and rationalism. However, this admiration did not extend to all aspects of Western culture, especially the artistic and philosophical trends emerging at the turn of the 20th century. As a rationalist and positivist, he was deeply suspicious of movements that he considered irrational, mystical, or pessimistic.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Quote:** The quote states he \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\" and denounced \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\".\n    *   **\"Stagnant swamp\" (or \"гнилое болото\" in the original Russian):** This is a powerful metaphor implying decay, lack of progress, unhealthiness, and moral corruption. It suggests a rejection of vitality and life-affirming principles.\n    *   **\"X-Ys\":** This format suggests a compound term or a two-word name for a group or movement. The plural form \"X-Ys\" indicates he was referring to the practitioners of this movement.\n\n4.  **Connect Milyukov's Views to Contemporary Cultural Movements:** Milyukov's most pointed cultural critiques were aimed at Modernism, particularly its manifestations in the forms of Decadence and Symbolism.\n    *   **Decadence:** This late 19th-century artistic and literary movement prized aestheticism, artificiality, and individualism, often exploring themes of decay, perversity, and disillusionment.\n    *   **Symbolism:** This movement reacted against realism and naturalism, favoring spirituality, the imagination, and dreams. It used symbolic imagery and suggestion to convey subjective emotional experiences.\n    *   Milyukov saw both movements as intertwined and representing a flight from civic responsibility and rational thought into morbid introspection and aestheticism. He believed they were signs of a deep cultural crisis.\n\n5.  **Identify \"X-Y\":** Based on Milyukov's known writings and public clashes with cultural figures of Russia's \"Silver Age,\" the specific target of his \"stagnant swamp\" insult was the combined movement he saw as one entity. He frequently referred to its followers as **Decadent-Symbolists**. This term perfectly fits the \"X-Y\" pattern and aligns with the historical context of his cultural criticism.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nPavel Milyukov, a rationalist and proponent of social progress, condemned the turn-of-the-century artistic and literary movements of Decadence and Symbolism. He saw their focus on mysticism, individualism, and decay as a \"stagnant swamp\" that was detrimental to culture. He often referred to the adherents of these intertwined movements as Decadent-Symbolists.\n\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
