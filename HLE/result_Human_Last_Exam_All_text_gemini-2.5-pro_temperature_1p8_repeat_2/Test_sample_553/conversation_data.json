    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Music Theory\nFirst, let's break down the musical terms in the question to understand what we are looking for.\n*   **Tonic:** The tonic is the first note of a scale and the tonal center or \"home\" key of a piece of music. The tonic chord is the chord built on this first note. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major. In the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n    *   In a major key (like C major), the fifth note is G. A standard \"fifth\" chord would be G major (the V chord). A \"minor fifth\" chord would be G minor (the v chord), which is an unusual chord to borrow in a major key.\n    *   In a minor key (like A minor), the fifth note is E. The chord built on the fifth degree in the *natural* minor scale is a minor chord (E minor, the v chord). This is a more common context for a minor fifth chord.\n\nThe question asks for a song that \"starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\". This means we are looking for a song whose opening harmonic movement is from the 'home' chord to this specific v chord.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming and Analyzing Candidate Songs\nThe Beatles were famous for their innovative intros and chord progressions. Let's consider a few songs, but focus on the one that is most famous for its sophisticated harmony.\n\nThe most likely candidate is the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul* (1965).\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Analysis of \"Michelle\"\n1.  **Determine the Key:** The song's intro and verses are in the key of **F minor**. Therefore, the tonic chord (spelled 'i' in a minor key) is **F minor**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Minor Fifth Chord:** In the key of F minor, the fifth note of the scale is **C**. A minor chord built on C is **C minor** (C-Eb-G). This is the \"minor fifth\" chord (the 'v' chord) for this key.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Opening Progression:**\n    *   The song does not start with a literal, instantaneous jump from one chord to the next. It begins with a distinctive descending guitar figure.\n    *   However, the *vocal melody* begins immediately after. Let's analyze the chords that support the famous opening lyrics.\n    *   The first line, *\"Michelle, ma belle\"*, is sung over a sustained **F minor** chord. This firmly establishes the tonic.\n    *   The second line, *\"These are words that go together well\"*, begins by moving to a **C minor** chord.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The defining harmonic movement that kicks off the song's main section (the verse) is the shift from the F minor tonic (under the first line) to the C minor fifth (under the second line). This movement from **i -> v** (tonic to minor fifth) is exactly what the question describes. The \"chord jump\" refers to this fundamental and memorable transition that establishes the harmonic character of the verse. No other Beatles song features this specific and prominent opening progression as clearly.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
