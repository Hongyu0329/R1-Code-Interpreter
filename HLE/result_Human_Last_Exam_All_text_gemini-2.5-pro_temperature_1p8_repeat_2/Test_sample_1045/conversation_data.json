    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms in the molecule.**\n    *   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n    *   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\n    *   The 6-31G basis set is a type of split-valence basis set developed by Pople's group.\n    *   The hyphen `-` separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals.\n    *   **Core orbitals:** The number before the hyphen (\"6\") describes the core atomic orbitals. It means each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **Valence orbitals:** The numbers after the hyphen (\"31\") describe the valence orbitals. It means the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, represented by two separate CGFs.\n        *   The first CGF (the \"inner\" part) is formed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   The second CGF (the \"outer\" part) is formed from 1 PGF.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions per Carbon (C) atom.**\n    *   Carbon is a second-row element, so it has both core and valence electrons.\n    *   **Core orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. According to the \"6-\" part of the basis set name, it is described by **1** contracted Gaussian function.\n    *   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The 2s and three 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz) orbitals are valence orbitals. According to the \"-31G\" part, each of these valence orbitals is split into two basis functions (an inner and an outer one).\n        *   2s orbital: Represented by **2** CGFs.\n        *   2p orbitals: There are three p-orbitals (px, py, pz). Each is represented by 2 CGFs. So, 3 * 2 = **6** CGFs for the p-shell.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions per Hydrogen (H) atom.**\n    *   Hydrogen is a first-row element. It has no core electrons, only a single valence electron in the 1s orbital.\n    *   **Valence orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is described by the valence part of the basis set, \"-31G\". This means the 1s orbital is split into two basis functions.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule (C7H8).**\n    *   Calculate the total from all Carbon atoms: 7 C atoms × 9 functions/atom = **63 functions**.\n    *   Calculate the total from all Hydrogen atoms: 8 H atoms × 2 functions/atom = **16 functions**.\n    *   **Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = **79 functions**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly distinguish between core and valence electrons for each atom type. Hydrogen has no core electrons. Carbon has a 1s core.\n*   **Splitting:** Understand that \"split-valence\" means only the valence orbitals are represented by more than one basis function.\n*   **p-orbitals:** Remember that the p-shell consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz), and the splitting rule applies to each one separately.\n*   **Final Summation:** Ensure you are summing the functions for the correct number of each atom in the molecule.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the final answer is calculated to be 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
