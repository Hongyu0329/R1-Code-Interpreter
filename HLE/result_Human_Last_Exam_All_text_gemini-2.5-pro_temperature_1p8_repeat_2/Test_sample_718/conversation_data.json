    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the key components of the question: \"Let $J$ be an upper semilattice. Then a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable for what $n$?\"\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**:\n    *   An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\leq)$ where for any two elements $i, j \\in J$, their least upper bound (or supremum, or join) exists. We denote it by $i \\vee j$.\n    *   Any poset can be viewed as a category. The objects of the category are the elements of the poset. A unique morphism exists from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\leq j$. Composition of morphisms is determined by the transitive property of the partial order.\n\n2.  **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$)**:\n    *   This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j) \\in \\text{Vect}_K$ to each element $j \\in J$.\n    *   For every relation $i \\leq j$ in $J$, it assigns a linear map (morphism in $\\text{Vect}_K$) $f_{ij}: f(i) \\to f(j)$.\n    *   These maps must be compatible with the poset structure: if $i \\leq j \\leq k$, then the map $f_{ik}$ must be the composition $f_{jk} \\circ f_{ij}$. Also, $f_{ii}$ must be the identity map on $f(i)$.\n    *   The collection of all such functors forms an abelian category, denoted $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n3.  **Tame Functor**:\n    *   A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called \"tame\" if for any $i \\leq j$, the image of the map $f_{ij}: f(i) \\to f(j)$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.\n    *   In many contexts where this term is used (like persistence theory), the vector spaces $f(j)$ themselves are assumed to be finite-dimensional. This finiteness condition is crucial for certain duality theorems to hold.\n\n4.  **$n$-resolvable**:\n    *   A functor (or object in an abelian category) $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it admits a projective resolution of length $n$.\n    *   This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n        $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n        where each $P_k$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   The question is asking for the smallest integer $n$ such that *any* tame functor is $n$-resolvable. This is equivalent to finding the **global dimension** of the category of tame functors from $J$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Strategy\n\n*   The structure of the poset $J$ determines the homological properties of the category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The key property we are given is that $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n*   Calculating projective resolutions directly for an arbitrary functor can be very complex. A more elegant strategy is to use a duality argument.\n*   The duality we will use connects the category of functors on $J$ to the category of functors on its opposite poset, $J^{op}$.\n*   The \"tame\" condition ensures that the vector space duality functor is well-behaved, specifically that $f$ is naturally isomorphic to its double dual $f^{**}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis using Duality\n\n1.  **Opposite Poset ($J^{op}$)**: Let's consider the opposite poset $J^{op}$. The elements of $J^{op}$ are the same as in $J$, but the order is reversed: $i \\leq_{op} j$ in $J^{op}$ if and only if $j \\leq i$ in $J$.\n    *   **Crucial Insight**: If $J$ is an upper semilattice (all joins exist), then $J^{op}$ is a **lower semilattice** (all meets exist). The meet of $i$ and $j$ in $J^{op}$ is simply their join $i \\vee j$ from $J$.\n\n2.  **A Standard Result from Representation Theory**: It is a well-known theorem in the representation theory of posets that if $J'$ is a lower semilattice, then the global dimension of the category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J', \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n    *   Applying this to our situation, since $J^{op}$ is a lower semilattice, we have:\n        $\\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\leq 1$.\n    *   This means any functor $g: J^{op} \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\n3.  **Vector Space Duality**: Let's define the duality functor $D: \\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K) \\to \\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)$. For a functor $f$, the dual functor $D(f)$ is defined by:\n    *   On objects: $D(f)(j) = \\text{Hom}_K(f(j), K) = f(j)^*$.\n    *   On morphisms: If $i \\leq_{op} j$ (i.e., $j \\leq i$), the map $f_{ji}: f(j) \\to f(i)$ gives rise to a dual map $(f_{ji})^*: f(i)^* \\to f(j)^*$. This is the map assigned by $D(f)$ to the relation $i \\leq_{op} j$.\n    *   The \"tame\" condition ensures $f(j)$ are finite-dimensional, so $f(j) \\cong f(j)^{**}$, and the functor $D$ is a contravariant equivalence of categories.\n\n4.  **Connecting Dimensions**: This duality functor $D$ relates the homological dimensions of the two categories. A fundamental property of such dualities is that they turn projective objects into injective objects and vice versa. Specifically, for any functor $f$, its injective dimension in $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equal to the projective dimension of its dual $D(f)$ in $\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   $\\text{inj.dim}_{\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)}(f) = \\text{proj.dim}_{\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)}(D(f))$.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together**:\n    *   Let $f$ be any tame functor from $J$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$.\n    *   Its dual, $D(f)$, is a functor from $J^{op}$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$.\n    *   From our standard result (Step 2), because $J^{op}$ is a lower semilattice, the projective dimension of $D(f)$ is at most 1.\n        $\\text{proj.dim}_{\\text{Fun}(J^{op}, \\text{Vect}_K)}(D(f)) \\leq 1$.\n    *   Using the dimension identity (Step 4), this means the injective dimension of $f$ is at most 1.\n        $\\text{inj.dim}_{\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)}(f) \\leq 1$.\n    *   This holds for *any* tame functor $f$. Therefore, the global injective dimension of the category of tame functors is at most 1.\n    *   The global dimension of an abelian category can be computed as the supremum of either the projective dimensions or the injective dimensions of all its objects. Thus, the global dimension is at most 1.\n        $\\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) = \\sup_{f} \\text{proj.dim}(f) = \\sup_{f} \\text{inj.dim}(f) \\leq 1$.\n    *   This implies that the projective dimension of any functor $f$ is at most 1. This means every such functor has a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n\n6.  **Is the answer 0?**: Could $n=0$? If $n=0$, it would mean every functor is projective. This is only true in very simple cases (e.g., if $J$ is a discrete poset, meaning no relations between distinct elements). An upper semilattice is generally not discrete. For instance, the chain $0 \\to 1$ is a simple upper semilattice, but the \"skyscraper\" functor which is $K$ at $0$ and zero elsewhere is not projective. Therefore, the global dimension is not 0 in general.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum required length for a projective resolution is 1. Thus, any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
