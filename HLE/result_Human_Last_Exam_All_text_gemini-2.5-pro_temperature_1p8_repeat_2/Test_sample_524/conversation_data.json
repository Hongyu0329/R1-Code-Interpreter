    "This is a classic and profound question in the field of point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we must dissect the properties of such a space and rely on several major classification theorems.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact and connected metric space.\n*   **Planar:** Can be embedded as a subset of the Euclidean plane, R².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space X is homogeneous if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X → X such that h(x) = y. This means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A category of topological spaces where all spaces within the category are homeomorphic to each other. We are asked for the number of such categories that satisfy the given properties.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of topologically distinct types of compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane.\n\n**Step 2: A fundamental division using Local Connectivity**\n\nA key topological property that helps classify continua is **local connectivity**. A space is locally connected if every point has a neighborhood base consisting of connected sets. We can divide all homogeneous planar continua into two groups: those that are locally connected and those that are not.\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum is locally connected.**\n    A celebrated theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that every non-degenerate, locally connected, homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve** (i.e., a circle, S¹). The term \"non-degenerate\" means it consists of more than one point.\n    We must also consider the degenerate case: a single **point**. A single point is a continuum (compact and connected), it is planar, it is homogeneous (trivially), and it is locally connected. It is clearly not homeomorphic to a circle.\n    Thus, from the locally connected case, we get two distinct homeomorphism classes:\n    1.  **The Point**\n    2.  **The Simple Closed Curve (Circle)**\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum is not locally connected.**\n    This case is more complex and was resolved by the work of several topologists, most notably R. H. Bing and J. T. Rogers, Jr. We can further subdivide this case based on whether the continuum separates the plane.\n\n    *   **Subcase 2a: The continuum does not separate the plane.**\n        A theorem by R. H. Bing and F. B. Jones states that a homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be a **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a fascinating, snake-like continuum that is indecomposable (cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua). Bing proved in 1951 that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. This gives us a third distinct class:\n        3.  **The Pseudo-arc**\n\n    *   **Subcase 2b: The continuum separates the plane.**\n        If a homogeneous planar continuum separates the plane, it must be indecomposable (another result by Bing). Such continua are also known to be \"circle-like\". Building on a large body of work, James T. Rogers, Jr. proved that any homogeneous, indecomposable, circle-like continuum that separates the plane is a **solenoid**. Furthermore, he showed that any such solenoid that can be embedded in the plane must be homeomorphic to a standard \"dyadic\" solenoid. This means that all such planar continua belong to a single homeomorphism class.\n        4.  **The Solenoid** (specifically, the unique planar, homogeneous type)\n\n**Step 3: Verify the classes are distinct**\n\nWe have found four candidate classes. We must confirm they are topologically distinct.\n1.  **The Point:** It is the only one with only one element. It has topological dimension 0.\n2.  **The Circle:** It is the only non-degenerate one that is locally connected.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** It is not locally connected and does not separate the plane.\n4.  **The Solenoid:** It is not locally connected but *does* separate the plane.\n\nSince local connectivity and the property of separating the plane are topological invariants, these four classes are indeed distinct. The cited theorems show that this classification is exhaustive.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nBased on the complete classification derived from major theorems in continuum theory, there are exactly four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are:\n1.  The point.\n2.  The simple closed curve (the circle).\n3.  The pseudo-arc.\n4.  The solenoid.\n\n<<<4>>>"
