    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and her Subject Matter**\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), was a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. Her work captured key moments from various conflicts involving the British Army, spanning from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I. The question requires us to find the most recent historical event among all the battles she depicted.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Paintings and the Historical Events Depicted**\nTo find the latest battle, we need to compile a list of her significant paintings and identify the specific historical event and date each one portrays. It is crucial to distinguish between the date the painting was made and the date of the event it depicts.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which took place on **16 June 1815**.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo** on **18 June 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the **Battle of Inkerman** during the Crimean War, which occurred on **5 November 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place from **22–23 January 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** during the First Boer War on **28 January 1881**.\n*   ***After the Battle*** (painted 1885): Shows the aftermath of the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** in the Anglo-Egyptian War on **13 September 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition, often associated with the **Battle of Abu Klea** on **17 January 1885**.\n*   ***The Dorsets on the Aisne*** (painted c. 1915): Shows the Dorsetshire Regiment during the **First Battle of the Aisne** in World War I on **20 September 1914**.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted c. 1915): Portrays the British Army during the **Retreat from Mons** in **August-September 1914**.\n*   ***A Sergeant of the Black Watch on the Somme*** (painted after 1916): Depicts a soldier during the **Battle of the Somme**, which lasted from **July to November 1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically Order the Battles by Date**\nNow, we arrange the historical events depicted in chronological order to identify the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras / Waterloo: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Inkerman: **1854**\n3.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n4.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n5.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n6.  Battle of Abu Klea: **1885**\n7.  Retreat from Mons / First Battle of the Aisne: **1914**\n8.  Battle of the Somme: **1916**\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the dates of the historical events depicted in her paintings, it is clear that Lady Butler's works cover conflicts up to World War I. The latest historical battle she is known to have painted is the Battle of the Somme, which took place in 1916. This is later than the Napoleonic, Crimean, Zulu, Boer, and Egyptian campaigns she famously captured, as well as the earlier battles of World War I, such as Mons and the Aisne in 1914.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** It is essential not to confuse the year a painting was created with the year of the historical event it portrays. For instance, *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881 but depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815.\n*   **Inclusion of Later Works:** Lady Butler's most famous paintings are from the Victorian era, but she continued to work into the 20th century. Her World War I paintings are key to answering this question correctly.\n*   **Specific Battle Identification:** Precisely identifying the battle is important. General scenes can often be linked to specific campaigns or battles through their titles or documented context (e.g., *The Camel Corps* and the Gordon Relief Expedition).\n\n***\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Battle\\ of\\ the\\ Somme}$."
