    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n$N = 36036$\n$N = 4 \\times 9009$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 9 \\times 1001$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### Step 3: Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$. This implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of $6$.\n2.  The set of orders of the component characters must contain at least one order divisible by $2$ and at least one order divisible by $3$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Eligible Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^k$ whose order divides $6$. Let $\\phi$ be Euler's totient function. The number of characters of order $d$ for a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $d|n$) is $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Modulo $4$ ($=2^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo $4$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character modulo $4$. Its order is $2$.\n    Since $2$ divides $6$, this character is eligible.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: $1$. (Order is 2).\n\n*   **Modulo $9$ ($=3^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo $9$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    The primitive characters modulo $9$ are those not induced by characters modulo $3$. The characters modulo $3$ have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. So, the non-primitive characters modulo $9$ have orders $1$ and $2$.\n    The orders of primitive characters modulo $9$ must be divisors of $6$ other than $1$ or $2$, which are $3$ and $6$.\n    Both orders $3$ and $6$ divide $6$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $3$: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $6$: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total eligible choices for $\\chi_2$: $2+2=4$. (Orders are in $\\{3, 6\\}$).\n\n*   **Modulo $7$ ($=7^1$):**\n    The group of characters modulo $7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    Primitive characters are all characters except the principal one (order 1). Their orders are $2, 3, 6$.\n    All these orders divide $6$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $2$: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $3$: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $6$: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Total eligible choices for $\\chi_3$: $1+2+2=5$. (Orders are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$).\n\n*   **Modulo $11$ ($=11^1$):**\n    The group of characters modulo $11$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of $10$ except $1$, which are $2, 5, 10$.\n    We need the order to divide $6$. Only order $2$ satisfies this condition.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $2$: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Total eligible choices for $\\chi_4$: $1$. (Order is 2).\n\n*   **Modulo $13$ ($=13^1$):**\n    The group of characters modulo $13$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of $12$ except $1$, which are $2, 3, 4, 6, 12$.\n    We need the order to divide $6$. The possible orders are $2, 3, 6$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $2$: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $3$: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    Number of primitive characters of order $6$: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Total eligible choices for $\\chi_5$: $1+2+2=5$. (Orders are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$).\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nNow, we must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly $6$ for any combination of the eligible characters we have counted.\nLet the orders of the chosen components be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$.\n*   $o_1 = 2$ (from mod 4) or $o_4 = 2$ (from mod 11). So the lcm will always be divisible by $2$.\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$ (from mod 9). In either case, $o_2$ is divisible by $3$. So the lcm will always be divisible by $3$.\n\nSince the lcm is divisible by both $2$ and $3$, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nFurthermore, since the order of every chosen component divides $6$, their lcm must also divide $6$.\nTherefore, for any combination of the eligible component characters, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly $6$.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
