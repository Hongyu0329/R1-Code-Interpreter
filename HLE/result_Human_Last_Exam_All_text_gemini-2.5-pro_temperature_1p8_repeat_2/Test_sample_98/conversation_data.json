    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Object:** The tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. It possesses a high degree of symmetry, including a center of symmetry.\n*   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank. Because an icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, the face opposite the base face will also be an equilateral triangle, and it will be horizontal at the top of the tank.\n*   **The Filling:** The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   A key property of any centrally symmetric solid (like a regular icosahedron) is that any plane passing through its center of symmetry divides the solid into two parts of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must be a plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n*   Because the tank is resting on a horizontal face, the force of gravity acts vertically. The surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n*   Combining these points, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central, horizontal plane.\n*   The problem is now reduced to a geometric question: What is the shape of the central cross-section of an icosahedron when the section is parallel to one of its triangular faces?\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Geometry and Symmetry**\n*   **Symmetry Axis:** When an icosahedron rests on a face, the vertical line passing through the center of the base face and the center of the icosahedron is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves it unchanged.\n*   **Implication for the Cross-Section:** Since the cutting plane (the water surface) is perpendicular to this 3-fold axis of symmetry, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Known Properties of Polyhedral Cross-Sections:** It is a known result in geometry that the cross-section of a regular icosahedron taken through its center and perpendicular to a 3-fold axis of symmetry (i.e., parallel to a pair of opposite faces) is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Step 5: Visualize the Structure (Intuitive Confirmation)**\n*   Imagine looking down the 3-fold axis from the top. You see the top triangular face.\n*   The 12 vertices of the icosahedron are arranged in four layers along this vertical axis:\n    1.  The 3 vertices of the bottom face.\n    2.  A layer of 3 vertices above the bottom.\n    3.  A layer of 3 vertices below the top.\n    4.  The 3 vertices of the top face.\n*   The center of the icosahedron is exactly between the two middle layers of vertices (layer 2 and 3).\n*   The horizontal plane of the water surface passes between these two middle layers.\n*   This plane will intersect all the edges that connect a vertex in layer 2 to a vertex in layer 3. There are exactly **six** such edges forming a \"zig-zag\" waist around the icosahedron.\n*   Because of the perfect symmetry of the icosahedron, these six edges are identical in length and orientation relative to the axis. The cutting plane intersects each of these six edges at their midpoint.\n*   Connecting these six midpoints forms a polygon. Due to the symmetry, the polygon must be equiangular and equilateral. Therefore, it is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface is the central cross-section parallel to the base. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
