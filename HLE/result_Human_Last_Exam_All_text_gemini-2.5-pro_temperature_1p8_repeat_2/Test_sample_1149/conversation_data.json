    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri* and a specific feature on its skull: the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone that sits in front of the eye socket. The lacrimal recess is a depression on the surface of this bone.\n2.  **Locate Primary Scientific Source:** To accurately determine the number of depressions, we must consult the primary paleontological literature describing the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen SMNS 58022). The key scientific paper is \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, published in 2002.\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors describe the individual bones of the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of the antorbital fossa, a large depression of which the lacrimal recess is a part.\n4.  **Find the Specific Count:** The paper explicitly states on page 6: \"The antorbital fossa on the lateral surface of the main body of the lacrimal is particularly deep and houses **two large accessory openings**.\" These \"two large accessory openings\" are the depressions within the lacrimal recess.\n5.  **Verify with Visual Evidence:** Illustrations and 3D reconstructions of the *Irritator challengeri* skull based on the holotype consistently show the lacrimal bone with a large fossa containing two distinct smaller openings or depressions.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the feature:** It is important to distinguish between the lacrimal recess itself (which is one large depression) and the smaller \"accessory openings\" or depressions *contained within it*. The question asks for the number of depressions *the lacrimal recess contains*, pointing to these smaller openings.\n*   **Source Authority:** The answer must be based on the scientific description of the actual fossil specimen, not on generalized depictions of dinosaurs or other spinosaurids, as anatomical details can vary between species. The Sues et al. (2002) paper is the definitive source for *Irritator*'s skull anatomy.\n*   **Terminology:** \"Depressions,\" \"openings,\" \"fenestrae,\" or \"fossae\" may be used interchangeably in descriptions to refer to these features. The key is understanding that they are distinct indentations within the larger recess on the lacrimal bone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed description of the holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess contains two large accessory depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
