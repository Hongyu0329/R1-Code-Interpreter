    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n**Question:** Let $d = 53599$. Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Factor the conductor d.**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors. It's not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Dividing 589 by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The number 31 is prime.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n**Careful point:** The conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes, which is known as a square-free integer. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**2. Understand the structure of a primitive character for a square-free conductor.**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $d$. Since $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is square-free, any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\chi_{p_3} \\chi_{p_4}$, where $\\chi_{p_i}$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive** character of conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ must be non-principal. If any $\\chi_{p_i}$ were the principal character (whose conductor is 1), the conductor of the overall character $\\chi$ would be a proper divisor of $d$.\n\n**3. Understand the order of the product character.**\nThe order of the product character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p_i}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{13}), o(\\chi_{19}), o(\\chi_{31}))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n**4. Determine the possible orders of the component characters.**\nFor the lcm of a set of numbers to be 6, each number in the set must be a divisor of 6. Therefore, the order of each component character, $o(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6.\nThe divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\nHowever, as established in Step 2, each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal for $\\chi$ to be primitive. The order of a principal character is 1. Thus, the order of each $\\chi_p$ cannot be 1.\nSo, for each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the order $o(\\chi_p)$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**5. Count the number of component characters for each possible order.**\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic and has order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check this condition for each prime factor of $d$:\n*   For $p=7$: $p-1 = 6$. The orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 6.\n*   For $p=13$: $p-1 = 12$. The orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 12.\n*   For $p=19$: $p-1 = 18$. The orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 18.\n*   For $p=31$: $p-1 = 30$. The orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 30.\n\nSo, for each of the four prime factors, we can count the number of available characters for each allowed order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**6. Combine the component characters using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.**\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose one character $\\chi_p$ for each of the four primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$ such that their orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ satisfy $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nLet's use an indirect counting method. Let $S_k$ be the set of primitive characters with conductor $d$ whose order divides $k$. We want to find the number of characters whose order is exactly 6. This is the set of characters whose order divides 6, but does not divide 2 and does not divide 3.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2| + |S_{1}|$.\nSince we are dealing with primitive characters (non-principal components), there are no characters of order 1. So, $|S_1|=0$. The formula simplifies to $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2|$.\n\n*   **Calculate |S₆| (characters with order dividing 6):**\n    For each prime component $\\chi_p$, its order must be in {2, 3, 6}.\n    The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four prime factors, the total number of combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Calculate |S₃| (characters with order dividing 3):**\n    For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 3, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 3. Since the order must be greater than 1, it must be 3.\n    The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    The total number of combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Calculate |S₂| (characters with order dividing 2):**\n    For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 2, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 2. Since the order must be greater than 1, it must be 2.\n    The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The total number of combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n**7. Calculate the final answer.**\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2|$\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$."
