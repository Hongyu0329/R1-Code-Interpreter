The common eigenvalues are found for the two possible total angular momentum states, j=3/2 and j=1/2.
For j=3/2:
The eigenvalue of J^2 is (15/4)ħ².
The eigenvalues of J_z are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.
For j=1/2:
The eigenvalue of J^2 is (3/4)ħ².
The eigenvalues of J_z are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.
