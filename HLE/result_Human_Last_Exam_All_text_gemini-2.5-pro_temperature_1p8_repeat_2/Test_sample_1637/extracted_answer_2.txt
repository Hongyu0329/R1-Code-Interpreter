Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group will very likely solve the precipitation problem. The precipitation is caused by the low aqueous solubility of the probe, which arises from two large hydrophobic regions in its structure: the planar thioxanthenone ring system and the 6-chlorohexyl alkyl chain. Replacing the existing side chain, particularly the hydrophobic hexyl part, with a hydrophilic PEG chain will increase the probe's water solubility in two ways. First, the repeating ether units of the PEG chain will increase the overall polarity of the molecule and its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water. Second, the flexible, hydrated PEG chain will provide a steric shield that prevents the hydrophobic thioxanthenone cores from aggregating and precipitating out of solution. This is a common and well-established strategy to improve the physicochemical properties of drug and probe molecules.
