    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Ambient Space:** The ambient space is a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, denoted as $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$, with weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **Hypersurface Equation:** The Calabi-Yau manifold is given as a hypersurface defined by the equation $P(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5) = 0$. The provided polynomial is $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n*   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** This is a topological invariant for simply-connected, closed 5-manifolds. For a spin manifold, it is the second homology group $H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. The question asks for a numerical answer, which is typically the rank of this group, also known as the second Betti number, $b_2(M)$.\n*   **Calabi-Yau Link:** This term usually refers to the link of the singularity of the affine cone over the projective Calabi-Yau variety.\n\n**2. Check for Consistency: The Polynomial's Degree**\n\nA weighted homogeneous polynomial must have a consistent weighted degree, $d$, for all its monomials. The degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}z_3^{a_3}z_4^{a_4}z_5^{a_5}$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i$. Let's calculate the degree for each term in the given polynomial:\n*   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\times 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $z_5^3$: $3 \\times 75 = 225$.\n\nThe second term has degree 224, while all other terms have degree 225. This indicates a typo in the polynomial definition. Given that most terms have degree 225, it is a standard assumption in such problems that the anomalous term should be corrected or removed. We will assume the intended polynomial is weighted homogeneous of degree $d=225$.\n\n**3. Check the Calabi-Yau Condition**\n\nA hypersurface $X_d \\subset \\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is Calabi-Yau if its degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$.\n*   $d = 225$ (from our corrected assumption).\n*   $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nSince $d = \\sum w_i$, the condition is satisfied. This strengthens our assumption that $d=225$ is the correct degree.\n\n**4. The Problem of Dimensionality and the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\nThe term \"Calabi-Yau Link\" for a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{C}^5$ (the affine cone over the projective variety) refers to the manifold $K = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C}^5 | P(z)=0, ||z||=\\epsilon \\}$. This is a real $(2 \\times 5 - 1 - 2) = 7$-dimensional manifold.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, however, is defined for 5-manifolds. This is a fundamental contradiction in the problem statement. Standard theories about links of singularities yield:\n*   A link of a singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^5$ is a 7-manifold.\n*   A link of a singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^4$ is a 5-manifold. However, established theorems (like the Milnor fibration theorem extended to weighted homogeneous polynomials) state that for an isolated singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with $n \\ge 4$, the link is $(n-2)$-connected. For $n=4$, this means the link is 2-connected, which implies $H_1=H_2=0$. Therefore, $b_2=0$.\n\nThis suggests that a direct, literal interpretation leads to either a dimensional mismatch or a trivial answer of 0, which would not depend on the specific weights provided.\n\n**5. An Alternative Interpretation**\n\nGiven the inconsistencies, it is highly likely that the question uses \"Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link\" as a specialized term for another invariant associated with the Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ itself. A key invariant of a Calabi-Yau threefold is its second Betti number $b_2(X)$, which is equal to the dimension of the Hodge space $h^{1,1}(X)$, also known as the Picard number $\\rho(X)$.\n\nFor a generic hypersurface in a weighted projective space, the Picard number is 1, corresponding to the hyperplane class of the ambient space. However, $\\rho(X)$ can be greater than 1 if the Calabi-Yau threefold acquires additional divisor classes. This typically happens when the hypersurface passes through the singular loci of the ambient weighted projective space. The number of \"extra\" cycles, $\\rho(X)-1$, would be a non-trivial integer invariant.\n\nThe singularities of the ambient space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$ correspond to subsets of weights that share a common divisor. Let's find these.\n\n**6. Calculating the Invariant from the Weights**\n\nThe invariant is likely the number of independent singular strata of the ambient space that contribute to the topology of the hypersurface. This corresponds to counting the minimal subsets of weights (of size $\\ge 2$) that have a greatest common divisor (GCD) greater than 1.\n\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   Let's check pairwise GCDs:\n    *   `gcd(22, 29) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(22, 49) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(22, 50) = 2`  -> This is one source of singularity.\n    *   `gcd(22, 75) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(29, 49) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(29, 50) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(29, 75) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(49, 50) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(49, 75) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(50, 75) = 25` -> This is a second source of singularity.\n*   We check larger subsets only if they are not supersets of the pairs we have already found. For instance, `gcd(22, 50, 75) = gcd(gcd(22,50), 75) = gcd(2, 75) = 1`.\n\nThere are two minimal subsets of weights with a common factor greater than 1: `{w_1, w_4} = \\{22, 50\\}$ and `{w_4, w_5} = \\{50, 75\\}$. These correspond to two distinct types of singularities in the ambient space. A generic hypersurface passing through them would have its Picard number increased by 2, becoming $\\rho(X)=1+2=3$. The number of these \"extra\" topological features is 2.\n\nThis value is the most plausible candidate for the requested invariant.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, interpreting the question as asking for the number of additional topological cycles on the Calabi-Yau threefold arising from the singularities of the ambient space:\n\nThe pairs of weights that are not coprime are (22, 50) with GCD 2, and (50, 75) with GCD 25. There are two such independent sources of singularities. Therefore, the invariant is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
