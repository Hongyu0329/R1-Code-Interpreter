    "An analysis of the question to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question.**\n\n*   **The Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. The order of the group is $|G| = 512 = 2^9$. For $n \\ge 4$, the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has the presentation:\n    $G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    In our case, $n=9$, so the group is $G = SD_{2^9}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$, which is\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i s^j$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $H$ is the image of the $k$-th power map, i.e., $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The problem asks for the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the power subgroups of a p-group.**\n\n*   The group $G=SD_{512}$ is a 2-group (a p-group with p=2), since its order is a power of 2.\n*   For any finite p-group $P$, the set of its power subgroups is given by $\\{ P^{p^m} \\mid m \\ge 0 \\}$. This is because for any integer $k$, we can write $k = p^m \\cdot j$ where $\\text{gcd}(j, p)=1$. It can be shown that $P^k = (P^{p^m})^j = P^{p^m}$.\n*   Therefore, to find all the power subgroups of $G = SD_{512}$, we need to compute the sequence of subgroups $G^{2^m}$ for $m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ and count how many of them are distinct. The sequence is $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\ldots$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the first few power subgroups.**\n\n*   **$G^1$:** The first power subgroup is $G^1 = G = SD_{512}$ itself. This is a non-cyclic group of order 512.\n\n*   **$G^2$:** This subgroup is generated by the squares of all elements in $G$. It is also the Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(G)$ for a 2-group. We must consider squares of all types of elements in $G$:\n    1.  Elements of the form $r^i$: Their squares are $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. These elements form the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, which has order $256/2 = 128 = 2^7$.\n    2.  Elements of the form $r^i s$: Their squares are $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (srs)^i = r^i (r^{127})^i = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n        *   If $i$ is even, say $i=2k$, then $r^{128(2k)} = r^{256k} = 1$.\n        *   If $i$ is odd, say $i=2k+1$, then $r^{128(2k+1)} = r^{256k}r^{128} = r^{128}$.\n    The set of all squares is therefore $\\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{1, r^{128}\\}$.\n    Since $r^{128} = (r^{64})^2$, it is already an element of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 128, isomorphic to $C_{128}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the entire chain of power subgroups.**\n\nThe sequence of power subgroups is $G, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\ldots$.\nSince $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ is a cyclic group, all its power subgroups are easy to compute. Let $H = G^2$.\n$G^4 = (G^2)^2 = H^2 = (\\langle r^2 \\rangle)^2 = \\langle (r^2)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n$G^8 = (G^4)^2 = (\\langle r^4 \\rangle)^2 = \\langle (r^4)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$.\nIn general, for $m \\ge 1$, we have $G^{2^m} = \\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$.\nWe list the distinct subgroups in this sequence until we reach the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n\n1.  $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G = SD_{512}$. Order $512=2^9$.\n2.  $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $128=2^7$.\n3.  $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $64=2^6$.\n4.  $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $32=2^5$.\n5.  $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $16=2^4$.\n6.  $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $8=2^3$.\n7.  $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $4=2^2$.\n8.  $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order $2=2^1$.\n9.  $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. Trivial, order $1=2^0$.\n\nAny subsequent power subgroup, such as $G^{512}=G^{2^9}$, will be $(G^{256})^2 = \\{1\\}^2 = \\{1\\}$, so the sequence becomes stationary.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct subgroups.**\n\nThe subgroups listed above are all distinct, as their orders are all different ($2^9, 2^7, 2^6, 2^5, 2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0$).\nCounting the items in the list gives the total number of power subgroups.\nThere are 9 distinct subgroups in the list.\n\nThe number of power subgroups for $SD_{2^n}$ for $n \\ge 4$ is $n$. Here $n=9$, so the number of power subgroups is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
