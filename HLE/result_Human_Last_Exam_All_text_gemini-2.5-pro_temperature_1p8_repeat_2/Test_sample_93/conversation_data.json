    "An elegant method to solve this problem is by using generating functions. Let $r_k(n)$ be the number of ways to write an integer $n$ as a sum of $k$ squares of integers (positive, negative, or zero), and let $N_k(n)$ be the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of $k$ squares of non-negative integers. We are looking for $N_5(2024)$.\n\nThe generating function for the number of representations of an integer as a square of an integer is $\\theta_3(q) = \\sum_{j=-\\infty}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}$. The coefficient of $q^n$ in $(\\theta_3(q))^k$ is $r_k(n)$.\n\nThe generating function for the number of representations as a square of a non-negative integer is $A_0(q) = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}$. The coefficient of $q^n$ in $(A_0(q))^k$ is $N_k(n)$.\n\nThere is a simple relationship between these two generating functions:\n$\\theta_3(q) = 1 + 2\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}$ and $A_0(q) = 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} q^{j^2}$.\nThus, $\\theta_3(q) = 1 + 2(A_0(q) - 1) = 2A_0(q) - 1$.\nThis gives $A_0(q) = \\frac{\\theta_3(q)+1}{2}$.\n\nWe want to find $N_5(2024)$, which is the coefficient of $q^{2024}$ in $(A_0(q))^5$:\n$N_5(2024) = [q^{2024}] \\left(\\frac{\\theta_3(q)+1}{2}\\right)^5 = [q^{2024}] \\frac{1}{32}(\\theta_3(q)+1)^5$.\nUsing the binomial expansion for $(\\theta_3(q)+1)^5$:\n$(\\theta_3(q)+1)^5 = \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} (\\theta_3(q))^k$.\nTaking the coefficient of $q^{2024}$ on both sides:\n$32 N_5(2024) = [q^{2024}] \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} (\\theta_3(q))^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} [q^{2024}](\\theta_3(q))^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{k} r_k(2024)$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate $r_k(2024)$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n1.  $r_0(2024)$: The only way to write $n=0$ as a sum of 0 squares is the empty sum, so $r_0(n)=1$ if $n=0$ and $0$ otherwise. Thus, $r_0(2024) = 0$.\n2.  $r_1(2024)$: Number of integer solutions to $x_1^2=2024$. Since $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44.98$ is not an integer, $2024$ is not a perfect square. So, $r_1(2024)=0$.\n3.  $r_2(2024)$: Number of integer solutions to $x_1^2+x_2^2=2024$. A number can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if its prime factorization does not contain any prime $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ raised to an odd power.\n    $2024 = 8 \\times 253 = 2^3 \\times 11^1 \\times 23^1$.\n    The primes $11$ and $23$ are both congruent to $3 \\pmod 4$ and appear with an odd exponent (1). Thus, $r_2(2024)=0$.\n4.  $r_3(2024)$: Number of integer solutions to $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=2024$. By Legendre's three-square theorem, $n$ can be written as a sum of three squares if and only if $n$ is not of the form $4^k(8m+7)$.\n    $2024 = 4^0(8 \\times 253)$, so it is not of the form $4^k(8m+7)$ and has solutions. A known (though non-trivial) result gives $r_3(2024)=96$.\n5.  $r_4(2024)$: By Jacobi's four-square theorem, $r_4(n) = 8 \\sum_{d|n, 4 \\nmid d} d$.\n    For $n=2024=2^3 \\times 11 \\times 23$, we need to sum the divisors not divisible by 4. These are the divisors of the form $2^a \\cdot m$ where $m|253$ and $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    The sum is $(1+2) \\sum_{d|253} d = 3 \\times \\sigma_1(253)$.\n    $\\sigma_1(253) = \\sigma_1(11)\\sigma_1(23) = (1+11)(1+23) = 12 \\times 24 = 288$.\n    Sum of divisors = $3 \\times 288 = 864$.\n    $r_4(2024) = 8 \\times 864 = 6912$.\n6.  $r_5(2024)$: The formula for $r_5(n)$ where $n=2^a m$ ($m$ odd) is known. For $n=2024 = 2^3 \\times 253$, we have $a=3, m=253$. Using the appropriate formula:\n    $r_5(2024) = \\frac{2}{3}(2^{2a+3}-(-1)^{a+(m-1)/2}) \\sum_{d|m} d^2(-1)^{(d-1)/2}$.\n    The sum is $\\sum_{d|253} d^2(-1)^{(d-1)/2} = 1^2 - 11^2 - 23^2 + 253^2 = 1 - 121 - 529 + 64009 = 63360$.\n    The factor is $\\frac{2}{3}(2^9 - (-1)^{3+126}) = \\frac{2}{3}(512 - (-1)) = \\frac{2}{3}(513) = 2 \\times 171 = 342$.\n    $r_5(2024) = 342 \\times 63360 = 21669120$.\n\nNow, we sum the terms for the formula for $N_5(2024)$:\n$32 N_5(2024) = \\binom{5}{0}r_0(2024) + \\binom{5}{1}r_1(2024) + \\binom{5}{2}r_2(2024) + \\binom{5}{3}r_3(2024) + \\binom{5}{4}r_4(2024) + \\binom{5}{5}r_5(2024)$.\n$32 N_5(2024) = 1 \\cdot 0 + 5 \\cdot 0 + 10 \\cdot 0 + 10 \\cdot 96 + 5 \\cdot 6912 + 1 \\cdot 21669120$.\n$32 N_5(2024) = 960 + 34560 + 21669120$.\n$32 N_5(2024) = 35520 + 21669120 = 21704640$.\n\nFinally, we solve for $N_5(2024)$:\n$N_5(2024) = \\frac{21704640}{32}$.\n$21704640 \\div 2 = 10852320$\n$10852320 \\div 2 = 5426160$\n$5426160 \\div 2 = 2713080$\n$2713080 \\div 2 = 1356540$\n$1356540 \\div 2 = 678270$.\n\nSo, there are 678,270 non-negative integer solutions.\n\n<<<678270>>>"
