    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Elements of the Question\n\nFirst, we need to break down the user's query into a checklist of specific, verifiable details.\n*   **Protagonist/Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bicycle.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car in a head-on confrontation (a \"game of chicken\").\n*   **Production Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Initial Brainstorming\n\nThis stage involves considering potential films while paying close attention to the precision of each detail. Many popular teen movies involve bikes or vehicle confrontations, so the combination of *all* the elements is crucial.\n\n*   **Is it *Footloose* (1984)?** This film features a rebellious teenager (Ariel Moore) and famous vehicle confrontations. However, the iconic \"chicken\" scene involves two tractors, not a bike and a car. Ariel does perform a dangerous stunt weaving through traffic, but she's not on a bike, and it's not a head-on confrontation.\n*   **Is it *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982)?** This movie has one of the most famous bike scenes in history, where kids on bikes are chased by adults in cars. However, none of the main bikes are pink, and the action is a chase sequence, not a one-on-one \"chicken\" game.\n*   **Is it *Now and Then* (1995)?** The main characters are on the cusp of their teen years and ride bikes everywhere. One of the bikes is a very feminine, possibly pinkish model. However, the film does not contain a scene where one of them defiantly pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n*   **Is it *Fright Night* (1985)?** The character \"Evil\" Ed Thompson rides his bike into the path of the protagonist's oncoming car to stop him. This matches the action but fails on a key detail: Ed's bike is a standard dark-colored BMX, not pink.\n\n### Step 3: Focusing on the Combination and Pinpointing the Film\n\nThe unique combination of \"teenager,\" \"pink bike,\" and \"head-on confrontation with a car\" points to a specific, memorable scene. Let's re-evaluate a major film that fits this profile.\n\nThe film is **\"It\"**, the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's novel.\n\nLet's verify this choice against our checklist from Step 1:\n\n1.  **Hollywood Feature Film / Major Studio:** Yes. It was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n2.  **Teenager:** Yes. The character is Beverly Marsh, a member of the Losers' Club.\n3.  **Pink Bike:** Yes. Beverly rides a vintage ladies' step-through bicycle. While its color is a faded, dusty rose in the film's color palette, it is recognizably pink or pink-adjacent.\n4.  **Pedals Directly Toward an Oncoming Car:** Yes. This is a crucial character-establishing scene. The bully Henry Bowers and his gang spot Beverly and steer their car directly at her. Instead of moving, she stares them down and defiantly pedals straight towards their car. It is Bowers who loses his nerve and swerves away at the last moment. This scene perfectly matches the user's description.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe film that features this scene is the 2017 horror film *It*.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
