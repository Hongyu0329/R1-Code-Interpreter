    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Sequence**\nThe sequence provided is: ZXXCVYBN_\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Primary Pattern**\nLet's examine the letters on a standard QWERTY keyboard, specifically the bottom row:\n`Z X C V B N M`\n\nIf we ignore the second 'X' and the 'Y' in the given sequence for a moment, we are left with:\n`Z X C V B N`\nThese letters appear in the exact same order as the first six letters on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, reading from left to right. This suggests that the keyboard layout is the key to solving the puzzle.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the \"Intruder\" Letters**\nThe full sequence is `Z X X C V Y B N _`. The letters that disrupt the simple keyboard row pattern are the second 'X' and the 'Y'. Let's analyze where they are placed.\n\nThe sequence seems to be constructed by taking letters from the keyboard's bottom row and inserting other letters at specific points. Let's re-structure the sequence to make this pattern clearer:\n\n*   Start with the first two letters from the keyboard's bottom row: **(Z, X)**\n*   Then, an extra letter is inserted: **X**\n*   Take the next two letters from the keyboard's bottom row: **(C, V)**\n*   Then, another extra letter is inserted: **Y**\n*   Take the next two letters from the keyboard's bottom row: **(B, N)**\n*   The sequence asks for the next letter, which would be the next inserted letter.\n\n**Step 4: Deducing the Rule for Inserted Letters**\nThe structure of the puzzle is to take a pair of letters from the keyboard row and then insert a letter from a different sequence.\nLet's look at the sequence of the inserted letters themselves:\n*   The first inserted letter (after Z, X) is **X**.\n*   The second inserted letter (after C, V) is **Y**.\n\nThis creates a new, simpler sequence to analyze: **X, Y, _**\n\n**Step 5: Solving the Secondary Pattern**\nThe sequence `X, Y, _` is a simple alphabetical progression. The letter that follows Y in the alphabet is Z.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe overall pattern is as follows:\n1.  Take a pair of letters in order from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n2.  Insert the next letter from the simple alphabetical sequence starting with X.\n3.  Repeat.\n\nLet's reconstruct the given sequence with this rule:\n*   Keyboard pair 1: (Z, X)\n*   Inserted letter 1: X\n    *   *Sequence so far: Z, X, X*\n*   Keyboard pair 2: (C, V)\n*   Inserted letter 2: Y\n    *   *Sequence so far: Z, X, X, C, V, Y*\n*   Keyboard pair 3: (B, N)\n    *   *Sequence so far: Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N*\n*   The next step is to insert the third letter of the secondary sequence (X, Y, **Z**).\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence should be Z.\n\n<<<Z>>>"
