    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific piece of information: The name(s) of the person or people whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The keywords are \"lectures,\" \"cite,\" \"Albert Einstein,\" and \"1905 paper on Brownian motion.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Correct Paper:** In his \"miracle year\" of 1905, Einstein published several papers. The one on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Initial Search for Citations within the Paper:** A direct analysis of the 1905 Brownian motion paper itself reveals a crucial point. Consistent with Einstein's style in his early work, the paper lacks a formal bibliography or footnotes. It does not contain any direct citations to the lectures of any specific individual. This means that if we are to be extremely literal, the answer is \"no one.\"\n\n4.  **Consider a Broader Context:** Historical questions like this often require a slightly broader context rather than a hyper-literal interpretation. Einstein's paper on Brownian motion was submitted to the journal *Annalen der Physik* on May 11, 1905. This was just 11 days after he submitted his doctoral dissertation, \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), to the University of Zurich on April 30, 1905. The two works are intellectually connected and were developed concurrently.\n\n5.  **Examine the Doctoral Dissertation for Citations:** Unlike the paper, Einstein's doctoral dissertation includes a short personal section (*Lebenslauf* or *Vita*) and acknowledgments. In this section, Einstein explicitly gives credit to his teachers. This is a form of citation, as he is attributing his intellectual \"stimulus\" to them.\n\n6.  **Identify the Names Cited:** In the acknowledgments of his dissertation, Einstein wrote that he \"obtained the principal stimulus\" for his work from the lectures of three individuals at the University of Zurich:\n    *   **Professor Alfred Kleiner:** A professor of experimental physics and Einstein's doctoral advisor.\n    *   **Professor Heinrich Burkhardt:** A professor of mathematics.\n    *   **Dr. J. Staub (Josef Staub):** A lecturer in physics.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The distinction between the paper and the thesis:** The literal answer for the Brownian motion paper is \"no one.\" The commonly accepted answer to this question, however, is derived from the acknowledgments in his nearly simultaneous doctoral thesis.\n*   **The meaning of \"cite\":** The question uses the word \"cite.\" While this often means a formal bibliographic reference, an acknowledgment of influence in a thesis is also a form of citation or giving credit.\n*   **Significance of the names:** Alfred Kleiner is the most significant figure in this context, as he was Einstein's official advisor (*Doktorvater*) who reviewed and ultimately accepted his dissertation.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nGiven that Einstein's work on his dissertation and his Brownian motion paper were intertwined and completed at the same time, the citation of his professors' lectures in the dissertation is understood to be the relevant source for answering this question. The lectures provided the foundational \"stimulus\" for the line of work that produced both documents. Therefore, the lectures he credited were those given by Alfred Kleiner, Heinrich Burkhardt, and J. Staub.\n\n<<<The lectures of Alfred Kleiner, Heinrich Burkhardt, and J. Staub."
