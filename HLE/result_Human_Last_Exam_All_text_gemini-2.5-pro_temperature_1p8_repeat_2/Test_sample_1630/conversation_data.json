    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ for which $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$**\n*   **Polynomials of Degree 3:**\n    *   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\n*   **Positive Derivative Condition:**\n    *   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$. This is a quadratic function of $x$. For it to be always positive, its parabola must open upwards and lie entirely above the x-axis. This requires two conditions:\n        1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n        2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n    *   A crucial consequence of the positive derivative condition is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Fixed Point Equation**\n*   We need to find the number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   Let's define a new function $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The fixed points are the roots of the equation $P(x) = 0$.\n\n**4. Determine the Degree of $P(x)$**\n*   First, what is the degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$? The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\n*   Degree of $h(x)$ = (Degree of $f$) $\\times$ (Degree of $g$) = $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The leading term of $h(x)$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$.\n*   The function $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is therefore a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**5. Find the Upper Bound for the Number of Roots**\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $P(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**6. Check if 9 Roots is Achievable (The Possibility Argument)**\nWe need to determine if it is possible to choose polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n*   **Using Rolle's Theorem:** If a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   To get 9 roots for $P(x)$, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n\n*   **Analyze the derivative $P'(x)$:**\n    *   $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   Let's find the degree of $f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n        *   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n        *   $f'(y)$ is a quadratic (degree 2).\n        *   So, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n        *   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic (degree 2).\n        *   Therefore, $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   This means $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. An 8th-degree polynomial can have at most 8 real roots.\n    *   This is consistent. For $P(x)$ to have 9 roots, $P'(x)$ must have 8 roots.\n\n*   **Graphical Interpretation:** The roots of $P(x)=0$ are the intersections of the graph $y = f(g(x))$ with the line $y=x$. For 9 intersections, the curve $y=f(g(x))$ must \"wiggle\" across the line $y=x$.\n    *   The roots of $P'(x)=0$ occur where $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. These are the points where the tangent to the curve $y=f(g(x))$ has a slope of 1, i.e., it is parallel to the line $y=x$.\n    *   For $P(x)$ to have 9 roots, it must have 8 local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima). Let these occur at the 8 roots of $P'(x)$. For 9 roots to exist, these local maxima must be positive, and the local minima must be negative.\n\n*   **Existence of Such Polynomials:**\n    1.  The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are \"open conditions\", meaning they hold in a region of the coefficient space, not just for specific values. This gives us flexibility to choose the coefficients.\n    2.  The term $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient (since $a_3>0, b_3>0$). Its graph goes to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n    3.  By choosing the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ appropriately (introducing non-zero $a_2$ and $b_2$ terms to break symmetry and create wiggles), we can shape the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ so that it has multiple local minima that are less than 1 and local maxima that are greater than 1. This would mean the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    4.  Having established that we can create 8 critical points for $P(x)$, we can use the constant term $a_0$ in $f(x)$ to shift the entire graph of $P(x)$ vertically. $P(x)$ changes by $a_0$. By choosing $a_0$ appropriately, we can ensure that the local maxima of $P(x)$ are all positive and the local minima are all negative.\n    5.  A degree-9 polynomial that goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ and has its 4 local maxima above the x-axis and its 4 local minima below the x-axis must cross the x-axis 9 times.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of a degree-9 polynomial, $P(x) = f(g(x))-x$. The theoretical maximum is 9. The analysis shows that the conditions on $f$ and $g$ are not restrictive enough to prevent this maximum from being achieved. There are enough free parameters in the coefficients of the polynomials to construct a scenario with 9 distinct fixed points."
