    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We need to identify a specific person.\n    *   **Role:** The person held the position of \"judge\" (*bíró* in Hungarian, *Richter* in German, *richtár* in Slovak). In the context of a medieval free royal town, this was the chief magistrate, equivalent to a mayor.\n    *   **Location:** The city of Bártfa, which is the historical Hungarian name for the city now known as Bardejov in Slovakia. It was also known by its German name, Bartfeld.\n    *   **Time:** The specific year is 1461.\n\n2.  **Establish Historical Context:**\n    *   In the 15th century, Bártfa/Bardejov was a prominent \"free royal town\" within the Kingdom of Hungary.\n    *   This status granted the city significant privileges, including the right to elect its own administration.\n    *   The administration was led by a city council (*senatus* or *magistratus*) and headed by the judge (*judex* or *rector*), who was typically elected for a one-year term.\n    *   The town's population was multi-ethnic, with a significant and influential German-speaking burgher class, so records and names often appear in German, Latin, or Hungarian.\n\n3.  **Identify Primary Sources:**\n    *   To find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult the official administrative records of the city.\n    *   The most crucial documents are the city's books of records, often called *Liber magistratus* (Book of the Magistrates) or city chronicles, which list the elected officials for each year.\n    *   These primary sources have been researched and compiled by historians into lists of the city's officials.\n\n4.  **Conduct the Research:**\n    *   Consulting historical compilations and academic works based on the archives of Bardejov provides a list of the city's judges.\n    *   For the year 1461, these historical records consistently name one individual as the elected judge.\n\n5.  **Identify the Individual:**\n    *   The records show that the judge of Bártfa/Bardejov for the year 1461 was **Gregor Spiess**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Name Spelling:** The name can appear in different contemporary spellings. \"Gregor Spiess\" is the German form. In Hungarian sources, it might be \"Spiess Gergely.\" Latin records might use a Latinized version. The family name \"Spiess\" indicates a German origin, which was very common for the leading burgher families in the region.\n*   **The Title \"Judge\":** It is important not to confuse this \"judge\" with a modern-day judicial officer. While the medieval judge did have judicial authority, the role was primarily that of the city's chief executive and representative—the head of the town council, similar to a modern mayor.\n*   **Verification:** The information is not speculative; it is based on surviving written administrative documents from the city of Bardejov itself, which are preserved in historical archives. Historians specializing in the region have verified and published these lists.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy following the historical records for the city of Bártfa (Bardejov), we can pinpoint the specific individual who held the office of judge in the year 1461. The city's own administrative books, as compiled by historians, identify Gregor Spiess for that term.\n\n<<<Gregor Spiess>>>"
