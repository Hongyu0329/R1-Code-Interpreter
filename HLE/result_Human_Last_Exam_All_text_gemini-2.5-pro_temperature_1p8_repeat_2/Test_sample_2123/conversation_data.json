    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Context:** The name appears in a passage describing the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Provide the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Sources and Keywords:**\n    *   \"Wide boulevards of Vienna\" most likely refers to the famous Ringstrasse.\n    *   We need to find an essay, translated into Russian, that connects Vienna and an English poet. A prominent author who fits this description is the Russian-American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky, who spent time in Vienna after his exile from the USSR and wrote about it. His essays are famous for their dense literary allusions.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Essay and Passage:**\n    *   Joseph Brodsky's collection of essays often includes a piece on Vienna titled \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (\"Путеводитель по переименованному городу\" in Russian).\n    *   Searching within this essay for descriptions of the Ringstrasse, we find a specific, characteristic comparison made by Brodsky.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reference:**\n    *   In the Russian translation of the essay, when describing the grand, spacious avenues of the Ring, Brodsky writes a line that translates to: \"Because the spacious avenues of the Ring make you want to yawn, like a volume of Milton...\"\n    *   The Russian text is: \"...просторные проспекты Ринга вызывают у вас желание зевнуть, как томик **Мильтона**...\"\n    *   \"Мильтона\" is the genitive case of \"Мильтон,\" which is the Russian transliteration for the surname of the English poet John Milton.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Finalize the Answer:**\n    *   The essay is \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" by Joseph Brodsky.\n    *   The boulevards are the Vienna Ringstrasse.\n    *   In the Russian translation, the surname that appears is \"Мильтон.\"\n    *   Translated back into English, this surname is **Milton**.\n\n<<<Milton>>>"
