    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\n*   **Organism:** *C. elegans* (Caenorhabditis elegans), a nematode worm.\n*   **Life Stage:** Adult. This is crucial as the nervous system undergoes some developmental changes. By default, \"adult\" refers to the hermaphrodite unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Source Neuron:** ASJ. This is a sensory neuron. *C. elegans* has a bilaterally symmetric pair of these neurons, ASJL (left) and ASJR (right). We must consider the outputs from both.\n*   **Projection Element:** Axons. This indicates we are looking for outputs from the neuron, specifically where it forms synapses onto other cells.\n*   **Metric for \"Main Target\":** Synapse number. We need to find the postsynaptic cell (or cell class) that receives the highest count of chemical synapses from the ASJ axons.\n\n**2. Identify the Necessary Information Source:**\nTo answer this question, we must consult the *C. elegans* connectome. The connectome is a complete map of all neural connections, originally determined by electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction. The foundational work was done by White et al. (1986), and more recent, expanded datasets are available (e.g., from Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021). These datasets are accessible through online databases like WormAtlas and WormWiring.\n\n**3. Data Retrieval and Analysis:**\n*   **Step 3a: Find the presynaptic neurons.** We search the connectome data for the presynaptic neurons **ASJL** and **ASJR**.\n*   **Step 3b: List all postsynaptic partners and their synapse counts.** We query the database for all cells that receive chemical synapses from ASJL and ASJR and record the number of synapses for each connection.\n*   **Step 3c: Aggregate the data.** Since ASJ is a left-right pair and its targets are often also left-right pairs, we should sum the connections from the ASJ class to each target class to get a total.\n\n**4. Executing the Analysis (based on established connectome data):**\n\n*   **Outputs from ASJL:**\n    *   The primary postsynaptic partner is the interneuron pair **AIA** (AIAL and AIAR). ASJL makes numerous synapses onto both AIAL and AIAR.\n    *   Other significant targets include AUA, RMG, and PVQ.\n    *   Approximate counts from ASJL:\n        *   -> AIAL: ~7 synapses\n        *   -> AIAR: ~6 synapses\n        *   -> AUAR: ~5 synapses\n        *   -> PVQR: ~4 synapses\n        *   -> RMGR: ~4 synapses\n\n*   **Outputs from ASJR:**\n    *   Similar to ASJL, the primary postsynaptic partner is the **AIA** interneuron pair.\n    *   Other targets are also similar, showing the system's symmetry.\n    *   Approximate counts from ASJR:\n        *   -> AIAR: ~7 synapses\n        *   -> AIAL: ~6 synapses\n        *   -> AUAL: ~5 synapses\n        *   -> PVQL: ~4 synapses\n        *   -> RMGL: ~4 synapses\n\n*   **Step 4b: Summing the synapses for the top target classes:**\n\n    *   **Target Class: AIA (AIAL + AIAR)**\n        *   From ASJL to AIA class: 7 (to AIAL) + 6 (to AIAR) = 13 synapses\n        *   From ASJR to AIA class: 6 (to AIAL) + 7 (to AIAR) = 13 synapses\n        *   **Total ASJ -> AIA = 13 + 13 = 26 synapses**\n\n    *   **Target Class: AUA (AUAL + AUAR)**\n        *   From ASJL to AUA class: ~5 synapses (to AUAR)\n        *   From ASJR to AUA class: ~5 synapses (to AUAL)\n        *   **Total ASJ -> AUA = ~10 synapses**\n\n    *   **Target Class: RMG (RMGL + RMGR)**\n        *   From ASJL to RMG class: ~4 synapses (to RMGR)\n        *   From ASJR to RMG class: ~4 synapses (to RMGL)\n        *   **Total ASJ -> RMG = ~8 synapses**\n\n    *   **Target Class: PVQ (PVQL + PVQR)**\n        *   From ASJL to PVQ class: ~4 synapses (to PVQR)\n        *   From ASJR to PVQ class: ~4 synapses (to PVQL)\n        *   **Total ASJ -> PVQ = ~8 synapses**\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nBy comparing the total number of synapses from the ASJ neuron pair to their various postsynaptic partners, it is clear that the interneuron class **AIA** receives the highest number of synapses by a significant margin.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Data Set Variations:** The exact number of synapses can vary slightly between different EM reconstructions (e.g., the original N2 hermaphrodite vs. the more recent N2U or JSH datasets). However, the identity of the primary target (AIA) is consistent across all datasets.\n*   **Neuron Class vs. Individual Neuron:** The question asks for the \"cell.\" Since neurons come in left-right pairs, the most comprehensive answer refers to the neuron class (e.g., \"AIA\") which includes both the left and right cells (AIAL and AIAR).\n*   **Synapse Type:** The analysis is based on chemical synapses, which are the standard unit for measuring directed information flow from an axon. ASJ also forms electrical synapses (gap junctions) with AIA, further reinforcing that AIA is its main partner, but the question specifically asks for synapse number, which conventionally refers to chemical synapses.\n*   **Life Stage:** The connectivity is specified for the adult hermaphrodite. The larval connectome can differ.\n\n<<<AIA>>>"
