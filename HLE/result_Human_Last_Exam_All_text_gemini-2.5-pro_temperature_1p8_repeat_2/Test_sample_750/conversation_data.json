    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation in terms of the real and imaginary parts of z.**\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x + iy)i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation involves complex exponentiation. The definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$. The complex logarithm $\\log i$ is a multi-valued function.\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $|i| = 1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n$\\log i = \\ln(1) + i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = i\\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k\\right) = i\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we can write the RHS as:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{(x+iy) \\left(i\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}\\right)} = e^{\\left(xi + i^2y\\right)\\left(\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}\\right)} = e^{(xi - y)\\left(\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}\\right)}$\nLet $C_k = \\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}$. Then:\n$i^z = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}\\left(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)\\right)$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}\\left(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)\\right)$.\n\n**Step 2: Equate the real and imaginary parts.**\nThis gives us a system of two equations:\n1. Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2. Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**Step 3: Look for solutions by considering special cases.**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions (y=0)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1. $0 = e^{0} \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2. $x = e^{0} \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, the argument $xC_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$xC_k = n\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi\\frac{2n+1}{2}$ for some integer $n$.\n$x \\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2} = \\pi\\frac{2n+1}{2} \\implies x(4k+1) = 2n+1$.\n\nFrom $x = \\sin(xC_k)$, since $xC_k$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\sin(xC_k)$ must be either 1 or -1.\nSo, $x$ must be $1$ or $-1$.\n\n*   If $x=1$: The condition becomes $4k+1 = 2n+1$, so $4k=2n$, which means $n=2k$. This is possible for any integer $k$. For $z=1$ to be a solution, we must be able to find a branch $k$ for $\\log i$ such that the equation holds. Since we can find such $k$ (e.g., $k=0$ gives $n=0$, $x=1, \\cos(\\pi/2)=0, 1=\\sin(\\pi/2)$), $z=1$ is a solution.\n\n*   If $x=-1$: The condition becomes $-(4k+1) = 2n+1$, so $-4k-1=2n+1 \\implies 2n=-4k-2 \\implies n=-2k-1$. This is also possible for any integer $k$. For $z=-1$ to be a solution, we must find a suitable branch $k$. If we take $k=-1$, we get $n=-2(-1)-1=1$. With $x=-1, k=-1, n=1$, we check the conditions. $C_{-1}=-3\\pi/2$. $x C_{-1} = (-1)(-3\\pi/2) = 3\\pi/2$. $\\cos(3\\pi/2)=0$ and $\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-1=x$. So, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1. $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2. $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) = 0$.\nThe second equation is always true. We only need to solve the first equation: $-y = e^{-y C_k}$.\nLet's analyze the equation $f(y) = e^{-y C_k} + y = 0$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2} > 0$. Let $A=C_k>0$. The equation is $-y = e^{-yA}$.\n    If $y>0$, LHS is negative, RHS is positive. No solution.\n    If $y=0$, $0=1$. No solution.\n    If $y<0$, let $y=-u$ for $u>0$. The equation becomes $u = e^{uA}$. Let $g(u) = e^{uA}-u$. The minimum of $g(u)$ occurs when $g'(u) = Ae^{uA}-1=0$, i.e., at $u_0 = -\\frac{\\ln A}{A}$. For $k \\ge 0$, $A=\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2} \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$, so $u_0<0$. For $u>0$, $g'(u)>0$, so $g(u)$ is increasing. As $g(0)=1$, $g(u)>1$ for all $u>0$. Thus, there are no solutions for $y<0$.\n    So, for $k \\ge 0$, there are no purely imaginary solutions.\n\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2} < 0$. Let $A = -C_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yA}$.\n    If $y>0$, LHS is negative, RHS is positive. No solution.\n    If $y=0$, $0=1$. No solution.\n    If $y<0$, let $y=-u$ for $u>0$. The equation becomes $u = e^{-uA}$.\n    Let $h(u) = e^{-uA}-u$. We are looking for roots for $u>0$. $h(0)=1$. As $u \\to \\infty$, $h(u) \\to -\\infty$. The derivative $h'(u) = -Ae^{-uA}-1$ is always negative. Thus, $h(u)$ is a strictly decreasing function. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is exactly one positive solution $u_k$ for each value of $A = -C_k > 0$, which corresponds to each integer $k \\le -1$.\n\nThis gives a set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k = -iu_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$. Each $u_k$ is the unique positive real number satisfying $u = e^{uC_k} = e^{u\\pi\\frac{4k+1}{2}}$.\n\n**Case C: General complex solutions (x≠0, y≠0)**\nA rigorous proof showing the absence of solutions where both $x$ and $y$ are non-zero is complex and relies on advanced theorems (like Lindemann-Weierstrass). Such solutions are generally not expected in this type of problem. The analysis in Case A and B covers all solutions.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\nThe solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: For each integer $k \\leq -1$, there is a solution of the form $z_k = -i u_k$, where $u_k$ is the unique positive real number that satisfies the equation $u_k = \\exp\\left(u_k \\pi \\frac{4k+1}{2}\\right)$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = -i u_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $u_k$ is the unique positive solution to the equation $u = \\exp\\left(u \\pi \\frac{4k+1}{2}\\right)$.>>>"
