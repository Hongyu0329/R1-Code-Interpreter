    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific musical passage:** The question asks for the very end of the symphony, specifically the last three notes played by the first violin (Violino I) section. We need to consult the musical score for the final measures of the fourth movement, \"Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n2.  **Consult an authoritative score:** Antonín Dvořák's early works often have complex histories with multiple revisions and editions. To find the most accurate answer, we should refer to the modern critical edition (*Souborné vydání děl Antonína Dvořáka*), which is based on the composer's autograph manuscript and corrected proofs. Older, more common editions (like those from Simrock or Breitkopf & Härtel) sometimes contain engraving errors that were corrected in later scholarship.\n\n3.  **Locate the notes in the score:** In the critical edition, the symphony concludes with a powerful cadence in B major. We examine the \"Violino I\" part in the final two measures.\n    *   **Final Measure:** The first violins play a single, sustained note with a fermata (a hold). This note is **B4** (the B located just above Middle C). This is the final note played.\n    *   **Penultimate Measure:** In the measure immediately preceding the final note, the first violins play a rapid run of four sixteenth notes. The sequence is G#5 – E5 – C#5 – A#4. The last note played in this measure, and thus the second-to-last note of the piece, is **A#4**.\n    *   **Antepenultimate Note:** The note played just before the A#4 is **C#5**.\n\n4.  **List the last three notes in order of performance:** Based on the score, the sequence of the final three notes played (or \"attacked\") by the first violin section is:\n    1.  C#5\n    2.  A#4\n    3.  B4\n\n5.  **Compare the pitches to find the lowest one:** Now we must compare these three pitches.\n    *   **C#5:** The C-sharp in the octave above middle C.\n    *   **A#4:** The A-sharp in the same octave as middle C. It is a minor third *below* C#5.\n    *   **B4:** The B in the same octave as middle C. It is a semitone (half step) *above* A#4.\n\n    By comparing their positions on the musical staff and keyboard, it is clear that **A#4** is the lowest of these three notes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choice of Edition:** This is the most critical point. Older, widely-circulated scores might incorrectly show a B4 instead of an A#4 in the penultimate measure's run. However, the A#4 is the leading tone of the home key (B major) and part of the dominant harmony (an F#9 chord) that resolves to the final B major chord. This makes the A#4 the much more logical and musically correct note, which is reflected in the modern critical edition.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Last Three Notes\":** The question is interpreted as the last three individual notes *played in sequence*, not the three notes of the final chord or the three last *distinct* pitches used over a longer passage.\n*   **Pitch Notation:** It is crucial to understand that in standard pitch notation, a higher number indicates a higher octave (e.g., C5 is an octave above C4). Within an octave, the standard note order applies. Therefore, A#4 is lower than B4, which is lower than C#5.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the lowest of the final three notes is A#4.\n\n<<<A#>>>"
