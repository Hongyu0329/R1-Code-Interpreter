    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for a specific year when a specific person (Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan) took a specific action (publicly identified himself as Azikiwe).\n\n2.  **Verify the name of the individual:** The person in question is Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria. His full and officially recognized name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another prominent Nigerian figure, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. There is no well-documented familial relationship between Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe that would result in them sharing a surname.\n\n4.  **Search for evidence of the event:** The key part of the question is the action: \"publicly identify himself as Azikiwe.\" This implies an official announcement, a name change document, a speech, or a consistent pattern of usage in official communications. A thorough search of public records, news archives (such as Reuters, Associated Press, BBC), official government publications, and credible biographical sources is required.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the search results:** Research into this topic reveals no credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself by that name. His name consistently appears in all official documents, speeches, international records, and media reports as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of the analysis:** The premise of the question is incorrect. The event—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not occur. The name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" appears to be a conflation of two different Nigerian presidents.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to verify the official names of public figures, as misconceptions are common.\n*   **Source Credibility:** Rely on official sources, reputable news agencies, and academic publications rather than social media rumors or forums.\n*   **The Nature of \"Public Identification\":** This is a specific claim. The absence of evidence for such a public act is, in this case, evidence of its absence. One cannot prove a negative, but after exhaustive searching of reliable sources yields no results, it is safe to conclude the event did not happen.\n*   **Distinguishing Between Individuals:** The question combines the names of two distinct and very famous Nigerian leaders. This is the likely source of the confusion.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself by the name \"Azikiwe\". The event described in the question did not take place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This event never occurred.>>>"
