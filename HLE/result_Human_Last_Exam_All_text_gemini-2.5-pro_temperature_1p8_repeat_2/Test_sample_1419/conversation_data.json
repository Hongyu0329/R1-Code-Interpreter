    "This problem asks for the leading order expression of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, in terms of the parameter $\\epsilon = 4 - D$, where $D$ is the spacetime dimension near four. The theory in question is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory. The solution involves using the Renormalization Group (RG) framework.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: The Lagrangian and Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian for a single scalar field $\\phi$ with a quartic self-interaction is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_0^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nHere, $u_0$ is the bare coupling constant. To determine its dimension, we require the action $S = \\int d^D x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ to be dimensionless. In natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$, the action is dimensionless.\nFrom the kinetic term, the mass dimension of the scalar field is found to be $[\\phi] = M^{(D-2)/2}$.\nFor the interaction term $\\int d^D x \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$ to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density term $\\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$ must have a mass dimension of $D$. This implies:\n$$ [u_0] + 4 \\times [\\phi] = D $$\n$$ [u_0] + 4 \\times \\frac{D-2}{2} = D $$\n$$ [u_0] + 2(D-2) = D \\implies [u_0] = D - 2D + 4 = 4-D $$\nWe are working near four dimensions, so we set $D = 4 - \\epsilon$. The mass dimension of the bare coupling $u_0$ is therefore $[u_0] = M^\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: The Renormalization Group and the Beta Function**\n\nThe RG analysis works with a dimensionless coupling constant. We introduce an arbitrary energy scale $\\mu$ and define a dimensionless renormalized coupling, $u$, such that the bare coupling $u_0$ is related to $u$ by:\n$$ u_0 = \\mu^\\epsilon Z_u u $$\nwhere $Z_u$ is the coupling renormalization constant. The beta function, which governs the \"running\" of the coupling $u$ with the scale $\\mu$, is defined as:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\nThe bare coupling $u_0$ is a fundamental parameter of the theory and does not depend on the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. Therefore, $\\mu \\frac{d u_0}{d\\mu} = 0$. Applying this to the relation above allows us to derive an expression for $\\beta(u)$. This procedure yields the Callan-Symanzik equation for the beta function:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\frac{-\\epsilon u}{1 + \\frac{u}{Z_u}\\frac{\\partial Z_u}{\\partial u}} $$\nTo find $\\beta(u)$, we need to calculate $Z_u$. In the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, $Z_u$ is chosen to cancel the pole singularities in $\\epsilon$ that arise from loop diagrams.\n\n**Step 3: One-Loop Calculation of the Renormalization Constant $Z_u$**\n\nWe need to compute the one-loop correction to the four-point vertex function, $\\Gamma^{(4)}$. There are three Feynman diagrams contributing at one loop, corresponding to the s, t, and u channels. They are topologically identical.\nThe vertex from the Lagrangian is $-u_0$. The one-loop correction is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Gamma^{(4)} = \\frac{3}{2} (-u_0)^2 \\int \\frac{d^D k}{(2\\pi)^D} \\frac{1}{k^2(k+p)^2} $$\nThe factor of $3$ comes from summing the three channels, and the $1/2$ is a symmetry factor for the loop.\nEvaluating the integral using dimensional regularization for small external momentum $p$ gives a divergence as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. The divergent part of the integral is:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^D k}{(2\\pi)^D} \\frac{1}{k^4} \\sim \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 \\epsilon} $$\nSo the divergent part of the one-loop correction is:\n$$ (\\Delta\\Gamma^{(4)})_{\\text{div}} = \\frac{3 u_0^2}{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon} $$\nTo make the theory finite, this divergence must be cancelled. In the MS scheme, the renormalization constant $Z_u$ is defined to do just that. Expressing the bare vertex in terms of the renormalized coupling $u$ and requiring the result to be finite leads to:\n$$ Z_u = 1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u^2) $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Beta Function and Finding the Fixed Point**\n\nNow we can compute the beta function to the lowest non-trivial order in $u$. Using the expression for $Z_u$ from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial Z_u}{\\partial u} = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u) $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $\\beta(u)$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\frac{-\\epsilon u (1 + O(u))}{1 + \\frac{u}{1+O(u)} (\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u))} \\approx \\frac{-\\epsilon u}{1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}} $$\nExpanding this for small $u$ (which is consistent with small $\\epsilon$):\n$$ \\beta(u) \\approx -\\epsilon u \\left(1 - \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\nA fixed point, $u^*$, of the RG flow is a point where the coupling constant ceases to change with scale, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a free theory.\n2.  $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$: This gives the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point $u^*$:\n$$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon \\implies u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\nThis result is of order $\\epsilon$. Higher-loop corrections to the beta function would introduce terms of order $u^3$, which would lead to corrections to $u^*$ of order $\\epsilon^2$. Therefore, the one-loop result gives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}>>>"
