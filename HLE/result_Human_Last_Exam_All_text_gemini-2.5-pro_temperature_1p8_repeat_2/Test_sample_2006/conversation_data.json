    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe core task is to solve a riddle presented in a haiku. The final answer must be a single word, with its letters rearranged into alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Question**\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays\", is identified as the question. Riddles often use puns or wordplay in their questions.\n*   **Careful Point:** \"The Bays\" could be a pun. Let's consider homophones or similar-sounding words. It could sound like \"The Base\", \"The B's\", or even \"The Weighs\". Let's keep these possibilities in mind as we analyze the clues.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku, Line by Line**\nThe haiku provides three key clues. We need to find an answer that satisfies all of them.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A tempest is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   \"August\" could refer to the month or to the quality of being majestic and imposing.\n    *   A good interpretation connects this to \"quicksilver,\" another name for mercury. The Roman god Mercury (the \"quick\" one) was the fleet-footed messenger, often depicted with wings, suggesting speed and chaotic movement like a storm. This line points towards a metallic element.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We should look for an answer that can be described as tempestuous or is related to something fast and powerful.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a clear calculation: 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   \"brings winds of change\" signifies a pivotal, transformative event.\n    *   This line is a very strong reference to the biblical story of Judas's betrayal of Jesus. Judas was paid **30 pieces of silver**. This act was certainly a \"wind of change,\" as it set in motion the events of the crucifixion.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The number 30 is not arbitrary. Its specific connection to a major event involving a particular substance is the central key to the riddle.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   This clue directly follows the previous one and completes the story.\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to Jesus.\n    *   \"yields\" means to be surrendered or given over.\n    *   The transaction of 30 pieces of silver resulted in a \"divine one\" being yielded to the authorities.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line confirms the interpretation of line 2. The three lines together narrate one consistent story.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues to Find the Answer**\nWhen we combine the analysis of all three lines, they point overwhelmingly to a single answer: **SILVER**.\n*   Line 1 alludes to its mercurial, \"quicksilver\" nature.\n*   Line 2 pinpoints the infamous \"30 pieces of silver.\"\n*   Line 3 describes the consequence of that payment: Jesus (\"a divine one\") being yielded.\n\nNow, let's revisit the title/question, \"The Bays?\". While the connection is less direct, it could be a pun on \"The Weighs\" (silver is a precious metal that is weighed) or a misdirection referring to the \"bay\" color of a horse, with the riddle asking for a different color (silver). Given the strength of the haiku clues, \"SILVER\" is the intended answer.\n\n**Step 5: Format the Final Answer**\nThe final instruction is to provide the answer with its letters in alphabetical order.\n*   The answer word is **SILVER**.\n*   The letters are S, I, L, V, E, R.\n*   Arranging these alphabetically, we get: E, I, L, R, S, V.\n\nThe final answer is **EILRSV**.\n\n<<<EILRSV>>>"
