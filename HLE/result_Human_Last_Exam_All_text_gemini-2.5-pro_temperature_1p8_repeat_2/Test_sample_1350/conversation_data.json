    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action 1:** A character must have visited a Roman city. This implies the character has a backstory involving travel or captivity among the Romans.\n    *   **Action 2:** This character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description must contain a clear reference to the foundation myth of Rome, specifically the story of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:**\n    *   The primary characters are the Goths of the Wolfing clan, such as their leader Thiodolf and the mystical Hall-Sun. Most have lived their entire lives within the Mark.\n    *   The plot revolves around defending their homeland from a Roman invasion, so any character with direct, prior experience within a Roman city would have a unique perspective. We need to look for a character with a background as a traveler, mercenary, or captive.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Character and Scene:**\n    *   The character who fits this description is an old thrall (a servant or bondsman) named **Otter**.\n    *   In Chapter IX, \"The Old Thrall Otter tells a Tale,\" Otter recounts his past life when he was a captive of the Romans.\n    *   During his storytelling, he speaks about the customs and beliefs of the Romans, his former masters.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Description:**\n    *   Otter describes an image he saw multiple times in the Roman city, made of both stone and bronze (\"brazen\").\n    *   He states: \"I have seen the image of this wolf-mother of the Romans carved in stone, and brazen also. She lieth down, and the young ones are at her teats, and a grim and eager beast she is.\"\n    *   This is a precise and unmistakable description of the famous Capitoline Wolf statue, which depicts a she-wolf nursing the two infant founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Indirect Reference:** The character, Otter, does not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus.\" As a Gothic thrall, he would not know the specific names from Roman mythology. He simply describes the image he saw in a way that his audience (the Wolfings) and the book's readers will understand. The reader is expected to recognize the famous iconography.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** Morris includes this detail deliberately. The Wolfing tribe reveres the wolf as their ancestor and totem animal. Otter's story reveals that their enemies, the Romans, also have a \"wolf-mother\" at the very heart of their own origin story. This creates a deep and tragic irony in their conflict.\n*   **Character's Role:** The crucial information comes not from a chieftain or warrior in the main plot, but from a minor character whose backstory provides this specific worldly experience. This highlights the importance of secondary characters in providing context and depth.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the text of *The House of the Wolfings*, we can definitively identify the character. It is the old thrall, Otter, who, in recounting his time as a captive in a Roman city in Chapter IX, describes seeing a statue of a she-wolf nursing two infantsâ€”a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
