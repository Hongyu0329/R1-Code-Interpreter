    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the First Clue: The Description of the Novel**\n    *   **The Quote:** \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **\"Intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a work of raw, primal power. It implies ferocity, violence, visceral impact, and a direct, forceful narrative drive.\n    *   **\"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This points to intellectual and structural complexity. A chess game is about strategy, foresight, intricate possibilities, and a battle of wits. This suggests a novel with a complex, puzzle-like structure, perhaps with multiple perspectives, shifting timelines, or a plot that unfolds through careful, deliberate revelations.\n    *   **Synthesis:** The novel in question must be a unique combination of brutal, raw content and highly sophisticated, intricate form.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Second Clue: The Description of the Author**\n    *   **The Description:** \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n    *   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This indicates that the author was heavily influenced by the American writer William Faulkner. Key Faulknerian elements include non-linear timelines, stream-of-consciousness narration, multiple viewpoints, Southern Gothic themes (decay, the past haunting the present, dysfunctional families), and a focus on a specific, mythologized region.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is a crucial distinction. While the author uses Faulkner's complex structural techniques, their own prose style is the opposite of Faulkner's dense, long, and labyrinthine sentences. This author's style would be more direct, sparse, laconic, or minimalist.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Author and Novel**\n    *   We are looking for a major Latin American author who fits the \"simplified Faulkner\" description. Among the authors influenced by Faulkner (like García Márquez, Vargas Llosa, Onetti), the one who most perfectly fits the description of using Faulknerian structure with stark, simple prose is the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**.\n    *   Juan Rulfo's landmark novel is **Pedro Páramo** (1955). Let's test it against the clues.\n    *   **Rulfo as \"Continuator and Simplifier\":** *Pedro Páramo* is famous for its fragmented narrative, told through the shifting voices of the living and the dead, with a timeline that moves backward and forward without clear signposts. This is deeply Faulknerian. However, Rulfo's prose is famously economical, direct, and sparse. He is celebrated for creating profound effects with very few words. This makes him the archetypal \"simplifier\" of Faulkner.\n    *   **Pedro Páramo as the \"Tiger\":** The novel's story is incredibly intense and brutal. It depicts a hellish, dead town, Comala, ruled by the ghost of a tyrannical landowner. The themes include violence, rape, revenge, despair, and damnation. The atmosphere is oppressive and raw.\n    *   **Pedro Páramo as the \"Chess Duel\":** The novel is a masterpiece of structural engineering. The reader must actively piece together the story from seemingly random fragments of dialogue and memory. Understanding who is speaking, when they are speaking, and whether they are alive or dead is the central challenge and pleasure of the book. Its structure is as intricate and demanding as a complex game.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of brutal intensity (\"tiger\"), complex structure (\"chess duel\"), and an author who applies Faulkner's techniques with a minimalist style points unequivocally to one of the masterpieces of Hispanic literature. Jorge Luis Borges was a great admirer of this work, and his critical sentiments are perfectly summarized by the clues provided.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
