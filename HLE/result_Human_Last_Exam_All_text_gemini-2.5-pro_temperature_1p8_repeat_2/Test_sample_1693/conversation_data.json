    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific ship with four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** French.\n2.  **Size:** The largest by displacement.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n4.  **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically before the Franco-German Armistice signed on 22 June 1940.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Key Terms**\n*   **Displacement:** This is the weight of water a ship displaces, which equals the ship's own weight. It is the standard measure of a warship's size and the most accurate measure for any ship's overall mass. For merchant ships, \"full load displacement\" is the most relevant metric for \"largest\". This is different from Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which measures a ship's internal volume.\n*   **U-boat:** A German submarine. The sinking must be a direct result of an attack by a U-boat (torpedo or gunfire), or in some interpretations, from a mine laid by one.\n*   **Armistice of 22 June 1940:** This is a strict cut-off date. Any sinking on or after this date is not eligible. The relevant period is from 3 September 1939 (when France declared war on Germany) to 21 June 1940.\n\n**Step 3: Research and Identify Potential Candidates**\nWe need to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats within the specified time frame. We can then compare their displacement values.\n\n*   **Search for French Naval Losses:** An initial check for major French warships (battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers) reveals that none were sunk by U-boats during this period. The battleship *Bretagne* was sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 (after the armistice). The French submarine *Doris* was sunk by U-9 in May 1940, but its displacement was only 669 tons. Therefore, the largest ship is likely to be a merchant vessel or an auxiliary cruiser.\n\n*   **Search for French Merchant and Auxiliary Losses:** A review of U-boat sinkings from September 1939 to June 1940 reveals several large French ships. The main candidates, ranked by Gross Register Tonnage (a proxy for size), are:\n    1.  **SS *Franche Comté***: An oil tanker of 11,043 GRT. Sunk on 11 June 1940 by U-48.\n    2.  **SS *Brazza***: A passenger liner/troopship of 10,387 GRT. Sunk on 28 May 1940 by U-37.\n    3.  **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger liner of 10,125 GRT. Sunk on 14 October 1939 by U-45.\n    4.  **AMC *La Hosdente***: An Armed Merchant Cruiser (formerly the liner *Djenné*) of 8,022 GRT. Sunk on 14 April 1940 by U-49.\n\n**Step 4: Compare Candidates by Displacement**\nNow, we must compare these ships using displacement, not GRT, to accurately answer the question.\n\n*   **SS *Franche Comté***: As a large oil tanker, its full load displacement was significantly greater than its volume-based GRT. It had a lightship weight of 6,750 tons and could carry 16,336 tons of cargo and fuel (Deadweight Tonnage).\n    *   **Full Load Displacement = ~23,086 tons** (6,750 + 16,336).\n\n*   **SS *Brazza***: As a passenger liner, its structure is less dense than a fully loaded tanker.\n    *   **Full Load Displacement = ~14,560 tons**.\n\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: Similar to the *Brazza*.\n    *   **Full Load Displacement = ~13,500 tons**.\n\n*   **AMC *La Hosdente***: As a converted liner.\n    *   **Full Load Displacement = ~11,500 tons**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBy comparing the full load displacement figures, the oil tanker **SS *Franche Comté***, at approximately **23,086 tons**, was substantially larger than any other French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 22 June 1940 armistice. All criteria of the question are met: it was a French ship, its sinking by U-48 on 11 June 1940 falls within the correct time frame, and it is the largest by displacement.\n\n<<<SS Franche Comté>>>"
