The product is a tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton of the starting material is converted into a cis-fused bicyclo[4.3.0]nonane (hydrindane) system, which is also fused to the original cyclopentyl ring, resulting in a tricyclic 5-6-5 ring system (a cyclopenta[f]indanone derivative). The ketone group is located on the six-membered ring, and a double bond is present in one of the five-membered rings. The dimethoxy ketal and the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether groups remain intact.
