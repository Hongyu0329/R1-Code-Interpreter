    "This problem asks for the conditions under which a system of three functions, F, G, and H, possesses a specific type of fixed point, which we'll call an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". We can solve this by generalizing the famous Banach Fixed Point Theorem (also known as the Contraction Mapping Principle) to a system of equations on a product of spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\nFirst, we must precisely define what we are looking for.\nThe user provided the following functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `G: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nThere appears to be a typo in the third function; it is labeled `G` but has a different domain and codomain. It is standard in this area of mathematics to use a different letter, so we will assume the user meant a third function, `H`. We will proceed by assuming the third function is `H: Z × Y × X → Z`.\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n#### Step 2: Establishing the Mathematical Framework\nTo guarantee the existence of a fixed point, we need to work within a space that has notions of \"distance\" and \"completeness\". This leads to the first critical condition.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Space.** We must assume that `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are not just sets, but **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point within the space.\n\nNext, we combine these three spaces into a single space, `W = X × Y × Z`. We need a metric for this product space. A common and convenient choice is the **sum metric**:\n`d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\nIf `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(W, d_W)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n#### Step 3: Defining a Unified Operator\nThe problem of finding a solution to a system of equations can be transformed into the problem of finding a single fixed point for a unified operator. We can define an operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n\nFor any point `p = (x, y, z) ∈ W`, let `T(p)` be:\n`T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Equivalence.** Observe that a fixed point of `T` is a point `p* = (x*, y*, z*)` such that `T(p*) = p*`. This means:\n    `(x*, y*, z*) = ( F(x*, y*, z*), G(y*, x*, y*), H(z*, y*, x*) )`\n    This single vector equation is exactly equivalent to the system of three equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, our problem is now to find the conditions under which the operator `T` has a fixed point.\n\n#### Step 4: Applying the Contraction Mapping Principle\nThe Banach Fixed Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. We will apply this theorem to our operator `T` on the complete metric space `(W, d_W)`.\n\nThe operator `T` is a **contraction mapping** if there exists a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1` and for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d_W(p1, p2)`\n\nLet's expand this inequality using our definitions of `T` and `d_W`:\n*   `d_W(p1, p2) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   `d_W(T(p1), T(p2))` is the distance between `(F(x1, y1, z1), G(y1, x1, y1), H(z1, y1, x1))` and `(F(x2, y2, z2), G(y2, x2, y2), H(z2, y2, x2))`.\n*   This distance is:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2))`\n\nSo, the contraction condition for `T` translates into a combined condition on the functions F, G, and H.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Contraction Condition.** This is the core condition on the functions themselves. For `T` to be a contraction, there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X × Y × Z`:\n\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\nIf this inequality holds, the Banach Fixed Point Theorem guarantees that the operator `T` has a unique fixed point, which means the system has a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nTo have a (unique) FGH-tripled fixed point, the following two major conditions must be satisfied:\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n2.  **Function Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a **joint contraction mapping property** on the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\nThese are the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the solution.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the system is guaranteed to exist and be unique if the following two conditions are met:\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces with respect to some metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n2.  **Joint Contraction Condition**: There exists a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, and for all points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X × Y × Z`, the functions satisfy the inequality:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n(Assuming the third function is `H: Z × Y × X → Z`).>>>"
