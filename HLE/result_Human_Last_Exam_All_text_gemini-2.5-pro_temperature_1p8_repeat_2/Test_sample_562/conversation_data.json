    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji:**\n    The first step is to correctly identify the components of the character 謄. This kanji follows a common left-right structure, known as *hen-tsukuri* (偏旁).\n    *   The left-side component (the *hen*) is **言**.\n    *   The right-side component (the *tsukuri*) is **朕**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    For kanji with a left-right (*hen-tsukuri*) structure, the radical is almost always the left-side component (*hen*). Therefore, the radical of 謄 is **言**.\n\n3.  **Find the Name of the Radical:**\n    The radical **言** has a specific name, which can change depending on its position within a character.\n    *   The base name of the radical is *gen* (げん) from its on'yomi reading.\n    *   When it appears on the left side of a character, as it does in 謄, it is referred to by its positional name, which is **gonben** (ごんべん). The term *ben* (from *hen*, 偏) indicates it's on the left side.\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization:**\n    The final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn transcription, as requested by the prompt's example (\"Onnahen\").\n    *   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n    *   The Hepburn transcription is **Gonben**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Decomposition:** It is crucial to correctly separate the character into its constituent parts. Misidentifying the components (e.g., confusing 謄 with a different character like 滕, or seeing it as a top-bottom structure) would lead to the wrong radical. 謄 is clearly **言 + 朕**.\n*   **Positional Names of Radicals:** Many radicals have different names depending on where they are placed in a kanji (left side, right side, top, bottom, enclosure, etc.). The radical 言 is a classic example, being called *gonben* when on the left.\n*   **Following the Example Format:** The question provides \"Onnahen\" for 媛 as an example. This shows that the expected answer is the capitalized Hepburn transcription of the radical's positional name. Our answer \"Gonben\" fits this format perfectly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine that the radical of 謄 is 言, and its positional name is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
