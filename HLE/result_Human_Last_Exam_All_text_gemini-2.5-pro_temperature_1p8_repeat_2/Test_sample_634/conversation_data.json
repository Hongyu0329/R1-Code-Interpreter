    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\n*   A polynomial matrix `D(s)` is a **right divisor** of `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)D(s)`.\n*   A **common right divisor** of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` is a matrix `D(s)` that is a right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n*   A **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)**, `G(s)`, is a common right divisor such that any other common right divisor `D(s)` is a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means `G(s) = L(s)D(s)` for some polynomial matrix `L(s)`.\n*   The GCRD is not unique. If `G(s)` is a GCRD, then so is `U(s)G(s)` for any unimodular matrix `U(s)` (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\n**2. Method: Euclidean Algorithm using Row Operations**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` is to perform elementary row operations on the compound matrix formed by stacking `P1` and `P2`.\n\nLet `M(s)` be the compound matrix:\n`M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n\n`M(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s],    (Row 1)`\n         `[-s^2 - 1, s^2],   (Row 2)`\n         `[s,        0],    (Row 3)`\n         `[-s - 1,   1]]    (Row 4)`\n\nWe will apply elementary row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another) to reduce this 4x2 matrix to a form `[G(s); 0]`, where `G(s)` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting `G(s)` will be a GCRD.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Row Reduction**\n\nThe goal is to introduce zeros into the matrix. A good strategy is to use rows with low-degree polynomials or simple entries (like 1 or -1) to simplify other rows. Row 4 has a `1` in the second column, which makes it an excellent pivot.\n\n*   **Step 1: Use Row 4 to eliminate the second-column entry of Row 1.**\n    Let's perform the operation `R1_new = R1 + s * R4`.\n    `R1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `R1_new = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s]`\n    `R1_new = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Step 2: Use Row 4 to eliminate the second-column entry of Row 2.**\n    Let's perform the operation `R2_new = R2 - s^2 * R4`.\n    `R2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `R2_new = [-s^2 - 1 - (-s^3 - s^2), s^2 - s^2]`\n    `R2_new = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0]`\n    `R2_new = [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\nAfter these two steps, the matrix `M(s)` has been transformed into an equivalent matrix `M'(s)`:\n`M'(s) = [[0,         0],`\n          `[s^3 - 1,   0],`\n          `[s,         0],`\n          `[-s - 1,    1]]`\n\nThe non-zero rows of `M'(s)` span the same row space as the GCRD. These rows are `[s^3 - 1, 0]`, `[s, 0]`, and `[-s - 1, 1]`. Let's continue reducing this set of rows.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduce the rows with non-zero entries only in the first column.**\n    We have `[s^3 - 1, 0]` and `[s, 0]`. We can find their \"greatest common divisor\" using the polynomial Euclidean algorithm on the first components, `p1(s) = s^3 - 1` and `p2(s) = s`.\n    `s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * s - 1`\n    The greatest common divisor `gcd(s^3 - 1, s)` is `gcd(s, -1)`, which is `1`.\n    This means we can perform row operations to obtain a row `[1, 0]`.\n    `New Row = s^2 * [s, 0] - 1 * [s^3 - 1, 0] = [s^3 - (s^3 - 1), 0] = [1, 0]`.\n    Since we can form `[1, 0]`, the row space spanned by `{[s^3 - 1, 0], [s, 0]}` is the same as the space spanned by `{[1, 0]}`.\n    So, our set of generating rows is now equivalent to `{[1, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final reduction to echelon form.**\n    Let's arrange our basis rows into a matrix:\n    `G(s) = [[1,      0],`\n             `[-s - 1, 1]]`\n    This matrix is in row-echelon form (it's lower triangular) and is a valid GCRD.\n    We can simplify it further to its simplest form (reduced row-echelon form). Let's use `Row 1` to simplify `Row 2`.\n    `R2_new = R2 + (s+1) * R1`\n    `R2_new = [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1) * [1, 0]`\n    `R2_new = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + 0]`\n    `R2_new = [0, 1]`\n    The resulting matrix is:\n    `G_final(s) = [[1, 0],`\n                   `[0, 1]]`\n    This is the identity matrix, `I`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe row reduction of the compound matrix results in the identity matrix `I`.\nLet's check the determinant of our result: `det(I) = 1`. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, the GCRD is a unimodular matrix. This means the original matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are **right co-prime**.\n\nFor right co-prime matrices, any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD. By convention, the simplest form, the identity matrix, is chosen."
