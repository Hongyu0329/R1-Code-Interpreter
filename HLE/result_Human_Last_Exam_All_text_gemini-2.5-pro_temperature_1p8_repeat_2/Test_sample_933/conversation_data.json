    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest efficient temperature for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:** The question is about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common and direct method for this synthesis involves reacting elemental Xenon (Xe) gas with Fluorine (F₂) gas.\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Synthesis Conditions:** The outcome of the reaction between Xenon and Fluorine is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, specifically the temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants. Different conditions produce different xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆).\n    *   **To produce XeF₂:** A large excess of Xenon is typically used.\n    *   **To produce XeF₆:** A large excess of Fluorine and higher pressure are used.\n    *   **To produce XeF₄:** The synthesis requires specific control over the conditions to favor its formation over the other fluorides. The standard laboratory and industrial method involves reacting a mixture of Xenon and Fluorine in a molar ratio of approximately 1:5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Role of Temperature:** Temperature is a critical factor in this reaction for several reasons:\n    *   **Activation Energy:** Chemical reactions require a certain amount of energy, known as activation energy, to proceed at a reasonable rate. For the reaction between Xe and F₂, heating is necessary to provide this energy and break the strong F-F bond in the fluorine molecule.\n    *   **Reaction Rate:** According to kinetics, reaction rates generally increase with temperature. If the temperature is too low, the reaction will be extremely slow, making the production process \"inefficient.\"\n    *   **Product Selectivity and Stability:** If the temperature is too high, it can lead to undesired outcomes. XeF₄ can decompose back into its elements or react further with excess fluorine to form Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Therefore, there is an optimal temperature range for efficient production.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Specific Temperature for XeF₄ Synthesis:**\n    *   Scientific literature and standard chemistry textbooks establish that the direct synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride is efficiently carried out by heating the 1:5 mixture of Xenon and Fluorine in a sealed nickel vessel.\n    *   The optimal temperature for this specific reaction is consistently cited as **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate to produce a high yield of XeF₄ within a few hours.\n\n5.  **Assess the Given Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is generally considered too high. It would increase the risk of XeF₄ decomposition and favor the formation of the more thermally stable XeF₆.\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the textbook temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It provides a good balance between reaction rate and product stability.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly lower than at 400 °C. While some reaction might occur over a very long period, it would not be considered an \"efficient\" method of production.\n    *   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for the thermal reaction between Xenon and Fluorine. The reaction rate would be negligible, making production highly inefficient or practically impossible by this method. (Note: Photochemical methods can use lower temperatures, but the thermal method described is the standard for efficient synthesis).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **\"Efficiently\" is Key:** The question specifies *efficient* production. This implies a balance of reaction speed (rate) and product amount (yield). A very slow reaction, even if it eventually produces the product, is not efficient.\n*   **Standard Method:** We should consider the most common, well-established method of synthesis unless otherwise specified. For XeF₄, this is the direct thermal reaction.\n*   **Temperature Optimization:** Chemical synthesis is often an optimization problem. 400 °C represents the optimized temperature that has been found to work best for producing XeF₄, avoiding the sluggish rates of lower temperatures and the side-reactions of higher temperatures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the established chemical principles and standard synthesis procedures for xenon fluorides, the reaction to produce XeF₄ is most efficiently carried out at 400 °C. This is the lowest temperature among the choices provided at which the synthesis can be considered efficient.\n\n<<<B>>>"
