    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *seh₂g-.\n\n**Analysis of the Starting Point: PIE *seh₂g-**\n\n1.  **The Root**: The given PIE form is *seh₂g-ieti* '(s)he’s giving a sign'. The core root is *seh₂g-. The *h₂* is a laryngeal consonant which colors an adjacent *e-vowel to an *a-vowel. The Latin cognate *sāgīre* suggests a PIE form with a long vowel, *sāg-, which would be derived from a lengthened grade *sēh₂g-. Germanic languages often lexicalize verbs from a particular vowel grade (e-g, *e*-grade, *o*-grade, zero-grade, or lengthened grade) that may differ from the one seen in a specific cognate. The Germanic verb for 'to seek' comes from a stem that points to a PIE long *ā*.\n2.  **Meaning**: The core meaning is 'to track, trace, seek out'. This aligns with Latin *sāgīre* ‘to perceive keenly, be keen-nosed’ and the meaning of its descendants in Germanic languages ('to seek').\n\n**Step 1: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Vocalism**: The PIE long vowel *ā* (derived from *eh₂ with lengthening, as in *sāg-) regularly becomes Proto-Germanic *ō*.\n2.  **Consonantism (Grimm's Law)**: PIE voiced stops become voiceless in Proto-Germanic. Therefore, the PIE voiced velar stop *g* becomes the PGmc voiceless velar stop *k*.\n3.  **Root Formation**: Combining these changes, the PIE root *sāg-* develops into the Proto-Germanic root ***sōk-**.\n4.  **Verb Class**: The verb becomes a Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic, characterized by a *-ja-* suffix in the present tense. The infinitive form is reconstructed as ***sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Result in Proto-Germanic**: ***sōkijaną**\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut**: The *-j-* in the suffix of ***sōkijaną** triggers a sound change called i-umlaut (or i-mutation), fronting the preceding back vowel. The PGmc long vowel *ō* /oː/ is fronted to *æ* /œː/.\n2.  **Loss of Medial *j***: After causing umlaut, the medial *-j-* is lost in Old Norse when it follows a long syllable (the root *sōk-* is long because it contains a long vowel).\n3.  **Infinitive Ending**: The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* reduces to *-a* in Old Norse.\n\n*   **Derivation**: PGmc ***sōkijaną** > Pre-Norse **sōkija* > (umlaut) **sœkja* > (loss of j) > **sækja**.\n*   **Result in Old Norse**: **sækja** (often normalized as **sœkja**)\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut**: As in Old Norse, the *-j-* suffix causes i-umlaut. In Old English, PGmc *ō* /oː/ is fronted and raised to *ē* /eː/. (e.g., PGmc *fōtiz > OE *fēt* 'feet').\n2.  **Loss of Medial *j***: Similar to Old Norse, the medial *-j-* is lost after a long root syllable.\n3.  **Palatalization**: The velar stop *k* is subject to palatalization before front vowels, but the development here is *k* > *c* /tʃ/. The infinitive *sēcan* is pronounced with /tʃ/.\n4.  **Infinitive Ending**: The PGmc ending *-aną* becomes *-an* in Old English (and is often written as *-(i)an* for this class).\n\n*   **Derivation**: PGmc ***sōkijaną** > Pre-OE **sōkjan* > (umlaut & j-loss) **sēcan**.\n*   **Result in Old English**: **sēcan**\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Diphthongization**: PGmc *ō* undergoes the Old High German diphthongization, becoming *uo*. (e.g., PGmc *fōt- > OHG *fuoz* 'foot').\n2.  **Second Sound Shift**: PGmc *k* undergoes the High German Sound Shift. After a vowel, it becomes the voiceless fricative *hh* [xx], which is written as `hh` or `ch`. The cluster *-kjan* becomes *-hhen* (or *-chen*).\n3.  **I-Umlaut**: While i-umlaut exists in OHG, in Class 1 weak verbs with a long root syllable, the umlaut-causing *-j-* was often lost before it could affect the newly developed diphthong *uo*. Therefore, the infinitive and most of the paradigm do not show umlaut.\n4.  **Infinitive Ending**: The ending evolves to *-an* or *-en*.\n\n*   **Derivation**: PGmc ***sōkijaną** > (diphthongization) **suokjan* > (sound shift) **suohhan* > OHG **suohhen**.\n*   **Result in Old High German**: **suohhen** (also spelled **suochen**)\n\n---\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: ***sōkijaną**\n*   **Old Norse**: **sækja** (or **sœkja**)\n*   **Old English**: **sēcan**\n*   **Old High German**: **suohhen**\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sækja (or sœkja); Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen (or suochen)>>>"
