No. Due to its fundamental properties, free-standing boron nanosheet is not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). The primary reason is that the common, stable phases of borophene possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, which means its second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Since SPDC is a χ⁽²⁾ process, it is symmetry-forbidden in borophene. Additionally, the metallic nature of borophene would cause high optical absorption, which would quench the process even if it were not forbidden by symmetry.
