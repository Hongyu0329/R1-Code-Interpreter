    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical process that is a cornerstone of quantum information and quantum optics. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon passes through a specific type of material and is converted into two lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must conserve both energy and momentum. The key physical property of the material that governs this interaction is its **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾** (chi-two). SPDC is fundamentally a second-order nonlinear process.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit a χ⁽²⁾ effect.**\nA material's response to an electric field can be described by the polarization it induces. For strong fields, this response becomes nonlinear. The second-order term in this response is proportional to χ⁽²⁾. A fundamental rule of nonlinear optics dictates that for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ in the bulk (under the electric dipole approximation), it **must lack inversion symmetry**. In other words, the material must be **non-centrosymmetric**. If a material's crystal structure has a center of inversion (i.e., it is centrosymmetric), its bulk χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero, and second-order processes like SPDC are forbidden.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of the material in question: Free-standing boron nanosheets (Borophene).**\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** Borophene is a 2D allotrope of boron, analogous to graphene. Several atomic structures (polymorphs) of borophene have been predicted and synthesized, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases. A critical feature of these common and stable phases of borophene is that their crystal lattices **are centrosymmetric**. They possess a center of inversion symmetry.\n*   **Electronic Properties:** Most experimentally realized and theoretically stable forms of borophene are **metallic**. This means they have no electronic bandgap and a high density of free charge carriers. This property is distinct from typical materials used for SPDC.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the material properties of borophene to the requirements for SPDC.**\n*   **The Symmetry Argument (The Primary Obstacle):** Since common forms of borophene are centrosymmetric, their bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility is zero. As SPDC is a χ⁽²⁾ process, it is fundamentally **symmetry-forbidden** in pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets. This is the most significant reason why they would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n*   **The Electronic Property Argument (A Secondary, but also critical, Obstacle):** Even if we were to imagine a hypothetical non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene, or if symmetry were broken by other means (see careful points below), its metallic nature presents another major problem. SPDC requires the material to be relatively transparent at the frequencies of the pump, signal, and idler photons to allow for efficient interaction and for the generated photons to escape the material without being absorbed. The high free-electron density in metallic borophene would lead to strong optical absorption across a broad spectrum (from visible to infrared). This would quench the SPDC process, making its efficiency vanishingly small. The pump photons would be absorbed before they could convert, and any signal/idler photons produced would be immediately re-absorbed.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bulk vs. Edge Effects:** The rule about inversion symmetry applies to the bulk material. At the edges of a finite nanosheet, the symmetry is necessarily broken. This could, in principle, allow for a χ⁽²⁾ response localized at the edges. However, this would be an extremely weak effect and not characteristic of the material as a whole.\n2.  **Symmetry Breaking:** External factors could break the inversion symmetry. Applying a strong DC electric field, inducing non-uniform strain, or placing the nanosheet on a specific substrate could break the symmetry. However, the question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets, ruling out substrate effects. An external field would induce an *effective* χ⁽²⁾, but this is a third-order process (χ⁽³⁾ effect), not the intrinsic SPDC in question.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects:** The \"χ⁽²⁾ = 0\" rule is for the electric dipole approximation. Much weaker second-order effects can arise from electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions, even in centrosymmetric materials. These are typically many orders of magnitude weaker and are not what is generally meant when discussing SPDC.\n4.  **Polymorphs:** While the most common borophene phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible for a non-centrosymmetric phase to exist. However, such a phase would still face the insurmountable challenge of high optical loss due to its metallic character.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The primary reason is that their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. A secondary, but equally prohibitive, reason is their metallic nature, which would lead to high optical absorption and quench any potential SPDC process.\n\n<<<No. Due to its fundamental properties, free-standing boron nanosheet is not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). The primary reason is that the common, stable phases of borophene possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure, which means its second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Since SPDC is a χ⁽²⁾ process, it is symmetry-forbidden in borophene. Additionally, the metallic nature of borophene would cause high optical absorption, which would quench the process even if it were not forbidden by symmetry.>>>"
