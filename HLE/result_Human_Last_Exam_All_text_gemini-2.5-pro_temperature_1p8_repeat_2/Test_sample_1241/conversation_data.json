    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given a system of four linear ordinary differential equations for four functions $P_0(t), P_1(t), P_2(t), P_3(t)$, which represent the probabilities of a system being in one of four states (0, 1, 2, 3). This is described as a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which typically models a continuous-time Markov process. We are also given the constraint that the probabilities sum to one: $P_0(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1$. The goal is to find the steady-state value of the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\n2.  **Write Down the System and Parameters:**\n    The system is:\n    $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n    $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n    $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    With the constraint: $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$.\n    The given parameters are:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\n3.  **Careful Point: Check for Consistency:**\n    For a valid Kolmogorov-Chapman system representing a closed Markov process, the total probability must be conserved. This means the sum of the probabilities must be constant. The problem states this sum is 1.\n    If $S(t) = P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$, then its time derivative must be zero: $S'(t) = P_{0}'(t) + P_{1}'(t) + P_{2}'(t) + P_{3}'(t) = 0$.\n    Let's sum the given equations:\n    $P_{0}' + P_{1}' + P_{2}' + P_{3}' = [-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}] + [\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}] + [\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}]$\n    Combining like terms:\n    $= P_{0}(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_{1}(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_{2}(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_{3}(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31})$\n    $= -2\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$\n    So, $S'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$. Since $S'(t)$ must be 0 and $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, this implies $P_0(t) = 0$.\n    If $P_0(t)=0$, then substituting this into the steady-state equations (where all derivatives are zero) leads to $P_1=P_2=P_3=0$, which contradicts the condition $\\sum P_i = 1$.\n    This reveals an inconsistency in the problem statement. The system as written is not conservative.\n\n4.  **Correction of the System:**\n    The inconsistency most likely stems from a typo. In a standard Markov process model, the rate of flow out of a state appears with a negative sign in that state's equation and with a positive sign in the destination state's equation. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_0'$ represents flow out of state 0 to state 1. Correspondingly, there should be a term $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the equation for $P_1'$. The problem has a negative sign instead. The most plausible correction is to change the sign of this term.\n    **Corrected second equation:**\n    $P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    With this correction, the sum of the derivatives is indeed zero, and the system is consistent with probability conservation. We will proceed with this corrected system.\n\n5.  **Finding the Steady-State Solution:**\n    We need to find $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, which are the stationary (steady-state) probabilities. In the steady state, the probabilities do not change with time, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n    The corrected system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n    2.  $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n    3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n    4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n    And the normalization condition:\n    5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n    Note that the first four equations are linearly dependent. We will use equations 1, 3, 4, and 5 to solve for the probabilities.\n\n6.  **Solve the System of Linear Equations:**\n    Let's express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n    From eq. (1): $0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$.\n    From eq. (4): $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$.\n    From eq. (3): $0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\n    Combining these results, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\n    Now substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n    $(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n    $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Required Quantity:**\n    The question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n    We have $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n    We can find $P_0$ using the relation from step 6:\n    $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$.\n    Now, we compute the sum:\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Calculation:**\n    To get a numerical value, we perform the division:\n    $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n    Rounding to four decimal places, the value is 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
