    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" for a fuzzy rule within an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System.\nWe are given:\n*   A value related to the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part): `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This represents the firing strength or degree of fulfillment of the rule's conditions for a specific input `x'`.\n*   A value related to the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part): `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This is the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`.\n*   An operation to be used: a **t-norm**.\n\n**2. Interpret the Terminology and Process**\nIn a standard fuzzy inference system (like Mamdani), the process for a single rule involves two main steps:\n*   **Antecedent Firing:** The inputs are compared to the antecedent fuzzy sets to calculate a single firing strength for the rule. The given `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` represents this value.\n*   **Implication:** The firing strength from the antecedent is used to modify the consequent fuzzy set. This step determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. The implication is performed using a t-norm operation that combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function.\n\nThe term \"rule activation level\" can sometimes be ambiguous.\n*   It can narrowly refer to the antecedent firing strength (`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`).\n*   However, the question explicitly provides the consequent's membership value (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`) and asks to use a \"t-norm operation\". This strongly implies that the question is asking for the result of the **implication step**, which calculates the membership value of the rule's output.\n\nTherefore, the most logical interpretation is to calculate the result of the t-norm operation on the two given values.\n\n**3. Address the \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" Context**\n*   Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Sets (IT3 FS) are highly complex and are used to model extreme levels of uncertainty. Calculations within an IT3 Fuzzy Logic System would normally involve complex objects (like Type-2 fuzzy sets), not simple numbers.\n*   The fact that we are given crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`) means the problem is either a conceptual question or represents a calculation on a very specific \"slice\" or simplified part of the IT3 FS.\n*   Regardless of the overall complexity of the IT3 FS, the fundamental logic of combining antecedent and consequent values relies on t-norms. So, the complexity of the set type does not alter the basic arithmetic of the implication step when single values are considered.\n\n**4. Select and Apply the T-Norm Operation**\nA t-norm (triangular norm) is a function that models the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. The question doesn't specify which t-norm to use. The most common t-norm used in fuzzy inference is the **minimum (min)** operator. Other common t-norms include the product and Lukasiewicz t-norm. We will use the standard minimum t-norm for this analysis.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n`Activation Level = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership Value)`\n`Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm:\n`Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n`min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of Terminology:** The primary challenge is interpreting \"rule activation level\". As analyzed, interpreting it as the result of the implication step makes the most sense as it uses all the information provided in the problem statement.\n2.  **Unspecified T-Norm:** Since the specific t-norm was not given, the standard choice is the minimum operator, which is fundamental to the original Mamdani fuzzy model. Using a different t-norm (like the product) would yield a different result (e.g., `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`). The minimum is the most conventional assumption.\n3.  **Irrelevance of IT3 Complexity:** The mention of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" can be distracting. The key is to recognize that the provided crisp values simplify the problem to a fundamental fuzzy logic calculation, making the higher-level complexity irrelevant to the immediate task.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the antecedent firing strength as `0.7`.\n*   **Step 2:** Identify the consequent membership degree as `0.9`.\n*   **Step 3:** The \"rule activation level\" is calculated using a t-norm on these two values, as per the phrasing of the question.\n*   **Step 4:** Apply the standard minimum t-norm: `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n*   **Step 5:** The result is `0.7`.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
