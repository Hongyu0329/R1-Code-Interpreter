    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key detail is the character's specific emotion—shame—tied to a specific memory or sensation: missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   The question pertains to the 1972 movie, not the Stanislaw Lem novel, on which it is based. There are significant differences in tone and character dialogue between the two.\n    *   The phrase \"ashamed to miss\" is very precise. It doesn't just mean the character misses Earth. It implies a deeper psychological state where the character feels they have lost a part of their humanity or connection to their home, and they feel a sense of self-reproach for this loss.\n    *   We must evaluate each character's personality and situation as presented in the film.\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Character Evaluation:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist who has most recently arrived from Earth. The entire film is framed by his profound connection to his home (his dacha), filled with the sounds of nature like rain and rustling trees. He is actively experiencing nostalgia and guilt related to his past on Earth. He is *not* at a point where he has forgotten or stopped missing these things; they are painfully present for him. Therefore, he wouldn't be ashamed of *not* missing them.\n    *   **Hari:** Hari is a \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his dead wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no independent memories of Earth herself. Her entire experience is confined to the station and what she learns from Kris. She cannot miss something she never experienced firsthand.\n    *   **Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the cold, rational scientist of the group. He is almost entirely focused on his work and treats the phenomena of Solaris as a problem to be solved. He is disdainful of sentimentality and emotional weakness. It would be entirely out of character for him to express a feeling as poetic and vulnerable as being ashamed to miss the sound of leaves.\n    *   **Gibarian:** Gibarian is already dead when Kris arrives at the station. We see him only in a recorded video message. In the video, he is in a state of extreme distress and paranoia, warning Kris about the \"visitors.\" His message is focused on the immediate crisis, not on long-term feelings of alienation from Earth.\n    *   **Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is the cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is weary, jaded, and philosophical. He acts as a guide for Kris, explaining the nature of Solaris and reflecting on their isolation. In a key scene in the station's library, Snaut has a long, philosophical conversation with Kris. It is during this conversation that Snaut confesses his deep sense of detachment from Earth. He says that he is now ashamed that he no longer misses simple terrestrial things, like the rustling of leaves. This line poignantly expresses his feeling of having lost his human connection to his home world after his prolonged, isolated experience in space.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The character who makes this specific statement is Dr. Snaut. His confession highlights the film's theme of humanity's profound and perhaps essential connection to Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
