Based on the evidence that IL-15 promotes the development of a less-differentiated, functionally superior memory T cell phenotype, one would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 would exhibit increased release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.
