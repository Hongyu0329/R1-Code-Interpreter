    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using principles from large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Foundational Concepts from Large Deviation Theory (LDT)**\n\n*   **LDT and Equilibrium:** Large Deviation Theory provides a mathematical framework to understand why macroscopic systems settle into an equilibrium state. It states that for a large system, the probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific total energy) that deviates from the most probable state is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is simply this most probable state.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem and Entropy:** This theorem relates the probability of an observed empirical distribution to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true underlying distribution. In the context of statistical mechanics, we consider a uniform *a priori* probability for all microstates. The macrostate that corresponds to the maximum number of microstates ($W$) is the most probable. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem justifies maximizing the entropy, $S = k_B \\log W$, to find the equilibrium distribution. The quantity being maximized is the entropy functional derived from counting microstates.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Energy:** This theorem (and its generalization, the GÃ¤rtner-Ellis theorem) deals with the probability of the average of many random variables. It justifies the use of the canonical ensemble and the partition function. It shows that the probability of observing a system with a mean energy density $u$ is governed by a rate function $I(u)$, and the most probable energy (the equilibrium energy) is the one that minimizes this rate function. This minimum corresponds exactly to the average energy calculated from the canonical partition function, $\\bar{E} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\log Z$.\n\n**2. Defining the System and Microstates**\n\n*   **System:** We consider a gas of light quanta (photons).\n*   **Statistics:** Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. A crucial property is that the total number of photons is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **States:** The system consists of discrete energy levels $\\epsilon_j$, with $j = 1, 2, ...$. A microstate of the system is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$, where $n_j$ is the number of photons in the energy level $\\epsilon_j$. Since photons are bosons, $n_j$ can be any non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n**3. Calculating the Entropy Functional (The Boltzmann-Sanov Perspective)**\n\nThe number of microstates ($W$) for a given macrostate defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$ is given by the formula for distributing $n_j$ indistinguishable particles into $g_j$ degenerate states within the energy level $j$. For simplicity, we can assume each distinct energy level $\\epsilon_j$ is non-degenerate ($g_j=1$). In this case, there's only one way to place $n_j$ photons in level $j$, but the total number of microstates for the distribution $\\{n_j\\}$ over all levels is $W=1$. This is not the right combinatorial factor.\n\nThe correct approach for bosons considers distributing *energy quanta*. A more direct path is to start from the well-established entropy functional for a Bose gas, whose form is justified by the combinatorial arguments underlying the Boltzmann-Sanov principle.\n\nThe entropy $S$ of a system described by occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$ is:\n$S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+n_j) \\log(1+n_j) - n_j \\log(n_j) \\right]$\n\n**4. The Constraint (The Cramer-Chernoff Perspective)**\n\nThe system is at equilibrium with a constant average total energy $\\bar{E}$. This provides our constraint for the maximization problem.\n$\\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j = \\bar{E}$\nThere is no constraint on the total number of particles, $\\sum_j n_j$, because photons can be created and annihilated.\n\n**5. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nTo find the equilibrium occupation numbers, $\\bar{n}_j$, we maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the energy constraint using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - \\bar{E} \\right)$\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_j \\left[ (1+n_j) \\log(1+n_j) - n_j \\log(n_j) \\right] - \\beta \\left( \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - \\bar{E} \\right)$\n\nWe find the maximum by setting the partial derivative with respect to each $n_j$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} \\left[ (1+n_j) \\log(1+n_j) - n_j \\log(n_j) - \\beta n_j \\epsilon_j \\right] = 0$\n\nCarrying out the differentiation:\n$[\\log(1+n_j) + \\frac{1+n_j}{1+n_j}] - [\\log(n_j) + \\frac{n_j}{n_j}] - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$[\\log(1+n_j) + 1] - [\\log(n_j) + 1] - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\log(1+n_j) - \\log(n_j) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{1+n_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n\nSolving for $n_j$ gives the equilibrium occupation number $\\bar{n}_j$:\n$\\frac{1+\\bar{n}_j}{\\bar{n}_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n$1 + \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n$\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n$\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nThe Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. This result is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential.\n\n**6. Determining the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium value for the mean energy, $\\bar{E}$, is obtained by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers $\\bar{n}_j$ back into the energy constraint equation.\n$\\bar{E} = \\sum_j \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j$\n$\\bar{E} = \\sum_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\nThis is the general formula for the mean energy of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T=1/(k_B \\beta)$. For a specific system (like a 3D box), one would replace the sum with an integral over the density of states.\n\n**7. Determining the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium value of the entropy, $S_{eq}$, is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers $\\bar{n}_j$ into the entropy formula.\n$S_{eq} = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\bar{n}_j) \\log(1+\\bar{n}_j) - \\bar{n}_j \\log(\\bar{n}_j) \\right]$\n\nThis expression gives the entropy of the photon gas as a function of the equilibrium occupation numbers, which themselves are determined by the temperature.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium state of a gas of light quanta (photons) is characterized by the Bose-Einstein distribution for its mean occupation numbers, $\\bar{n}_j$, at a given temperature $T = 1/(k_B \\beta)$. The equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy are functions of this distribution.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy ($\\bar{E}$):**\n    The mean energy is the sum of the energies of each level, weighted by its mean occupation number:\n    $\\bar{E} = \\sum_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy ($S_{eq}$):**\n    The entropy is given by the statistical mechanics formula for a Bose gas, evaluated at the equilibrium occupation numbers:\n    $S_{eq} = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\bar{n}_j) \\log(1+\\bar{n}_j) - \\bar{n}_j \\log(\\bar{n}_j) \\right]$\n    where $\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $\\bar{E} = \\sum_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S_{eq} = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (1+\\bar{n}_j) \\log(1+\\bar{n}_j) - \\bar{n}_j \\log(\\bar{n}_j) \\right]$, where $\\bar{n}_j = (e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1)^{-1}$ and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n>>>"
