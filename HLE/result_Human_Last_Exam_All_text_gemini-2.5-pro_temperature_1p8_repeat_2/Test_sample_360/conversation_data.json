    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Ligand: 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole**\n        *   Let's abbreviate this ligand as `dpttz`.\n        *   The core is a fused `thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` system, which is a rigid, planar, bicyclic structure.\n        *   Attached to positions 2 and 5 of this core are two `2-pyridyl` groups.\n        *   This ligand has two potential bidentate chelating sites, one at each end. A chelating site consists of the nitrogen atom of a pyridyl ring and the adjacent nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring.\n        *   Crucially, these two nitrogen atoms are different (one is from a pyridine ring, one is from a thiazole ring), making this an **asymmetric bidentate ligand**. We can represent it as `B^C`, where B and C are the two different nitrogen donor atoms.\n        *   In the reaction with a single metal complex, the `dpttz` ligand will use one of its two identical chelating ends to act as a standard asymmetric bidentate ligand.\n\n    *   **Complex: cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)**\n        *   This is an octahedral Ruthenium(II) complex with the formula `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]`.\n        *   `bipyridine` (bpy) is a **symmetric bidentate ligand** (`A^A`).\n        *   The complex has two `bpy` ligands and two `cis` chloro ligands.\n        *   A complex of the type `cis-[M(A^A)₂X₂]` lacks any mirror planes or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral** and exists as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n        *   Since the problem does not specify that a single enantiomer is used, we must assume the starting material is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of the Δ and Λ enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction and the Product:**\n    *   The reaction is a substitution reaction. The chelating ligand `dpttz` will replace the two labile monodentate chloro (`Cl⁻`) ligands. This is favored by the chelate effect.\n    *   `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂] + dpttz → [Ru(bpy)₂(dpttz)]²⁺ + 2Cl⁻`\n    *   The resulting product is the complex cation `[Ru(bpy)₂(dpttz)]²⁺`.\n    *   This product is an octahedral complex of the general type **[M(A^A)₂(B^C)]**, where `M=Ru`, `A^A=bpy`, and `B^C=dpttz`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Isomers for the Product:**\n    *   We need to find the total number of possible stereoisomers for a complex of the type `[M(A^A)₂(B^C)]`.\n    *   This is a standard case in coordination chemistry. The isomerism arises from the different possible geometric arrangements of the single asymmetric ligand (`B^C`) with respect to the two identical symmetric ligands (`A^A`).\n    *   Any possible structure for this complex will lack a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry because of the presence of the three chelate ligands and the inherent asymmetry of the `B^C` ligand. Therefore, all possible isomers are chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n    *   The task reduces to finding the number of unique geometric isomers (diastereomers).\n    *   For a complex of the type `[M(A^A)₂(B^C)]`, it is a well-established result that there are **three** possible geometric isomers. These isomers are diastereomers of each other. They differ in the spatial arrangement of the B and C donor atoms relative to the two `A^A` ligands.\n    *   Since each of these three geometric isomers is chiral, each exists as an enantiomeric pair (Δ/Λ).\n    *   Total number of stereoisomers = (Number of diastereomers) × 2\n    *   Total number of stereoisomers = 3 × 2 = 6.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The reaction between racemic `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` and the achiral ligand `dpttz` can lead to the formation of all six possible stereoisomers of the product `[Ru(bpy)₂(dpttz)]²⁺`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of isomers formed is 6. This consists of three pairs of enantiomers.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Recognize that `dpttz` acts as an asymmetric bidentate ligand in this context.\n*   Recognize that the starting complex `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` is chiral and therefore a racemic mixture is used.\n*   The product has the general formula `[M(A^A)₂(B^C)]`.\n*   Recall or deduce the number of possible stereoisomers for this general formula. The key is that there are 3 distinct diastereomeric arrangements, and each is chiral.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: 3 diastereomers × 2 enantiomers/diastereomer = 6 total isomers.\n\n<<<6>>>"
