    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem and key objects\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus `g = 3`. This is a complex manifold of dimension 1.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted `X = C^{(15)}`. An element of `C^{(15)}` is an effective divisor of degree 15 on `C`, which can be thought of as an unordered set of 15 points on `C` (with repetitions allowed). `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group `NS(X)`:** The group of divisors on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi group `ρ(X)`:** The rank of the free abelian group `NS(X)`. It is also known as the Picard number of `X`. This rank is equal to the dimension of the vector space of rational Hodge classes of type (1,1) in the cohomology group `H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})`.\n*   **The goal:** Find the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all possible genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n### Step 2: Relating `ρ(X)` to the properties of `C`\n\nA fundamental result relates the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve to the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety. The Jacobian of `C`, denoted `J(C)`, is a `g`-dimensional abelian variety that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on `C`. In our case, `g = 3`, so `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n\nThe key formula, which holds for any curve `C` and any integer `d \\geq 1`, is:\n`ρ(C^{(d)}) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\nThis formula arises from the fact that the second cohomology group of the symmetric product `C^{(d)}` has a natural decomposition.\n`H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot \\alpha`\nHere, the first part `H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})` comes from the pullback of cohomology classes via the Albanese map `C^{(d)} \\to J(C)`. The second part, `\\mathbb{Q} \\cdot \\alpha`, is a one-dimensional space spanned by the cohomology class `α` of a divisor `W`, where `W` consists of all divisors in `C^{(d)}` containing a fixed base point. Both parts are algebraic, so this decomposition holds for Neron-Severi groups as well.\n\nSince `X = C^{(15)}`, we have:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the smallest possible value of `ρ(J(C))`\n\n*   `J(C)` is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. The polarization provides a non-degenerate divisor class (the theta divisor, `\\Theta`).\n*   The existence of this class guarantees that `NS(J(C))` contains at least one non-trivial element, so `ρ(J(C)) \\ge 1`.\n*   This minimum value is achieved for a \"very general\" curve `C`. For such a curve, its Jacobian has no endomorphisms other than multiplication by integers (`End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}`). In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the theta divisor, `NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[\\Theta]`.\n*   Therefore, the smallest possible rank is `ρ(J(C))_{min} = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the largest possible value of `ρ(J(C))`\n\n*   The Picard number `ρ(A)` of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded above by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A) = \\dim H^{1,1}(A, \\mathbb{C})`.\n*   For a `g`-dimensional abelian variety, `h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`.\n*   In our case, `A = J(C)` and `g = 3`, so the maximum possible Picard number is `ρ(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9`.\n*   This maximum is achieved if `J(C)` is a \"singular\" abelian variety, which has the maximal possible number of endomorphisms. This happens, for example, for curves whose Jacobians have Complex Multiplication (CM).\n*   We need to ensure that there exists a genus 3 curve `C` for which `ρ(J(C)) = 9`. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0` in `\\mathbb{P}^2`.\n    *   This curve has genus `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n    *   Its Jacobian, `J(C)`, is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve `E` with complex multiplication by `\\mathbb{Z}[i]` (the Gaussian integers). Let's call this `J(C) \\sim E^3`.\n    *   For an abelian variety that is a product of CM elliptic curves, it is known that its Picard number is maximal, i.e., `ρ(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C))`.\n    *   As calculated, `h^{1,1}(J(C)) = g^2 = 9`.\n*   Thus, the maximum value `ρ(J(C))_{max} = 9` is attainable.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the final answer\n\nNow we can substitute the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(J(C))` back into our formula for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_{min} = ρ(J(C))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_{max} = ρ(J(C))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
