Based on the analysis, the two problems that the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge runs into, given the constraint of only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief) and ignoring Gettier problems, are:

1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement for a belief to be "Justified" (J) for it to count as Knowledge (K) leads to an infinite regress. For a justification (J1) to be strong enough to ground knowledge, one must arguably have knowledge of J1 itself. If one merely has a "Belief" in J1, it's too weak. But having knowledge of J1 requires a new justification (J2), which one must also know, and so on, ad infinitum. This makes knowledge impossible as it requires an infinite chain of known justifications.

2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The "Truth" (T) condition is an objective, external state of the world that is inaccessible from the subject's first-person perspective. A subject cannot step outside their own mind to confirm that their belief truly corresponds to reality. The only tool they have to assess the truthfulness of their belief is their own justification. This makes the JTB definition circular from the subject's standpoint ("I believe it's true because I am justified") and non-operational, as it relies on a condition that the subject can never directly verify. This makes it impossible for the agent to distinguish between a justified true belief (Knowledge) and a justified false belief (Belief).
