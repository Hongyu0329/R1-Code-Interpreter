    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Core Theory:** Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief.\n*   **Core Constraint:** There are only two epistemic states available: \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This means any state that fails to be Knowledge is, by definition, Belief.\n*   **The Task:** Identify two distinct problems with the JTB definition under this constraint.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that still doesn't seem to be knowledge, usually due to luck. We need to find problems with the fundamental structure of JTB itself.\n\n**2. Analyze the JTB Conditions under the Constraint**\nTo have **Knowledge** of a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n1.  You must **B**elieve P.\n2.  P must be **T**rue.\n3.  Your belief in P must be **J**ustified.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not met, your state is simply **Belief**. This \"Belief\" category therefore includes:\n*   Unjustified true beliefs (Lucky guesses).\n*   Justified false beliefs (Reasonable but mistaken beliefs).\n*   Unjustified false beliefs (Simple errors).\n\nThe problems we look for will likely stem from the nature of the \"J\" (Justification) and \"T\" (Truth) conditions and their relationship within this binary epistemic world.\n\n**3. Identify Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n*   **The Chain of Justification:** The \"J\" in JTB is crucial; it's what separates knowledge from a lucky true guess. But what justifies the justification itself?\n*   **Applying the Constraint:** Let's say you believe P, and your justification is J1. What is your epistemic state regarding J1?\n    *   If your state regarding J1 is just \"Belief\", it means it's not \"Knowledge\". This would imply J1 could be false or itself unjustified, making it a very poor foundation for \"Knowledge\" of P. A mere belief cannot reliably justify knowledge.\n    *   Therefore, for J1 to serve as a proper justification, you must have \"Knowledge\" of J1.\n*   **The Regress:** If you must have Knowledge of J1, then according to the JTB definition, your belief in J1 must also be justified. Let's call this new justification J2. For J2 to be a proper justification, you must have Knowledge of J2. This, in turn, requires a justification J3 that you must know, and so on.\n*   **The Conclusion:** This creates an infinite chain of required justifications (K(P) requires K(J1) requires K(J2)...). Since a finite human being cannot complete an infinite chain of justification, knowledge becomes impossible to achieve. This is known as the regress problem.\n\n**4. Identify Problem 2: The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**\n*   **Internal vs. External Conditions:** The JTB definition mixes conditions that are internal to the subject with a condition that is external.\n    *   **Internal:** Belief (B) and Justification (J) are states or processes within the subject's mind. The subject is aware of their beliefs and their reasons for them.\n    *   **External:** Truth (T) is a feature of the world, independent of the subject's mind. A proposition is true or false regardless of what anyone thinks.\n*   **The Subject's Dilemma:** A subject cannot step outside of their own mind to get a \"god's-eye view\" and directly confirm that their belief matches objective reality (i.e., that the \"T\" condition is met).\n*   **Circularity:** From the subject's point of view, what is their reason for thinking their belief is true? It is precisely their justification. The reasoning becomes circular: \"I know P because my belief is justified and true. I believe P is true *because* I have this justification.\" The subject has no access to the truth condition other than through their justification, making the 'T' condition redundant or unverifiable from their perspective.\n*   **The Conclusion:** The JTB definition relies on a condition (Truth) that is inaccessible to the epistemic agent. This makes the definition non-operational from a first-person perspective. It fails to explain how a person can distinguish between their own justified true belief (Knowledge) and their justified false belief (Belief), as the distinguishing factor—objective truth—is beyond their direct verification.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe two problems identified—the infinite regress of justification and the inaccessibility of the truth condition—are both fundamental flaws in the structure of the JTB theory and are distinct from Gettier-style counterexamples. They directly address the difficulty of operationalizing the \"J\" and \"T\" conditions.\n\n<<<\nBased on the analysis, the two problems that the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge runs into, given the constraint of only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief) and ignoring Gettier problems, are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement for a belief to be \"Justified\" (J) for it to count as Knowledge (K) leads to an infinite regress. For a justification (J1) to be strong enough to ground knowledge, one must arguably have knowledge of J1 itself. If one merely has a \"Belief\" in J1, it's too weak. But having knowledge of J1 requires a new justification (J2), which one must also know, and so on, ad infinitum. This makes knowledge impossible as it requires an infinite chain of known justifications.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** The \"Truth\" (T) condition is an objective, external state of the world that is inaccessible from the subject's first-person perspective. A subject cannot step outside their own mind to confirm that their belief truly corresponds to reality. The only tool they have to assess the truthfulness of their belief is their own justification. This makes the JTB definition circular from the subject's standpoint (\"I believe it's true because I am justified\") and non-operational, as it relies on a condition that the subject can never directly verify. This makes it impossible for the agent to distinguish between a justified true belief (Knowledge) and a justified false belief (Belief)."
