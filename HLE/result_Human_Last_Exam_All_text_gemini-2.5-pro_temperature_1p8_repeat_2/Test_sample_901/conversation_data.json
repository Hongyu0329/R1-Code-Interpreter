    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry is specified, which is a crucial detail.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is a polar protic solvent, often used with its conjugate base for elimination reactions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. SN2 is hindered by the bulky base and the secondary substrate. E1/SN1 are not favored because the strong base will initiate elimination without waiting for a carbocation to form.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The hallmark of an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring is the requirement for an **anti-periplanar** geometry. This means the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being abstracted must be in a **trans-diaxial** orientation (one axial-up, the other axial-down on adjacent carbons).\n\n4.  **Draw the Chair Conformation of the Starting Material:**\n    *   First, let's determine the relative orientation of the substituents in (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. Using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, we can determine that for the substituents to have 1S and 2R configurations, the Bromine atom and the methyl group must be **trans** to each other (i.e., one pointing 'up' and the other 'down' relative to the ring plane).\n    *   A 1,2-trans disubstituted cyclohexane can exist as an equilibrium between two chair conformers:\n        *   **Conformer A (diequatorial):** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less hindered equatorial position.\n        *   **Conformer B (diaxial):** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformation.\n\n5.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   The E2 reaction *cannot* occur from the more stable diequatorial conformer (Conformer A) because the equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any beta-protons.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must first flip into the less stable diaxial conformation (Conformer B) for the reaction to proceed. In this conformation, the bromine atom is in an **axial** position.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Beta-Protons in the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   Let's analyze the diaxial conformer (Conformer B). Assume the bromine at C1 is axial-down. The trans methyl group at C2 must be axial-up.\n    *   The beta-protons are the protons on the carbons adjacent to C1, which are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Beta-Proton at C2:** The methyl group is in the axial-up position. This means the proton on C2 is in the **equatorial-down** position. This proton is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial-down bromine. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **stereochemically impossible**. This would have been the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene), which is the more substituted and generally more stable alkene.\n    *   **Beta-Proton at C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is axial-up and the other is equatorial-down. The **axial-up proton at C6 is anti-periplanar** to the axial-down bromine at C1. This is the only proton that satisfies the geometric requirement for E2 elimination.\n\n7.  **Predict the Final Product:**\n    *   Since elimination can only occur by removing the axial proton from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n    *   The methyl group at C2 remains untouched. Relative to the new double bond (between C1 and C6), the methyl group is at the 3-position.\n    *   The product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Stereochemistry is Key:** The specific stereoisomer of the reactant dictates the outcome. If the starting material had been the cis isomer, the outcome would be different.\n*   **Reactive Conformation:** Reactions do not always proceed from the most stable conformer. The E2 reaction on cyclohexanes *requires* the leaving group to be axial, forcing the reaction to proceed through a less stable conformer if necessary.\n*   **Geometric vs. Electronic Control:** Usually, bulky bases like tert-butoxide favor the formation of the less substituted Hofmann product due to sterics. In this specific case, the product formed (3-methylcyclohexene) is indeed the less substituted alkene. However, the reason for its formation is not the bulky base (Hofmann's rule), but the rigid stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction (anti-periplanar geometry), which completely prevents the formation of the more substituted Zaitsev product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe name of the product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
