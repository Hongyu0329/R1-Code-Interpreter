    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Key Terms in the Question**\n\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or opened container should not be used. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is opened. It is distinct from the manufacturer's expiration date on the unopened container.\n*   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** As defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), this is a container of a sterile medication intended for a single use in a single patient. SDCs typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n*   **Ampule:** This is a specific type of SDC. It is a sealed glass container with a neck that is broken to access the contents. Once opened, it cannot be resealed to ensure sterility.\n*   **Puncture (in this context):** For an ampule, \"puncture\" means breaking the glass neck to open it.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a compounding aseptic isolator (CAI), which is the standard environment for sterile drug preparation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Standard**\n\nThe primary standard governing sterile compounding and medication handling in the United States is the **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding â€“ Sterile Preparations**. This chapter provides explicit rules for the handling of SDCs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Rules for Ampules**\n\n*   USP <797> makes a critical distinction between different types of SDCs based on whether they can be resealed.\n*   An ampule is an SDC that **cannot be resealed**. When its neck is snapped, it becomes an open system, fully exposed to the surrounding environment.\n*   Because of this direct and continuous exposure, the risk of microbial and particulate contamination (including microscopic glass fragments from the breaking process) is very high.\n*   Therefore, the official guidance for ampules is absolute and strict.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the BUD Based on the Standard**\n\n*   According to USP <797>, once an ampule is opened, it **must be used immediately**.\n*   There is no provision for storing an opened ampule for any length of time, even within an ISO Class 5 environment.\n*   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be **discarded immediately** after the initial dose is withdrawn. It cannot be saved for later use.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction from Single-Dose Vials:** This is the most common point of confusion. A **single-dose vial** (with a rubber stopper) can be punctured multiple times and used for up to **12 hours** *if and only if* it remains within an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment. An **ampule** does not have this allowance because it cannot be resealed.\n2.  **No Storage Permitted:** The concept of a BUD implies a period of allowable storage. For an opened ampule, storage is not permitted. The correct procedural term is \"immediate use.\"\n3.  **Risk of Contamination:** The primary reason for this strict rule is the high risk of contamination. Unlike a vial's stopper which helps maintain a barrier, an opened ampule is completely exposed, compromising sterility.\n4.  **Filtering Requirement:** When withdrawing medication from a glass ampule, a filter needle or filter straw should always be used to remove any potential glass particles that may have entered the solution when the ampule was opened. This is a safety measure separate from the BUD but related to the risks of using ampules.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rules for an opened ampule are the most stringent for any container type due to its inability to be resealed. Once opened, its contents must be used right away, and any remainder must be discarded. Therefore, it has no extended BUD.\n\n***\n\nThe opened ampule cannot be stored and must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded. There is no allowable time for storage."
