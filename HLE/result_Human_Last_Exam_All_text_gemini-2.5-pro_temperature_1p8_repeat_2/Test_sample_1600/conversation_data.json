    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**\n    *   **Feynman diagrams in QED:** These are pictorial representations of particle interactions in Quantum Electrodynamics. The particles involved are electrons (represented by solid lines) and photons (represented by wavy lines).\n    *   **Propagators:** A propagator diagram, also known as a self-energy diagram, describes the propagation of a particle from one point to another, including all quantum fluctuations (self-interactions). It has one incoming external line and one outgoing external line of the same particle type. The question specifies electron or photon propagators.\n    *   **Order of a diagram (2n):** In perturbation theory, the \"order\" corresponds to the power of the coupling constant, which is the elementary charge `e` in QED. Each vertex in a QED diagram (where an electron line meets another electron line and a photon line) contributes one factor of `e`. Therefore, a diagram of order `2n` has `2n` vertices.\n    *   **`a(n)`:** This is the function we are given. `a(n)` represents the number of diagrams of order `2n`.\n    *   **Non-vanishing diagrams:** This term usually implies diagrams that are \"one-particle irreducible\" (1PI). A diagram is 1PI if it remains connected after cutting any single internal line. We also typically count only the \"primitive\" diagrams, which do not contain any sub-diagrams that are themselves self-energy or vertex corrections. This is because these insertions are accounted for by dressing the simpler diagrams' propagators and vertices.\n    *   **The question:** We need to find `a(3)`. According to the definition, this is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2 * 3 = 6`.\n\n2.  **Relating Order to Loops**\n    *   For propagator diagrams in QED, there is a direct relationship between the number of vertices (`V = 2n`) and the number of loops (`L`). The number of loops is given by `L = n`.\n    *   `a(1)` corresponds to order `2*1 = 2` (2 vertices), which is the 1-loop correction.\n    *   `a(2)` corresponds to order `2*2 = 4` (4 vertices), which is the 2-loop correction.\n    *   `a(3)` corresponds to order `2*3 = 6` (6 vertices), which is the 3-loop correction.\n    *   So, the question is asking for the number of 3-loop 1PI diagrams for the electron or photon propagator.\n\n3.  **Counting the Diagrams**\n    *   The number of topologically distinct, primitive, 1PI Feynman diagrams for QED is a well-known result in quantum field theory. Due to gauge invariance (specifically, the Ward-Takahashi identities), the number of such diagrams is the same for the electron self-energy, the photon self-energy, and the vertex correction at any given loop order.\n    *   We can list the known values for `a(n)` for small `n`:\n        *   **n = 1 (1 loop, order 2):** There is only **one** possible diagram for the electron self-energy. An electron emits a photon and reabsorbs it. Thus, `a(1) = 1`.\n        *   **n = 2 (2 loops, order 4):** There are **two** distinct primitive 1PI diagrams for the electron self-energy. These correspond to a vertex insertion and a self-energy insertion on the internal lines of the 1-loop diagram. Thus, `a(2) = 2`.\n        *   **n = 3 (3 loops, order 6):** The enumeration becomes more complex. It requires careful graphical analysis to find all unique topologies. This has been a classic calculation in QED. The established result is that there are **seven** distinct primitive 1PI diagrams at this order. Thus, `a(3) = 7`.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion**\n    *   The question asks for `a(3)`.\n    *   `a(3)` is the number of diagrams of order `2*3 = 6`.\n    *   This corresponds to the 3-loop self-energy corrections in QED.\n    *   The number of such diagrams is a known value from the literature of quantum field theory.\n    *   Following the established sequence `a(1)=1`, `a(2)=2`, the next term is `a(3)=7`.\n\nTherefore, a(3) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
