    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has a perimeter of squares known as the edge squares. We need to find the total number of these squares.\n    *   The top rank (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n    *   The bottom rank (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n    *   The left file (file 'a') has 8 squares, but the top and bottom squares (a8 and a1) have already been counted. This adds 6 more squares.\n    *   The right file (file 'h') also has 8 squares, but its corners (h8 and h1) have been counted. This adds another 6 squares.\n    *   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n2.  **Understand the Bishop's Movement and Constraint:** The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares. The crucial rule in such placement puzzles is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks any square along the same diagonal.\n\n3.  **Separate by Color:** A key property of bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only move to and attack other white squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark square only ever interacts with other dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for white edge squares and dark edge squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n4.  **Count Edge Squares by Color:** The 28 edge squares are divided equally between the two colors.\n    *   Total White Edge Squares: 14\n    *   Total Dark Edge Squares: 14\n\n5.  **Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares:** Let's find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. A systematic way is to place bishops along one side and see what they attack.\n    *   The white edge squares on file 'a' are a2, a4, and a6.\n    *   The white edge squares on rank 1 are b1, d1, f1, and h1.\n    *   Let's place a bishop on **a2**. It attacks diagonally, and one of the squares it attacks is the edge square **b1**.\n    *   Place a bishop on **a4**. It attacks the edge square **d1**.\n    *   Place a bishop on **a6**. It attacks the edge square **f1**.\n    *   The corner square **a8** is also white. Placing a bishop on **a8** attacks the edge square **h1**.\n    *   So, by placing 4 bishops on a2, a4, a6, and a8, we have also blocked the 4 white squares on rank 1 (b1, d1, f1, h1). This covers 8 of the 14 white edge squares.\n    *   The remaining 6 white edge squares are on file 'h' (h3, h5, h7) and rank 8 (c8, e8, g8). Let's check the attacks between these squares:\n        *   A bishop on c8 attacks h3.\n        *   A bishop on e8 attacks h5.\n        *   A bishop on g8 attacks h7.\n    *   From these 6 squares, we can only place 3 non-attacking bishops (e.g., on c8, e8, and g8).\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops on the white edge squares is 4 (from file 'a') + 3 (from rank 8) = **7**.\n\n6.  **Maximize Bishops on Dark Edge Squares:** Due to the symmetrical nature of the chessboard, the logic for the dark squares is identical to the white squares. There are 14 dark edge squares, and we can place a maximum of **7** non-attacking bishops on them.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Number of Bishops:** Since the white and dark square placements are independent, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board is the sum of the maximums for each color.\n    *   Total Bishops = 7 (on white squares) + 7 (on dark squares) = **14 bishops**.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Number of Empty Edge Squares:** The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n    *   Total Edge Squares = 28\n    *   Edge Squares with Bishops = 14\n    *   Edge Squares without Bishops = Total Edge Squares - Edge Squares with Bishops\n    *   Edge Squares without Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Total edge squares on an 8x8 board: 28.\n*   The problem is separated by color: 14 white edge squares and 14 dark edge squares.\n*   Maximum non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares: 7.\n*   Maximum non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 dark edge squares: 7.\n*   Total maximum bishops placed on the edge: 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   Number of edge squares lacking a bishop = Total Edge Squares - Total Bishops Placed = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
