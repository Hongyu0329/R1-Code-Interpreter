    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Definitions:**\n    *   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** This is a finite set $X$ equipped with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality (or ultrametric inequality): $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$. A key aspect is that \"finite\" does not exclude the case of a space with only one point, $X=\\{x_0\\}$. Such a space is a valid ultrametric space where $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$.\n    *   **Banach Space (B):** This is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ with a complete norm. The cardinality of the Banach space is given as $K$. Importantly, the definition of a Banach space allows for the zero space, $B = \\{0\\}$. In this case, its cardinality is $K=1$. Any other Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ must be infinite; if $B \\ne \\{0\\}$, it contains a non-zero vector $v$, and thus all its scalar multiples $\\alpha v$, making it an infinite set of at least cardinality of the continuum, $c=|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances, meaning $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Question:**\n    The question asks for \"the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of $X$ in $B$\". This means we need to find the value of $|\\mathcal{E}(X, B)|$, the number of such embeddings, and then find the minimum value this number can take across all possible choices of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (of some cardinality $K$). Crucially, we consider only pairs $(X, B)$ for which at least one embedding exists, otherwise, the number would be 0, and the question would be trivial. We are seeking $\\min \\{ |\\mathcal{E}(X, B)| \\mid \\mathcal{E}(X, B) \\ne \\emptyset \\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Non-Trivial Cases:**\n    *   Let's first consider a \"non-trivial\" space $X$, for instance, a space with at least two points ($|X| \\ge 2$). For an isometric embedding to exist, the target space $B$ cannot be the zero space $\\{0\\}$, because if $x \\ne y$ in $X$, then $d(x,y)>0$, but any map $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ would give $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = \\|0-0\\|=0$. So, we must have $B \\ne \\{0\\}$.\n    *   As established, if $B \\ne \\{0\\}$, it is an infinite-dimensional space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ and has infinite cardinality $K \\ge c$.\n    *   Let's assume an isometric embedding $f_0: X \\to B$ exists for such a pair $(X,B)$. It is a known result that for any finite metric space $X$, such a Banach space $B$ can always be found (for example, $\\ell_\\infty(|X|)$).\n    *   Now, consider the family of functions $f_v : X \\to B$ defined by $f_v(x) = f_0(x) + v$ for any constant vector $v \\in B$.\n    *   Let's check if $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n        $\\|f_v(x) - f_v(y)\\| = \\|(f_0(x)+v) - (f_0(y)+v)\\| = \\|f_0(x) - f_0(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n        The distance is preserved.\n    *   For any two different vectors $v_1 \\ne v_2$ in $B$, the functions $f_{v_1}$ and $f_{v_2}$ are different.\n    *   Thus, there are at least as many isometric embeddings as there are vectors in $B$. Since $|B| = K \\ge c$ is infinite, the number of isometric embeddings is infinite in any such non-trivial case.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Trivial (Degenerate) Cases:**\n    *   The previous analysis suggests that if we restrict ourselves to non-trivial spaces, the \"smallest number\" would be an infinite cardinality (e.g., $c$), which is usually not the expected format of an answer to such a question. This prompts us to consider the degenerate cases not explicitly excluded by the problem statement.\n    *   Let's choose the simplest finite ultrametric space: a one-point space $X = \\{x_0\\}$.\n    *   Let's choose the simplest Banach space: the zero space $B = \\{0\\}$, which has cardinality $K=1$.\n    *   Now, let's find the isometric embeddings $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one possible function between these two sets: the one that maps $x_0$ to $0$. Let's call it $f_{const_0}$. So, $f_{const_0}(x_0) = 0$.\n    *   We need to verify if this function is an isometric embedding. The condition is $\\|f_{const_0}(x_0) - f_{const_0}(x_0)\\| = d(x_0, x_0)$.\n    *   By definition, $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. The left side of the equation is $\\|0-0\\| = 0$.\n    *   Since $0=0$, the condition is met. $f_{const_0}$ is an isometric embedding.\n    *   Since this is the only possible function, there is exactly one isometric embedding for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have found a pair $(X, B)$—namely, a single-point space and the zero Banach space—for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n    *   The number of existing embeddings must be a positive integer.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1. The specific properties of $X$ being an ultrametric space are not crucial for finding this minimum, as the argument relies on general properties of metric spaces and Banach spaces, particularly the consequences of allowing degenerate cases.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
