    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\n\n*   **The Simplex Category, $\\Delta$**: The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. A morphism $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a non-decreasing function, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[n]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[m]$.\n*   **As a Locally Posetal 2-Subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**: This means that for any two objects $[n]$ and $[m]$, the set of morphisms between them, $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([n], [m])$, forms a partially ordered set (a poset). The order relation is given by the pointwise comparison: for two morphisms $f, g: [n] \\to [m]$, we say $f \\le g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [n]$. This gives a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$. Since there's at most one 2-morphism between any parallel pair of 1-morphisms, the hom-categories are posets, and $\\Delta$ is \"locally posetal\".\n\n### Step 2: Defining an Internal Adjunction in $\\Delta$\n\nAn internal adjunction from $[n]$ to $[m]$ (in this case, from $[23]$ to $[37]$) consists of:\n1.  A pair of morphisms: a left adjoint $f: [23] \\to [37]$ and a right adjoint $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n2.  A pair of 2-morphisms: a unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and a counit $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$.\n\nIn the context of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category, these conditions translate to:\n1.  $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is a non-decreasing function.\n2.  $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is a non-decreasing function.\n3.  The unit $\\eta$ corresponds to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [23]$.\n4.  The counit $\\epsilon$ corresponds to the inequality $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [37]$.\n\nThese four conditions are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$, where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. The triangle identities required for an adjunction are automatically satisfied in a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing Adjoints between Posets $[n]$ and $[m]$\n\nFor posets that are complete lattices (which $[n]$ and $[m]$ are, being finite total orders), a function is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and a function is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\n*   **Left Adjoint ($f$)**: For $f: [23] \\to [37]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema.\n    *   A non-decreasing function between total orders automatically preserves the suprema (maxima) of non-empty sets.\n    *   We must also check the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element of the poset. In $[n]$, the bottom element is $0$.\n    *   The preservation of suprema condition thus simplifies to $f(\\sup_{i \\in \\emptyset} i) = \\sup_{y \\in f(\\emptyset)} y$.\n    *   This translates to $f(0) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, a non-decreasing function $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\n*   **Right Adjoint ($g$)**: For $g: [37] \\to [23]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve all infima.\n    *   Similarly, a non-decreasing function automatically preserves the infima (minima) of non-empty sets.\n    *   We must check the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element of the poset. In $[n]$, the top element is $n$.\n    *   The preservation of infima condition becomes $g(\\inf_{j \\in \\emptyset} j) = \\inf_{x \\in g(\\emptyset)} x$.\n    *   This translates to $g(37) = 23$.\n    *   Therefore, a non-decreasing function $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(37) = 23$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. So, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints $f$, which is also equal to the number of possible right adjoints $g$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Adjunctions\n\nWe can count the number of such adjunctions by counting the number of valid left adjoints $f$.\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing functions $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nA non-decreasing function is defined by its sequence of values, which must be non-decreasing:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\nThe domain is $[23] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, and the codomain is $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to find the number of sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We need to choose 23 values (for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) from the set of possible outcomes $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. Since the sequence must be non-decreasing, this is a combination-with-repetition problem (also known as \"stars and bars\" or multiset coefficient).\n\n*   The number of values we need to choose is $k = 23$.\n*   The number of options to choose from is the size of the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which is $N = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\n\nThe formula for the number of ways to choose a multiset of size $k$ from a set of size $N$ is:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\nPlugging in our values for $N$ and $k$:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a check, we can count the number of valid right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$ where $g(37)=23$. This requires counting non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\n*   Number of values to choose: $k' = 37$ (for $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$).\n*   Number of options to choose from: $N' = 23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.\nThe count is $\\binom{N'+k'-1}{k'} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, our result is consistent.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
