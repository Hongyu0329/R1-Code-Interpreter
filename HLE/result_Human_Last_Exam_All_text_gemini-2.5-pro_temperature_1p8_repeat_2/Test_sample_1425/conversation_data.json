    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** The system can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir. This ensemble is characterized by a constant temperature $T$ (or inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$), volume $V$, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **Partition Function (Z):** The grand canonical partition function is defined as the trace ($\\text{Tr}$) over the Fock space of the system:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\n    where $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's energy Hamiltonian operator and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   **Given Hamiltonian:** The problem states the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. A careful interpretation is necessary. The standard formulation uses a system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ (describing kinetic and potential energy) and a chemical potential term $-\\mu\\hat{N}$. The question's notation suggests that the system's intrinsic energy is zero, i.e., $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$. This might describe a system of non-interacting particles localized on sites, where the energy of each site is taken as the zero of energy.\n*   **Operator to be Traced:** With $\\hat{H}_{sys}=0$, the operator inside the exponential of the partition function becomes $(0 - \\mu\\hat{N}) = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n    Therefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n**2. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\n*   The partition function can be expressed as a functional integral (path integral) over fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is imaginary time running from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** The Euclidean action corresponding to a grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$ is given by:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{H}_{op} - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n    where $\\hat{H}_{op}$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.\n*   **Action for this System:** In our case, $\\hat{H}_{sys}=0$, which implies $\\hat{H}_{op}=0$. Thus, the Euclidean action simplifies to:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n    This is the path integral representation of the partition function.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe action has no spatial derivatives (no kinetic term), meaning all single-particle modes (e.g., momentum states) are degenerate. Let $g$ be the total number of single-particle states (degeneracy). The system is equivalent to $g$ independent systems, so the total partition function is $Z = (Z_1)^g$, where $Z_1$ is the partition function for a single state. The evaluation of the path integral depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\n**Case A: The system consists of Bosons**\n\n*   **Formalism:** The fields $\\psi$ are commuting complex numbers. The path integral requires periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\psi(\\tau=0) = \\psi(\\tau=\\beta)$. The path integral is a Gaussian integral, and for bosons, its value is inversely proportional to the determinant of the operator in the action.\n    $Z_B \\propto [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-g}$\n*   **Evaluation:** To evaluate the determinant, we find its eigenvalues. We expand the field in a Fourier series (Matsubara modes) that respects the periodic boundary conditions: $\\psi(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_n$, where $\\omega_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\beta}$ (for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.\n    The operator $\\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ has eigenvalues $i\\omega_n - \\mu$.\n    $\\ln Z_B = -g \\ln(\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)) = -g \\text{Tr}\\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = -g \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n*   **Matsubara Sum:** Using the standard formula for summing over bosonic Matsubara frequencies:\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(E - i\\omega_n) = \\text{const} + \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E})$\n    Here, our energy term is $E = \\mu$. So we get:\n    $\\ln Z_B = -g (\\text{const} + \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu}))$\n    Ignoring the infinite constant which is removed by proper normalization of the path integral measure, we have:\n    $\\ln Z_B = -g \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})$\n*   **Result for Bosons:**\n    $Z_B = (1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})^{-g}$\n    This result is physically sensible only if the argument of the logarithm is positive, i.e., $1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu} > 0$, which implies $e^{\\beta\\mu} < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this requires the chemical potential to be negative, $\\mu < 0$. This prevents an infinite number of bosons from occupying the zero-energy states (Bose-Einstein condensation).\n\n**Case B: The system consists of Fermions**\n\n*   **Formalism:** The fields $\\psi$ are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The path integral requires anti-periodic boundary conditions: $\\psi(\\tau=0) = -\\psi(\\tau=\\beta)$. For Grassmann variables, a Gaussian integral is directly proportional to the determinant.\n    $Z_F \\propto [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{+g}$\n*   **Evaluation:** The anti-periodic boundary conditions lead to fermionic Matsubara frequencies: $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$ (for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$). The eigenvalues of the operator are still $i\\omega_n - \\mu$.\n    $\\ln Z_F = +g \\ln(\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)) = g \\text{Tr}\\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = g \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n*   **Matsubara Sum:** Using the standard formula for summing over fermionic Matsubara frequencies:\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(E - i\\omega_n) = \\text{const} + \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta E})$\n    With $E=\\mu$, we get:\n    $\\ln Z_F = g (\\text{const} + \\ln(1 + e^{-\\beta\\mu}))$\n    Again, ignoring the normalization constant:\n    $\\ln Z_F = g \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n*   **Result for Fermions:**\n    $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^g$\n    This result is valid for any real value of $\\mu$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Hamiltonian Interpretation:** Correctly identifying that $\\hat{H}_{sys}=0$ is the crucial first step.\n2.  **Path Integral Action:** Correctly writing the Euclidean action as $S_E = \\int \\psi^*(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\psi$.\n3.  **Boson vs. Fermion Distinction:** This is the most important part of the analysis. It dictates the boundary conditions (periodic/anti-periodic), the type of fields (complex/Grassmann), the determinant formula ($(\\det)^{-1}$ vs. $\\det$), and the Matsubara frequencies.\n4.  **Matsubara Summation:** Using the correct complex analysis identities to perform the infinite sums over Matsubara frequencies.\n5.  **Physical Conditions:** Recognizing the constraint $\\mu<0$ for the bosonic case to have a well-defined partition function.\n6.  **Degeneracy (g):** Since the Hamiltonian lacks any term that distinguishes states (like a kinetic term), the result must depend on the total number of available single-particle states, denoted by $g$.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe partition function $Z$ for the system is given by the path integral:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\exp\\left[ -\\sum_{j=1}^g \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\psi_j^*(\\tau)(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\psi_j(\\tau) \\right]$\nwhere the fields $\\psi_j$ and the functional measure $\\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ depend on the particle statistics. The evaluation of this integral yields a result that depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\n*   **For Bosons:** $Z_B = (1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})^{-g}$ (requires $\\mu < 0$)\n*   **For Fermions:** $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^g$\n\nThese two results can be written in a compact form.\n\n<<<The partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. Let $g$ be the number of single-particle states.\nFor a system of bosons, the partition function is $Z_B = (1 - e^{-\\beta\\mu})^{-g}$, which requires $\\mu < 0$.\nFor a system of fermions, the partition function is $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{g}$.\nThese can be combined into the single expression $Z = (1 \\mp e^{\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp g}$, where the top sign (-) is for bosons and the bottom sign (+) is for fermions.>>>"
