The partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. Let $g$ be the number of single-particle states.
For a system of bosons, the partition function is $Z_B = (1 - e^{-\beta\mu})^{-g}$, which requires $\mu < 0$.
For a system of fermions, the partition function is $Z_F = (1 + e^{\beta\mu})^{g}$.
These can be combined into the single expression $Z = (1 \mp e^{\beta\mu})^{\mp g}$, where the top sign (-) is for bosons and the bottom sign (+) is for fermions.
