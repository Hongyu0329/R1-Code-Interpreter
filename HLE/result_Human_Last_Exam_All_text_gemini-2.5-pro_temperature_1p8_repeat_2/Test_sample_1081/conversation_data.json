    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question and key concepts\n\nThe question asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n*   **Reductive Group of type $E_8$**: This is a specific type of simple algebraic group, which is a fundamental object in Lie theory. $E_8$ is one of the exceptional Lie types.\n*   **Maximal Torus**: A maximal torus $T$ in $G$ is a subgroup that is isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$ (i.e., a torus) and is not strictly contained in any larger torus. All maximal tori in a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field are conjugate.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational**: This means the torus $T$ is defined as an algebraic variety over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We are interested in tori that are subgroups of $G$ and are themselves defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   **Number of tori**: In this context, \"the number of tori\" is a standard way of asking for the number of *conjugacy classes* of such tori under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The total number of such subgroups would be a complicated polynomial in $q$, whereas the number of conjugacy classes is a fixed integer, which fits the phrasing \"the exact number\".\n\n### Step 2: The classification of rational maximal tori\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem that classifies the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. Let $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$. The Frobenius map $F$ induces an automorphism on $W$, also denoted by $F$.\n\nThe theorem states that the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of **$F$-conjugacy classes** in the Weyl group $W$.\n\nAn $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ is the set $\\{ g^{-1} w F(g) \\mid g \\in W \\}$. The set of these classes is the first cohomology set $H^1(F, W)$.\n\n### Step 3: Properties of groups of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$\n\nWe need to understand how the general theory applies to our specific group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n\n1.  **The group is split**: A reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is called split if it contains a maximal torus that is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (i.e., isomorphic to $\\mathbb{G}_m^r$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$). For simple algebraic groups, the various forms over a field $k$ are related to the automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any group of type $E_8$ is of \"inner type\". A key theorem by Steinberg states that any group of inner type over a finite field is split. Therefore, our group $G$ is the split group of type $E_8$.\n\n2.  **The action of Frobenius on the Weyl group**: For a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the standard choice of Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. That is, $F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the problem\n\nWith the Frobenius acting trivially on $W$, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies significantly:\nThe $F$-conjugacy class of $w \\in W$ becomes $\\{ g^{-1} w F(g) \\mid g \\in W \\} = \\{ g^{-1} w g \\mid g \\in W \\}$.\nThis is precisely the ordinary conjugacy class of $w$ in the group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a question about a specific finite group: the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n*   The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite Coxeter group of rank 8.\n*   Its order is $|W(E_8)| = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 = 696,729,600$.\n*   The number of conjugacy classes of a finite group is a fundamental property, equal to the number of its irreducible complex representations.\n*   This number for $W(E_8)$ is a well-known result in the representation theory of finite groups. The character table for $W(E_8)$ was first computed by J.S. Frame in the 1950s.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is **112**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these steps, we find:\n1.  The number of rational maximal tori (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$.\n2.  For a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the group is split, and the Frobenius action on $W$ is trivial.\n3.  This means the number of rational maximal tori is the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n4.  The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is a known mathematical fact.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
