    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. According to the game's data, the base `lifeMax` for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode (for a single player) is **3,640 HP**.\n\n2.  **Understand Health Scaling in Multiplayer:**\n    In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for the increased number of players. This scaling is particularly aggressive in Expert and Master modes. The formula used for health scaling in Expert Mode is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`\n    This means for every player added to the game after the first one, the boss's base health is increased by an additional 35%.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an **infinite** number of players. If we analyze the formula from a purely mathematical perspective, as the \"Number of Players\" approaches infinity (∞), the total health would also approach infinity:\n    `lim (Players -> ∞) [3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (Players - 1))] = ∞`\n\n4.  **Consider the Constraints of the Game's Source Code:**\n    This is the most critical point. The question specifies that the answer must be according to the **source code**. In software, numbers are not infinite; they are stored in variables of specific data types, which have a maximum value. In Terraria's source code (which is written in C#), the `lifeMax` property for an NPC is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n\n5.  **Determine the Data Type Limit:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer has a specific range of values it can represent. The maximum possible value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`.\n    `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    While the mathematical scaling formula would result in an infinite value, the game engine itself cannot store a health value larger than the maximum for a 32-bit integer. The condition of \"infinite players\" ensures that the health calculation will far exceed this limit. When this happens, the value is effectively capped at the maximum storable number. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can actually have within the game is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mathematical vs. Programmatic Limit:** The key is distinguishing between a purely mathematical problem and one constrained by the reality of a computer program's architecture. The phrase \"according to the source code\" directs the analysis towards the programmatic limit.\n*   **Data Type:** Identifying the correct data type (`int`) for the `lifeMax` variable is essential.\n*   **Scaling Formula:** Using the correct scaling factor for Expert Mode (35% per additional player) is necessary for understanding why the health value grows so large.\n*   **Irrelevance of Base Health for the Final Number:** While we need the base health (3640) to understand that the health *does* scale up, the final limiting value is determined solely by the data type's maximum, not the base health itself, because the \"infinite players\" condition guarantees the cap will be reached.\n\nWith all steps considered, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
