    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given the state-space representation of a system with matrices:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe eigenvalues of the closed-loop system are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. Given the desired eigenvalues `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, we can construct the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)`.\n\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the identity `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2`, we get:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**3. Set up the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\nThe state feedback law is `u = Fx`. For a system `ẋ = Ax + Bu`, the closed-loop system is `ẋ = (A + BF)x`.\nThe dimensions are: `A` is 2x2, `B` is 2x2. The feedback matrix `F` must have dimensions compatible for multiplication, so `F` must be 2x2. Let:\n`F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n\n**Careful Point:** This system has 2 inputs, and we need to determine 4 elements in `F`. The characteristic polynomial will only provide 2 equations (by comparing coefficients). This means the problem is underdetermined, and there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common simplification is to set one of the rows of `F` to zero. Let's set the second row of `F` to zero.\n\nLet `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl`**\nNow, compute `A_cl = A + BF` with our simplified `F`.\n*   First, calculate `BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[1*f1 + 2*0, 1*f2 + 2*0], [1*f1 + 0*0, 1*f2 + 0*0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n*   Next, calculate `A_cl`:\n    `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**5. Find the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl)`.\n`det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ, 0], [0, λ]] - [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]])`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ + 1 - f1, -(1 + f2)], [-(1 + f1), λ - f2]])`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1)(λ - f2) - (-(1 + f2))(-(1 + f1))`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ^2 - f2λ + λ - f1λ - f2 + f1f2) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1f2)`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-f2 + f1f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1f2)`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2)`\n\n**6. Solve for the Gains by Comparing Coefficients**\nWe equate the coefficients of the actual polynomial with the desired polynomial (`λ^2 + 2λ + 2`).\n*   Comparing the `λ^1` coefficients:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`  =>  `-f1 - f2 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing the constant terms (`λ^0`):\n    `-1 - f1 - 2f2 = 2` =>  `-f1 - 2f2 = 3`  (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we solve this system of two linear equations. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(-f1 - 2f2) - (-f1 - f2) = 3 - 1`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into Equation 1:\n`-f1 - (-2) = 1`\n`-f1 + 2 = 1`\n`-f1 = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**7. State the Final Answer**\nWe found `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`. Using our simplified form for `F`, we have:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible solution for the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
