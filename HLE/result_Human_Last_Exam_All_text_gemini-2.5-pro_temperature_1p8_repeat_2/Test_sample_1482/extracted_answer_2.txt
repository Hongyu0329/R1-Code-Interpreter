The mathematical formulation for the upper bound (`μ_U`) of the membership function for a vertical cross-section of an IT3 MF, as a function of the primary input `x` and secondary input `u`, is given by: μ_U(x, u) = \exp\left(-\frac{(u - \mu_{U, \tilde{A}}(x))^2}{2\sigma^2}\right), where `μ_{U, \tilde{A}}(x)` represents the upper bound of the primary membership function for `x`, and `σ` is a constant standard deviation parameterizing the secondary uncertainty.
