    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the correspondence between irreps and partitions**\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$. For this problem, $n=25$. Our task is to count the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Hook-Length Formula for dimensions**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of boxes to the right of the box in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the box itself).\n\n**Step 3: Identify which partitions yield small dimensions**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of the hook lengths in the denominator is large. This generally happens for partitions that are \"far from the center,\" meaning partitions that are very long and thin (like $(n-k, k)$ for small $k$) or very tall and narrow (like $(k+1, 1^{n-k-1})$ for small $k$). These correspond to partitions where the first part, $\\lambda_1$, is large, or the number of parts, $\\lambda'_1$, is large.\n\nIt is a known property that if $\\lambda'$ is the conjugate partition of $\\lambda$ (obtained by transposing its Young diagram), then $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. We can therefore focus our search on partitions with a large first part, i.e., $\\lambda_1 > n/2 = 12.5$. For each such partition $\\lambda$ that we find, we also count its distinct conjugate $\\lambda'$. We will check for self-conjugate partitions at the end, which would be counted only once.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically search for qualifying partitions**\nWe search by systematically decreasing the size of the first part $\\lambda_1$ starting from $n=25$. For a given $\\lambda_1$, the rest of the partition, $\\mu = (\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\dots)$, must be a partition of $n-\\lambda_1$.\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 25$**: The only partition is $\\lambda=(25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation with $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, which has the same dimension $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n    *   Found: (25), (1^25). (2 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 24$**: The rest must be a partition of 1, so $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d_{(24,1)}=n-1=24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension.\n    *   Found: (24,1), (2,1^23). (2 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 23$**: The rest is a partition of 2. Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = 275$. Conjugate $(2^2,1^{21})$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = 276$. Conjugate $(3,1^{22})$. (2 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 22$**: The rest is a partition of 3. Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1). All yield dimensions < 500,000.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d=2000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4025$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d=2024$. (2 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 21$**: Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1). All 5 partitions yield dimensions < 500,000.\n    *   5 partitions + their 5 conjugates. (10 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 20$**: Partitions of 5 are (5), (4,1), (3,2), (3,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1). All 7 partitions yield dimensions < 500,000.\n    *   7 partitions + their 7 conjugates. (14 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 19$**: Partitions of 6. There are 11 partitions of 6. We test each one by forming $\\lambda=(19, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 6.\n    *   Dimensions for (19,6), (19,4,2), (19,4,1,1), (19,3,3), (19,3,2,1), (19,2,2,2), (19,2,2,1,1), (19,1^6) are all < 500,000.\n    *   Dimensions for (19,5,1), (19,3,1^3), (19,2,1^4) are > 500,000.\n    *   This gives 8 qualifying partitions + their 8 conjugates. (16 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 18$**: Partitions of 7. There are 15 partitions of 7.\n    *   Only (18,7) and (18,1^7) yield dimensions < 500,000. For instance, $d_{(18,7)}=303,600$ and $d_{(18,6,1)}$ is over 1.8 million.\n    *   This gives 2 qualifying partitions + their 2 conjugates. (4 irreps)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1 = 17$**: Partitions of 8. The smallest dimension here comes from $\\lambda=(17,8)$, which is $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875$. This is greater than 500,000. Any other partition with $\\lambda_1=17$ or smaller will result in an even larger dimension. So, we can stop our search here.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nWe sum the number of irreps found for each value of $\\lambda_1$. In all cases checked, the partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ were distinct, so there are no self-conjugate partitions among our candidates.\n\n*   From $\\lambda_1=25$: 2 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=24$: 2 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=23$: 4 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=22$: 6 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=21$: 10 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=20$: 14 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=19$: 16 irreps\n*   From $\\lambda_1=18$: 4 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 16 + 4 = 58."
