    "This is an excellent competitive programming problem that tests not only algorithmic thinking but also an understanding of how C handles memory and I/O. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Deconstruction**\n    *   **Input:** Two strings, `s1` and `s2`, of the same length (1 to 100 characters).\n    *   **Task:** Compare `s1` and `s2` lexicographically.\n    *   **Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive (e.g., 'a' is equivalent to 'A').\n    *   **Output:** \"-1\" if `s1` < `s2`, \"1\" if `s1` > `s2`, and \"0\" if `s1` = `s2`.\n    *   **Constraint:** The goal is to write the *most memory-efficient* C program and find the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by its variables.\n\n2.  **Algorithmic Approach**\n    The standard lexicographical comparison involves iterating through both strings from left to right and comparing characters at each corresponding position. The first position where the characters differ determines the result. Since the comparison must be case-insensitive, we must convert characters to a common case (either upper or lower) before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this.\n\n3.  **Memory Usage Analysis & Optimization**\n\n    *   **Standard (Naive) Approach:** The most straightforward way is to read both strings into two separate character arrays.\n        *   `char s1[101];` (100 chars + 1 null terminator) -> 101 bytes\n        *   `char s2[101];` (100 chars + 1 null terminator) -> 101 bytes\n        *   An integer loop counter `int i;` -> 4 bytes (on typical systems)\n        *   Total memory: 101 + 101 + 4 = **206 bytes**.\n\n    *   **Optimized Approach:** We need to find a way to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. The standard input (`stdin`) is a forward-only stream. This means once we read past a character, we cannot go back. Therefore, to compare the `i`-th character of `s1` with the `i`-th character of `s2`, we must have at least one of them stored in memory to refer back to. The most memory-efficient strategy is:\n        1.  Read the first string (`s1`) into a buffer. This is unavoidable.\n        2.  Read the second string (`s2`) one character at a time from the input stream and immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the `s1` buffer. This avoids needing a buffer for `s2`.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Variable Selection for the Optimized Approach**\n\n    *   **Buffer for String 1:** We need a character array to store the first string. Its maximum length is 100, and C strings need a `\\0` null terminator.\n        *   Variable: `char s1[101];`\n        *   Memory: **101 bytes** (`sizeof(char)` is 1).\n\n    *   **Input Handling:** When we read the first string using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`, it stops at the first whitespace character, which is the newline (`\\n`) at the end of the first line. This newline remains in the input buffer. Before reading the second string character-by-character, we must consume this leftover newline, for example with `getchar();`.\n\n    *   **Reading String 2:** We can use `getchar()` in a loop to read the second string one character at a time. A crucial point is that `getchar()` returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to allow it to return all possible character values as well as a special value `EOF` (End Of File) to signal the end of the input or an error.\n        *   Variable: `int c2;`\n        *   Memory: **4 bytes** (`sizeof(int)` on most competitive programming platforms).\n\n    *   **Loop Index:** We need an index to traverse our `s1` buffer. The index will range from 0 to 99. A standard `int` (4 bytes) works, but we can do better. Since the maximum value is 99, a single-byte unsigned integer type is sufficient.\n        *   Variable: `unsigned char i;` (range 0 to 255)\n        *   Memory: **1 byte**.\n\n5.  **Final Memory Calculation**\n    By summing the memory required for the variables in our optimized approach, we get the total memory `m`.\n\n    *   Buffer `s1`: 101 bytes\n    *   Index `i`: 1 byte\n    *   Character holder `c2`: 4 bytes\n\n    Total memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 4 = **106 bytes**.\n\nThis is the minimum possible memory for variables to solve this problem correctly and robustly in C.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{106}$.\n<<<106>>>"
