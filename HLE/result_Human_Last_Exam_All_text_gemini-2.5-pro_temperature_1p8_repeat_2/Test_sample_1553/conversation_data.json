    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n    *   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n    *   **Task:** Find the name of the character the main character marries.\n\n2.  **Identify the main character of the novel:** The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century human cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the far future.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main character's significant relationships:** Upon his revival, Adam Zamoyski is assigned a guide and tutor to help him acclimate to the vastly different future civilization. This guide is an advanced post-human being, an \"Inkluzja\" (Inclusion).\n\n4.  **Identify the name of this key character:** The Inkluzja assigned to Adam is named Angelika. She is one of the most important characters in the book and the primary figure with whom Adam forms a deep, personal bond.\n\n5.  **Examine the concept of \"marriage\" in the context of the novel:** The relationship between Adam, a baseline human (\"stahs\"), and Angelika, a distributed consciousness, evolves from a mentorship to a profound romantic and symbiotic bond. The society of the future has different social contracts and ways of forming unions.\n\n6.  **Determine the specific event corresponding to \"marriage\":** Towards the climax of the story, Adam and Angelika decide to formalize their union. This is not a traditional wedding but a far more complex technological and existential event. Adam undergoes a process that permanently merges his existence with Angelika's. This union allows them to be together permanently and elevates Adam beyond his baseline human status. This event is the narrative's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n7.  **Conclude the answer:** Based on the plot, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms this ultimate union with is Angelika.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The nature of the \"marriage\":** It's crucial to understand that the term \"marries\" is an interpretation of a science-fiction concept. The union is a symbiotic merger, not a traditional human ceremony. However, in the context of the story's emotional and narrative arc, it fulfills the role of a marriage.\n*   **Character identification:** Adam Zamoyski is unequivocally the main character. Angelika is his primary partner and guide throughout the narrative. There are no other characters he marries or forms a similar union with.\n*   **Correct spelling:** The character's name is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
