\(\rho(z) = \frac{m_A N_A + m_B N_B}{V} + \frac{g}{(k_B T) V} (N_A m_A^2 + N_B m_B^2) \left(\frac{H}{2} - z\right)\)
where:
*   \(z\) is the height from the bottom of the container (from 0 to H).
*   \(m_A, m_B\) are the masses of the individual gas particles.
*   \(N_A, N_B\) are the total numbers of particles for each gas.
*   \(V = A \times H\) is the total volume of the container.
*   \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration.
*   \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant.
*   \(T\) is the temperature.
*   \(H\) is the total height of the container.
