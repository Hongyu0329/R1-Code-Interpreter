    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Second Great War\nThe Second Great War refers to the overarching conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It is distinct from the first Great War (covered in the original *StarCraft* and *Brood War*). The main events are the campaigns of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Start and End Points in the Official Timeline\nAccording to the official StarCraft lore and timelines:\n*   **Start Year:** The war began in the year **2504** with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, which kicks off the *Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n*   **End Year:** The war concluded in the year **2506** with the final defeat of the dark god Amon by the unified Protoss, Terran, and Zerg forces in the Void. This is depicted in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue, \"Into the Void.\"\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Duration\nThe war was active during three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506. To calculate the exact duration, we would need the specific start and end dates (month and day), which are not provided in the lore.\n\nLet's analyze the duration based on the years:\n*   The entire year of **2505** is within the war's timespan. This is a baseline of 1 full year.\n*   The war also took place for a portion of the year **2504**.\n*   The war also took place for a portion of the year **2506**.\n\nThe total duration can be expressed as: `(Portion of 2504) + (All of 2505) + (Portion of 2506)`.\nMathematically, this duration will be somewhere between 1 year and 3 years. For example, if the war started on December 30th, 2504, and ended on January 2nd, 2506, the duration would be 1 year and 3 days.\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points and Refine the Calculation\n*   **The \"Round Up\" Rule:** The question explicitly asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. This means that if the duration is anything greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2 years and 1 day), the answer must be 3. If the duration is exactly 2.0 years or less, it would be 2.\n*   **Narrative Scope:** The events within the three campaigns are massive in scale. They involve traveling between numerous star systems, raising and commanding huge armies, and conducting planetary campaigns that last for significant periods. The time between campaigns (Kerrigan's transformation, Artanis gathering the Golden Armada) also adds to the total duration.\n*   **Plausible Duration:** Given the vast scope of events, it is narratively improbable that the entire war could be compressed into 2 full years or less. For the duration to be â‰¤ 2 years, the conflict would have to end on an earlier calendar day in 2506 than it started in 2504 (e.g., start in September 2504 and end in March 2506). The sheer amount of activity across the trilogy makes this unlikely. It is far more plausible that the events took more than two full years to transpire.\n*   **Conclusion on Duration:** The most logical conclusion is that the duration of the Second Great War is slightly over 2 years.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Calculation\nBased on the analysis, the duration is a value greater than 2 years. Let's call this value `2.X` years.\nAccording to the question's rule to round up:\n`ceil(2.X years) = 3 years`\n\nTherefore, the Second Great War lasted for 3 years when rounded up.\n\n<<<3>>>"
