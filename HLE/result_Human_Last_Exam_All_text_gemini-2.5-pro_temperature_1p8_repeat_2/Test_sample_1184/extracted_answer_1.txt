**1. Hotspots for Interaction with Alpha-1 Subunit (Direct Binding):**

These residues are located within the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit and are critical for forming the high-affinity binding interface.

*   **Key Hydrophobic Groove Residues:**
    *   **Leucine 366 (L366)**
    *   **Valine 370 (V370)**
    *   **Isoleucine 431 (I431)**
    *   **Isoleucine 451 (I451)**
*   **Key Electrostatic/Polar Residues:**
    *   **Aspartate 363 (D363)**
    *   **Glutamate 398 (E398)**

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**

These residues/regions exert an allosteric effect on the alpha-1 subunit after binding. Their role is to fine-tune the channel's opening and closing kinetics, particularly inactivation. The binding residues listed above are a prerequisite for this function.

*   **Hook Region Residues:** This region links the N-terminus to the conserved core and interacts with the alpha-1 subunit's I-II linker to modulate inactivation.
    *   **Aspartate 260 (D260)**
    *   **Glutamate 261 (E261)**
*   **N-terminal Region:** The variable N-terminus as a whole (residues 1-229 for beta-1b) contributes to the specific modulatory signature of the isoform. While it is difficult to pinpoint single "hotspot" residues, its presence and composition are critical for the full modulatory effect on Cav2.3 gating.
