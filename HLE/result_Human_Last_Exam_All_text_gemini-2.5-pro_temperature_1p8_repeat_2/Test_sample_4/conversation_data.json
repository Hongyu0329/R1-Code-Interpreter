    "An elegant step-by-step derivation to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and non-zero commutation relations:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n    We observe that $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is an abelian ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$. This means $[\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{a}] = 0$. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be written as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$, where $\\mathbb{R}e_1$ is the 1-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by $e_1$. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $y \\mapsto [e_1, y]$.\n\n2.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\n    For a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$ with $\\mathfrak{a}$ abelian, the Chevalley-Eilenberg differential can be decomposed, which leads to a formula for the Betti numbers $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. Let $W = \\mathfrak{a}^*$ be the dual space of $\\mathfrak{a}$, and let $\\delta: W \\to W$ be the dual of the derivation defining the action of $\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathbb{R}e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$. This derivation extends to the exterior algebra $\\wedge^* W$. Let $k_n = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta|_{\\wedge^n W}))$. The Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are given by:\n    $b_n(\\mathfrak{g}) = k_n + k_{n-1}$ (for $n \\ge 1$) and $b_0(\\mathfrak{g}) = k_0 = 1$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^6 b_n x^n$, can then be expressed in terms of the polynomial of invariants $P_{inv}(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^5 k_n x^n$ as:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{inv}(x) + x P_{inv}(x) = (1+x)P_{inv}(x)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the action of the derivation.**\n    The action of $ad_{e_1}$ on the basis of $\\mathfrak{a}$ is:\n    $ad_{e_1}(e_2) = e_3$, $ad_{e_1}(e_3) = e_4$, $ad_{e_1}(e_4) = 0$.\n    $ad_{e_1}(e_5) = e_6$, $ad_{e_1}(e_6) = 0$.\n    The action of the dual map $\\delta = (ad_{e_1})^*$ on the dual basis $W = \\text{span}\\{e_2^*, \\ldots, e_6^*\\}$ is:\n    $\\delta(e_3^*) = -e_2^*$, $\\delta(e_4^*) = -e_3^*$, $\\delta(e_2^*) = 0$.\n    $\\delta(e_6^*) = -e_5^*$, $\\delta(e_5^*) = 0$.\n    The operator $\\delta$ acting on $W$ decomposes $W$ into two Jordan blocks. Let's choose a new basis to simplify $\\delta$:\n    -   A 3-dimensional Jordan block $J_3 = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ where $\\delta(v_1)=v_2, \\delta(v_2)=v_3, \\delta(v_3)=0$. (e.g., $v_1=-e_4^*, v_2=e_3^*, v_3=-e_2^*$).\n    -   A 2-dimensional Jordan block $J_2 = \\text{span}\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ where $\\delta(u_1)=u_2, \\delta(u_2)=0$. (e.g., $u_1=-e_6^*, u_2=e_5^*$).\n    So, $W \\cong J_3 \\oplus J_2$ as $\\delta$-modules.\n\n4.  **Compute the polynomial of invariants $P_{inv}(x)$.**\n    We need to compute $k_n = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta|_{\\wedge^n W}))$. The space of $\\delta$-invariants in $\\wedge^*W = \\wedge^*(J_3 \\oplus J_2)$ is the tensor product of the spaces of invariants in $\\wedge^*J_3$ and $\\wedge^*J_2$. Therefore, the polynomial of invariants for $W$ is the product of the polynomials for $J_3$ and $J_2$:\n    $P_{inv}(x) = I(J_3, x) \\cdot I(J_2, x)$.\n    -   For $J_2 = \\text{span}\\{u_1, u_2\\}$:\n        $k_0(J_2) = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta|_{\\wedge^0 J_2})) = 1$ (the element 1).\n        $k_1(J_2) = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta|_{\\wedge^1 J_2})) = 1$ (the element $u_2$).\n        $k_2(J_2) = \\dim(\\ker(\\delta|_{\\wedge^2 J_2})) = 1$ (the element $u_1 \\wedge u_2$).\n        So, $I(J_2, x) = 1 + x + x^2$.\n    -   For $J_3 = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$:\n        $k_0(J_3) = 1$ (the element 1).\n        $k_1(J_3) = 1$ (the element $v_3$).\n        $k_2(J_3) = 1$ (the element $v_2 \\wedge v_3$).\n        $k_3(J_3) = 1$ (the element $v_1 \\wedge v_2 \\wedge v_3$).\n        So, $I(J_3, x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$.\n    Now we multiply them:\n    $P_{inv}(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)(1 + x + x^2)$\n    $P_{inv}(x) = (1+x+x^2) + (x+x^2+x^3) + (x^2+x^3+x^4) + (x^3+x^4+x^5)$\n    $P_{inv}(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\n5.  **Compute the final Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$.**\n    Using the formula from Step 2:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) P_{inv}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 3x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n6.  **Final verification.**\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, so it is unimodular. For a 6-dimensional unimodular Lie algebra, Poincaré duality must hold, which means $b_k = b_{6-k}$. Our Betti numbers are $(b_0, ..., b_6) = (1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 1)$, which satisfies this symmetry. This gives us confidence in the result.\n\nFinal Answer: The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
