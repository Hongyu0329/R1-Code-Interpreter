    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré is a bend of the body from the waist in any direction. A cambré derrière specifically refers to a bend backwards. The movement is initiated from the upper spine, and the goal is to create a graceful arc with the upper body while maintaining stability in the lower body.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova method's approach to cambré derrière**\nThe Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its precise, logical, and codified system. It prioritizes strength, clean lines, and core stability.\n*   **Foundation:** The primary focus is on maintaining a stable and square pelvis.\n*   **Hip Placement:** To counterbalance the backward bend of the torso, the dancer actively pushes the hips slightly *forward*. This creates a stable base, engages the core, protects the lower back from compression, and ensures the bend originates correctly from the upper and middle back. The line is a continuous, controlled curve.\n*   **Backbend:** The bend is deep but controlled, emphasizing spinal articulation and strength.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back to complete the arc.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine method's approach to cambré derrière**\nThe Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, is a neoclassical style that emphasizes speed, musicality, and elongated, often extreme lines. It frequently modifies classical technique for greater dynamism and visual impact.\n*   **Foundation:** The focus shifts from a purely stable pelvis to creating a more dynamic and angular line.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the key point of divergence. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer often pushes the hip of the standing leg *back*. This is sometimes referred to as \"breaking\" at the hip or \"sitting into\" the hip. This action allows for a visually deeper and quicker bend.\n*   **Line:** This creates a different aesthetic line—more of an angle at the hip rather than the continuous curve seen in Vaganova. It produces a distinct, off-balance look that is characteristic of the style.\n*   **Speed:** The technique of breaking at the hip facilitates the speed often required in Balanchine's fast-paced choreography.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be stylistic nuances in how the arms (port de bras) are presented in each method, the fundamental mechanical difference of the cambré itself is not found in the arm placement.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and well-documented difference. Vaganova pushes hips forward for stability. Balanchine pushes the standing hip back for dynamism and a deeper line. This is a core technical distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's style is generally faster, and the hip placement allows for a quicker cambré. However, speed is a quality of performance, not the fundamental technical difference itself. A Vaganova-trained dancer can also perform a fast cambré. The *cause* of the potential for greater speed is the hip placement.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine hip placement can *create the illusion* of or *facilitate* a deeper backbend. However, the degree of the bend is ultimately limited by the individual dancer's flexibility. The primary difference is *how* the bend is achieved mechanically (the hip action), not just the final angle of the spine.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the back. There is no fundamental disagreement between the styles on this principle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most defining technical difference between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the opposition of the hips. Vaganova keeps the hips forward and square, while Balanchine allows the hip to go back. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
