The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a differential expression analysis comparing the "CAR only" group against the "CAR-IL15" group. In this comparison, contaminating genes specific to the cancer cells will appear as highly upregulated with a large, positive log2 fold change (L2FC). The strategy is to then filter out these specific genes by applying a stringent combined threshold. Using a command-line tool like `awk` on the differential expression results table, you would remove all genes that simultaneously meet the criteria of having a `log2FoldChange > 8` and an `adjusted p-value < 0.05`. This removes genes that are consistently and massively overexpressed in the contaminated group while preserving the header and all other genes for downstream analysis.
