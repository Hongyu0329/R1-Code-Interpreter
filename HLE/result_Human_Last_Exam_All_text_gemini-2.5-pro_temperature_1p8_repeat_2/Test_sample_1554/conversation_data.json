    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** The philosopher is known for decomposing the notion of a \"hallmark\" (or more broadly, a \"sign\") into two distinct categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:**\n    *   The question asks about a specific analysis of how something can be a \"hallmark\" or \"sign\" of something else. The analysis breaks this down into two types:\n    *   **Symptom (Polish: *oznaka*):** This refers to a natural sign. There is a causal or natural correlation between the symptom and the thing it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The sign is caused by the phenomenon it indicates.\n    *   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*):** This refers to a conventional or artificial sign. The relationship between the signal and what it signifies is based on an established rule, convention, or intention to communicate. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a person waving their hand can be a signal for \"hello\". The sign is not caused by the phenomenon but is used to intentionally communicate or regulate behavior.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Philosopher:**\n    *   We need to find which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is famous for making this exact distinction.\n    *   Reviewing the major works of the school's members, this specific semiotic (theory of signs) distinction is a hallmark of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was a logician and philosopher of language who focused on clear, precise definitions and analyses of concepts. In his work on language and meaning (e.g., in his influential essay \"Language and Meaning\" and his university textbook \"Propedeutics to Philosophy\"), he explicitly introduces and analyzes the distinction between signs that are symptoms and signs that are signals as a fundamental part of understanding communication and meaning. This was central to his analysis of how language works, contrasting words used as conventional signals with natural signs.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposed the notion of a sign or hallmark into the categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
