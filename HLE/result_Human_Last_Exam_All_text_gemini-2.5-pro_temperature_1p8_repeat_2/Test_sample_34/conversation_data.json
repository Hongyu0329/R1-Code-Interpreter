    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game. \"Rake-free\" is an important detail. In a standard game with rake, the profitability of marginal hands decreases. In a rake-free environment, any hand that has a positive Expected Value (EV), no matter how small, becomes a correct open-raise. This encourages opening a wider range of hands.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which provides a significant informational advantage. This positional power is the primary reason why you should play the widest range of hands from the button.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size. The question asks what hand is on the cusp of profitability for this action.\n    *   **Question:** We need to find the *worst* suited Jack (JXs) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise. \"Worst\" refers to the hand with the lowest EV that isn't a fold.\n\n2.  **Ranking Suited Jack Hands:**\n    Suited hands derive their value from their ability to make flushes, their high-card strength, and their ability to make straights (connectivity). We can rank suited Jacks from best to worst based on these factors:\n    *   **Top Tier (High Card Strength):** AJs, KJs, QJs. These are premium hands.\n    *   **Middle Tier (Strong Connectivity):** JTs, J9s, J8s. These hands have excellent straight and flush potential.\n    *   **Bottom Tier (Weak Kickers / Poor Connectivity):** J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. As the kicker gets lower, the hand gets weaker for several reasons.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Bottom Tier Hands:**\n    Let's compare the weakest suited Jacks to determine which is the absolute worst.\n    *   **Domination:** A hand like J2s is dominated by every other Jack (J3s-AJs). If a Jack comes on the flop, you are very likely to be out-kicked if you face resistance.\n    *   **Straight Potential:** The connectivity, or ability to make a straight, improves as the two cards get closer together.\n        *   **J2s:** Has almost no straight potential involving both cards.\n        *   **J3s:** Marginally better. Can use the 3 to connect with A-2-4-5.\n        *   **J4s:** Can connect with A-2-3-5.\n        *   **J5s:** The first hand in this group that has significantly better straight potential, as it can flop an open-ended straight draw (e.g., on a 6-7-8 board).\n    *   **Kicker Strength:** A higher kicker (e.g., a 5 vs. a 2) can occasionally win a pot by making a better pair than your opponent's low cards.\n\n4.  **Consulting Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Strategy:**\n    Modern poker strategy is based on GTO solvers, which calculate the optimal way to play in a given scenario. For a 100BB rake-free cash game, GTO button opening ranges are extremely wide (often 45-50% of hands).\n    *   Because of the immense power of position and the fact that the hand is suited (giving it flush potential), even the weakest suited Jacks are included in a standard GTO button opening range.\n    *   The strategy includes raising with AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n    *   Since all of these hands are considered profitable opens, the \"worst\" one is simply the one with the lowest rank and lowest EV.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the suited Jacks are ranked in descending order of strength. The hand J2s is at the bottom of this list due to having the weakest kicker, the highest chance of being dominated, and the worst straight potential. While it is still a profitable open-raise from the button in a rake-free game due to the power of position and flush potential, it is objectively the worst among all suited Jacks that you should be opening.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
