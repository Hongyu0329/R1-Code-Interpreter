    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a relationship between consecutive terms**\nLet's examine the relationship between each number and the one before it. We can try simple arithmetic operations.\n*   11 / 2 = 5.5\n*   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n*   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n*   119 / 51 ≈ 2.33\n\nThe ratio between consecutive terms is consistently around 2. This suggests a pattern of the form: `Next Term = 2 * Previous Term + Some Number`. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n**Step 3: Define the pattern more precisely**\nLet's denote the terms of the sequence as `a_n`.\n`a_1 = 2`\n`a_2 = 11`\n`a_3 = 23`\n`a_4 = 51`\n`a_5 = 119`\n\nLet's check the formula `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`, where `c_n` is a number that might change with each step.\n\n*   For n=1: `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + c_1` => `11 = 2 * 2 + c_1` => `11 = 4 + c_1` => `c_1 = 7`.\n*   For n=2: `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + c_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + c_2` => `23 = 22 + c_2` => `c_2 = 1`.\n*   For n=3: `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + c_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + c_3` => `51 = 46 + c_3` => `c_3 = 5`.\n*   For n=4: `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + c_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + c_4` => `119 = 102 + c_4` => `c_4 = 17`.\n\nThe sequence of numbers being added (`c_n`) is 7, 1, 5, 17, ...\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the secondary sequence**\nIn number sequence problems, it's common for the first term to be a \"seed\" or starting point, with the main pattern starting from the second term. Let's ignore the first added number (`c_1 = 7`) and analyze the pattern of the subsequent added numbers: `1, 5, 17, ...`. Let's call this secondary sequence `b_n`.\n`b_1 = 1`\n`b_2 = 5`\n`b_3 = 17`\n\nWe need to find the next term, `b_4`. Let's look for a pattern within the `b_n` sequence.\n*   How to get from 1 to 5? `5 = 1 * 3 + 2`.\n*   How to get from 5 to 17? `17 = 5 * 3 + 2`.\n\nA clear pattern emerges: `b_{n+1} = 3 * b_n + 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the next term in the secondary sequence**\nUsing the pattern we found, we can calculate `b_4`:\n`b_4 = 3 * b_3 + 2`\n`b_4 = 3 * 17 + 2`\n`b_4 = 51 + 2`\n`b_4 = 53`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the next term in the main sequence**\nNow we can find the number that should be in the parentheses. This will be `a_6`.\n`a_6 = 2 * a_5 + b_4`\n`a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n`a_6 = 238 + 53`\n`a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Summary of the pattern:**\nThe sequence `a_n` is defined by `a_1 = 2` and for `n ≥ 2`, `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + b_{n-1}`, where the secondary sequence `b_n` is defined by `b_1 = 1` and `b_{k+1} = 3 * b_k + 2`.\n\n*   `a_2 = 11` (given)\n*   `a_3 = 2*a_2 + b_1 = 2*11 + 1 = 23`\n*   `a_4 = 2*a_3 + b_2 = 2*23 + 5 = 51`\n*   `a_5 = 2*a_4 + b_3 = 2*51 + 17 = 119`\n*   `a_6 = 2*a_5 + b_4 = 2*119 + 53 = 291`\n\nThe analysis is consistent and leads to a definitive answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
