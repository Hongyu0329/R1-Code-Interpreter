    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very *first* piece of legislation (statute) in the modern State of Israel that explicitly used the legal concept of \"good faith\". The answer should be the name of the statute only, without the definite article \"the\" or its year of enactment.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Knowledge:** The concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev* - תום לב) is a foundational principle of modern Israeli private law. Many lawyers and law students would immediately point to the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This statute is indeed famous for establishing good faith as a broad, overarching duty, both in pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and in the performance of contractual obligations (Section 39). However, the question asks for the *first* introduction of the concept, not necessarily the most famous or comprehensive one. This requires a chronological investigation of Israeli legislation.\n\n3.  **Historical Context:** Before the 1960s and 1970s, Israeli law was a composite of Ottoman law and English common law (from the British Mandate period). Neither system contained a general, codified principle of \"good faith\" in the way modern civil law systems do. The legislative reforms of the 1960s and 70s were designed to create a unique, modern Israeli civil law, often drawing inspiration from Continental European legal systems where \"good faith\" is a central tenet.\n\n4.  **Chronological Examination of Key Statutes:** We must examine significant private law statutes enacted *before* the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973.\n\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" or \"faithfulness\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While related to good faith, *ne'emanut* is a more specific fiduciary duty and is not the same as the general legal concept of *tom lev*. Therefore, this is not the first statute to introduce the specific concept of \"good faith.\"\n\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law governs contracts for the sale of goods. A review of its text shows that it did not, upon its enactment, contain a general or specific provision explicitly using the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a pivotal statute. **Section 9** of the Land Law deals with conflicting transactions, where a person agrees to sell land to one party and then enters into a conflicting transaction with a second party. The section stipulates that the first party's right prevails, *unless* the second party completed the transaction in \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) and for consideration, and the transaction was registered while the second party was still in \"good faith.\" This is a clear, explicit, and statutorily significant use of the term *tom lev*. Since it was enacted in 1969, it predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n\n    *   **Movable Property Law, 1971:** This law also explicitly uses the concept. **Section 34**, which establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat ha-shuk*), states that a buyer acquires good title to an asset even from a non-owner, provided the buyer acted in \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). However, this law was enacted in 1971, two years *after* the Land Law.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** By comparing the enactment dates, it becomes clear that while the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, generalized the principle, it was not the first to introduce it into the statutory books of the modern State of Israel. The Land Law of 1969 explicitly uses the term *tom lev* in a crucial section, making it the first statute to do so. The Movable Property Law of 1971 followed, and then the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 expanded the concept dramatically.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specific Terminology:** The analysis must focus on the explicit introduction of the concept of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*), distinguishing it from related but distinct legal duties like \"faithfulness\" (*ne'emanut*).\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The question is about the \"first\" statute. Therefore, the dates of enactment (Land Law, 1969; Movable Property Law, 1971; Contracts Law, 1973) are the most critical factor in determining the correct answer.\n*   **\"Introduction\" vs. \"Generalization\":** It is important not to confuse the first statutory *mention* or *application* of a concept with the statute that made the concept a general, overarching principle of the entire legal field. The Land Law introduced it in a specific context; the Contracts Law later generalized it.\n*   **Adherence to Formatting Rules:** The final answer must not include the year of the statute or the article \"the\", as per the user's instructions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step chronological analysis of Israeli legislation, the first statute to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Land Law of 1969.\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
