    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of how the bare Green's function ($G_0$) in the Feynman path integral formalism depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) and the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism (using the imaginary-time or Matsubara formalism, which is common), the Green's function is a correlation function calculated as a functional average weighted by the action. The **bare** Green's function, $G_0$, describes a system of **non-interacting** particles.\n\nFor a system of fermions described by Grassmann fields $\\psi^*(x, \\tau)$ and $\\psi(x, \\tau)$, the bare Green's function is defined as:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau [\\psi(x, \\tau) \\psi^*(x', \\tau')] \\rangle_0$\n\nThe average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is performed using the path integral with the non-interacting action, $S_0$:\n$\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\dots e^{-S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ is given by:\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle, non-interacting Hamiltonian and we have set $\\hbar=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Change to the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nThe key to revealing the dependence on the energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is to switch from the position basis $(x)$ to the basis that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the single-particle eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$\\hat{H}_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\n\nWe can expand the fields $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(x, \\tau) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) c_k(\\tau)$\n$\\psi^*(x, \\tau) = \\sum_k \\phi_k^*(x) c_k^*(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | \\phi_k \\rangle$ are the spatial wavefunctions, and $c_k(\\tau), c_k^*(\\tau)$ are new Grassmann fields corresponding to the eigenmode $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Decouple the Action and Green's Function**\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int d^d x \\, \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_{k'}(x) = \\delta_{kk'}$), the action separates into a sum over independent modes $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, c_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\tau)$\n\nSimilarly, the Green's function becomes:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = -\\sum_{k,k'} \\phi_k(x) \\phi_{k'}^*(x') \\langle T_\\tau [c_k(\\tau) c_{k'}^*(\\tau')] \\rangle_0$\nSince the action is completely decoupled, the average is zero unless $k=k'$. This simplifies the expression to:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) \\phi_k^*(x') \\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(\\tau - \\tau')$\nwhere $\\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(\\tau - \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau [c_k(\\tau) c_k^*(\\tau')] \\rangle_0$ is the bare Green's function for the single mode $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe calculation is simplest in frequency space. We perform a Fourier series expansion (Matsubara transform) from imaginary time $\\tau$ to discrete imaginary frequencies $i\\omega_n$. For fermions, these are $i\\omega_n = i(2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n$\\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_n \\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(i\\omega_n) e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$\n\nIn frequency space, the derivative operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$. The action for each mode $k$ is now a simple algebraic form:\n$S_0 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_k \\sum_n c_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k) c_{k,n}$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral to Find the Final Form**\n\nThe Green's function $\\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(i\\omega_n)$ is the inverse of the term in the action's exponent. The result of the Gaussian Grassmann path integral gives:\n$\\mathcal{G}_{0,k}(i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nPlugging this back into the expression for the full Green's function in frequency space gives the Lehmann (or spectral) representation for the *bare* Green's function:\n$G_0(x, x'; i\\omega_n) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(x) \\phi_k^*(x')}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which corresponds to a non-interacting system ($S_0$). The full Green's function ($G$) for an interacting system has a more complex structure where the poles are shifted to the quasi-particle energies, not the bare energies $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Basis Choice**: The dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is made explicit by working in the energy eigenbasis of the non-interacting Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$.\n3.  **Frequency Domain**: The relationship is most clearly and simply expressed in the frequency domain (Matsubara frequencies $i\\omega_n$ or, by analytic continuation, real frequencies $\\omega$).\n4.  **Poles of the Green's Function**: A crucial physical insight from this result is that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane (after setting $E = i\\omega_n$) are located precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $E = \\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis directly leads to the functional form. The Green's function $G_0$ is constructed as a sum over all single-particle eigenstates. Each term in the sum contains the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ for that state in the denominator. The functional dependence is that of a sum of simple poles, where the location of each pole is determined by an energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nIn summary, the bare Green's function in the energy-frequency representation has an inverse dependence on the term $(i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n<<<In the frequency domain, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is a sum over all single-particle states $k$. For each state, its contribution is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency variable and the state's single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, in the eigenstate-frequency representation, the dependence is given by the expression:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\nIn real space, this translates to the spectral representation:\n$G_0(x, x'; i\\omega_n) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(x) \\phi_k^*(x')}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\nThe key functional dependence is that the poles of the bare Green's function are located at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
