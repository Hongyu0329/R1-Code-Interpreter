The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst comprising **Zirconium (Zr)** as the Group IV metal, supported on **partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO2)**. The catalyst is prepared using a simple organometallic precursor that lacks persistent spectator ligands, such as **zirconium tetrakis(neopentyl) [Zr(CH2C(CH3)3)4]**. The silica support is essential for creating and stabilizing the isolated active sites. This system functions as a polymerization catalyst from its grafted alkyl form under mild conditions, and as an efficient polyolefin hydrogenolysis catalyst after in-situ conversion to a zirconium hydride under high temperature and hydrogen pressure.
