    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication involving a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the HSS Matrix Structure\n\nA Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is a data-sparse representation of a dense matrix. Its structure is defined by a recursive partitioning of the matrix indices, which can be visualized as a binary tree. The key idea is that specific off-diagonal blocks of the matrix are of low rank and can be stored in a compressed format using generator matrices.\n\nThe submatrices that are stored and accessed for HSS operations are:\n1.  **Diagonal Blocks (`D_i`):** For the blocks on the main diagonal at the lowest level of the hierarchy (the leaves of the tree), the matrices are stored explicitly, typically as dense matrices.\n2.  **Generator Matrices (`U_i`, `V_i`):** For all the off-diagonal blocks created by the partitioning, their low-rank property is exploited. An off-diagonal block `A_{rc}` corresponding to row indices `r` and column indices `c` is approximated as `A_{rc} ≈ U_r G_{rc} V_c^T`. In a common HSS representation, a set of basis matrices (`U_i` and `V_i`) is stored for each node `i` in the tree (except the root), which can be used to generate any required off-diagonal block.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of these constituent submatrices (`D_i`, `U_i`, `V_i`) for a given tree structure.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Tree Structure for Depth 4\n\nThe problem specifies a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4.\n*   A tree of depth `d` has `d+1` levels, which we can index from 0 (the root) to `d` (the leaves).\n*   For this problem, `d=4`, so the levels are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n*   The number of nodes at any level `k` in a full binary tree is `2^k`.\n\nLet's list the number of nodes at each level:\n*   Level 0 (root): `2^0 = 1` node\n*   Level 1: `2^1 = 2` nodes\n*   Level 2: `2^2 = 4` nodes\n*   Level 3: `2^3 = 8` nodes\n*   Level 4 (leaves): `2^4 = 16` nodes\n\n### Step 3: Count the Diagonal Leaf Blocks (`D_i`)\n\nThe diagonal blocks are stored only for the leaf nodes of the tree. The leaves are at the deepest level, which is level 4.\n*   Number of leaf nodes = Number of nodes at level 4.\n*   Number of leaf nodes = `2^4 = 16`.\n*   Each leaf node `i` has one corresponding diagonal submatrix `D_i`.\n*   **Number of diagonal submatrices = 16.**\n\n### Step 4: Count the Generator Matrices (`U_i`, `V_i`)\n\nGenerator matrices are needed to represent the off-diagonal blocks. In a standard HSS data structure, a pair of generator matrices, `U_i` and `V_i`, is associated with each node `i` of the tree, except for the root node.\n*   First, we need to count the total number of non-root nodes in the tree.\n*   Total nodes in the tree = `sum_{k=0 to 4} 2^k = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31`.\n*   The root is the single node at level 0.\n*   Number of non-root nodes = Total nodes - 1 = `31 - 1 = 30`.\n*   Alternatively, the non-root nodes are all nodes at levels 1, 2, 3, and 4: `2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30`.\n*   For each of these 30 non-root nodes, we store two generator matrices: `U_i` and `V_i`.\n*   Number of generator submatrices = (Number of non-root nodes) × 2.\n*   Number of generator submatrices = `30 × 2 = 60`.\n*   **Number of generator submatrices = 60.**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Submatrices\n\nThe total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the diagonal blocks and the generator matrices.\n*   Total Submatrices = (Number of Diagonal Blocks) + (Number of Generator Matrices)\n*   Total Submatrices = `16 + 60`\n*   **Total Submatrices = 76**\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{76}$."
