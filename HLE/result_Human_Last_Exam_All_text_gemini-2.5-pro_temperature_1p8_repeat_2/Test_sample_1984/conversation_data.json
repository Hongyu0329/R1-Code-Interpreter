    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Finding the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) of the autonomous differential equation $x'(t) = f(x(t))$ are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out a $-x$ from each term:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square trinomial, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   $-x = 0 \\implies x_1 = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1=0 \\implies x_2 = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determining the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the first derivative test. We analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at the equilibrium point.\n\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable** (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need further analysis.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n**3. Further Analysis for the Inconclusive Case ($x=1$)**\n\nWhen the first derivative test is inconclusive, we can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point. This is often visualized using a phase line.\nRecall that $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n*   **To the left of $x=1$ (e.g., $x = 0.5$):**\n    $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.5(0.25) = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **To the right of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=2$):**\n    $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nThe phase line looks like this: `... ---> 0 <--- 1 <--- ...`\nSince solutions starting near $x=1$ but less than 1 move away from it, the point is not stable. This type of equilibrium is called half-stable or semi-stable, which is considered a type of **unstable** equilibrium in the context of Lyapunov stability. A point must attract solutions from both sides to be considered stable.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if solutions starting sufficiently close to $x^*$ remain close to $x^*$ for all future time.\n*   The equilibrium $x=1$ is not stable because solutions starting at $x=1-\\epsilon$ (for small $\\epsilon > 0$) will move away from 1 towards 0.\n*   Therefore, only $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n\n**4. Counting the Number of Stable Equilibria, $m$**\n\nFrom our analysis, we have identified only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\nThis is the final answer."
