    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The question asks for a scaling exponent within the context of the Renormalization Group (RG) and the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is used to calculate critical exponents for phase transitions in dimensions below the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. The system is typically described by a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) Hamiltonian with a $\\phi^4$ interaction term.\n\n2.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For a model with a single scalar order parameter and a $\\phi^4$ interaction (i.e., the Ising universality class), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, the predictions of mean-field theory are largely correct.\n\n3.  **Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Parameter:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative calculation in powers of the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. The question specifies the spatial dimension $d=3$. Therefore:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n    Although $\\epsilon=1$ is not infinitesimally small, the procedure involves calculating the exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$ and then substituting $\\epsilon=1$. This extrapolation provides surprisingly good estimates for exponents in $d=3$.\n\n4.  **Recall the Hyperscaling Relation:** The specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$ through the hyperscaling relation:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n    This relation is valid below the upper critical dimension.\n\n5.  **Use the Epsilon Expansion for $\\nu$:** The one-loop RG calculation provides the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ as a power series in $\\epsilon$. For a general n-vector model (with an n-component order parameter), the result to first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    The question does not specify the number of components of the order parameter, $n$. In such cases, the standard assumption is the Ising model universality class, where the order parameter is a scalar, meaning $n=1$.\n\n6.  **Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$ in terms of $\\epsilon$:** We substitute the expression for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation. It is crucial to substitute $d=4-\\epsilon$ to maintain consistency in the expansion.\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\nu$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\n    Now, expand the expression and keep only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon) - (\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - 2 - \\left[ \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right]\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Now we substitute the specific values for our problem: $n=1$ (Ising model) and $\\epsilon=1$ ($d=3$). We use the first-order approximation.\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9}$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series, and its application at $\\epsilon=1$ is a formal extrapolation, not a rigorously convergent calculation. However, it is the standard method for this type of problem.\n*   The calculation is performed to the first order (one-loop) in $\\epsilon$. Higher-order corrections exist but are more complex to calculate and are generally not expected unless specified.\n*   The choice of $n=1$ (Ising universality class) is a standard assumption when the model is not specified, as it is the simplest case of a system with a discrete symmetry breaking.\n*   It is critical to use $d=4-\\epsilon$ within the hyperscaling relation. A common mistake is to incorrectly use $d=4$ or $d=3$ before the expansion is complete.\n\nThe final answer is the result of this first-order calculation.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
