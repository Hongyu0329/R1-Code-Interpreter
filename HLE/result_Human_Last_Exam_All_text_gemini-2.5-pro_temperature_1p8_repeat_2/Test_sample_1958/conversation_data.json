    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nThe user wants to identify two things:\n1.  The first book of the Bible, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned by its specific name within a Shakespeare play.\n2.  The title of the Shakespeare play where this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Method\n\nTo answer this correctly, several points must be handled with care:\n*   **Canonical Order:** The search must be systematic, starting with Genesis and proceeding through the books of the Old Testament in their conventional order (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers... Job, Psalms, Proverbs... etc.). The Protestant canon is the most relevant for Shakespeare.\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\":** This is the most critical constraint. An allusion to a story (like Noah's flood) or a quote from a book is not sufficient. The name of the book itself, or a clearly identifiable titled part of it, must appear in the text.\n*   **Distinguishing Mentions:** It's important to distinguish between mentioning a biblical *character* (e.g., \"as patient as Job\") and mentioning the biblical *book* (e.g., \"the Book of Job\"). The question asks for the book to be mentioned by name. While naming the title character can be interpreted as naming the book, a more direct reference to the book as a text would be a stronger candidate.\n*   **Exhaustive Search:** A thorough search of the complete works of Shakespeare is required to ensure no earlier mention has been missed.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Search\n\n1.  **Early Books (Genesis to Esther):** A full-text search of Shakespeare's plays confirms that the books from Genesis through Esther are not mentioned by name. There are countless allusions to their stories and characters (Adam and Eve, Cain, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samson), but the books themselves (e.g., \"the Book of Genesis,\" \"the Book of Judges\") are not named.\n\n2.  **The Book of Job:** The search for \"Job\" yields a result. In **Part 2 of *Henry IV*** (Act 1, Scene 2), Falstaff says: \"I am as poor as **Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This mentions the name \"Job,\" which is the title of a book of the Bible. However, it is used in a common proverbial phrase that refers to the man Job and his characteristics (poverty and patience). It is a mention of the character, not an explicit reference to the book as a text.\n\n3.  **The Book of Psalms:** Continuing in canonical order, the next book that yields a result is the Book of Psalms. In **_The Merry Wives of Windsor_** (Act 2, Scene 1), Mistress Ford is complaining about Falstaff. Comparing his words to his character, she says they \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the **Hundredth Psalm** to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a very specific and unambiguous reference. \"The Hundredth Psalm\" is a named, titled part of the Book of Psalms. This is not just a reference to a character or a general theme, but to a specific piece of text from the Bible, identified by its name/number.\n\n4.  **Comparing Candidates (Job vs. Psalms):**\n    *   The reference to \"Job\" occurs in *2 Henry IV*. The reference to \"Psalms\" occurs in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.\n    *   In the Bible, the Book of Job comes before the Book of Psalms.\n    *   The crucial difference lies in the nature of the mention. The reference to \"Job\" is to the person as an archetype. The reference to \"the Hundredth Psalm\" is to the biblical text itself.\n    *   Given the question asks which *book* is \"mentioned by name,\" the reference to a specific textual component (\"the Hundredth Psalm\") is a more direct and literal fulfillment of the prompt than the idiomatic reference to a character (\"poor as Job\"). Therefore, the Book of Psalms is the first book to be unambiguously named *as a book* (via one of its numbered components).\n\n5.  **Later Books:** Later books like Daniel are also mentioned by naming the title character (\"A Daniel come to judgment!\" in *The Merchant of Venice*), but this is the same type of reference as the one to Job and occurs later in the biblical canon than Psalms.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe first book of the Bible mentioned by name *as a textual entity* is the Book of Psalms. While the character Job is mentioned, the reference to \"the Hundredth Psalm\" is a direct naming of a component of the book, making it the most accurate answer.\n\n**Book:** The Book of Psalms\n**Play:** *The Merry Wives of Windsor*\n\n<<<The Book of Psalms, mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.>>>"
