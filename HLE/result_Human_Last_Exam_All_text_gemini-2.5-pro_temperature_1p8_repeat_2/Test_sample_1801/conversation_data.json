    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Two individuals.\n*   **Qualification:** Both must be Nobel laureates.\n*   **Context:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **Company:** The commercial was for Enron.\n*   **Year:** The commercial aired around 2000.\n*   **Specific Identifier:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n\n**Step 2: Research Strategy**\nThe most effective approach is to search for information about Enron's advertising campaigns, specifically the \"Ask Why\" campaign from the year 2000. Keywords for searching would include \"Enron Ask Why commercial\", \"Enron commercial cast 2000\", and \"famous people in Enron ads\".\n\n**Step 3: Execution and Analysis**\n1.  **Identify the \"Ask Why\" campaign:** Research confirms that Enron launched a high-profile, multi-million dollar advertising campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why\" in 2000. The campaign was intended to rebrand Enron from just an energy company to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation.\n2.  **Identify the specific commercial:** One of the most discussed television spots from this campaign featured several prominent thinkers and public figures. The commercial is known for its ironic tone in retrospect, given Enron's massive fraud and subsequent collapse in 2001.\n3.  **Identify the individuals in the commercial:** Looking up the cast of this specific commercial reveals that it featured several people, but two in particular were Nobel Prize winners. These two individuals were the American mathematician John Nash and the former President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.\n4.  **Verify Nobel Laureate status:**\n    *   **Mikhail Gorbachev:** A check of the Nobel Prize records confirms he was awarded the **Nobel Peace Prize in 1990** \"for his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community.\"\n    *   **John Nash:** A check of the Nobel Prize records confirms that John F. Nash Jr. was a co-recipient of the **Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics) in 1994** for his pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games (Game Theory).\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the research, the two Nobel laureates who appeared in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial are indeed Mikhail Gorbachev and John Nash.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The deep irony of the campaign's message (\"Ask Why\") in light of the massive, undisclosed fraud occurring within Enron at the time.\n*   The distinction between the Nobel Peace Prize (Gorbachev) and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Nash), both of which qualify them as \"Nobel laureates.\"\n*   The year of the commercial (2000) was just before Enron's scandal broke and the company filed for bankruptcy (late 2001), making this ad one of the company's last major public relations efforts.\n\n<<<Mikhail Gorbachev and John Nash>>>"
