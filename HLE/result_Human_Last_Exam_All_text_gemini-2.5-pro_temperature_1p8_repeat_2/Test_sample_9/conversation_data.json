    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space X\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. Let's formalize this description.\n\n1.  **A lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$**: A lattice $\\Lambda$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ of rank 2. It can be written as $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ where $v_1, v_2$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The condition \"nondegenerate\" means that the lattice spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is already part of the definition. We can represent the basis by a matrix $V = (v_1, v_2) \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit area**: The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(V)|$. The condition of unit area means we restrict to matrices $V$ with $|\\det(V)| = 1$. The set of such matrices is $SL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n\n3.  **Lattice equivalence**: Two bases $V$ and $V'$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $V' = VM$. Thus, the space of all lattices of unit area is the quotient space $\\mathcal{L}_1 = SL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R})/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Moduli space**: The term \"moduli space\" implies that we identify lattices that are considered equivalent. In the context of geometric objects like lattices, equivalence is typically defined by isometry. Two lattices $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are equivalent if there exists an isometry $R \\in O(2)$ (an orthogonal transformation, i.e., a rotation or a reflection) such that $\\Lambda_2 = R(\\Lambda_1)$. This means we must quotient the space of lattices by the action of $O(2)$. The action of $R \\in O(2)$ on a lattice represented by a basis $V$ transforms it to a lattice represented by $RV$. So, the moduli space is $X = O(2) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_1 = O(2) \\backslash SL_2^\\pm(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Represent X using quadratic forms\n\nA more convenient way to represent $X$ is by using quadratic forms. A lattice $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ determines a metric structure on the torus $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\Lambda$. This structure is encoded by the Gram matrix of the basis vectors, $G = (g_{ij}) = (\\langle v_i, v_j \\rangle)$. If $V=(v_1, v_2)$, then $G = V^T V$.\n\n*   $G$ is a symmetric positive-definite $2 \\times 2$ matrix.\n*   The area of the lattice is $|\\det(V)| = \\sqrt{\\det(G)}$. The unit area condition translates to $\\det(G)=1$.\n*   Let $S$ be the space of symmetric positive-definite $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1. This space is known to be homeomorphic to the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$.\n*   If we change the basis of the lattice, $V' = VM$ for $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, the Gram matrix transforms as $G' = (VM)^T(VM) = M^T G M$.\n*   If we apply an isometry $R \\in O(2)$ to the lattice, the basis becomes $RV$. The new Gram matrix is $(RV)^T(RV) = V^T R^T R V = V^T I V = G$, since $R^T R = I$ for $R \\in O(2)$. The Gram matrix is invariant under isometries.\n\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ is precisely the space of equivalence classes of these Gram matrices under the action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n$X = S / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where the action is $G \\mapsto M^T G M$ for $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate X to a quotient of the hyperbolic plane\n\nIt is a classical result from the theory of quadratic forms that the space $X = S / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is homeomorphic to the quotient of the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$ by the group of all its isometries that arise from $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This group is $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$.\n\nThe action of $PGL_2(\\mathbb{R}) = GL_2(\\mathbb{R})/\\{\\pm \\lambda I\\}$ on $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is given by fractional linear transformations. If $\\det(M)>0$, $M$ acts as $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. If $\\det(M)<0$, $M$ acts as $z \\mapsto \\frac{a\\bar{z}+b}{c\\bar{z}+d}$.\nThus, $X \\cong \\mathbb{H}^2 / PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the first homology group\n\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\mathbb{H}^2$ is simply connected, it is the universal cover of the orbifold $X$. The fundamental group of the quotient space (as an orbifold) is the group of deck transformations, which is $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nSo, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nWe need to compute the abelianization $(PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab}$.\n\nThe group $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be generated by three elements, for instance:\n$S: z \\mapsto -1/z$, corresponding to matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n$T: z \\mapsto z+1$, corresponding to matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n$U: z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$, corresponding to matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe defining relations for $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with these generators are:\n1.  $S^2 = 1$\n2.  $(ST)^3 = 1$ (These two generate $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$)\n3.  $U^2 = 1$\n4.  $USU^{-1} = S$ (i.e., $US=SU$)\n5.  $UTU^{-1} = T^{-1}$\n\nTo find the abelianization, we assume the generators commute. Let $s, t, u$ be the images of $S, T, U$ in the abelianized group. The relations become (in additive notation):\n1.  $2s=0$\n2.  $3(s+t)=0$\n3.  $2u=0$\n4.  $s+u-s-u=0$ (gives no information)\n5.  $u+t-u = -t \\implies 2t=0$\n\nWe have the set of relations: $2s=0$, $2t=0$, $2u=0$, and $3(s+t)=0$.\nFrom $2s=0$ and $2t=0$, the element $s+t$ has order at most 2. The relation $3(s+t)=0$ implies its order must divide 3. The only way to satisfy both is if $s+t=0$, which means $s=-t$. Since $2t=0$, we have $s=t$.\nSubstituting $s=t$ into $3(s+t)=0$ gives $3(2s) = 6s = 0$. Since $2s=0$, this relation is redundant.\nSo, the independent relations are $s=t$, $2s=0$, and $2u=0$.\nThe abelian group is generated by $s$ and $u$, with the relations $2s=0$ and $2u=0$. This is the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = (PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nFinal check of the steps: The identification of the moduli space with $\\mathbb{H}^2/PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a standard result in the field. The computation of the abelianization of $PGL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ from its presentation is algebraic and seems correct. The conclusion is therefore robust."
