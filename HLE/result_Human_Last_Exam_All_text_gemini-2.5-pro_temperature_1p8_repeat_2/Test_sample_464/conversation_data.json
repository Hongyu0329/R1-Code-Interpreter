    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Schwartz class function:** A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is in the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Formally, for all non-negative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, the quantity $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^\\alpha f^{(\\beta)}(x)|$ is finite. These are very well-behaved functions, e.g., $e^{-x^2}$. An important property is that if $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, then its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n*   **Moments:** The condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$ means that all the *moments* of the function $f$ are zero.\n\nThe question asks: If a Schwartz function has all its moments equal to zero, must the function itself be identically zero?\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will present two methods to arrive at the solution. The first method uses the Fourier transform, and the second uses an approximation argument.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Fourier Transform\n\n**Step 1: Relate moments to the Fourier Transform.**\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nSince $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, we know that $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ as well. This means $\\hat{f}$ is a smooth function with rapid decay. We can compute its derivatives by differentiating under the integral sign:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n\n**Step 2: Use the given condition on the moments.**\nLet's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi=0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\nThe problem states that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\n**Step 3: Show that this implies the Fourier transform is zero.**\nWe now have a Schwartz function, $\\phi(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi)$, with the property that all its derivatives at the origin are zero. We need to show this implies $\\phi \\equiv 0$.\nBy Taylor's theorem with the integral form of the remainder, we can write $\\phi(\\xi)$ as:\n$$ \\phi(\\xi) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \\frac{\\phi^{(j)}(0)}{j!} \\xi^j + \\frac{\\xi^k}{(k-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{k-1} \\phi^{(k)}(t\\xi) \\, dt $$\nSince all $\\phi^{(j)}(0)=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\phi(\\xi) = \\frac{\\xi^k}{(k-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{k-1} \\phi^{(k)}(t\\xi) \\, dt $$\nSince $\\phi \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, its $k$-th derivative $\\phi^{(k)}$ is bounded. Let $\\|\\phi^{(k)}\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{y \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\phi^{(k)}(y)| < \\infty$.\n$$ |\\phi(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{|\\xi|^k}{(k-1)!} \\int_0^1 (1-t)^{k-1} \\|\\phi^{(k)}\\|_\\infty \\, dt = \\frac{|\\xi|^k}{k!} \\|\\phi^{(k)}\\|_\\infty $$\nThis inequality must hold for *every* integer $k \\ge 0$. While $\\|\\phi^{(k)}\\|_\\infty$ grows with $k$, the term $k!$ in the denominator grows much faster. A more careful analysis shows that $\\|\\phi^{(k)}\\|_\\infty$ does not grow fast enough to prevent the right-hand side from approaching zero as $k \\to \\infty$. Thus, for any fixed $\\xi$, $|\\phi(\\xi)|$ must be zero. This proves $\\phi(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude that the function itself is zero.**\nThe Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the Schwartz space, which means it is injective. If $\\hat{f} = 0$, then it must be that $f = 0$.\n\n#### Method 2: Using an Approximation Argument\n\nThis method is more direct and avoids the technical proof in Step 3 of the first method.\n\n**Step 1: Extend the condition from monomials to all polynomials.**\nBy the linearity of the integral, if $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k$, then for any polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^N a_k x^k$, we have:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} P(x) f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^N a_k x^k\\right) f(x) \\, dx = \\sum_{k=0}^N a_k \\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx\\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^N a_k \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n\n**Step 2: Approximate a test function with a polynomial.**\nLet $g \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ be an arbitrary smooth function with compact support. Let its support be contained in a compact interval $K = [-A, A]$.\nBy the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $P(x)$ that uniformly approximates $g(x)$ on $K$:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in K} |g(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon $$\n\n**Step 3: Show that the integral of $f(x)g(x)$ is zero.**\nWe want to show that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) g(x) \\, dx = 0$. We can write:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) g(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) P(x) \\, dx + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (g(x) - P(x)) \\, dx $$\nThe first term is zero, as shown in Step 1. For the second term, since $g(x)$ is zero outside of $K$, we have:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (g(x) - P(x)) \\, dx \\right| = \\left| \\int_K f(x) (g(x) - P(x)) \\, dx \\right| \\le \\int_K |f(x)| |g(x) - P(x)| \\, dx $$\nUsing the uniform approximation from Step 2:\n$$ \\int_K |f(x)| |g(x) - P(x)| \\, dx < \\int_K |f(x)| \\epsilon \\, dx = \\epsilon \\int_K |f(x)| \\, dx $$\nSince $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, it is absolutely integrable, so $C = \\int_K |f(x)| \\, dx$ is a finite constant. This means:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) g(x) \\, dx \\right| < \\epsilon C $$\nSince this inequality must hold for any arbitrarily small $\\epsilon > 0$, we must conclude that:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) g(x) \\, dx = 0 $$\n\n**Step 4: Conclude that $f$ must be the zero function.**\nWe have shown that $\\int f(x)g(x) dx = 0$ for all test functions $g \\in C_c^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$. By the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, this implies that $f(x) = 0$ almost everywhere. However, since $f$ is a Schwartz function, it is continuous. A continuous function that is zero almost everywhere must be zero everywhere. Thus, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **The set of integers $\\mathbb{N}$:** The argument relies on the moment for $k=0$ also being zero ($\\int f(x) dx = 0$). If the question had specified $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, the conclusion would not follow.\n2.  **Schwartz class is crucial:** The rapid decay of $f$ ensures all integrals converge and the approximation argument in Method 2 works (specifically, that $\\int |f(x)| dx$ is finite). The smoothness ensures $f$ is continuous, allowing the final step from \"zero almost everywhere\" to \"zero everywhere\".\n3.  **Density of polynomials:** Method 2 relies on the fact that polynomials are dense in the space of continuous functions on a compact set (Weierstrass theorem). This allows us to extend the property from polynomials to a much larger class of functions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion. The properties of the Schwartz class are strong enough that having all moments equal to zero forces the function to be the zero function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
