    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the possible degrees of the specified normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find the Galois group of its splitting field.**\n\nLet the polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nBy inspection, we can find a factorization of this polynomial. Let's try to see if it is a product of two lower-degree polynomials. Notice the coefficients $\\{3, 18, -6\\}$ are all multiples of 3. Let's try to factor out $(x^2-2)$:\n$(x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3) = x^7 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x^5 + 18x - 6 = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6$.\nThis is precisely $f(x)$. So, $f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n*   **Analysis of g(x) = x^2 - 2:**\n    The roots of $g(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of this extension is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Analysis of h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient is $1$, which is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients ($0, 0, 0, -9, 3$) are divisible by 3. The constant term $3$ is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Therefore, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Number of real roots:** To find the Galois group, we determine the number of real roots of $h(x)$. We analyze its derivative: $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        *   $h(+\\infty) \\to +\\infty$\n        *   At the local minimum $x_1 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$, $h(x_1) = (x_1^4)x_1 - 9x_1 + 3 = \\frac{9}{5}x_1 - 9x_1 + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}x_1$. Since $x_1>1$, $h(x_1)<0$.\n        *   At the local maximum $x_2 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 0$, $h(x_2) = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}x_2 > 0$.\n        *   $h(-\\infty) \\to -\\infty$\n        The signs of $h(x)$ at $-\\infty, x_2, x_1, +\\infty$ are $-,+, - ,+$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots. Since the degree is 5, it must have 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    3.  **Galois Group:** For an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, if it has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\n*   **The Galois Group of K/Q:**\n    The splitting field $K$ is the compositum of $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_h$. To find the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, we check if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The Galois group of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. $S_5$ has a unique subgroup of index 2, the alternating group $A_5$. By Galois theory, this corresponds to a unique quadratic subfield of $K_h$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\n    $\\Delta = \\text{disc}(x^5-9x+3) = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = -14,863,419$.\n    The unique quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field, it cannot be this subfield. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subset K_h$, which implies $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Since $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ are both Galois extensions with trivial intersection, the Galois group of their compositum $K=K_gK_h$ is the direct product of their Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The order of the group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 2: Find all possible degrees of normal sub-extensions.**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between subfields $L$ of $K$ (containing $\\mathbb{Q}$) and subgroups $H$ of $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ implies that $H$ must be a proper non-trivial subgroup of $G$ (i.e., $H \\neq \\{e\\}$ and $H \\neq G$).\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nSo, we need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ and compute their indices.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_n$ for $n \\ge 5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_n$, and $S_n$. So for $S_5$, they are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ can be of two types: product subgroups and \"skew\" subgroups.\n1.  **Product Normal Subgroups:** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 2 \\times 1 = 2$. Index: $240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$. Index: $240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H| = 1 \\times 60 = 60$. Index: $240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H| = 1 \\times 120 = 120$. Index: $240/120 = 2$.\n    (We exclude $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and $C_2 \\times S_5$ as they correspond to $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ respectively).\n\n2.  **\"Skew\" Normal Subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the normal subgroups of the factors. Let $H \\unlhd G_1 \\times G_2$. Such a group is determined by an isomorphism $\\phi: K_1/N_1 \\to K_2/N_2$ (where these are quotients of normal subgroups), satisfying a compatibility condition with the group actions. For $G = C_2 \\times S_5$, the condition implies that the image of $\\phi$, $K_2/N_2$, must be central in $S_5/N_2$.\n    Let's check the possible quotients of normal subgroups of $S_5$:\n    *   $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$. $Z(S_5)=\\{e\\}$. Trivial case.\n    *   $A_5/\\{e\\} \\cong A_5$. $Z(A_5)=\\{e\\}$. Trivial case.\n    *   $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. $Z(C_2)=C_2$. This is a possible candidate for $K_2/N_2$.\n    For a skew subgroup to exist, we need a quotient from $C_2$ isomorphic to this $C_2$. The only candidate is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    So there is a skew normal subgroup corresponding to the isomorphism $\\phi: C_2/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$.\n    Let $c$ be the generator of $C_2$. The subgroup $H$ consists of pairs $(g, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5$ where $\\phi(g\\{e\\}) = \\sigma A_5$.\n    *   If $g=e$, $\\phi(e\\{e\\}) = A_5$ (the identity), so $\\sigma$ must be in $A_5$. These elements are $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$.\n    *   If $g=c$, $\\phi(c\\{e\\})$ is the non-identity element of $S_5/A_5$, which is the coset of odd permutations. So $\\sigma$ must be an odd permutation. These elements are $\\{c\\} \\times (S_5 \\setminus A_5)$.\n    So, this normal subgroup is $H_5 = (\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cup (\\{c\\} \\times (S_5 \\setminus A_5))$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: List all the possible degrees.**\nThe degrees of the normal extensions are the indices we calculated:\n*   From $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, the degree is 120.\n*   From $C_2 \\times A_5$, the degree is 2.\n*   From $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$, the degree is 4.\n*   From $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$, the degree is 2.\n*   From the skew subgroup $H_5$, the degree is 2.\n\nThe set of all possible distinct degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
