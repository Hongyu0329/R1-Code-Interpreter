    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis Strategy**\n\n1.  **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils are protein structural motifs where α-helices wrap around each other. The oligomeric state (number of helices) is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence.\n2.  **Heptad Repeat:** The sequence of a coiled-coil follows a seven-residue (heptad) repeat pattern, commonly denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n3.  **Core Positions:** Residues at the `a` and `d` positions are critical. They are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form the core of the structure, stabilizing the oligomer. The identity of the amino acids at these positions dictates the packing geometry and thus the number of helices.\n4.  **Determining the Register:** The first step is to identify the correct register (which amino acid corresponds to which position `a-g`). We do this by finding a repeating pattern that places hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`. All sequences are 28 amino acids, which means they consist of four full heptad repeats `(n=4)`.\n5.  **Applying Packing Rules:** Once the register and the core residues are identified, we apply established principles, largely derived from seminal studies like those by Harbury et al., which systematically mutated the core positions of the GCN4 leucine zipper. The key rules relate the identity of amino acids at `a` and `d` positions to the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Size and Shape:** The size and shape of the side chains at `a` and `d` positions are crucial. For example, β-branched amino acids (like Isoleucine `I` or Valine `V`) have different packing properties than γ-branched ones (like Leucine `L`).\n    *   **Polar Residues:** Sometimes, polar residues like Asparagine (`N`), Glutamine (`Q`), or Threonine (`T`) are found in the core. They can form stabilizing hydrogen bond networks that specify a particular oligomeric state.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\nFirst, we must determine the correct heptad register. After testing several possibilities, the register that provides the most chemically sensible core for the majority of the sequences is `g(abcdefg)4`. In this register, for each 7-residue block (`X1X2X3X4X5X6X7`), the core residues are `a = X2` and `d = X5`.\n\n1.  **Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   **Register Analysis (`gabcdefg`):** The core residues `(a,d)` are `(I,A)` for all four heptads.\n    *   **Oligomeric State Analysis:** The core consists of Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Alanine (A) at the `d` position. While not one of the classic pairs studied by Harbury, the `I` side chain is large and β-branched, and `A` is small. This combination can pack efficiently in a standard knobs-into-holes arrangement, which is characteristic of a **dimer (2)**.\n\n2.  **Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **Register Analysis (`gabcdefg`):** The core residues `(a,d)` are `(I,L)` for three of the repeats, and `(N,L)` for the third repeat.\n    *   **Oligomeric State Analysis:** The combination `a=I, d=L` is the canonical motif for a **dimer (2)**, as shown by Harbury's GCN4-pIL peptide. The third repeat contains an Asparagine (N) at the `a` position. Buried Asn-Asn pairs are known to strongly favor and specify parallel dimers. Even as a single `N` in one layer, its presence is highly consistent with, and does not contradict, the dimeric preference of the rest of the sequence. Therefore, this peptide is a **dimer (2)**.\n\n3.  **Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **Register Analysis (`gabcdefg`):** The core residues `(a,d)` are `(I,I)` for all four heptads.\n    *   **Oligomeric State Analysis:** The `a=I, d=I` core is that of Harbury's GCN4-pII. While this was initially characterized as a trimer, subsequent studies have shown it can readily form **tetramers (4)**. The bulky, symmetric core of Isoleucine at both positions can be favorably packed in a four-helix bundle. A tetramer is a very plausible state for this sequence.\n\n4.  **Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **Register Analysis (`gabcdefg`):** The core residues `(a,d)` are `(I,Q)` for all four heptads.\n    *   **Oligomeric State Analysis:** This is the most complex case. Glutamine (Q) is a polar residue. Placing it in the hydrophobic `d` position is generally unfavorable unless it can form a stabilizing \"polar zipper,\" which usually occurs in trimers or tetramers. However, this may be a case where the destabilization of higher-order states (due to the `I-Q` packing) is so great that a less-than-ideal **dimer (2)** is the most stable form. This is a known outcome for some designed peptides that do not follow simple rules.\n\n5.  **Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **Register Analysis (`gabcdefg`):** The core residues `(a,d)` are `(I,T)` for all four heptads.\n    *   **Oligomeric State Analysis:** Threonine (T) at the `d` position is polar and β-branched. The polar hydroxyl group is likely buried in the core. To be stable, it needs to form hydrogen bonds. A configuration of three Threonine residues at a `d`-position layer can form a highly stable, hydrogen-bonded network in the core of a **trimer (3)**. This is a strong indicator for a trimeric state.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\nBased on the analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are:\n1.  **2** (Dimer)\n2.  **2** (Dimer)\n3.  **4** (Tetramer)\n4.  **2** (Dimer)\n5.  **3** (Trimer)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence `2, 2, 4, 2, 3`. This matches one of the provided answer choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
