    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where n = 35.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding and Formalizing the Question\n\n1.  **Graph:** We start with a complete graph $K_{35}$, which has $n=35$ vertices. In $K_{35}$, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n2.  **Covering:** We need to find a collection of bipartite graphs, let's call them $H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k$. The condition is that the union of the edge sets of these bipartite graphs must contain all the edges of $K_{35}$. This means for every edge in $K_{35}$, it must be present as an edge in at least one of the graphs $H_i$.\n3.  **Vertices of the Bipartite Graphs:** Each bipartite graph $H_i$ is a subgraph of $K_{35}$. Its vertex set, $V(H_i)$, is a subset of the 35 vertices of $K_{35}$.\n4.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the minimum possible value for the \"total number of vertices in the family\". This is interpreted as the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of the graphs in the family, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(H_i)|$. If a vertex appears in multiple bipartite graphs, it is counted for each appearance.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Problem to Known Combinatorial Concepts\n\nThis problem is a known one in extremal combinatorics.\n*   Any bipartite graph is a subgraph of a complete bipartite graph (often called a biclique) on the same set of vertices. If we have a covering by bipartite graphs $H_i$, we can replace each $H_i$ with the corresponding biclique on $V(H_i)$ without changing the vertex sets. The new family of bicliques will still cover $K_{35}$. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by considering only families of bicliques.\n*   Let a biclique $H_i$ have a vertex partition $(A_i, B_i)$, so its vertex set is $V(H_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$. The condition that the family of bicliques covers $K_{35}$ means that for any pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ in $K_{35}$, there must exist at least one index $i$ such that one vertex is in $A_i$ and the other is in $B_i$.\n\n### Step 3: A Constructive Upper Bound\n\nWe can construct a family of bipartite graphs that covers $K_{35}$ and calculate the total number of vertices for this construction. This will give us an upper bound on the minimum value.\n\n1.  **Binary Representation:** Let's assign a unique binary string (codeword) to each of the $n=35$ vertices. To do this, we need strings of a certain length, say $k$. The number of unique binary strings of length $k$ is $2^k$. We need $2^k \\ge 35$.\n    *   $2^5 = 32$ (not enough)\n    *   $2^6 = 64$ (sufficient)\n    So, we need a string length of $k = 6$. Thus, $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n    We can assign a unique binary vector $a(v) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^6$ to each vertex $v$ of $K_{35}$.\n\n2.  **Constructing the Bipartite Graphs:** We create $k=6$ bipartite graphs, $H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_6$, one for each coordinate in the binary strings.\n    *   For each coordinate $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 6\\}$, define two sets of vertices:\n        *   $A_i = \\{ v \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th bit of } a(v) \\text{ is } 0 \\}$\n        *   $B_i = \\{ v \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th bit of } a(v) \\text{ is } 1 \\}$\n    *   Let $H_i$ be the complete bipartite graph with partition $(A_i, B_i)$. The vertex set of $H_i$ is $V(H_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$.\n\n3.  **Verification of the Cover:** Let's check if this family of 6 graphs covers all edges of $K_{35}$. Take any two distinct vertices, $u$ and $v$. Since they are distinct, their assigned binary codewords $a(u)$ and $a(v)$ must be different. This means there is at least one coordinate position, say $i$, where they differ. For example, the $i$-th bit of $a(u)$ is 0 and the $i$-th bit of $a(v)$ is 1. By our construction, this means $u \\in A_i$ and $v \\in B_i$. Therefore, the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph $H_i$. This holds for any pair of vertices, so the family $\\{H_1, \\ldots, H_6\\}$ covers all edges of $K_{35}$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Cost:** Now, we calculate the total number of vertices for this construction.\n    *   For any graph $H_i$, its vertex set is $V(H_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$. Every vertex $v$ in $K_{35}$ has a codeword, and its $i$-th bit is either 0 or 1. So, every vertex belongs to either $A_i$ or $B_i$.\n    *   This means $V(H_i)$ contains all 35 vertices of $K_{35}$. So, $|V(H_i)| = 35$ for all $i = 1, \\ldots, 6$.\n    *   The total number of vertices is $\\sum_{i=1}^6 |V(H_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^6 35 = 6 \\times 35 = 210$.\n\n### Step 4: The Lower Bound and Conclusion\n\nThe construction above provides a covering with a total vertex count of 210. This is an upper bound for the minimum value. A key result in combinatorics, established by G. Hansel and also independently by G.O.H. Katona, provides a matching lower bound.\n\n*   **Theorem (Hansel, Katona):** For any family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of the complete graph $K_n$, the sum of the sizes of their vertex sets is at least $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\nFor our case, with $n=35$:\n*   The lower bound is $35 \\times \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nSince our construction achieves this lower bound, the value we calculated is indeed the minimum possible.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of $K_{35}$ is calculated as $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\nWith $n = 35$:\n1.  Calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$:\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^6 = 64$\n    *   Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6$.\n    *   Thus, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n2.  Calculate the total number of vertices:\n    *   $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
