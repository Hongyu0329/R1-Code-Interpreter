    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Define the components of the expressions\n*   **Values (V):** {T, F} (2 choices)\n*   **Unary Operator (U):** {!}\n*   **Binary Operators (B):** {&, |} (2 choices)\n*   **Parentheses:** {(, )}\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` > `&` > `|`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the number of syntactically valid expressions of length 5 that evaluate to `True`.\n\nWe will categorize expressions into two groups: those without parentheses and those with parentheses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Expressions Without Parentheses\n\nWe need to find valid structures of length 5 using only {T, F, !, &, |}.\n\n1.  **Structure: `V B V B V`**\n    *   This structure consists of 3 values and 2 binary operators. There are 4 ways to choose the two operators (`& &`, `& |`, `| &`, `| |`).\n    *   `V1 & V2 & V3`: True only if all are T. (1 case: `T&T&T`).\n    *   `V1 | V2 | V3`: True unless all are F. There are 2³=8 total assignments for (V1,V2,V3), so 8 - 1 = 7 true expressions.\n    *   `V1 & V2 | V3`: Parsed as `(V1 & V2) | V3`. This is true if V3 is T (2²=4 ways for V1,V2), or if V3 is F and (V1&V2) is T (1 way: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   `V1 | V2 & V3`: Parsed as `V1 | (V2 & V3)`. This is true if V1 is T (2²=4 ways for V2,V3), or if V1 is F and (V2&V3) is T (1 way: T&T). Total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**.\n\n2.  **Structure: `! V B ! V`**\n    *   `!V1 & !V2`: True if `!V1` is T AND `!V2` is T, which means `V1` is F AND `V2` is F. (1 case: `!F & !F`).\n    *   `!V1 | !V2`: True if `!V1` is T OR `!V2` is T. It's false only if `!V1` and `!V2` are both F, which means `V1` and `V2` are both T. There are 2²=4 assignments for (V1,V2), so 4 - 1 = 3 true expressions.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n3.  **Structure: `!!V B V`**\n    *   This is equivalent to `V B V` in evaluation.\n    *   `!!V1 & V2` (same as `V1 & V2`): True only if V1=T, V2=T. (1 case: `!!T & T`).\n    *   `!!V1 | V2` (same as `V1 | V2`): True unless V1=F, V2=F. (3 cases).\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n4.  **Structure: `V B !!V`**\n    *   Symmetrical to the previous case.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n5.  **Structure: `!!!!V`**\n    *   This is equivalent to `V`.\n    *   True only if `V` is T. (1 case: `!!!!T`).\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n**Total for Non-Parenthesized Expressions:** 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **31**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Expressions With Parentheses\n\nThe expression must have exactly 5 symbols, including one pair of balanced parentheses.\n\n1.  **Structure: `(V B V)`**\n    *   The content is an expression of length 3.\n    *   `(V1 & V2)`: True only for `(T & T)`. (1 case).\n    *   `(V1 | V2)`: True for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (3 cases).\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n2.  **Structure: `(!!V)`**\n    *   `(` `!` `!` `V` `)` is 5 symbols. Evaluates to `V`.\n    *   True only if `V` is T. (1 case: `(!!T)`).\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n3.  **Structure: `!(!V)`**\n    *   `!` `(` `!` `V` `)` is 5 symbols. Evaluates to `V`.\n    *   True only if `V` is T. (1 case: `!(!T)`).\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n4.  **Structure: `V B (V)`**\n    *   `V` `B` `(` `V` `)` is 5 symbols. The parentheses are redundant but form a distinct written expression. Evaluates as `V B V`.\n    *   `V & (V)`: True for `T & (T)`. (1 case).\n    *   `V | (V)`: True unless F | (F). (3 cases).\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n5.  **Structure: `(V) B V`**\n    *   `(` `V` `)` `B` `V` is 5 symbols. Symmetrical to the previous case.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n6.  **Structure: `!!(V)`**\n    *   `!` `!` `(` `V` `)` is 5 symbols. Evaluates to `!(!V)` which is `V`.\n    *   True only if `V` is T. (1 case: `!!(T)`).\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n**Total for Parenthesized Expressions:** 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **15**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nTotal number of true expressions = (Total from non-parenthesized) + (Total from parenthesized)\nTotal = 31 + 15 = 46.\n\n<<<46>>>"
