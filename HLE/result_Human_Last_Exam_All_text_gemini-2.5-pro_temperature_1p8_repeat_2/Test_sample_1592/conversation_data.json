    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located within the Cree community of Waskaganish. This community is situated in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. Geographically, it's on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nQuebec shares borders with the following provinces and territories:\n*   **Ontario** to the west and southwest.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick** to the south.\n*   **Nunavut** to the north (this is a maritime border through Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Geographic Proximity of Each Neighbor**\nWe need to find the shortest distance from Waskaganish to the border of each of these neighbors.\n\n*   **Ontario:** Waskaganish is located on the southeastern coast of James Bay. The provincial border between Quebec and Ontario runs down the western side of James Bay and extends south. The southern shoreline of James Bay is not far from Waskaganish, meaning the land border with Ontario is very close, just a short distance to the southwest.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes several islands within James Bay itself, the largest of which is Akimiski Island. While these islands are geographically in the same body of water as Waskaganish, they lie to the north and northwest of the community, across a significant stretch of water.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is far to the east of Waskaganish, separated by hundreds of kilometers of Quebec's landmass.\n*   **New Brunswick:** The border with New Brunswick is far to the south, beyond the St. Lawrence River and the Gasp√© Peninsula. This is clearly much farther than Ontario or Nunavut.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Closest Candidates (Ontario and Nunavut)**\nThe two most viable candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.\n*   The land border with **Ontario** starts at the southern tip of James Bay and runs south. Waskaganish is positioned very near this starting point. The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border is a relatively small overland or short cross-bay distance to the southwest.\n*   The closest part of **Nunavut** is one of the islands in James Bay (e.g., Akimiski Island or the Twin Islands). A direct measurement on a map shows that the distance across the bay to the nearest Nunavut island is greater than the distance to the Ontario provincial land border.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on its location on the southeastern shore of James Bay, the closest political entity to Waskaganish, other than Quebec, is the province of Ontario, whose border lies a short distance to the southwest.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **The question specifies \"province or territory.\"** It's essential to consider both.\n*   **The exclusion of Quebec** is a key part of the question.\n*   **The specific geography of James Bay is crucial.** Knowing that Nunavut has islands within the bay makes it a strong contender, but knowing that the Ontario border starts at the head of the bay is the deciding factor.\n*   **\"Closest\" means the shortest straight-line distance to a border,** not necessarily to a major city or town.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
