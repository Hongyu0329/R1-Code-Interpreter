    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we need to understand the key terms in the question: \"Sidon set\" and \"Hausdorff dimension\".\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set `E` within an additive group (in this case, the real numbers `ℝ`) is called a Sidon set (or a B₂-set) if all sums of pairs of elements are unique, up to the order of the summands. Formally, for any `a, b, c, d ∈ E`, the equality `a + b = c + d` implies that the multisets `{a, b}` and `{c, d}` are identical. This means either (`a=c` and `b=d`) or (`a=d` and `b=c`). This property represents a strong form of additive independence.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted `dim_H(E)`, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `E`. It generalizes the familiar concepts of length, area, and volume to more complex sets. For instance, a line segment has Hausdorff dimension 1, a square has dimension 2, and Cantor's ternary set has dimension `log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.63`. The dimension of a set `E` can be any non-negative real number.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum** possible Hausdorff dimension that a set `E ⊂ [0, 1]` can have while also being a Sidon set. This implies we are looking for the supremum of the set `{dim_H(E) | E ⊂ [0, 1] is a Sidon set}`.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nThere is a fundamental limit on how \"large\" a Sidon set can be in terms of its dimension. The key result, established through techniques in Fourier analysis and geometric measure theory, provides an upper bound.\n\n**Theorem:** If `E ⊂ ℝ` is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension must be less than or equal to 1/2. That is, `dim_H(E) ≤ 1/2`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Intuition Behind the Upper Bound**\nThe proof of this theorem is quite technical, but the intuition is as follows:\n1.  A set with a Hausdorff dimension `α > 1/2` is \"large\" in a specific analytical sense.\n2.  A well-known result in geometric measure theory (a consequence of Kaufman's work on Fourier transforms of measures) states that if `dim_H(E) > 1/2`, the sum set `E + E = {x + y | x, y ∈ E}` must contain an open interval.\n3.  Having a sum set that contains an interval implies a very rich additive structure. It means that there are abundant ways to form sums.\n4.  This \"additive richness\" is fundamentally incompatible with the \"additive scarcity\" required by the Sidon property. A formal proof shows that if `E+E` contains an interval, one can find four distinct elements `a, b, c, d ∈ E` such that `a + b = c + d`, which violates the Sidon condition.\n5.  Therefore, a set with `dim_H(E) > 1/2` cannot be a Sidon set. This establishes that `dim_H(E) ≤ 1/2` for any Sidon set `E`.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing the Supremum\n\nNow that we have an upper bound of 1/2, we need to know if it's the *least* upper bound (supremum). To do this, we need to show that there exist Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions arbitrarily close to 1/2.\n\n**Theorem:** For any `ε > 0`, there exists a Sidon set `E ⊂ [0, 1]` such that `dim_H(E) > 1/2 - ε`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Construction of High-Dimension Sidon Sets**\n1.  These sets are not simple to describe. They are typically constructed as random Cantor-like sets.\n2.  The construction process involves starting with the interval `[0, 1]` and iteratively removing parts of it in a randomized way. At each stage of the construction, care is taken to ensure that the emerging set is very likely to satisfy the Sidon property.\n3.  By carefully choosing the parameters of this random construction, it's possible to make the Hausdorff dimension of the resulting Sidon set as close to 1/2 as desired (i.e., greater than `1/2 - ε` for any chosen `ε > 0`). This result was first shown by R. Kaufman in the early 1980s and has been refined by others since.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the Results and Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set `E` cannot exceed 1/2.\nFrom Step 3, we know that for any value `x < 1/2`, we can find a Sidon set `E` with `dim_H(E) > x`.\n\nCombining these two facts leads to the conclusion that the supremum of the Hausdorff dimensions of all Sidon sets in `[0, 1]` is exactly 1/2. The question asks for the \"maximum\" value, which in this context is universally understood to mean the supremum.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Maximum vs. Supremum**\nIt is a famous open problem in the field whether the supremum is attained. That is, it is not currently known if there exists a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension *exactly* equal to 1/2. However, since we can get arbitrarily close to 1/2, the least upper bound is 1/2. The question \"What is the maximum value?\" asks for this supremum.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Upper Bound: `dim_H(E) ≤ 0.5`\n*   Existence: For any `ε > 0`, there exists `E` with `dim_H(E) > 0.5 - ε`.\n*   Conclusion: The maximum (supremum) value is 0.5.\n\n<<<0.5>>>"
