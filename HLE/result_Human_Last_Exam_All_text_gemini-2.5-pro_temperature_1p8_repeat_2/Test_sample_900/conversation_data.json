    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question asks about a specific dance performance. The key elements are:\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n    *   **Year:** 2015\n    *   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known as the Gigue variation).\n    *   **Specific Move:** *pas de Balanchine*\n\n2.  **Define the Core Terminology:** The crucial part of the question is to identify the dance move called a *pas de Balanchine*.\n    *   A *pas de Balanchine* is not a formal step found in classical ballet dictionaries but rather a nickname for a specific movement pattern frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine.\n    *   It is a variation of a *pas de bourrée dessous* (under). The sequence is typically: step back onto pointe or demi-pointe with one foot, step to the side with the other foot, and then step forward onto the first foot (often in a piqué). The pattern is \"back-side-front.\" It's known for its syncopated, off-balance, and jazzy feel.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography in Question:** The next step is to analyze the choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated.\"\n    *   William Forsythe's choreographic style is famously a deconstruction of classical ballet. While he was heavily influenced by Balanchine, he pushed the classical vocabulary to its extremes, focusing on off-balance positions, extreme speed, hyperextensions, and complex, fragmented transitions.\n    *   The \"Jete Woman\" solo is one of the most iconic examples of this style. It is characterized by powerful lunges, staccato piqué turns, explosive *grands battements* (high kicks), and sustained off-balance poses.\n\n4.  **Examine the Performance:** By reviewing footage of Svetlana Gileva performing this specific solo, we can search for the defined *pas de Balanchine* step.\n    *   Watching the solo reveals that the connecting steps and footwork used by Forsythe are different from the characteristic Balanchine pattern.\n    *   The footwork in the solo is predominantly composed of sharp piqués, quick runs, deep lunges, and abrupt changes of direction.\n    *   There are no instances of the \"back-side-front\" weaving and syncopated motion that defines the *pas de Balanchine*. Forsythe uses other types of traveling and transitional steps that suit the aggressive and angular aesthetic of the piece.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Definition Ambiguity:** The term *pas de Balanchine* is informal. One must establish a clear working definition of the step to begin counting. The standard interpretation as a specific *pas de bourrée dessous* is used for this analysis.\n2.  **Choreographic Style:** It is crucial to understand that Forsythe's work intentionally breaks down and reassembles classical steps. A movement might contain elements of a known step but be altered so fundamentally that it cannot be classified as such.\n3.  **Specificity of the Solo:** The analysis must be confined to the \"Jete Woman\" solo only, not the entire ballet.\n4.  **Verification:** The conclusion must be drawn from careful observation of the specified choreography, ideally as performed by the dancer in question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter a detailed analysis of the choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" solo from \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" and defining the *pas de Balanchine* as a specific \"back-side-front\" *pas de bourrée*, it is evident that this particular step is not used in the solo. The choreographic language of this piece, while descending from the classical and Balanchinian tradition, uses a different vocabulary of movement. Therefore, Svetlana Gileva does not perform any *pas de Balanchines* in this solo.\n\n<<<0>>>"
