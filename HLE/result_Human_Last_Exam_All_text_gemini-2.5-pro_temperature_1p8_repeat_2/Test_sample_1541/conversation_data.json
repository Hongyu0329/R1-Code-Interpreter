    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to take an input string representing a sum of numbers (exclusively 1, 2, 3, and 4) and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order. For example, \"3+2+1+4+1\" should become \"1+1+2+3+4\". The main constraint is to devise a C program that uses the minimum possible memory for its variables.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Right Algorithm for Memory Efficiency\nA common approach would be to:\n1.  Read the whole input string into a character array.\n2.  Parse the string to extract the numbers into an integer array.\n3.  Sort the integer array.\n4.  Print the sorted numbers, adding '+' between them.\n\nHowever, this approach is not memory-efficient. Storing the input string (up to 1000 characters) would take about 1001 bytes (`char s[1001];`). Storing the extracted numbers (up to 501 of them) would take `501 * sizeof(int)` which is about 2004 bytes. This is far from optimal.\n\nA more memory-efficient algorithm is **Counting Sort**. Since the numbers are limited to a very small set {1, 2, 3, 4}, we can simply count the occurrences of each number without storing them individually.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Plan for a Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n1.  **Do not store the input string:** To save memory, we should process the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. This function reads a single character from the standard input, avoiding the need for a large buffer.\n2.  **Use counters:** We will declare counters for each of the numbers: one for '1's, one for '2's, one for '3's, and one for '4's.\n3.  **Process the input stream:** We'll loop, calling `getchar()` until we reach the end of the line or the end of the file. Inside the loop, if the character is '1', '2', '3', or '4', we increment the corresponding counter. We can ignore the '+' characters.\n4.  **Print the sorted output:** After counting, we print the result directly. We'll have a series of loops: first, a loop to print '1's as many times as counted, then a loop for '2's, and so on. We need a simple flag or logic to ensure '+' is printed between numbers but not at the end.\n\n### Step 4: Careful Points and Variable Memory Calculation\n\nWe need to choose the smallest possible data type for each variable to minimize memory. We assume a standard C environment where `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n1.  **Counters for numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}:**\n    *   **How large can a count be?** The input string is at most 1000 characters. The numbers appear at indices 0, 2, 4, ... . The maximum number of terms is for a string like \"1+1+...+1\", which has (1000+1)/2 ≈ 501 terms.\n    *   **Which data type?** An `unsigned char` (1 byte) can hold values up to 255, which is too small. A `short` (2 bytes) can hold values up to 32,767, which is sufficient.\n    *   **Memory:** We need 4 counters. Using an array `short counts[4];` is a clean way to store them. Total memory = `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Variable for `getchar()`:**\n    *   The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to accommodate the special `EOF` (End of File) value, which is outside the `char` range. We cannot change this.\n    *   **Memory:** `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Looping and Printing Variables:**\n    *   **Loop counter:** We need a variable for the `for` loops that print the numbers. These loops will run up to the maximum count (501). A `short` is sufficient.\n    *   **Memory:** `1 * sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n    *   **'+' Sign Handling:** We need a way to avoid printing a '+' before the very first number. A flag variable is a good solution. A `short` can serve as a boolean flag (0 for false, 1 for true).\n    *   **Memory:** `1 * sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation (m)\nLet's sum the memory usage of all necessary variables:\n*   Counters (`short counts[4]`): 8 bytes\n*   Input character (`int c`): 4 bytes\n*   Loop variable (`short i`): 2 bytes\n*   Flag for '+' sign (`short first`): 2 bytes\n\n**Total memory (m) = 8 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 16 bytes.**\n\nThis is the most memory-efficient implementation, as it avoids large buffers and uses the smallest appropriate data types for its variables.\n\n<<<16>>>"
