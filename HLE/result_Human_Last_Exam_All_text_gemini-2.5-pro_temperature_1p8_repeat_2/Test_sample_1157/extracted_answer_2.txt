**Procedures:** The patient's management must begin with an urgent medical referral to initiate treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.5%) and stabilize her blood glucose. Due to the delayed presentation and diabetic status, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered. The acute dental care involves thorough clinical and radiographic assessment, confirmation that the avulsed left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar cannot be replanted after 28 hours, gentle debridement and irrigation of the sockets, and suturing of any soft tissue wounds. The patient’s SNB angle of 88⁰ indicates a prognathic mandible (skeletal Class III), which must be considered in the final prosthetic design.
**Cells of Interest:** The primary cells of interest are those for wound healing: **fibroblasts** (for tissue formation), **osteoblasts** (for bone formation), and **osteoclasts** (for bone remodeling). The function of these cells is impaired by her diabetic state.

**Denture Replacement Plan:**
*   **Type of Denture:** After a healing period of 3-6 months and stabilization of her diabetes, the most appropriate replacement is a **cast metal framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** The framework should be fabricated from **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** for rigidity and support, with the denture base and teeth made from **acrylic resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The abutment teeth will be the **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar**.
*   **Reasons for Abutment Choice:** These teeth are adjacent to the edentulous space and are essential for providing **support** (via rests), **retention** (via clasps), and **stability** for the denture. Using both teeth distributes forces evenly, creating a functional and durable prosthesis.
