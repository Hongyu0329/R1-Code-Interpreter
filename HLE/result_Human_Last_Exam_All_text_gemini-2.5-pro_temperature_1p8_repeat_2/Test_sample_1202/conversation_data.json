    "This question asks to identify the most likely mechanism that explains both the retention (keeping both copies) and divergence (sequence change) of duplicate genes. Let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Gene Duplication:** A process where a region of DNA containing a gene is duplicated. This creates a redundant copy.\n    *   **Retention:** The evolutionary process by which both copies of the duplicated gene are maintained as functional genes in the genome, rather than one being lost or silenced.\n    *   **Divergence:** The process where the two gene copies accumulate different mutations over time, leading to differences in their DNA sequences and potentially their functions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, such that the sequences become identical. This mechanism causes homogenization, not divergence. It works *against* the divergence of duplicate genes. Therefore, this is an incorrect choice.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one copy of the duplicate gene accumulates debilitating mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes non-functional. While the sequence of the pseudogene does *diverge* from the functional copy (as it's no longer under purifying selection), this mechanism represents a *loss* of function, not functional *retention*. It is the most common fate of duplicate genes, but it doesn't explain how two functional, divergent copies are maintained.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a novel, beneficial function.\n        *   **Retention:** Both genes are retained by natural selection because they each perform a distinct, essential function (one old, one new). Losing either would be disadvantageous.\n        *   **Divergence:** The acquisition of a new function requires changes in the gene's sequence, causing it to diverge from the original copy.\n        *   This is a valid and important mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, resulting in the loss of different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function B, and copy 2 loses function A.\n        *   **Retention:** To perform the full suite of ancestral functions, both copies are now required. They complement each other, and losing either one would be deleterious. Therefore, both are retained.\n        *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of different mutations in each copy leads to sequence divergence and divergence in their functional roles or expression patterns.\n        *   This is also a valid and powerful mechanism explaining retention and divergence.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes the rapid diversification of an ancestral species into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. This is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism acting on genes within a genome. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism of gene retention itself.\n\n3.  **Compare Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D):**\n    Both C and D are accepted models that explain both retention and divergence. The question asks for the \"*most likely*\" mechanism.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a relatively rare event: a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation must occur in the redundant copy before it succumbs to pseudogenization.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, relies on much more common degenerative mutations that are initially neutral because the other copy is still functional. The fixation and retention happen through a passive process where the partitioned functions become essential.\n    *   Because the degenerative mutations required for subfunctionalization are far more frequent than the specific gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization a more common, and thus more \"likely,\" route for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It provides a stable state where both copies are maintained, allowing a longer time for one of them to potentially evolve a new function later.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid mechanisms. However, subfunctionalization is often considered more likely to initiate the preservation of a duplicate gene pair because it relies on more frequent mutational events (degeneration) compared to the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
