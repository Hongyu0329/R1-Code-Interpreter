    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs within a single graph on `n = 128` vertices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Terminology:**\n    *   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices is `|V| = 128`.\n    *   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique with `k` vertices is a complete graph, denoted as `K_k`.\n    *   **Clique Size:** This is the number of vertices, `k`, in a clique.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a graph `G = (V, E)` and a subset of its vertices `S ⊆ V`, the subgraph induced by `S`, denoted `G[S]`, has `S` as its vertex set. Its edge set consists of all edges from `E` that have both of their endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **\"Clique of size k appears as an induced subgraph\":** This means there exists a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V` with `|S| = k`, such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find the largest possible value for `m`, where `m` is the number of distinct integers `k` for which the graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`. We need to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes this `m`.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Let `G` be any graph with 128 vertices.\n    *   Suppose `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`.\n    *   By definition, this requires a set of `k` vertices. Therefore, the size of the clique, `k`, cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph.\n    *   So, `k` must be an integer satisfying `1 ≤ k ≤ 128`.\n    *   This means that the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes, `m`, can therefore not be greater than 128. The maximum possible number is at most 128.\n\n3.  **Construct a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound:**\n    *   Now, we must check if it's possible to construct a graph on 128 vertices that actually achieves this upper bound of 128 distinct clique sizes.\n    *   To do this, we need a graph that contains an induced clique for every size `k` from 1 to 128.\n    *   Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   Let's verify if `K_{128}` satisfies the condition. We need to check if it contains an induced clique of size `k` for all `k ∈ {1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n    *   Pick any integer `k` in this range.\n    *   Select any subset `S` of `k` vertices from `K_{128}`.\n    *   Let's examine the induced subgraph `K_{128}[S]`. The vertex set is `S`.\n    *   Since the original graph is a complete graph, every pair of vertices in `S` is connected by an edge.\n    *   By the definition of an induced subgraph, all these edges are present in `K_{128}[S]`.\n    *   This means `K_{128}[S]` is a complete graph on `k` vertices, i.e., a `K_k`.\n    *   Since we can do this for any `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n    *   The set of distinct clique sizes found in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`. The number of such sizes is 128.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n    *   We have constructed a specific graph, `K_{128}`, that achieves exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number is 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Induced vs. Non-Induced Subgraph:** The word \"induced\" is critical. However, for a clique, any complete subgraph `K_k` is automatically an induced subgraph. If a set of `k` vertices forms a `K_k`, all `k(k-1)/2` edges between them must exist, and the induced subgraph includes exactly these edges, so it is also a `K_k`.\n*   **Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The question uses the word \"clique,\" not \"maximal clique.\" A clique is a set of vertices that is fully connected. A *maximal* clique is a clique that cannot be made larger by adding another vertex. If the question were about maximal cliques, the answer would be different (the analysis for that case would involve finding the maximum `m` for which we can find `m` distinct integers `k_i` that sum to at most 128, leading to an answer of 15). Since the problem states \"clique,\" we adhere to the standard definition. In the `K_{128}` graph, only the clique of size 128 is maximal. But cliques of size 1, 2, ..., 127 are all non-maximal, yet they are still cliques and exist as induced subgraphs.\n*   **\"Simultaneously Appear\":** This phrase simply means that all the differently-sized cliques must be found within one single graph, not different graphs for different sizes. Our construction of `K_{128}` satisfies this.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe problem is to maximize the number of distinct clique sizes `k` that can be found as induced subgraphs in a graph with `n=128` vertices.\n1.  The size `k` of any clique in a graph with 128 vertices must be less than or equal to 128. Thus, the number of distinct sizes cannot exceed 128.\n2.  The complete graph `K_{128}` is a graph on 128 vertices. For any integer `k` from 1 to 128, any subset of `k` vertices from `K_{128}` induces a `K_k`.\n3.  Therefore, `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., 128. This is a total of 128 distinct sizes.\n4.  Since the upper bound of 128 is achievable, it is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
