    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the molecular structure from its name.**\n\nThe name is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The base of the molecule is a benzene ring. The substitution pattern is `1,3,5-tri[...]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene`. This describes a hexasubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl (`-CH3`) groups.\n    *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are large substituent groups, which are `[...]methyl` groups. The `methyl` part here refers to the `-CH2-` linker connecting the benzene ring to the large indazolyl group.\n*   **Linker Group:** A methylene (`-CH2-`) group connects the benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5 to the nitrogen atom of the substituent group.\n*   **Substituent Group (let's call it 'R'):** This is `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`.\n    *   This is a complex, rigid, and chiral ligand derived from camphor.\n    *   The `2H-indazol-2-yl` part indicates that the attachment to the linker `-CH2-` group is via the nitrogen atom at position 2 of the indazole ring system.\n    *   The `4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano` part describes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornane-like) framework fused to the pyrazole part of the indazole.\n    *   The `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl` part specifies the stereochemistry and the location of three methyl groups on this framework. The group is explicitly chiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the overall symmetry of the molecule.**\n\nThe central benzene core is symmetrically substituted at positions 1,3,5 with identical large groups (`R-CH2-`) and at positions 2,4,6 with identical smaller groups (`-CH3`). This arrangement gives the entire molecule a 3-fold rotational axis of symmetry (C3) passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to it.\n\n*   Because of this C3 symmetry, the three `-CH3` groups (at C2, C4, C6) are chemically equivalent.\n*   Similarly, the three large substituent \"arms\" (`R-CH2-` groups at C1, C3, C5) are also chemically equivalent. This means a specific proton in one arm is chemically equivalent to the corresponding protons in the other two arms.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of distinct proton environments (signals).**\n\nWe can determine the number of signals for one \"arm\" and the core methyl groups, and then sum them up, as the C3 symmetry ensures there are no additional signals from the other arms.\n\n1.  **Core Methyl Groups (`-CH3` at C2, C4, C6):**\n    The three methyl groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   Number of signals = **1**\n\n2.  **Linker Methylene Groups (`-CH2-` at C1, C3, C5):**\n    Each `-CH2-` group is attached to the central aromatic ring and to a chiral substituent 'R'. Protons of a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic. This means the two protons of each `-CH2-` group are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them Ha and Hb. Due to the C3 symmetry of the whole molecule, all three Ha protons are equivalent to each other, and all three Hb protons are equivalent to each other.\n    *   Number of signals = **2** (one for the three Ha's, one for the three Hb's)\n\n3.  **Substituent Group 'R' (the camphor-derived indazole):**\n    This group is chiral and has a rigid, asymmetric structure. We must count the number of non-equivalent protons within one of these groups.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring at the C3 position. -> **1 signal**.\n    *   **Norbornane Skeleton Protons:**\n        *   C4-H: There is a single bridgehead proton at C4. -> **1 signal**.\n        *   C5-H2: The methylene group at C5 has two diastereotopic protons (exo and endo). -> **2 signals**.\n        *   C6-H2: The methylene group at C6 is in a different environment from C5. It also has two diastereotopic protons. -> **2 signals**.\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons:**\n        *   C7-CH3: There is one methyl group on the C7 bridgehead. -> **1 signal**.\n        *   C8-(CH3)2: There is a gem-dimethyl group on the C8 bridge. Because the entire R group is chiral and asymmetric, these two methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. -> **2 signals**.\n    *   **Total signals from one 'R' group:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9 signals**.\n\n**Step 4: Sum all the signals.**\n\nTo get the total number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we sum the signals from all the distinct parts of the molecule.\n\n*   From core `-CH3` groups: 1\n*   From linker `-CH2-` groups: 2\n*   From the three equivalent 'R' groups: 9\n\nTotal Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of the molecule.\n\nFinal list of signals:\n1. Ar-CH3 (9H)\n2. Ar-CHa- (3H)\n3. Ar-CHb- (3H)\n4. R-H3 (3H)\n5. R-H4 (3H)\n6. R-H5exo (3H)\n7. R-H5endo (3H)\n8. R-H6exo (3H)\n9. R-H6endo (3H)\n10. R-C7-CH3 (9H)\n11. R-C8-CH3a (9H)\n12. R-C8-CH3b (9H)\n\n<<<H>>>"
