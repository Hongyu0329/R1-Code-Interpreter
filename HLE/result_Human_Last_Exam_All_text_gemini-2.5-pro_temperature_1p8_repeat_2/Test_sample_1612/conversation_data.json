    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\n\nThe most common \"Triple Crown\" in baseball refers to the batting Triple Crown. A player achieves this feat by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive statistics in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List All Winning Seasons and Players\n\nTo find the total number of winners, we need to list every instance of the Triple Crown being won in MLB history. This includes the American League (AL), the National League (NL), and the American Association (AA), which is recognized as a major league for the period it existed.\n\nHere is a complete chronological list of each time the batting Triple Crown was won:\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, National League)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, National League)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, American League)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, American League)\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, National League)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, National League)\n8.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, National League)\n9.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, National League)\n10. **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, American League)\n11. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, American League)\n12. **Joe Medwick** (1937, National League)\n13. **Ted Williams** (1942, American League)\n14. **Ted Williams** (1947, American League)\n15. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, American League)\n16. **Frank Robinson** (1966, American League)\n17. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, American League)\n18. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, American League)\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Distinctions\n\n*   **Batting vs. Pitching:** The question implicitly refers to the batting Triple Crown, which is rarer and more famous than the pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in Wins, ERA, and Strikeouts). The analysis focuses on the batters.\n*   **Winners vs. Wins:** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., unique players), not the total number of times the feat has been accomplished. As seen in the list above, two players have won it twice.\n*   **League Specific:** The Triple Crown is a league-specific award. A player only needs to lead their own league (AL or NL), not all of MLB, in the three categories.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Unique Winners\n\nNow we will count the number of individual players from the list in Step 2. We must be careful not to double-count players who won the award multiple times.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (won twice, counted as one winner)\n8.  Chuck Klein\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. **Ted Williams** (won twice, counted as one winner)\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting these unique individuals gives a total of 16 players.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of MLB history, there have been 16 different players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
