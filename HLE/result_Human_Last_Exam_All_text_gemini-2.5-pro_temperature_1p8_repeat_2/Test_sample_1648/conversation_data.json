    "Answering the question: What is the largest natural number n such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero?\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the ring and the K-groups in question.**\n    The ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. Since $27=3^3$, this is the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ with $p=3$ (an odd prime) and $k=3$.\n    We are looking for the algebraic K-groups $K_{2n}(R)$ for natural numbers $n$. The K-groups $K_m(R)$ for $m \\ge 1$ are known to be finite abelian groups.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the K-groups.**\n    Any finite abelian group can be decomposed into a direct sum of its primary components. So, for each $n$, we can write:\n    $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{q \\neq 3} K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)}$\n    where $G_{(p)}$ denotes the $p$-primary part of an abelian group $G$.\n    The group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero if and only if at least one of its primary components is nonzero.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the 3-primary component.**\n    The $p$-primary parts of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ have been computed, most notably by Hesselholt and Madsen. A key result from their work (e.g., in their 1997 Acta Mathematica paper \"On the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$\") is:\n    *For an odd prime $p$, the $p$-primary torsion subgroup of $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is zero for all positive even integers $m$.*\n    In our case, $p=3$ is an odd prime. We are interested in the groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ for natural numbers $n$. For $n \\ge 1$, the index $m=2n$ is a positive even integer. Therefore, the 3-primary part is zero:\n    $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the $q$-primary components for $q \\neq 3$.**\n    To analyze the prime-to-$p$ torsion, we use the long exact sequence in K-theory associated with the ring homomorphism $\\pi: \\mathbb{Z}/p^k \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p$. The kernel of this map is the ideal $I = p(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) = (p)/(p^k)$, which is a nilpotent ideal.\n    The long exact sequence is:\n    $ \\dots \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k, I) \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_*} K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p) \\to K_{m-1}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k, I) \\to \\dots $\n    A fundamental result, due to Gabber and Suslin, states that for a ring $A$ in which a prime $p$ is nilpotent (which is true for $A = \\mathbb{Z}/p^k$), the relative K-groups $K_m(A,J)$ are $p$-torsion groups for any ideal $J$.\n    Therefore, the relative groups $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27, (3)/(27))$ are 3-torsion groups.\n    When we consider the $q$-primary component of this sequence for a prime $q \\neq 3$, the relative K-groups vanish, i.e., $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27, (3)/(27))_{(q)} = 0$. The long exact sequence breaks into short exact sequences:\n    $ 0 \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)} \\to K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3)_{(q)} \\to 0 $\n    This implies an isomorphism:\n    $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)} \\cong K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/3)_{(q)}$ for any prime $q \\neq 3$.\n    We apply this to our case with $m=2n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n    $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)_{(q)}$.\n\n5.  **K-groups of the finite field $\\mathbb{Z}/3$.**\n    The algebraic K-groups of finite fields were famously computed by Daniel Quillen. His results include:\n    *For any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the K-groups $K_m(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ are zero for all positive even integers $m$.*\n    Applying this to our case with the field $\\mathbb{Z}/3$:\n    $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    Since the group itself is zero, all its primary components must be zero. Thus, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3)_{(q)} = 0$ for any prime $q$.\n    This means $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)} = 0$ for all $q \\neq 3$ and $n \\ge 1$.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the results for $n \\ge 1$.**\n    From Step 3, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n    From Step 5, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(q)} = 0$ for all primes $q \\neq 3$ and $n \\ge 1$.\n    Since all primary components of the finite abelian group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ are zero, the group itself must be zero.\n    So, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n7.  **Consider the case n=0.**\n    The question asks for the largest *natural number* $n$. Depending on convention, \"natural numbers\" can be $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ or $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. Let's check the case $n=0$.\n    For $n=0$, we consider the group $K_{2(0)}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n    The $K_0$ group of a commutative ring $R$ is the Grothendieck group of the monoid of finitely generated projective $R$-modules.\n    The ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is a local ring (its only maximal ideal is $(3)/(27)$). For any local ring, every finitely generated projective module is free.\n    This implies that the isomorphism classes of f.g. projective modules are just $\\{0, R, R^2, R^3, \\dots\\}$. The Grothendieck group construction gives an isomorphism $K_0(R) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, defined by $[R^k] \\mapsto k$.\n    Thus, $K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is not the zero group, $K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    We found that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero for $n=0$, and $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    The set of natural numbers $n$ for which the group is nonzero is $\\{0\\}$ (assuming natural numbers include 0). The problem asks for the *largest* such natural number. The existence of a largest number suggests the set of such $n$ is non-empty and finite. Our result aligns with this.\n    The largest number in the set $\\{0\\}$ is 0."
