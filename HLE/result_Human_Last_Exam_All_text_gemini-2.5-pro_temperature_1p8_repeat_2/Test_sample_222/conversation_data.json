    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, for two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question\nThe phrase \"Find 4-point DFT for sequence {...}\" where the sequence has 8 points is non-standard. The standard mathematical interpretation is to create a 4-point sequence by aliasing the 8-point sequence in the time domain, and then compute its DFT.\nThis aliased 4-point sequence, let's call it `y'(n)`, is defined as:\n`y'(n) = y(n) + y(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, the goal is to calculate `Y'(k) = DFT{y'(n)}`.\n\n### Step 3: Use DFT Properties to Find a Simpler Solution Path\nWe can use a property of the DFT known as the Decimation-In-Frequency (DIF) property. This property relates the DFT of the time-aliased sequence `y'(n)` to the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The property states:\n`Y'(k) = DFT{y'(n)} = DFT{y(n) + y(n+4)} = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThis means the 4-point DFT we are looking for is simply the set of even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`. Our task now is to find `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n### Step 4: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`\nThe structure of our sequence `y(n)` is that the even-indexed terms come from `x(n)` and the odd-indexed terms come from `h(n)`.\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nThis is the standard setup for the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT algorithm. The relationship between the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` and the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` is:\n$Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)$\nwhere $W_N = e^{-j2\\pi/N}$ is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Required DFT Components\nWe need to calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n*   **Calculate Y(0):**\n    $Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0)$\n    From the given data, `X(0) = 1` and `H(0) = 0`. $W_8^0 = 1$.\n    $Y(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1$.\n\n*   **Calculate Y(2):**\n    $Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 H(2)$\n    From the given data, `X(2) = -1` and `H(2) = 1`.\n    The twiddle factor is $W_8^2 = e^{-j2\\pi(2)/8} = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j$.\n    $Y(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j$.\n\n*   **Calculate Y(4):**\n    $Y(4) = X(4 \\pmod 4) + W_8^4 H(4 \\pmod 4) = X(0) + W_8^4 H(0)$\n    From the given data, `X(0) = 1` and `H(0) = 0`.\n    The twiddle factor is $W_8^4 = e^{-j2\\pi(4)/8} = e^{-j\\pi} = -1$.\n    $Y(4) = 1 + (-1)(0) = 1$.\n\n*   **Calculate Y(6):**\n    $Y(6) = X(6 \\pmod 4) + W_8^6 H(6 \\pmod 4) = X(2) + W_8^6 H(2)$\n    From the given data, `X(2) = -1` and `H(2) = 1`.\n    The twiddle factor is $W_8^6 = e^{-j2\\pi(6)/8} = e^{-j3\\pi/2} = j$.\n    $Y(6) = -1 + (j)(1) = -1 + j$.\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer\nThe desired 4-point DFT is `Y'(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`.\nSubstituting the calculated values, we get:\n`Y'(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
