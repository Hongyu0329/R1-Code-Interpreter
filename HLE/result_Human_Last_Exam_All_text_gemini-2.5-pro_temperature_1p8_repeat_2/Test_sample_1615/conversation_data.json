    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has a specific number of vertices ($n=12345$) and is not a complete graph.\n\n*   **Graph G:** A simple graph (no loops or multiple edges).\n*   **Number of vertices, n:** 12345.\n*   **Proper vertex coloring:** Assigning a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   **Chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$:** The minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of G.\n*   **Constraint:** The graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph, $K_{12345}$.\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum value that $\\chi(G)$ can take, subject to these conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Chromatic Number of a Complete Graph:** For a complete graph $K_n$ with $n$ vertices, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, each vertex needs a unique color. The chromatic number is $\\chi(K_n) = n$. For this problem, if the graph were $K_{12345}$, it would need 12345 colors.\n\n2.  **The \"Not Complete Graph\" Constraint:** This is the most critical piece of information. A graph $G$ is not a complete graph if there exists at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are **not** connected by an edge.\n\n3.  **Strategy for finding a maximum value:** To prove that a value $X$ is the maximum possible value for a quantity, we need to do two things:\n    a. Show that the quantity can never be greater than $X$ (establish an **upper bound**).\n    b. Show that the quantity can be equal to $X$ for at least one specific case (show the bound is **achievable**).\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Part A: Establishing the Upper Bound**\n\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n = 12345$ vertices, such that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\n1.  Because $G$ is not a complete graph, by definition, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between $u$ and $v$).\n\n2.  Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper vertex coloring without violating the coloring rules.\n\n3.  We can devise a coloring scheme that uses at most $n-1$ colors. For instance, assign a single color (say, Color 1) to both $u$ and $v$. Then, color the remaining $n-2$ vertices. In the worst-case scenario, each of these remaining vertices requires a new, distinct color. This would take $n-2$ more colors.\n\n4.  The total number of colors used in this scheme is $1$ (for $u$ and $v$) + $(n-2)$ (for the rest) = $n-1$.\n\n5.  This shows that any graph on $n$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the chromatic number must satisfy $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n6.  For our specific case, $n = 12345$. So, the maximum possible number of colors is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n**Part B: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow we need to show that there actually exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not complete, and requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\n1.  Let's construct such a graph. A simple way is to start with the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and remove a single edge. Let's call this new graph $G^*$. Let the removed edge be the one that connected vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\n2.  $G^*$ has 12345 vertices and is not the complete graph (since we removed an edge), so it satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n3.  Now, let's find the chromatic number of $G^*$, i.e., $\\chi(G^*)$. Consider the subgraph of $G^*$ formed by all vertices *except* $u$. This subgraph has $12344$ vertices and contains all the edges from the original $K_{12345}$ between them. Thus, this subgraph is a complete graph on 12344 vertices, a $K_{12344}$ clique.\n\n4.  To color this $K_{12344}$ clique, we need at least 12344 distinct colors.\n\n5.  So, for the entire graph $G^*$, we know that $\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$.\n\n6.  From Part A, we know that since $G^*$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than or equal to 12344. So, $\\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$.\n\n7.  Combining these two facts ($\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$ and $\\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$), we can conclude that $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  Any graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph can be colored with at most **12344** colors.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph (namely, $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed) that requires exactly **12344** colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that we need to colour the vertices of G properly is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
