    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane symmetry groups, also known as 2D crystallographic groups. They describe all the ways a pattern can be repeated in a plane using translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n*   **Point Group:** For a given wallpaper group, the point group is the set of all symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the plane fixed. It describes the symmetry of the pattern around a point, ignoring the translational symmetry.\n*   **Order of a Group:** This is simply the number of distinct symmetry operations (elements) in the group.\n\nThe question asks us to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group with exactly two elements (order 2).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders**\n\nThe Crystallographic Restriction Theorem limits the rotational symmetries in a crystal lattice to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold rotations. The 10 possible point groups in two dimensions are:\n\n| Hermann-Mauguin (International) Notation | Schönflies Notation | Order | Symmetry Elements                        |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| 1                                          | C₁                  | 1     | Identity only                            |\n| **2**                                      | **C₂**              | **2** | **Identity, 180° rotation**              |\n| **m**                                      | **Cₛ**              | **2** | **Identity, one reflection line**        |\n| 2mm                                        | C₂ᵥ                 | 4     | 180° rotation, two reflection lines      |\n| 3                                          | C₃                  | 3     | 120° rotations                           |\n| 3m                                         | C₃ᵥ                 | 6     | 120° rotations, three reflection lines   |\n| 4                                          | C₄                  | 4     | 90° rotations                            |\n| 4mm                                        | C₄ᵥ                 | 8     | 90° rotations, four reflection lines     |\n| 6                                          | C₆                  | 6     | 60° rotations                            |\n| 6mm                                        | C₆ᵥ                 | 12    | 60° rotations, six reflection lines      |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that there are two point groups of order 2: point group **2** (C₂) and point group **m** (Cₛ).\n\n**Step 3: List the wallpaper groups associated with each point group of order 2**\n\nNow, we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones belong to the point groups '2' and 'm'.\n\n*   **Point Group 2 (C₂):**\n    This point group contains only a 2-fold (180°) rotation. There is exactly one wallpaper group that has this point group:\n    1.  **p2**: This group's symmetries consist of translations and multiple centers of 2-fold rotation.\n\n*   **Point Group m (Cₛ):**\n    This point group contains only a single reflection axis. A \"glide reflection\" is a combination of a reflection and a translation parallel to the reflection line. The \"point\" part of a glide reflection is the reflection itself. Therefore, wallpaper groups whose symmetries (other than translation) are reflections *or* glide reflections will have the point group 'm'. There are three such wallpaper groups:\n    2.  **pm**: Symmetries include reflection lines.\n    3.  **pg**: Symmetries include glide-reflection lines (but no simple reflection lines).\n    4.  **cm**: Symmetries include both reflection lines and glide-reflection lines, arranged on a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the results**\n\nWe count the number of wallpaper groups identified in Step 3.\n*   Number of groups with point group '2' = 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group 'm' = 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n\nThe total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is the sum of these counts.\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 4 wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
