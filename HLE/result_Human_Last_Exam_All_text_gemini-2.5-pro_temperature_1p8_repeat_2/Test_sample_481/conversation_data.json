    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers imprinted on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to identify the specific numerical imprints that differentiate Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsules from their 20mg fluoxetine capsules. The response must adhere to several constraints: do not mention color, the word \"PLIVA\", or size.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Multiple Imprints:** Pharmaceutical manufacturers sometimes use different imprints for the same product. This can be due to production at different facilities, changes in branding, or the acquisition of other pharmaceutical companies. Teva Pharmaceuticals has acquired other companies (like Pliva), so products may carry imprints from the original manufacturer.\n*   **Imprint Components:** Pill imprints can consist of letters, numbers, or logos. The question specifically asks for the \"different numbers.\"\n*   **Verification:** Information should be verified using reliable pharmaceutical databases like the FDA's National Drug Code (NDC) Directory or Drugs.com's Pill Identifier tool.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Information - Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule:**\n*   A search in pharmaceutical databases for \"Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule\" reveals two primary imprints currently or previously associated with the Teva brand.\n*   **Imprint Set 1:** The number imprinted on the capsule is **647**.\n*   **Imprint Set 2:** The number imprinted on the capsule is **9231**. This imprint is often accompanied by the letters \"TEVA\", but the question asks only for the number.\n\n**4. Acquiring the Information - Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule:**\n*   A similar search for \"Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule\" also reveals two corresponding imprints.\n*   **Imprint Set 1:** The number imprinted on the capsule is **648**.\n*   **Imprint Set 2:** The number imprinted on the capsule is **9232**.\n\n**5. Comparing and Finalizing the Answer:**\nBy comparing the information for both dosages, we can identify the different numbers used for identification.\n\n*   In one version, the 10mg capsule is identified by the number **647**, while the 20mg capsule is identified by the number **648**.\n*   In another version, the 10mg capsule is identified by the number **9231**, while the 20mg capsule is identified by the number **9232**.\n\nThe final answer should state these differentiating numbers for each dosage.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is **647**, while the number on the 20mg capsule is **648**. In an alternate version, the number on the 10mg capsule is **9231**, and the number on the 20mg capsule is **9232**.>>>"
