    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct Christian theologian.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific Christian theologian.\n    *   **Core Action:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a unique vocabulary or conceptual framework, not just a general belief.\n    *   **Core Concept:** The terminology must describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This is key; the framework shouldn't just be about miracles *violating* laws, but about the potential for the laws themselves to be altered or operate differently under certain conditions.\n    *   **Application 1:** The Virgin Birth of Jesus. This is a classic example of a miracle, an event contrary to the normal course of biology.\n    *   **Application 2:** Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall. This refers to the theological idea that Adam and Eve's sin had cosmic consequences, changing the physical reality of creation (e.g., introducing death, pain in childbirth, thorns and thistles).\n    *   **Temporal Element:** The question asks who *first* developed this. This points towards an early, foundational figure in Christian thought.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas had a highly developed system of law (*eternal*, *natural*, *divine*, *human*) and a detailed classification of miracles. For Aquinas, a miracle was an event *praeter ordinem totius naturae creatae* (outside the order of all created nature). The Virgin Birth is a prime example. However, regarding the Fall, Aquinas's view was that humanity lost \"preternatural gifts\" (like immortality) and was thus returned to its purely natural state, which includes death and suffering. In this view, the fundamental laws of nature *did not change*; rather, a supernatural protection was removed. This does not perfectly match the \"changes in the laws of nature\" criterion for the Fall.\n\n    *   **John Calvin / Martin Luther (16th Century):** The Reformers strongly believed in God's sovereignty over nature and the cosmic effects of the Fall. They affirmed the Virgin Birth as a direct act of God's power. They believed the curse on the ground was real. However, they were generally less concerned with developing a new, systematic philosophical terminology for the *mechanics* of these changes, focusing more on the theological and soteriological implications. They built on earlier thought rather than being the *first* to develop the terminology.\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** As one of the most influential early Church Fathers, Augustine wrote extensively on creation, providence, miracles, and the Fall. He is a very strong candidate.\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of Augustine's Terminology and Concepts:**\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing Different \"Orders.\"** Augustine was careful not to say God acts \"against nature\" (*contra naturam*), because God is the author of nature. Instead, he developed a more nuanced view. He argued a miracle is not contrary to nature *as a whole*, but only contrary to the *usual course of nature as we know it* (*contra consuetudinem naturae*). This is a crucial distinction.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** *Ordo naturalis* (the natural order established by God), *consuetudo naturae* (the custom or usual course of nature), and *voluntas Dei* (the will of God), which is the ultimate law and cause of all things.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Explaining Novelty in Nature.** To explain how new or seemingly impossible things could happen, Augustine proposed the concept of *rationes seminales* or *causales* (seminal or causal reasons). He believed God embedded hidden potentialities within creation from the very beginning. Miracles, then, are not new creations *ex nihilo* but the activation by God of these pre-existing potentials at a specific time.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Application to the Virgin Birth.** The Virgin Birth fits Augustine's framework perfectly. It is an event that goes against the *consuetudo naturae* (the normal custom of procreation), but it happens by the direct *voluntas Dei* (will of God), perhaps by activating a unique potentiality (*ratio seminalis*) placed in creation for this very purpose. It is not \"unnatural\" from the perspective of God, the author of nature.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Application to the Fall.** Augustine's doctrine of the Fall posits a fundamental change in the state of humanity and its environment. Before the Fall, the first humans had bodies that were not subject to death and decay, conditioned on their obedience. After the Fall, death entered the world, and curses like pain in childbirth and the toil of agriculture became part of human experience. This represents a fundamental alteration in the *cursus naturae* (the course of nature) for humanity. The \"laws\" governing human biology and its interaction with the world were changed by divine judgment. Augustineâ€™s framework accounts for a pre-Fall natural order and a different, post-Fall natural order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major theologian to develop a sophisticated and specialized set of terms and concepts (*ordo naturalis*, *consuetudo naturae*, *rationes seminales*) to explain how the operation of nature can be understood to change. His system is directly applicable to describing both the Virgin Birth (as a unique event outside the usual *custom* of nature) and the altered state of the world after the Fall (a change in the very *course* of nature for humanity). No earlier figure presented such a systematic explanation, and later figures like Aquinas built upon or reacted to his foundational work.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
