    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Key Terms**\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\":** This refers to a human figure from history (in this case, biblical history) who is venerated for their holiness and considered a saint in major Christian traditions. This definition will exclude:\n    *   **Angels:** Figures like Michael and Gabriel are saints but are angels, not historical human figures.\n    *   **Deities:** Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, is the object of worship and is theologically considered above the category of \"saint.\"\n    *   **Antagonists:** Figures like Cain or Nimrod are historical but are not saints.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\":** The specific proper name of the individual (e.g., \"Moses,\" \"David\") must appear in Milton's text. Referring to someone by a title (\"the Prophet\") or relationship (\"his Brother\") does not count.\n\n### **Step 2: Locating the Relevant Sections of *Paradise Lost***\n\nMost historical figures are mentioned in **Books XI and XII**. In these books, the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of the future of humanity, from the time of his expulsion from Eden to the Second Coming. We will focus our search here, while also considering the rest of the poem.\n\n### **Step 3: Examining the Text for Named Individuals**\n\nWe will now go through the poem, primarily Books XI and XII, to identify named historical humans and then determine if they are considered saints.\n\n1.  **Adam and Eve:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes, they are the protagonists and are named throughout the entire epic.\n    *   **Historical Saints?** Yes. As the first humans and the progenitors of mankind, they are historical within the biblical narrative. Both are venerated as saints in Eastern Christianity and are on the calendar of saints.\n    *   **Count: 2** (Adam, Eve)\n\n2.  **Abel:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Michael describes the story of Cain and Abel (Book XI, lines 429-460). Milton names Cain (\"This stirr’d in CAIN envy…\") but refers to Abel only as \"his Brother\" and \"the righteous.\"\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes, Abel is revered as the first martyr and a saint.\n    *   **Named?** No. The name \"Abel\" does not appear in the text.\n    *   **Count: 0**\n\n3.  **Enoch:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. Michael describes him: \"Of him the seav’nth from Adam, ENOCH call’d...\" (Book XI, line 661).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. He is a righteous patriarch who \"walked with God\" and was taken to Heaven without dying. He is venerated as a saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (Enoch)\n\n4.  **Noah:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. \"But he his Brothers view’d with equall eye, NOAH, found The only Son of Light in a dark Age\" (Book XI, lines 807-809).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. As the righteous man who saved life on Earth from the Flood, he is venerated as a saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (Noah)\n\n5.  **Abraham:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. \"his Name, The Father of many Nations call’d, I ABRAHAM;\" (Book XII, lines 139-140).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. He is a foundational patriarch of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and is venerated as a saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (Abraham)\n\n6.  **Moses:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. \"Deliverance for his people, who by promise found their call from AEgypt, by the hand of MOSES...\" (Book XII, lines 239-241).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. The great lawgiver of Israel, he is revered as a prophet and saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (Moses)\n\n7.  **Joshua:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. Michael prophesies a leader to bring the Israelites into Canaan: \"him JOSHUA, whom the Gentiles JESUS call,\" (Book XII, line 310).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. As the successor to Moses, he is a major figure and considered a saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (Joshua)\n\n8.  **David:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Yes. The Messiah is prophesied to come \"of Royal Stock of DAVID...\" (Book XII, lines 360-361).\n    *   **Historical Saint?** Yes. The great king of Israel is revered as a prophet and saint.\n    *   **Count: 1** (David)\n\n9.  **Solomon:**\n    *   **Mentioned?** He is referred to clearly as David's \"Son\" who will build the temple (Book XII, lines 331-334), but the name \"Solomon\" is not used.\n    *   **Count: 0**\n\n10. **New Testament Figures (Mary, John the Baptist, Apostles):**\n    *   **Mentioned?** Michael refers to a \"Virgin\" mother, a \"great Prophet\" harbinger, and the work of the apostles, but he does not mention **Mary**, **John the Baptist**, **Peter**, **Paul**, or any other New Testament saint *by name*.\n    *   **Count: 0**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum up the confirmed historical saints mentioned by name:\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Enoch\n4.  Noah\n5.  Abraham\n6.  Moses\n7.  Joshua\n8.  David\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
