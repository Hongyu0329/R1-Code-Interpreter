    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of $f$**:\n    The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, which means it is injective (one-to-one). Let's see what this implies for $f$.\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of $f$**:\n    A fundamental theorem in real analysis states that any continuous and injective function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotone. That is, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nThis allows us to partition the set of solutions $S$ into two disjoint subsets:\n*   $S_I$: the set of strictly increasing solutions.\n*   $S_D$: the set of strictly decreasing solutions.\nThe total cardinality will be $|S| = |S_I| + |S_D|$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the strictly increasing solutions ($S_I$)\n\nLet's assume $f \\in S_I$, so $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n1.  **Relationship between $f(x)$ and $x$**:\n    For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, either $f(x) > x$, $f(x) < x$, or $f(x) = x$.\n    *   If $f(x_0) = x_0$ for some $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ never intersect, so there is no real solution to this equation. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n    *   Since $f(x)-x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it must have the same sign for all $x$. So, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    *   Let's check these two possibilities:\n        *   Case A: $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, applying $f$ to the inequality gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This implies $\\exp(x) < x$ for all $x$. This is false (e.g., for $x=0$, $e^0=1$ which is not less than 0). So this case is impossible.\n        *   Case B: $f(x) > x$ for all $x$. Applying the increasing function $f$ gives $f(f(x)) > f(x)$. This means $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$, which implies $\\exp(x) > x$. This is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This case is possible.\n    *   So, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Constructing an increasing solution**:\n    We can construct such functions, which demonstrates their existence and allows us to count them. The main idea is that the choice of the function on a \"fundamental\" interval determines the entire function.\n    *   Let $a_0$ be any real number. Let $a_1 = f(a_0)$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $a_1 > a_0$. Then $f(a_1) = f(f(a_0)) = \\exp(a_0)$. Let's call this $a_2 = \\exp(a_0)$.\n    *   Now, choose $a_0 = 0$. We have $f(0) = a_1 > 0$, and $f(a_1) = \\exp(0) = 1$. Let's call $f(0) = c$. So $c>0$ and $f(c)=1$.\n    *   Also, consider $f(1) = f(f(c)) = \\exp(c)$.\n    *   We can define $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$ by choosing an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ such that $h(0)=c$ and $h(c)=1$. Let $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [0,c]$.\n    *   This choice determines $f$ on the interval $[c, 1]$. For any $y \\in [c, 1]$, there is a unique $x \\in [0, c]$ such that $y = h(x)$, so $x=h^{-1}(y)$. We must define $f(y)$ such that $f(y) = f(h(x)) = f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. Therefore, for $y \\in [c, 1]$, we define $f(y) = \\exp(h^{-1}(y))$. This function is continuous and strictly increasing from $[c,1]$ to $[\\exp(0), \\exp(c)]=[1, e^c]$.\n    *   This process can be extended to define $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$. The crucial point is the freedom we have in the initial step.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of $S_I$**:\n    Our construction depends on choosing a continuous, strictly increasing function $h$ from one compact interval, $[0,c]$, to another, $[c,1]$. Let's find the cardinality of such functions $h$.\n    *   A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset, like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Let's fix $c=1/2$ for simplicity. We need to choose a strictly increasing continuous function $h:[0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$.\n    *   Let $\\{q_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers in $(0, 1/2)$.\n    *   To define $h$, we need to assign values $h(q_n)$ in $(1/2, 1)$ while preserving the order. For each $q_n$, the set of available values for $h(q_n)$ (constrained by the values chosen for other rationals) forms a non-empty open interval. Any such interval contains a continuum of points.\n    *   The number of ways to make this choice is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}|$).\n    *   More formally, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. The subset of these that are strictly increasing homeomorphisms is also of cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since we can choose from a continuum of functions $h$ to define just one solution $f$, the set of strictly increasing solutions $S_I$ has at least cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set of solutions $S_I$ is a subset, so its cardinality cannot be greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, by the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of strictly increasing solutions is $|S_I| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the strictly decreasing solutions ($S_D$)\n\nNow, let's assume $f \\in S_D$, so $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n1.  **Existence**: The composition of two strictly decreasing functions is a strictly increasing function. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is possible for $f(f(x))$ to equal $\\exp(x)$. Unlike the increasing case, it is much harder to immediately deduce properties of decreasing solutions. However, their existence has been proven.\n\n2.  **Cardinality of $S_D$**:\n    While the technical details are more involved, a similar argument for construction and cardinality can be made.\n    *   A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point for the equation $f(x)=-x$. (This can be seen by applying the IVT to the function $g(x) = f(x)+x$, which is continuous and goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$). Let this point be $b$, so $f(b)=-b$.\n    *   A construction for a decreasing solution $f$ can be based on choosing an arbitrary continuous, strictly decreasing function on a fundamental interval, such as $[b, -b]$ (if $b < 0$), satisfying certain boundary conditions derived from the functional equation.\n    *   Just as in the increasing case, this freedom of choice for the initial function segment is what generates a large number of solutions. The number of ways to choose a suitable decreasing function on a compact interval is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the set of strictly decreasing solutions, $S_D$, also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe set of all continuous solutions $S$ is the disjoint union of the set of strictly increasing solutions $S_I$ and the set of strictly decreasing solutions $S_D$.\nThe cardinality of the total set is:\n$|S| = |S_I| + |S_D| = \\mathfrak{c} + \\mathfrak{c}$\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{c}$ is a transfinite cardinal, the sum is equal to the larger of the two, which is just $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n$|S| = \\mathfrak{c}$\n\nThe cardinality of the set is the cardinality of the continuum."
