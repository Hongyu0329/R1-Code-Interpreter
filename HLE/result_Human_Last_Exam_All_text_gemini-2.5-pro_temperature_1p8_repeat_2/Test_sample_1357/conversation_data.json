    "This problem asks for the number of possible combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve `C`, under the key assumption that its Jacobian variety `J(C)` has good reduction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Main Condition\nThe central piece of information is that the Jacobian of the curve, `J(C)`, has **good reduction**. According to a fundamental theorem by Raynaud, which extends the Criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich, an abelian variety `A` has good reduction if and only if the `l`-adic Tate module `V_l(A)` is unramified for any prime `l` different from the characteristic of the residue field. For a curve `C`, this condition on its Jacobian `J(C)` has a direct geometric consequence on the stable reduction of `C`.\n\nLet `C_k` be the special fiber of a stable model of `C`. `C_k` is a stable nodal curve of arithmetic genus 4. The structure of `C_k` is encoded by its **dual graph**, `G(C_k)`. The vertices of this graph correspond to the irreducible components of `C_k`, and the edges correspond to the nodes where these components intersect.\n\nThe theory of reduction of abelian varieties states that the toric rank of the semi-abelian identity component of the special fiber of the Néron model of `J(C)` is equal to the first Betti number `b_1(G(C_k))` of the dual graph of the stable reduction of `C`. The condition that `J(C)` has good reduction means its special fiber is a pure abelian variety, which implies this toric rank is zero.\n\nTherefore, `b_1(G(C_k)) = 0`.\nSince `C_k` is connected, its dual graph `G(C_k)` must be connected. A connected graph with `b_1 = 0` is a **tree**.\n\n### Step 2: The Genus Formula\nFor a nodal curve `C_k` with `m` irreducible components `C_1, ..., C_m` of geometric genera `g_1, ..., g_m` and `δ` nodes, the arithmetic genus `g` is given by the formula:\n`g = Σ g_i + δ - m + 1`\n\nWe know `g = 4` and that `G(C_k)` is a tree. For a tree with `m` vertices, the number of edges is `δ = m-1`. Substituting this into the formula:\n`4 = Σ g_i + (m-1) - m + 1`\n`4 = Σ g_i`\n\nThis simplifies the problem immensely: we need to find all possible ways to form a stable curve of genus 4 whose components have genera that sum to 4 and whose dual graph is a tree.\n\n### Step 3: The Stability Condition\nA nodal curve `C_k` is stable if, for each of its irreducible components `C_i` (of geometric genus `g_i`), the following condition holds:\n`2g_i - 2 + n_i > 0`\nwhere `n_i` is the number of special points on the component (in this case, the nodes). In the dual graph `G(C_k)`, `n_i` is the degree of the vertex corresponding to `C_i`.\n\nThis condition imposes constraints based on the genus `g_i`:\n*   If `g_i ≥ 2`, it's always satisfied for `n_i ≥ 1`.\n*   If `g_i = 1`, it requires `n_i > 0`, which is true for any component of a connected curve.\n*   If `g_i = 0` (i.e., the component is a rational curve `P^1`), it requires `-2 + n_i > 0`, which means `n_i ≥ 3`. A rational component must be attached to the rest of the curve at 3 or more points.\n\n### Step 4: Enumerating the Types\nWe classify the types by partitioning the number 4 into a sum of non-negative integers `g_i`, and for each partition, we find all possible tree structures that satisfy the stability conditions. A \"type\" corresponds to a distinct labeled graph (where labels are the genera), considered up to isomorphism.\n\n**Part A: Partitions into positive integers (`g_i ≥ 1`)**\nThese configurations are always stable since `2g_i - 2 + n_i > 0` for `g_i ≥ 1` and `n_i ≥ 1`.\n\n1.  **Partition {4}**: `m=1` component. `g_1=4`. The dual graph is a single vertex. This is a smooth curve of genus 4.\n    *   **1 type**\n2.  **Partition {3, 1}**: `m=2` components. `g_1=3, g_2=1`. The only tree on 2 vertices is a single edge.\n    *   **1 type**\n3.  **Partition {2, 2}**: `m=2` components. `g_1=2, g_2=2`. Same single-edge tree.\n    *   **1 type**\n4.  **Partition {2, 1, 1}**: `m=3` components. The only tree is a line `v_1-v_2-v_3`. We must assign genera {2, 1, 1} to the vertices.\n    *   Case (a): `g(v_2)=2` (central). Leaves `g(v_1)=g(v_3)=1`. This is one type.\n    *   Case (b): `g(v_1)=2` (end). `g(v_2)=g(v_3)=1`. This is a distinct type.\n    *   **2 types**\n5.  **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}**: `m=4` components. There are two trees on 4 vertices.\n    *   Case (a): Line graph `P_4`. Unique assignment as all genera are 1.\n    *   Case (b): Star graph `K_{1,3}`. Unique assignment.\n    *   **2 types**\n\n**Part B: Partitions involving `g_i = 0`**\nAny component with `g_i=0` must correspond to a vertex in the dual tree with degree `n_i ≥ 3`.\n\n6.  **Partition {2, 1, 1, 0}**: `m=4` components. The dual tree must have a vertex of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   The only tree on 4 vertices with such a vertex is the star graph `K_{1,3}`, which has one central vertex of degree 3. The `g=0` component must be at the center. The genera {2, 1, 1} are assigned to the three leaf vertices. Since the leaves are equivalent under graph automorphism, this gives one unique configuration.\n    *   **1 type**\n\n7.  **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1, 0}**: `m=5` components. We need a tree on 5 vertices with a vertex of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   There are two such non-isomorphic trees:\n    *   Case (a): Star graph `K_{1,4}`. It has a central vertex of degree 4. The `g=0` component goes here. The four `g=1` components go on the leaves. This is one unique configuration.\n    *   Case (b): \"Fork\" graph (a `P_4` with a leaf attached to an interior vertex). This graph has one vertex of degree 3. The `g=0` component must go here. The other four `g=1` components are placed on the remaining vertices. This gives another unique configuration.\n    *   **2 types**\n\n8.  **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0}**: `m=6` components. We have two `g=0` components, so the tree must have two vertices of degree ≥ 3.\n    *   The unique tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree 3 is the \"dumbbell\" graph: `v_1-v_2(-v_5)-v_3(-v_6)-v_4`. The vertices `v_2` and `v_3` have degree 3. The two `g=0` components must be placed there. The four `g=1` components are placed on the four leaf vertices. This gives a single, unique configuration.\n    *   **1 type**\n\nNo other partitions yield valid stable configurations. For instance, any partition with three or more `g=0` components is impossible to realize, as the required sum of degrees in the dual tree becomes too large. Partitions like `{3,1,0}` are impossible because the tree on 3 vertices (`P_3`) has no vertex of degree 3.\n\n### Final Count\nSumming the number of types from each valid configuration:\n*   From partitions with `g_i > 0`: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 types.\n*   From partitions with one `g_i=0`: 1 + 2 = 3 types.\n*   From partitions with two `g_i=0`: 1 type.\n\nTotal number of types = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
