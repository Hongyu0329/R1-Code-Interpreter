    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the Coordinate System and the First Cube\nTo analyze the problem, we'll use a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and its sides aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Shift and Position the Second Cube\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Identify the Main Diagonal.**\n    For Cube A positioned as described, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1). The direction of this diagonal is represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\n*   **Careful Point: Interpret the \"Shift by 1/2\".**\n    This phrase can be ambiguous.\n    1.  It could mean the *distance* of the shift is 1/2. In this case, the shift vector **v** would have a length of 1/2, so **v** = (k, k, k) where √(k² + k² + k²) = 1/2, which gives k = 1/(2√3). This leads to a complex, irrational answer.\n    2.  It could mean the *component of the shift along each axis* is 1/2. This gives a shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This vector is \"along the main diagonal\" as its components are equal. This configuration is geometrically significant: the corner of Cube B that was at (0,0,0) moves to (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), which is the exact center of Cube A. This is a common setup in geometry problems and typically leads to a cleaner result. This is the most likely intended meaning.\n\nWe will proceed with the second interpretation. So, Cube B is Cube A shifted by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). A point (x', y', z') is inside Cube B if the original un-shifted point (x' - 1/2, y' - 1/2, z' - 1/2) is within the boundaries of Cube A. This gives us the inequalities for Cube B:\n*   0 ≤ x' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 ≤ y' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 ≤ z' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Volume of Intersection\nThe intersection is the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:**\n    The range for Cube A is [0, 1].\n    The range for Cube B is [1/2, 3/2].\n    The intersection of these two ranges is [1/2, 1].\n\n*   **For the y-axis:**\n    The range for Cube A is [0, 1].\n    The range for Cube B is [1/2, 3/2].\n    The intersection of these two ranges is [1/2, 1].\n\n*   **For the z-axis:**\n    The range for Cube A is [0, 1].\n    The range for Cube B is [1/2, 3/2].\n    The intersection of these two ranges is [1/2, 1].\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Volume\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe side length of this intersection cube is the length of each of these intervals:\n*   Side length = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n*   Volume of Intersection = (1/2)³ = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
