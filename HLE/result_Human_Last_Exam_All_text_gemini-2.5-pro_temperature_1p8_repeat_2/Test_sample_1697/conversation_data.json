    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's deconstruct its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: This is the core structure, consisting of a benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH2).\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) replace the two hydrogen atoms on the nitrogen of the amide group, forming a tertiary amide: -CON(CH2CH3)2. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is attached to the benzene ring at position 3 (meta position relative to the amide group).\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n      CON(Et)2\n      /\n(1)C---C(2)H\n   ||  ||\n(6)CH--C(3)--N(Me)2\n   \\  /\n(5)CH--C(4)H\n```\nThis molecule has several C-H bonds on the aromatic ring, specifically at positions 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Metalation)**\nThe reagents are sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF solvent.\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role is to abstract a proton (deprotonation).\n*   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium cation (Li+). This chelation breaks up sec-BuLi aggregates and increases the basicity of the butyl anion, making the reagent system highly reactive.\n*   This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring directs the deprotonation (lithiation) to a position ortho (adjacent) to itself. The directing group coordinates to the lithium ion, bringing the base close to the ortho proton.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 2:**\n*   **Identify Directing Groups:** The starting material has two potential directing groups (DMGs):\n    1.  The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) at position 1.\n    2.  The dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at position 3.\n*   **Rank Directing Group Strength:** It is crucial to know the relative directing ability of different functional groups. Tertiary amides (-CONR2) are among the most powerful directing groups, significantly stronger than tertiary amines (-NR2). Therefore, the -CONEt2 group will primarily control the position of the reaction.\n*   **Identify Target Protons:** The -CONEt2 group will direct the lithiation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n*   **Determine Regioselectivity:** We must decide whether the deprotonation will occur at C2 or C6.\n    *   The proton at **C2** is ortho to the powerful -CONEt2 group and also ortho to the weaker -NMe2 group. The proximity to two electron-withdrawing groups makes this proton the most acidic one on the ring.\n    *   The proton at **C6** is only ortho to the -CONEt2 group.\n    *   Due to the cooperative directing effect and the higher acidity of the C2 proton, the lithiation will occur selectively at the C2 position.\n\nThis first step produces an aryllithium intermediate where the lithium atom replaces the hydrogen at C2. This position is now a strong nucleophilic carbanion.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Alkylation)**\nThe second reagent is methyl iodide (CH3I).\n*   **Methyl iodide** is an electrophile. The carbon atom is electron-deficient due to the electronegative iodine atom, and iodide (I-) is a good leaving group.\n*   The nucleophilic aryllithium species formed in Step 2 will attack the electrophilic carbon atom of methyl iodide. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 3:**\n*   **Identify Nucleophile and Electrophile:** The aryllithium intermediate is the nucleophile, and methyl iodide is the electrophile.\n*   **Predict the Bond Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond will form between the C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group from methyl iodide. The lithium iodide (LiI) is formed as a byproduct.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\nThe reaction sequence first removes the hydrogen at C2 and then replaces it with a methyl group (-CH3). All other parts of the molecule remain unchanged.\n*   Starting material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final Product: The same structure with a methyl group added at the 2-position.\n\nThe name of the final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nFinal Structure:\n```\n      CON(Et)2\n      /\n(1)C---C(2)-CH3\n   ||  ||\n(6)CH--C(3)--N(Me)2\n   \\  /\n(5)CH--C(4)H\n```\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
