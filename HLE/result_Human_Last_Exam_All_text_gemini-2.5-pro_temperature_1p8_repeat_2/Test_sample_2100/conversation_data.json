    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"a joy-discovering sailor\"**. This points to a historical figure who was an explorer or traveler associated with the sea. The phrasing is poetic, suggesting a pioneering and optimistic spirit.\n*   **Clue 2: Andrei Voznesensky**. This tells us the author of the quote. The source is a poem or work by this famous Russian poet.\n*   **Clue 3: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**. This is a crucial piece of information. It means that for a long time, the burial place of this man was unknown or had been lost.\n*   **Clue 4: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**. This provides a specific time frame for when the mystery of the grave was solved or at least significantly clarified. This period (late 1980s) is associated with glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union, a time when many historical secrets and suppressed facts were revisited.\n*   **The Question:** What is this man's last name?\n\n**Step 2: Connecting the Clues and forming a Hypothesis**\n\n*   The combination of Andrei Voznesensky and a story about a sailor whose grave was lost points directly to his most famous work, the rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"** (\"Юнона и Авось\"). Voznesensky wrote the libretto for this immensely popular production.\n*   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the historical figure **Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov**.\n*   Let's check if Rezanov fits the other clues.\n    *   Was he a \"joy-discovering sailor\"? Yes. Rezanov was a diplomat and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. In 1806, he sailed from Russian Alaska to Spanish California on the ships *Juno* and *Avos* to secure food for the struggling Russian colonies. This voyage and his romantic involvement with Conchita Argüello are the basis of the opera. He was an explorer and a diplomat seeking new opportunities, which fits the poetic description.\n    *   Was his grave lost? Yes. On his return journey across Siberia, Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky (Resurrection) Cathedral. In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral and the cemetery were destroyed, and the exact location of his grave was lost.\n    *   Did the answer emerge in the late 1980s? Yes. Fueled by the popularity of the rock opera, there was a surge of public interest in Rezanov's fate. During the era of glasnost in the late 1980s, historical and archaeological efforts were made in Krasnoyarsk to locate the grave. Although the grave itself was not definitively excavated from under the later construction, the presumed location was identified. This campaign culminated in the re-establishment of a memorial, symbolically \"answering\" Voznesensky's poetic question.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nAll the clues point to one person. The quotes are about the main character of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\" This character was a real historical explorer whose grave was lost during the Soviet era and whose resting place became a subject of renewed interest and research in the late 1980s. This man's name was Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
