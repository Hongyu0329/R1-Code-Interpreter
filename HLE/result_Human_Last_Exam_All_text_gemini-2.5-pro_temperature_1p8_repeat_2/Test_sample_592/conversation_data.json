    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Character's Story Arc:** In the film, Tommaso is the wealthy and rebellious best friend of the protagonist, Piero. While Piero's life remains largely rooted in their hometown of Livorno, Tommaso leaves to travel the world, leading an adventurous and nomadic life for several years.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Relevant Plot Point:** Towards the end of the film, the protagonist Piero, now an adult, married, and a teacher, goes on his honeymoon. He has learned that his old friend Tommaso has finally settled down in the United States.\n\n5.  **Locate the Scene of Revelation:** Piero and his wife decide to use their honeymoon to visit Tommaso in America. The film shows their reunion. In this scene, it is revealed that Tommaso has drastically changed his lifestyle; he is married and works at a university.\n\n6.  **Identify the City:** The city where Piero visits Tommaso, and where Tommaso has established his new life, is explicitly shown and mentioned to be **Philadelphia**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It's crucial not to confuse the protagonist Piero with his friend Tommaso. Piero stays in Italy, while Tommaso is the one who moves to the US.\n*   **Plot Timeline:** Tommaso's move to Philadelphia is not his first stop abroad but rather where he eventually settles after years of traveling.\n*   **Verification:** This information can be verified by consulting detailed plot summaries of *Ovosodo* from reliable film databases (like IMDb) and film reviews that discuss the later parts of the movie. The scene where Piero visits Tommaso in Philadelphia is a key moment illustrating the different paths the two friends have taken.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the correct US city.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
