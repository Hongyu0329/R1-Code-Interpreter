    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis involving the properties of a toroidal chessboard and the rules for non-attacking queens.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints on a toroidal chessboard.**\nA 5x5 toroidal chessboard is a board that wraps around both horizontally and vertically. This means row 1 is adjacent to row 5, and column 1 is adjacent to column 5. When placing queens, we must consider these wrapped-around attack lines.\n\nThe conditions for placing non-attacking queens at positions `(r_i, c_i)` are:\n1.  **Distinct Rows:** All `r_i` must be distinct.\n2.  **Distinct Columns:** All `c_i` must be distinct.\n3.  **Distinct Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, diagonals are lines where `r - c` is constant (modulo 5). So, all `(r_i - c_i) mod 5` must be distinct.\n4.  **Distinct Anti-diagonals:** Similarly, anti-diagonals are lines where `r + c` is constant (modulo 5). So, all `(r_i + c_i) mod 5` must be distinct.\n\nWe will use coordinates {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} for rows and columns for easier modulo arithmetic.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the 4-queens problem to the 5-queens problem.**\nThis is the key insight for solving this problem elegantly. Let's consider what happens when we have a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   This placement uses 4 out of 5 rows, leaving one row empty.\n*   It uses 4 out of 5 columns, leaving one column empty.\n*   It occupies 4 out of 5 diagonals (`r-c mod 5`), leaving one diagonal type empty.\n*   It occupies 4 out of 5 anti-diagonals (`r+c mod 5`), leaving one anti-diagonal type empty.\n\nLet the set of 4 queens be `A = {(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), (r_3, c_3), (r_4, c_4)}`.\nLet `r_5` be the empty row, `c_5` be the empty column, `d_5` be the empty diagonal value, and `a_5` be the empty anti-diagonal value.\n\nWe know that the sum of all row indices is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10`, which is `0 mod 5`.\nSo, `r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 0 mod 5`, which implies `r_5 = -(r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4) mod 5`.\nSimilarly:\n*   `c_5 = -(c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4) mod 5`\n*   `d_5 = -((r_1-c_1) + ... + (r_4-c_4)) mod 5 = -(Σr_i - Σc_i) = r_5 - c_5 mod 5`\n*   `a_5 = -((r_1+c_1) + ... + (r_4+c_4)) mod 5 = -(Σr_i + Σc_i) = r_5 + c_5 mod 5`\n\nThis proves a crucial point: the unique empty square `(r_5, c_5)` determined by the placement of 4 queens has exactly the empty diagonal `d_5` and empty anti-diagonal `a_5`. This means that any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens by adding a queen to this empty square `(r_5, c_5)`.\n\nTherefore, the set of all valid 4-queen placements is precisely the set of all possible 5-queen placements with one queen removed.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of 5-queen solutions.**\nA valid 5-queen solution must have one queen in each row and each column. So, any solution can be represented by a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, where the queens are placed at `(i, p(i))` for `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n\nFor this to be a valid solution, the diagonal and anti-diagonal constraints must also be met:\n*   The set of values `{i - p(i) mod 5}` for `i=0..4` must be `{0,1,2,3,4}`.\n*   The set of values `{i + p(i) mod 5}` for `i=0..4` must be `{0,1,2,3,4}`.\n\nThis is a known problem in combinatorics. For a prime board size `n`, the solutions are given by linear permutations `p(i) = k*i + d (mod n)`, where `k` must satisfy `k ≠ 0, 1, -1 (mod n)`.\nFor `n=5`:\n*   `k ≠ 0 mod 5`\n*   `k ≠ 1 mod 5`\n*   `k ≠ -1 mod 5`, which is `k ≠ 4 mod 5`\n\nThe possible values for `k` are `2` and `3`. The value `d` can be any integer from `0` to `4`, representing a cyclic shift of the columns.\n\nCase 1: `k = 2`. The permutations are `p(i) = 2i + d mod 5` for `d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. This gives 5 distinct 5-queen solutions.\nCase 2: `k = 3`. The permutations are `p(i) = 3i + d mod 5` for `d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. This gives another 5 distinct 5-queen solutions.\n\nIn total, there are `5 + 5 = 10` unique sets of squares that constitute a 5-queen solution on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nAs established in Step 2, every valid 4-queen placement is created by taking one of the 5-queen solutions and removing a single queen.\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions: 10\n*   Number of ways to remove one queen from a 5-queen solution: 5\n\nEach 4-queen placement can be extended to a 5-queen solution in only one way. This guarantees that the sets of 4 queens generated from different 5-queen solutions are themselves different. Also, removing two different queens from the same 5-queen solution obviously results in two different 4-queen arrangements. Therefore, all the generated arrangements are unique.\n\nTotal number of ways = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × (Ways to remove one queen)\nTotal number of ways = 10 × 5 = 50."
