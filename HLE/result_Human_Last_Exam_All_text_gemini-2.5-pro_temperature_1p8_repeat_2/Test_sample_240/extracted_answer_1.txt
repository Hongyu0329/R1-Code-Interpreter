The most probable reason is that the functional coils that do not show resonance are equipped with an active decoupling or detuning circuit, often using PIN diodes. This circuit is a safety feature that protects the sensitive receive coil from the high-power transmit pulse of the MRI scanner. In many designs, this protective circuit defaults to a "detuned" or non-resonant state when it is un-powered (i.e., when it is on a workbench and disconnected from the scanner). The coil only becomes resonant at its operating frequency when it is connected to the scanner, which provides the necessary DC bias or control signal to switch the circuit into the "receive" mode. Therefore, you are correctly measuring the coil in its non-resonant, protected state.
