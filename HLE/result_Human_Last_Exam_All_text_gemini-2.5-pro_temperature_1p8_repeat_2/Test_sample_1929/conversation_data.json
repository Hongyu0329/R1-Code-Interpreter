    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene).** Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, a key component for a Diels-Alder reaction. For the reaction to proceed, it must adopt the reactive s-cis conformation.\n    *   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene and will act as the dienophile. The electron-withdrawing halogen atoms make it an excellent dienophile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where the '4' refers to the four π-electrons of the diene and the '2' refers to the two π-electrons of the dienophile.\n\n2.  **Predict the Basic Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is concerted, meaning bonds form and break in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n    *   The C1 and C4 of butadiene will form new sigma (σ) bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n    *   The double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond.\n    *   The two double bonds of the diene are converted into one new σ-bond and one new π-bond (between C2 and C3).\n    *   The product will be a six-membered ring, specifically a derivative of cyclohexene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical in terms of its substituents (a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group).\n    *   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, it can add to the symmetric diene in two different orientations. This leads to the possibility of two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers).\n    *   **Possibility A:** The CCl₂ part of the dienophile bonds next to one side of the newly formed double bond, and the CF₂ part bonds to the other.\n    *   **Possibility B:** The CF₂ part of the dienophile bonds next to one side, and the CCl₂ part bonds to the other.\n\n4.  **Draw and Name the Possible Products:**\n    *   Let's draw the cyclohexene ring product and number it according to IUPAC rules. The double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2. We then number the ring to give substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   **Product A:** This isomer has the CCl₂ group at position 4 and the CF₂ group at position 5. The IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   **Product B:** This isomer has the CF₂ group at position 4 and the CCl₂ group at position 5. The IUPAC name would be **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, when locants are tied, the alphabetically first substituent (chloro) gets the lower number. Therefore, Product A's name (4,4-dichloro...) is preferred over the alternative for Product B (4,4-difluoro-5,5-dichloro...).\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product:**\n    *   Predicting the regioselectivity of Diels-Alder reactions can be complex. Simple theories like Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory are inconclusive for a symmetric diene like butadiene, predicting a mixture of both products. Other considerations like stepwise radical mechanisms might predict one isomer over the other.\n    *   However, we can rely on experimental evidence. The reaction has been reported in the scientific literature (e.g., *J. Org. Chem.* 1965, 30 (6), pp 1988–1992). The product was identified using ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopy.\n    *   The analysis of the ¹⁹F NMR spectrum is a careful point:\n        *   For product **A (4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene)**, the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the two fluorine atoms on carbon-5 chemically equivalent. This would lead to a simple NMR signal (a single peak, possibly split into a triplet by neighboring protons).\n        *   For product **B (5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene)**, the two fluorine atoms on carbon-4 are diastereotopic. They are not chemically equivalent and would have different chemical shifts, leading to a much more complex NMR signal (an AB quartet, with further splitting).\n    *   The experimental spectrum showed a single sharp peak, which strongly supports the formation of **Product A**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on experimental evidence, the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene selectively produces one major regioisomer.\n\nThe final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n \n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
