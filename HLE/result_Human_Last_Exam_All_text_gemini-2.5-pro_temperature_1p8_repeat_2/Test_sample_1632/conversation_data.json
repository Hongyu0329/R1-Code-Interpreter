    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, a(10).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps (like moving on the streets of Manhattan). It is also known as a square lattice.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A path on the lattice that starts at a specific point (usually the origin, (0,0)) and never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A walk consisting of exactly `n` steps.\n*   **a(n):** This notation represents the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\nThe goal is to find the value of `a(10)`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing for small `n`\nThere is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The number of walks is typically found by direct enumeration, which becomes complex very quickly. Let's analyze the first few steps to understand the logic.\n\n*   **n=0:** There is one walk of zero steps: staying at the origin.\n    *   `a(0) = 1`\n\n*   **n=1:** From the origin (0,0), you can take one step in any of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). All are valid SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **n=2:** For each of the 4 one-step walks, the second step can go in any direction except back to the previous point. This gives 3 choices for the second step.\n    *   `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **n=3:** For each of the 12 two-step walks, there are again 3 non-backtracking choices for the third step. A 3-step walk cannot self-intersect except by immediately backtracking (which we've already excluded). A walk can only return to the origin after an even number of steps, so it's impossible to self-intersect after 3 steps.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **n=4:** From the 36 three-step walks, we can make 3 non-backtracking extensions, giving `36 * 3 = 108` potential paths. However, for the first time, a walk can form a closed loop that isn't just an immediate reversal. A 4-step walk can return to the origin, creating a 1x1 square. We must subtract these invalid paths.\n    *   **Counting the loops:** To form a square loop, you have 4 choices for the first step (e.g., East), 2 choices for the second step (North or South to make a bend), and then the third and fourth steps are forced to complete the square and return to the origin.\n    *   Number of invalid loops = 4 (initial directions) * 2 (bend directions) = 8.\n    *   `a(4) = (36 * 3) - 8 = 108 - 8 = 100`\n\n### Step 3: Recognizing the Complexity\nAs `n` increases, the direct enumeration process becomes exceedingly complex.\n*   For `a(5)`, we start with 100 4-step walks, giving `100 * 3 = 300` potential paths. We must subtract paths that self-intersect. A 5-step path cannot return to the origin (odd number of steps), but it can intersect with other earlier points in the path.\n*   For `a(10)`, manual calculation is computationally infeasible and highly prone to error.\n\n### Step 4: Using Known Results\nThis is a famous problem in computational physics and combinatorics. The values of `a(n)` have been calculated using powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms. The sequence is well-documented, for example, as sequence A001411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThe known values for `a(n)` are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the established and computationally verified sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, the value for n=10 is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
