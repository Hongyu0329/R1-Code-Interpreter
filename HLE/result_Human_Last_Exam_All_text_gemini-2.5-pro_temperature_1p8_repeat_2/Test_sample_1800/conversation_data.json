    "### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe user is asking for the ideal Nickel (Ni) to Cerium (Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts for two specific applications: the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and Water Splitting (WS). To provide a comprehensive answer, we must analyze the role of each component and how their ratio influences the overall catalytic performance.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Catalyst System (Ni-Ceria):**\n    *   **Ni (Nickel):** This is the primary active metal component. Metallic Ni is known to be active for breaking chemical bonds, such as H-O in water and C-O in carbon monoxide, and for forming H₂.\n    *   **Ceria (CeO₂):** This is not an inert support; it's an active, reducible oxide. Its key property is the high Oxygen Storage Capacity (OSC), which comes from the facile redox couple Ce⁴⁺ ↔ Ce³⁺. This allows ceria to store and release oxygen, creating oxygen vacancies on its surface.\n    *   **Ni-Ceria Synergy:** The catalytic magic happens at the interface between the Ni nanoparticles and the Ceria support. Ni promotes the reduction of Ceria (creating oxygen vacancies), and these vacancies, in turn, play a crucial role in activating reactant molecules (like H₂O). This strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) enhances activity, selectivity, and stability.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   **Water Gas Shift (WGS):** CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂. In this reaction, the ceria support's OSC is vital. A common mechanism involves water adsorbing and dissociating at an oxygen vacancy on the ceria surface, followed by the oxidation of CO by a lattice oxygen atom at the Ni-Ceria interface. The created vacancy is then replenished by the water dissociation step.\n    *   **Water Splitting (WS):** The term \"Water Splitting\" can be broad. In the context of Ni-Ceria, it usually refers to its use in reactions that involve splitting water as a co-reactant, most notably **steam reforming** of hydrocarbons or alcohols (e.g., Methane Steam Reforming: CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂). Direct thermochemical water splitting (2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂) requires much higher temperatures and different catalyst properties. We will assume the question refers to catalytic processes like steam reforming. Here, the catalyst must not only split water but also break C-H and C-C bonds, making it susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition (coking).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the \"Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio\":**\n    *   The \"ideal\" ratio is not a single universal value. It represents a compromise between several competing factors. The optimal ratio depends heavily on:\n        *   **Specific reaction** (WGS vs. different types of steam reforming).\n        *   **Reaction conditions** (especially temperature).\n        *   **Catalyst synthesis method** (e.g., co-precipitation, impregnation, sol-gel), which affects particle size, dispersion, and the intimacy of the Ni-Ceria contact.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ni Dispersion vs. Loading:**\n    *   **Too low Ni/Ce ratio:** Not enough Ni active sites, leading to low overall activity. However, the Ni particles are often small and highly dispersed, maximizing the beneficial interface area per Ni atom.\n    *   **Too high Ni/Ce ratio:** Too much Ni can lead to the formation of larger Ni particles (agglomeration/sintering). This reduces the dispersion (fewer surface Ni atoms per total Ni atoms) and decreases the relative contribution of the vital Ni-Ceria interface. Large Ni particles are also more prone to coking.\n\n2.  **Maximizing the Ni-CeO₂ Interface:** The catalytic activity is often directly proportional to the length of the perimeter of the Ni-CeO₂ interface. The ideal ratio seeks to maximize this interfacial area across the entire catalyst volume. This often occurs at intermediate Ni loadings.\n\n3.  **Redox Properties and Stability:**\n    *   The presence of Ni enhances the reducibility of the Ceria support. The optimal ratio ensures that this enhancement is maximized without compromising the structural integrity of the ceria.\n    *   For reactions prone to coking (like steam reforming), the OSC of ceria is critical for gasifying carbon deposits (C + [O] → CO). A higher proportion of ceria (lower Ni/Ce ratio) can improve the catalyst's stability and lifetime, even if it slightly reduces the initial peak activity.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Synthesizing Literature Findings\n\n*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction:**\n    Numerous studies have investigated the effect of the Ni/Ce ratio. The results consistently show a \"volcano-type\" relationship between the Ni content and CO conversion. Activity increases with Ni content up to a certain point and then decreases.\n    *   **The optimum is consistently found at a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1/3 (or 0.33).** This ratio provides an excellent balance between a high number of available Ni active sites and a well-developed, highly active Ni-Ceria interface that facilitates the redox mechanism. This corresponds to a Ni loading of roughly 10-15 wt%, depending on the synthesis method.\n\n*   **For Water Splitting / Steam Reforming Reactions:**\n    In these reactions, long-term stability and resistance to coking are often more important than sheer initial activity.\n    *   Because ceria's OSC is crucial for coke removal, a slightly lower Ni/Ce ratio is often preferred compared to WGS. This maximizes the supportive, anti-coking effect of the ceria.\n    *   Studies on steam reforming of methane, ethanol, or biomass tar often report **optimal performance (balancing activity and stability) at Ni/Ce atomic ratios between 1/4 (0.25) and 1/6 (0.17).**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is no single ideal ratio for all conditions, but a clear trend exists. The ideal ratio balances the number of Ni active sites with the beneficial promotional and stabilizing effects of the ceria support.\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, where activity is key, the most frequently cited optimum is a **Ni/Ce atomic ratio of ~0.33 (1/3)**.\n*   For **Water Splitting/Steam Reforming**, where stability against coking is paramount, a slightly lower ratio, often in the range of **0.17 to 0.25 (1/6 to 1/4)**, is typically ideal.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the ideal ratio for \"these reactions,\" the answer should reflect the most common and robustly supported finding, which points to the WGS reaction's optimum.\n\n<<<An atomic ratio of Ni/Ce ≈ 0.33 (1/3)>>>"
