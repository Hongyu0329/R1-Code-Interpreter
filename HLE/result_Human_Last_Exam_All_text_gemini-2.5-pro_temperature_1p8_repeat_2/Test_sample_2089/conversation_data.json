    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for a specific film with four key elements:\n    *   It must be an **Oscar-nominated film**. This means it received at least one nomination in any category from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n    *   A character **seals his fate**. This implies a pivotal, conclusive moment that determines the character's future path or outcome. It does not necessarily have to be negative (like getting caught or killed), but it must be decisive.\n    *   The character says the specific words **\"Thank you\"**.\n    *   This action happens **while boarding a bus**.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Eliminating incorrect candidates:**\n    *   A common guess might be Quentin Tarantino's *Inglourious Basterds*. That film is famous for a scene where a character's identity is revealed by a subtle mistake. However, in that scene, the giveaway is a hand gesture (holding up the wrong three fingers for a drink order), not the phrase \"Thank you,\" and it takes place in a basement tavern, not on a bus.\n    *   Other spy or chase films like *Bridge of Spies*, *Argo*, or *The Fugitive* are also Oscar-nominated and feature tense moments, but none contain the specific combination of a \"Thank you\" on a bus that seals a character's fate.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    The film that matches all the criteria is the 2007 Austrian drama **_The Counterfeiters_** (*Die Fälscher*).\n\n4.  **Confirming the Film Meets the Criteria:**\n    *   **Oscar-Nominated:** Yes, *The Counterfeiters* won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at the 80th Academy Awards, making it an Oscar-winning (and thus, nominated) film.\n    *   **The Character:** The character is the protagonist, Salomon 'Sally' Sorowitsch, a master counterfeiter and Jewish prisoner forced by the Nazis to forge currency during WWII.\n    *   **The Scene:** The final scene of the film takes place after the war. Sally has taken the counterfeit money he helped create to Monte Carlo and is living a life of luxury. Wracked with guilt, he deliberately gambles away every last bill.\n    *   **The Action:** Now penniless, Sally is shown walking away from the casino. He then boards a public bus. As he pays his fare to the driver, he looks at him and says **\"Danke schön\"** (\"Thank you\").\n    *   **How it Seals His Fate:** This is the crucial point. The \"fate\" being sealed is not his capture or death, but his choice to abandon the life of crime and forgery. By purposefully losing the money and accepting his new, humble circumstances—symbolized by the simple, courteous act of taking a bus—he has decisively chosen his future. He has sealed his fate to be a free, normal man rather than a rich criminal haunted by his past. The \"Thank you\" is an affirmation of this choice and his acceptance of a new, ordinary life.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe film is *The Counterfeiters*. The protagonist, Salomon Sorowitsch, after ridding himself of the tainted money from his past, seals his fate of starting a new, honest life by humbly saying \"Thank you\" as he boards a public bus in the movie's final scene.\n\n<<<The Counterfeiters>>>"
