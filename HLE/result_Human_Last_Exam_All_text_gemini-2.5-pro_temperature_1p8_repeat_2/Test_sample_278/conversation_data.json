    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined in two parts based on the parameter `t`.\n    *   **Part 1: For `t` in `[0, π]`**\n        The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b\\sin t$ with $b=1$.\n        So, $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n        We know that $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which means $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.\n        As `t` goes from 0 to $\\pi$, `y = sin(t)` is always non-negative (`y ≥ 0`).\n        Therefore, this part of the curve represents the **upper semi-circle** of a unit circle.\n        *   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   The y-values range from $\\sin(0)=0$ to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n    *   **Part 2: For `t` in `(π, 2π)`**\n        The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b\\sin t$ with $b=5$.\n        So, $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n        We can write $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ as $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis).\n        As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, `y = 5sin(t)` is always non-positive (`y ≤ 0`).\n        Therefore, this part of the curve represents the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n        *   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n        *   The y-values range from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0]$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions. We combine the ranges from both parts.\n    *   **Overall X-Range:** The maximum x-value is 1 (from both parts) and the minimum x-value is -1 (from both parts). So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   **Overall Y-Range:** The maximum y-value is 1 (from the semi-circle part) and the minimum y-value is -5 (from the semi-ellipse part). So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Dimensions of the Bounding Box:**\n    The figure fits inside a rectangle defined by these minimum and maximum values.\n    *   **Width** of the figure = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   **Height** of the figure = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square:**\n    A square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this figure must be large enough to contain the bounding rectangle we just found. The side length of the square must be at least as long as the larger of the two dimensions (width and height).\n    *   Side length of square, $S \\ge \\text{Width}$\n    *   Side length of square, $S \\ge \\text{Height}$\n    *   Therefore, the minimum side length of the square is $S_{min} = \\max(\\text{Width}, \\text{Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Area of the Smallest Square:**\n    The area of a square is the side length squared.\n    *   Area = $(S_{min})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Be mindful that the value of `b` changes, resulting in two different geometric shapes (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse) that are joined together.\n*   Correctly determine the range of x and y values for each part of the curve to find the global maximum and minimum values.\n*   The side length of the smallest *square* that encloses a rectangle is determined by the *longer* side of that rectangle.\n*   The final question is about the *area* of the square, not just its side length.\n\n<<<36>>>"
