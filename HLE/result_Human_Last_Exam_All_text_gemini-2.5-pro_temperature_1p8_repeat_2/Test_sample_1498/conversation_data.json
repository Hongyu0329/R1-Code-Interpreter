    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the specific verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that list the names of the prophets.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a creedal poem that follows a logical order. It begins with praise to Allah, then discusses Allah's necessary, impossible, and possible attributes. Following this, it moves on to the topic of the prophets (*rusul* and *anbiya*).\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on Prophets:** The section on the prophets first discusses their four necessary attributes (*sifah wajibah*): Truthfulness (*al-Sidq*), Trustworthiness (*al-Amanah*), Conveying the Message (*al-Tabligh*), and Intellect (*al-Fatanah*). Immediately after establishing these general principles about prophethood, the author proceeds to list the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Bayt (Couplet):** The list begins right after the discussion of the prophets' attributes. The first couplet that starts enumerating the names is:\n    *   هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَــعْ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْـمُ كُـلٌّ مُتَّبَـــعْ\n    *   *(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed)*\n    *   In the standard numbering of the poem, this is **Bayt 29**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Ending Bayt (Couplet):** The list continues over several couplets, systematically naming the prophets. We need to find the final couplet that contains the last of the names. The enumeration concludes with the mention of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to by the name \"Taha.\" The final couplet in this list is:\n    *   يَحْيَى وَعِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِــمُ دَعْ عَنـْكَ الْغَيَّ فكُلّ لازِمُ\n    *   *(Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha, the Seal [of the Prophets]. Leave deviation, for belief in all is necessary.)*\n    *   This couplet, which concludes the list of 25 prophets, is **Bayt 33**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Range:** The couplet immediately following Bayt 33 is a general prayer for all the prophets mentioned (`عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّــــلَامُ...`), which serves as a conclusion to the list. Therefore, the verses that explicitly contain the names of the prophets are from Bayt 29 to Bayt 33 inclusive.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Numbering:** The numbering of the couplets can sometimes vary slightly between different prints or manuscripts, especially concerning whether the opening *Bismillah* and introductory praises are counted. However, the range from Bayt 29 to 33 is the most standard and widely accepted numbering.\n*   **Prophet Muhammad's Name:** The poem uses \"Taha\" (طه), one of the names/titles of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to refer to him.\n*   **Total Count:** The couplets from 29 to 33 list exactly 25 prophets, which is the number traditionally understood to be mentioned by name in the Qur'an.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the section containing the names of the prophets spans five full couplets.\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 33>>>"
