    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed classical ballet steps concludes with the legs in the same position they were in at the start of the step. For steps that begin and end in fifth position, this means the same foot that started in front (or *devant*) must also end in front.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** An \"entrechat\" is a vertical jump where the legs are beaten together or crossed in the air. The number indicates the number of movements. An *entrechat six* involves three distinct beats (or crossings) of the legs. In ballet pedagogy, steps with an odd number of beats/crossings result in the feet changing position. An *entrechat quatre* has two beats and does not change feet. An *entrechat six* has three beats and does change feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If the dancer starts with the right foot in front, they will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Échappé\" means \"to escape,\" referring to the jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). \"Battu\" means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat together before closing. The key term here is \"**changé**,\" which literally means \"changed.\" This qualifier explicitly states that the feet must switch places.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The feet are reversed from their starting orientation in fifth position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Often begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The working leg brushes out to the side, front, or back, and the dancer jumps, \"assembling\" both legs in the air to land simultaneously on both feet in fifth position. In a standard *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the working leg closes on the opposite side of where it started. For example, in an *assemblé dessous*, the foot that starts in front brushes to the side and lands in the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The feet have changed places in fifth position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" It is a traveling step. The term \"**derrière**\" means \"to the back.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the front foot closes in the back at the end of the step. If you start with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot will glide out to the side, you transfer your weight, and the right (originally front) foot closes behind the left.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The left foot is now in front. The feet have changed places.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Movement Analysis:** This is a decorative step that resembles a *pas de chat* but with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg. The foot that starts in front is the first to execute its *rond de jambe en l'air* as the dancer jumps. This same leg is also the first to land. The second leg then performs its *rond de jambe* and closes into fifth position. In the standard execution, the second leg closes behind the first leg.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If the step starts with the right foot in front, the right leg leads the action and lands first, and the left leg closes behind it. The step therefore ends with the right foot still in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is the same as the starting position.\n\n### Final Determination\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, *Gargouillade* is the only step among the choices where the starting and ending leg positions (specifically, which foot is in front) are the same. All other listed steps involve a change of feet (*changement*).\n\n<<<E>>>"
