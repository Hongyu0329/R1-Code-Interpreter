    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe user wants to know the total number of distinct members in the human let-7 microRNA family as of the current date.\n\n**Step 2: Define what \"let-7 family member\" means.**\nIn the context of microRNAs (miRNAs), a \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a similar sequence, particularly in the crucial \"seed\" region (nucleotides 2-8 of the mature miRNA). This shared seed sequence means they often regulate a similar set of target genes. A \"member\" typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence (e.g., let-7a, let-7b), not the number of precursor genes that encode them.\n\n**Step 3: List the primary let-7 members in humans.**\nThe primary members are named with the prefix \"let-7\" followed by a letter. We can list them based on the authoritative miRNA database, miRBase.\n*   hsa-let-7a\n*   hsa-let-7b\n*   hsa-let-7c\n*   hsa-let-7d\n*   hsa-let-7e\n*   hsa-let-7f\n*   hsa-let-7g\n*   hsa-let-7i\n\n**Step 4: Identify careful points and common misconceptions.**\n*   **Counting Genes vs. Members:** It is crucial not to confuse the number of members with the number of genes (precursors). For example, the single mature miRNA `let-7a` is produced from three different genetic loci (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`). The question asks for members, not genes.\n*   **The Missing `let-7h`:** While the naming seems alphabetical, `let-7h` is notably absent in the human genome. It is present in other mammals like mice, but not in humans. This is a key detail. Counting the list from Step 3, we have 8 members.\n*   **Inclusion of other miRNAs:** The let-7 family, based on its seed sequence, functionally includes another well-known miRNA.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the other official member of the family.**\n*   `miR-98` shares the same seed sequence as the let-7 family members. Due to this sequence and functional similarity, the scientific community universally considers `miR-98` to be a member of the let-7 family.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final count.**\nBy combining the primary let-7 members with the closely related `miR-98`, we can determine the total.\n*   Number of primary let-7 members (let-7a through let-7i, skipping h): 8\n*   Number of other closely related members: 1 (miR-98)\n*   Total members = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo date, there are 9 established members of the let-7 family identified in humans: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n\n<<<9>>>"
