    "Answering this question requires understanding the theory of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves, particularly over number fields. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Elliptic Curve:** A curve defined by an equation like $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$, along with a point at infinity, forming an abelian group.\n*   **Torsion Subgroup:** The subgroup of points of finite order, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K$.\n*   **Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** This is a specific number field of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is an imaginary quadratic field. A key property of this field is that it contains the third and sixth roots of unity. Specifically, $\\zeta_3 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ and $\\zeta_6 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$ are elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The ring of integers of this field is $\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_3]$.\n*   **Non-cyclic Group:** A group that cannot be generated by a single element. A finite abelian group is non-cyclic if its structure is not $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for some $N$.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The number of elements in the group. We are looking for the maximum possible size of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup.\n\n**2. Structure of Torsion Subgroups over Number Fields**\nFor any elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is a finite abelian group. Its structure is always of the form:\n$E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$\nfor some positive integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n$ divides $m$.\nFor this group to be non-cyclic, we must have $n > 1$. The order of this group is $n \\cdot m$.\n\n**3. Classification of Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields**\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields (like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$) have been completely classified by the work of mathematicians including Kenku, Momose, and Najman. We need to identify all possible non-cyclic groups from this classification and then determine which of them can occur specifically over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over *any* quadratic field are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   *Note:* The existence of $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ have also been established more recently for certain quadratic fields, and we will consider them. For this specific problem, it turns out that $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ is indeed possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n**4. Filtering the Possibilities for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nThe existence of a specific torsion structure depends on the field. The condition that the field contains certain roots of unity is often crucial. As we noted, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$.\n\nLet's examine the families of groups and determine the largest possible order from each family that can occur over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$**:\n    The largest such group that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The order is $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n    (Groups with $N=5$ or $N=6$ in this family do not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$).\n\n*   **Family $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$**:\n    Since $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, this field is particularly suitable for torsion structures involving the number 3. It is known that the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    The order is $3 \\times 9 = 27$.\n\n*   **Family $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4N\\mathbb{Z}$**:\n    The group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ requires the field to contain $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{-7})$. Since $i \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, this group structure does not occur over our field. In fact, it is only known to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n\n*   **Group $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$**:\n    This group only occurs over the real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. So it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$**:\n    The existence of this torsion structure requires the field of definition of the elliptic curve to contain the field of moduli of the modular curve $X_1(6,6)$, which is precisely $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Thus, not only is this group possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, it is the *only* quadratic field for which this torsion structure can occur.\n    The order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n**5. Comparing the Maximum Orders**\nNow we compare the maximum possible orders we have found for each family of non-cyclic groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n*   From the $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ family: Order 16.\n*   From the $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ family: Order 27.\n*   From the $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ group: Order 36.\n\nThe largest among these orders is 36.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36. This order is realized by an elliptic curve with a torsion subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$."
