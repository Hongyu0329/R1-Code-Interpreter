    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the mathematical terms used in the question.\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element (`e`), inverses for all elements, and a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A *non-empty* subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `xy` is *not* in `S`. This can be written concisely as `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ S` to `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** The question states a group `G` is filled if \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G.\" This is interpreted as the union of all maximal product-free sets being equal to `G`. Let `M` be the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`. The condition is `⋃_{S∈M} S = G`.\n*   **Finite Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Examples include abelian groups and p-groups.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the \"Filled Group\" Definition as Stated\n\nA critical point arises from the definition of a product-free set.\n1.  Let `e` be the identity element of the group `G`.\n2.  Consider any product-free set `S`. By definition, `S` is non-empty.\n3.  Can `e` be an element of `S`? Let's assume `e ∈ S`.\n4.  According to the definition of a product-free set, for any `x, y ∈ S`, their product `xy` must not be in `S`. Let's choose `x = e` and `y = e`. Both are in `S`.\n5.  Their product is `xy = e ⋅ e = e`.\n6.  The definition requires this product `e` to not be in `S`. But we assumed `e ∈ S`, which is a contradiction.\n7.  Therefore, the identity element `e` can never be in any product-free set `S`.\n8.  Since `e` is not in any product-free set, it cannot be in any *maximal* product-free set either.\n9.  This means that the union of all maximal product-free sets, `⋃_{S∈M} S`, is a subset of `G \\ {e}` (the set `G` with the identity element removed).\n10. The condition for `G` to be a \"filled group\" is `⋃_{S∈M} S = G`.\n11. This leads to the requirement that `G` must be a subset of `G \\ {e}`, which is impossible for any group (as groups must contain an identity element `e`).\n\n**Conclusion from Literal Interpretation:** If we adhere strictly to the definition that \"fills G\" means the union is the entire group `G`, then no such group exists. The set of finite filled nilpotent groups would be empty.\n\n### Step 3: A More Likely Interpretation\n\nThe conclusion that no group can satisfy the condition is a strong indicator that the problem statement as provided contains a common shorthand or a transcription error. In mathematical literature concerning product-free sets, a group is typically called \"filled\" (or a similar term) if the union of its maximal product-free sets covers all *non-identity* elements.\n\n**Corrected Definition of Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is filled if `⋃_{S∈M} S = G \\ {e}`.\n\nLet's proceed with this standard, corrected definition.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis with the Corrected Definition\n\nOur goal now is to determine which finite nilpotent groups `G` satisfy `⋃_{S∈M} S = G \\ {e}`.\n1.  As established in Step 2, `⋃_{S∈M} S` is always a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n2.  So, the condition is met if and only if every non-identity element of `G` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set. That is, `G \\ {e} ⊆ ⋃_{S∈M} S`.\n3.  Let's take an arbitrary non-identity element `g ∈ G \\ {e}`.\n4.  Consider the singleton set `A = {g}`. For `A` to be product-free, the product `g ⋅ g = g²` must not be in `A`. This means `g² ≠ g`. Multiplying by `g⁻¹` on the left, this is equivalent to `g ≠ e`. Since we chose `g` from `G \\ {e}`, this condition holds. Thus, `{g}` is a product-free set.\n5.  Since `G` is finite, any product-free set can be extended to a maximal product-free set. Let's start with `A = {g}`. If `A` is not maximal, there exists a larger product-free set `A₁` containing `A`. If `A₁` is not maximal, there is a larger `A₂`, and so on. This creates a chain `A ⊂ A₁ ⊂ A₂ ⊂ ...`. Since `G` is finite, this chain must terminate at some set `S`, which is by definition a maximal product-free set.\n6.  This maximal product-free set `S` contains our original element `g`.\n7.  Since our choice of `g ∈ G \\ {e}` was arbitrary, we have shown that every non-identity element of `G` is contained in at least one maximal product-free set.\n8.  This means `G \\ {e} ⊆ ⋃_{S∈M} S` is true for any finite group `G` with order `|G| > 1`.\n9.  Combining this with `⋃_{S∈M} S ⊆ G \\ {e}`, we conclude that `⋃_{S∈M} S = G \\ {e}` for any finite group `G` of order greater than 1.\n\n### Step 5: The Case of the Trivial Group\n\nWhat about the trivial group `G = {e}`?\n*   According to the corrected definition, `G` is filled if `⋃ S = G \\ {e}`.\n*   Here, `G \\ {e} = {e} \\ {e} = ∅` (the empty set).\n*   Does `G = {e}` have any non-empty product-free sets? The only non-empty subset is `{e}`. This set is *not* product-free because `e ⋅ e = e`, and `e` is in the set.\n*   Therefore, the trivial group has no product-free sets, and thus no maximal product-free sets. The collection `M` is empty.\n*   The union of an empty collection of sets is the empty set `∅`.\n*   So for `G={e}`, `⋃_{S∈M} S = ∅`.\n*   The condition `⋃ S = G \\ {e}` becomes `∅ = ∅`, which is true.\n*   Thus, the trivial group `G = {e}` is a filled group. The trivial group is also finite and nilpotent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard definition of a filled group (`⋃ S = G \\ {e}`), all finite groups are filled groups. The question asks to identify the finite groups that are both **filled** and **nilpotent**. Since the \"filled\" property applies to all finite groups, the question simplifies to identifying the finite groups that are nilpotent.\n\nTherefore, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups is simply the set of all finite nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<All finite nilpotent groups>>>"
