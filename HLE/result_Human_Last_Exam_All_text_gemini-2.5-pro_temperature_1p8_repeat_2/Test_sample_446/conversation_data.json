    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct peptide.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Binding Motif**\nThe question asks about peptides that bind to integrin receptors. The most well-known and common recognition sequence for a large family of integrins is the tripeptide RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). This sequence acts as a recognition site within extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Answer Choices**\nAll five of the provided peptide options begin with the RGD sequence:\nA. RGDMAA\nB. RGDSPSS\nC. RGDLTTP\nD. RGDQVSK\nE. RGDARGG\n\nSince all options contain the core RGD motif, the binding affinity and specificity are determined by the amino acids that flank this core sequence. These flanking residues influence the conformation of the RGD loop, making it more or less accessible and complementary to the binding pocket of a specific integrin subtype.\n\n**Step 3: Relate to a Known Natural Ligand**\nThe RGD sequence was originally discovered as the cell-attachment site in the protein fibronectin. In fibronectin, the sequence that mediates binding to integrins (like α5β1) is not just RGD, but a slightly longer and specific sequence. The minimal active sequence from fibronectin is well-established as **RGDS** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine). The serine residue at the fourth position is critical for high-affinity binding to the fibronectin receptor.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Peptide in Detail**\n*   **A. RGDMAA:** The residue following RGD is Methionine (M). While some RGD-containing peptides can bind integrins, RDM is not a classic, high-affinity sequence.\n*   **B. RGDSPSS:** The residue following RGD is Serine (S). This peptide contains the canonical **RGDS** motif from fibronectin. Peptides containing the RGDS sequence have been extensively synthesized and are widely used in *in vitro* assays to study, block, or mimic cell adhesion to fibronectin. The presence of this well-characterized sequence makes it an extremely strong candidate. The following Pro-Ser-Ser sequence can also help adopt a favorable conformation (e.g., a β-turn) for receptor binding.\n*   **C. RGDLTTP:** The residue following RGD is Leucine (L). This sequence is not a well-known high-affinity motif for common integrins.\n*   **D. RGDQVSK:** The residue following RGD is Glutamine (Q). This is also not a common or well-characterized sequence for high-affinity integrin binding.\n*   **E. RGDARGG:** The residue following RGD is Alanine (A). While RGD-containing peptides can have varying affinities, RGDA is generally less effective than RGDS for binding to the fibronectin receptor.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on evidence**\nThe peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the classic and highly active **RGDS** motif derived from fibronectin. Synthetic peptides with this sequence have been a cornerstone of integrin research for decades and are known to bind potently to integrin receptors (specifically the fibronectin receptor α5β1) in numerous *in vitro* assays. Therefore, it is the most likely peptide among the choices to have been found to bind an integrin receptor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
