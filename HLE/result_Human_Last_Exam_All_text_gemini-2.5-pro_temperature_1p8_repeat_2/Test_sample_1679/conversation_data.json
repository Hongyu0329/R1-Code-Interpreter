    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their Locations\nThe question refers to a \"Luxor Obelisk\". Originally, a pair of obelisks stood at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Today, they are in two different locations:\n1.  One obelisk remains at its original location in front of the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The second obelisk was moved to **Paris, France, in the 1830s** and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde**.\nTherefore, a film could satisfy the query by depicting either of these two locations.\n\n### Step 2: Chronological Search of Best Picture Winners\nWe must go through the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture, starting from the first ceremony, and check their settings and key scenes. The search is for the *first* film on the list that contains a clear depiction.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Potential Candidate Films\n\n*   **1st-9th Academy Awards (1927-1936):** None of the winning films from this period, including *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, or *Mutiny on the Bounty*, are set in Paris or Luxor in a way that would feature the obelisk.\n\n*   **10th Academy Awards (1937) - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is set in Paris. As a biopic of a famous French figure, it is a plausible candidate. However, the film was primarily shot on studio lots in California. While it features Parisian settings, there is no clear or notable scene that depicts the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. Most external shots are of non-specific streets or more intimate locations. Without a confirmed sighting, we cannot definitively say it's the first.\n\n*   **11th-23rd Academy Awards (1938-1950):** Films from this era like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All About Eve* do not feature the obelisk. While *Casablanca* (1943) has famous flashbacks to Paris, they focus on landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and intimate cafe scenes, not the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **24th Academy Awards (1951) - *An American in Paris***: The title itself points to its setting. The film is famous for its extended, 17-minute ballet sequence at the end, which is a tribute to Paris as seen through the eyes of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters. During this sequence, there is a segment inspired by the style of Raoul Dufy that clearly **depicts the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk featured prominently** in the center of a vibrant, painted set. A depiction does not have to be live-action, and this stylized representation certainly qualifies. This is a very strong candidate for the first confirmed instance.\n\n*   **29th Academy Awards (1956) - *Around the World in 80 Days***: This film's global journey begins in Paris. It features extensive on-location footage. During the montage of Phileas Fogg's departure from Paris, there are **clear, live-action shots of the Place de la Concorde showing the Luxor Obelisk**. While this is a definite depiction, it occurred five years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n*   **Subsequent Winners:** Other Paris-set winners like *Gigi* (1958) or films with Egyptian settings like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) either came later or did not feature the specific locations required. No Best Picture winner has featured a clear depiction of the obelisk that remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nComparing the candidates, *An American in Paris* (1951) is the first film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture to contain a confirmed, clear depiction of a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris). While the depiction is a stylized, painted backdrop, it is an intentional and memorable part of the film's climactic sequence. It predates the confirmed live-action depiction in *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956).\n\n***\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
