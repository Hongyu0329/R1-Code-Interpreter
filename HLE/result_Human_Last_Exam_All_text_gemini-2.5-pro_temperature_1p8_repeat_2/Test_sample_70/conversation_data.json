    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross that extends to the edges of the flag. The vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side.\n2.  **Model as a Matrix:** We represent the flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a point's color. Let the color Red be represented by a value `R` and White by a value `W`. The problem states we should choose values to *maximize* the rank. This means we must choose `R` and `W` such that they do not create accidental linear dependencies. For example, we can choose `R=1` and `W=sqrt(2)`, or more abstractly, consider them as linearly independent vectors.\n3.  **Analyze Row Patterns:** Let's examine the patterns of the rows in the Danish flag matrix.\n    *   The rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the white cross will all be identical, consisting of only the color white. Let's call this pattern `P_W = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   All other rows pass through the red field and the vertical bar of the white cross. These rows will also be identical to each other, forming a pattern of red with a section of white. Let's call this pattern `P_RW = [R, R, ..., W, ..., R, R]`.\n4.  **Determine the Rank:** The set of all rows in the matrix consists of repetitions of just two unique patterns: `P_W` and `P_RW`. The row space of the matrix is the vector space spanned by these two row vectors. Since `R` and `W` are chosen to be linearly independent values, the vectors `P_W` and `P_RW` are linearly independent. For instance, no scalar multiple of `P_W` (a vector of all `W`s) can produce `P_RW` (a vector containing both `R` and `W`). Therefore, the dimension of the row space is 2.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The maximal rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Criterion for African Flags\n\nWe are looking for African national flags that also have a maximal rank of 2. Based on the analysis above, a flag's matrix will have a rank of 2 if and only if its entire design can be constructed from exactly two linearly independent row (or column) patterns.\n\n**Flags that will NOT have a rank of 2:**\n\n*   **Flags with 3 or more simple stripes (horizontal or vertical):** For example, a horizontal tricolor like Gabon (green, yellow, blue) has three distinct row patterns (`[G,G,...]`, `[Y,Y,...]`, `[B,B,...]`) and thus has a rank of 3.\n*   **Flags with emblems, stars, or complex symbols:** A central emblem on a uniform background introduces new, distinct row patterns. For example, the flag of Somalia (a white star on a blue field) has rows of all blue (`[B,B,...]`) and multiple distinct rows that intersect the star (e.g., `[B,B,W,B,B]`, `[B,W,W,W,B]`). These patterns are linearly independent, making the rank greater than 2.\n*   **Flags with diagonal or oblique elements:** Diagonal lines create a large number of unique row and column patterns, resulting in a high rank. For example, the flag of Tanzania.\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Analyze African Flags\n\nWe will now search for African flags whose structure results in exactly two linearly independent patterns.\n\n1.  **Nigeria:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical triband of green, white, and green.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the columns. All columns in the first third are solid green (`[G, G, ..., G]^T`). All columns in the middle third are solid white (`[W, W, ..., W]^T`). All columns in the final third are solid green again. The entire column space is spanned by just two distinct, linearly independent vectors: a \"green\" vector and a \"white\" vector.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This flag is a match.\n\n2.  **Benin:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical green band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of yellow (top) and red (bottom) on the fly side.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the rows. All rows in the top half of the flag consist of a section of green followed by a section of yellow (`[G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`). All rows in the bottom half consist of a section of green followed by a section of red (`[G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`). These are the only two row patterns. Since green, yellow, and red are distinct colors, these two patterns are linearly independent.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This flag is a match.\n\n3.  **Madagascar:**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical white band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of red (top) and green (bottom) on the fly side.\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag has the same geometric structure as the flag of Benin. The rows in the top half follow the pattern `[W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`, and the rows in the bottom half follow the pattern `[W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`. These two patterns are linearly independent and span the entire row space.\n    *   **Rank:** 2. This flag is a match.\n\nOther potential candidates are ruled out for the reasons mentioned in Step 2. For instance:\n*   **Mali** (vertical tricolor) and **Sierra Leone** (horizontal tricolor) both have a rank of 3.\n*   **Angola** (horizontal bicolor with a central emblem) has a rank greater than 2 because the emblem introduces new, independent row patterns.\n*   **Morocco** (red field with a green pentagram) has a rank greater than 2 because the pentagram introduces many distinct row patterns that are independent of the all-red rows.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2) are those whose designs are composed of exactly two fundamental, linearly independent patterns. Our analysis identified three such flags.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
