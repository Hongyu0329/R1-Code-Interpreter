A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed based on the **Schnorr signature scheme** over a group where the Discrete Logarithm Problem is hard. The design requires a one-time **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)** to establish a shared public key `Y` and secret key shares `xᵢ` for each party.

The two-round signing protocol for a message `m` by a set of `t` participants proceeds as follows:

**Round 1: Commitment**
Each of the `t` signing parties `i` generates a fresh, secret random nonce `kᵢ` and broadcasts its public commitment `Cᵢ = gᵏⁱ`. This commitment binds the party to their choice of nonce.

**Round 2: Response**
After receiving all `t` commitments, each party `i`:
1.  Computes the aggregated group nonce commitment `R = Π Cⱼ`.
2.  Computes the challenge hash `c = H(Y, R, m)`.
3.  Calculates their specific Lagrange coefficient `λᵢ` for the signing set.
4.  Computes and broadcasts their partial signature `sᵢ = kᵢ + c * λᵢ * xᵢ`.

A final signature `(R, s)` is formed by aggregating the partial signatures: `s = Σ sᵢ`. This signature is a standard Schnorr signature and can be publicly verified.

This design is **tightly secure** because its security directly reduces to the security of the underlying Schnorr signature scheme, which has a tight proof of security in the Random Oracle Model. The two-round structure is crucial for preventing forgery by malicious insiders, thereby preserving the tightness of the reduction.
