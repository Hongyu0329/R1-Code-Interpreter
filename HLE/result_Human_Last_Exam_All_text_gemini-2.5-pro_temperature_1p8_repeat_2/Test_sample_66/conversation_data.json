    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Object:** The flag of Tonga.\n    *   **Matrix Representation:** We're creating a matrix from an idealized image of the flag. Every red pixel gets a value `a`, and every white pixel gets a value `b`.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the *maximal possible* rank of this matrix. This means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` (and assume a sufficiently high resolution for the image) to achieve the highest possible rank.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Flag's Structure:**\n    *   The flag of Tonga is composed of a large red field.\n    *   In the upper-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle.\n    *   Inside this white rectangle, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the field it is on.\n    *   This gives us three distinct regions defined by their color and position:\n        1.  The main red field.\n        2.  The white background of the canton.\n        3.  The red cross within the canton.\n\n3.  **Construct the Matrix Structure:**\n    Let the matrix be denoted by `M`. We can model the flag's structure as a block matrix. The top-left block corresponds to the canton, and the rest of the matrix corresponds to the red field.\n    ```\n      M = [ C | A1 ]\n          [---+----]\n          [A2 | A3 ]\n    ```\n    *   `C` is the matrix for the canton (white with a red cross).\n    *   `A1`, `A2`, `A3` are blocks corresponding to the red field, so all their entries are `a`.\n\n4.  **Identify Distinct Row Vectors:**\n    The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. Let's identify the unique patterns of rows that can appear in the matrix `M`.\n\n    *   **Type 1: Rows from the main red field.** Any row below the canton (in blocks `A2` and `A3`) consists entirely of the value `a`. Let's call this vector `v_red_field`.\n        `v_red_field = (a, a, a, ..., a)`\n\n    *   **Type 2: Rows that pass through the canton.** These rows consist of a left part (from the canton matrix `C`) and a right part (from the block `A1`, which is all `a`'s).\n        *   **Sub-type 2a: Row hits the horizontal bar of the cross.** The canton part of this row is all red, so all its values are `a`. The full row is `(a, a, ... | a, a, ...)`, which is identical to `v_red_field`.\n        *   **Sub-type 2b: Row hits the white area of the canton, missing the cross entirely.** This is possible because the cross is couped. The canton part of this row is all white, so its values are all `b`. The full row vector is a new type. Let's call it `v_white_canton`.\n            `v_white_canton = (b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n        *   **Sub-type 2c: Row hits the white area but intersects the vertical bar of the cross.** The canton part of this row will be mostly `b`'s, but will have a segment of `a`'s where it crosses the vertical bar. This is another new type of vector. Let's call it `v_vert_cross`.\n            `v_vert_cross = (b, ... b, a, ... a, b, ... b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\n    So, we have identified three distinct types of row vectors in the matrix `M`:\n    1.  `v1 = (a, a, ..., a)`\n    2.  `v2 = (b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n    3.  `v3 = (b, ... a, ... b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximal Rank:**\n    The rank of the matrix will be the number of linearly independent vectors among `{v1, v2, v3}`. The rank depends on the choice of `a` and `b`. We want to maximize it. Let's test for linear independence by setting a linear combination to zero:\n    `c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃ = 0`\n\n    We can look at the components of this vector equation corresponding to different columns:\n    *   **A column in the main red field (far right):** Here, all three vectors have the value `a`.\n        `c₁a + c₂a + c₃a = 0` => `(c₁ + c₂ + c₃)a = 0`.\n        To maximize the rank, we should not choose trivial values. Let's assume `a ≠ 0`. Then we must have:\n        (i) `c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = 0`\n\n    *   **A column in the canton's pure white area (missing the cross):** Here, `v1` has `a`, while `v2` and `v3` have `b`.\n        `c₁a + c₂b + c₃b = 0` => `c₁a + (c₂ + c₃)b = 0`.\n        From (i), we know `c₂ + c₃ = -c₁`. Substituting this in gives:\n        `c₁a + (-c₁)b = 0` => `c₁(a - b) = 0`.\n        To maximize the rank, we should choose `a ≠ b`. This implies that `c₁ = 0`.\n\n    *   **A column in the canton that hits the vertical bar of the cross:** Here, `v1` and `v3` have `a`, while `v2` has `b`.\n        `c₁a + c₂b + c₃a = 0` => `(c₁ + c₃)a + c₂b = 0`.\n        Since we found `c₁ = 0`, this simplifies to `c₃a + c₂b = 0`.\n        From (i), since `c₁=0`, we have `c₂ + c₃ = 0`, which means `c₃ = -c₂`. Substituting this in gives:\n        `(-c₂)a + c₂b = 0` => `c₂(b - a) = 0`.\n        Since we chose `a ≠ b`, this implies that `c₂ = 0`.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** If `c₁ = 0` and `c₂ = 0`, then from `c₃ = -c₂`, we get `c₃ = 0`.\n        The only solution is `c₁ = c₂ = c₃ = 0`.\n\n    This means the three vectors are linearly independent, provided we choose `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. For example, `a=1, b=2` or `a=1, b=0`. If we choose values that don't meet these conditions (e.g., `a=b` or `a=0`), the rank will be lower (1 or 2).\n\n    Therefore, the maximal number of linearly independent rows is 3.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
