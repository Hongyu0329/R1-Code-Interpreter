    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Space X:** We start with a metric continuum $X$ that is *hereditarily indecomposable*.\n        *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n        *   An **indecomposable continuum** is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n        *   **Hereditarily indecomposable** means that every subcontinuum of $X$ is itself indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is the canonical example. This property implies that $X$ is indecomposable.\n    *   **Space S:** We remove a single point $x$ from $X$ to get the space $S = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $\\{x\\}$ is closed, $S$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Compactification and Remainder:** We consider the Stone-Cech compactification of $S$, denoted $\\beta S$ or $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. The Stone-Cech remainder is the set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space: $K = \\beta S \\setminus S$.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the maximum possible number of **composants** of this remainder $K$.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Stone-Cech Remainder K:**\n    *   A key result in continuum theory, due to D.P. Bellamy, states that if $X$ is an indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $K = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is an **indecomposable continuum**.\n    *   Since $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum (it must have more than one point to be indecomposable), the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is non-empty, and its remainder $K$ is also a non-degenerate continuum.\n\n3.  **Establish a Lower Bound on the Number of Composants:**\n    *   A **composant** of an indecomposable continuum $Y$ is a maximal set of points that can be connected by proper subcontinua.\n    *   A fundamental theorem of indecomposable continua states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum must have **at least two** composants. (A continuum with only one composant is decomposable, unless it's a single point).\n    *   Since we've established that $K$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it must have at least 2 composants.\n\n4.  **Establish an Upper Bound on the Number of Composants:**\n    *   This is the most crucial part of the analysis and relies on a deep theorem by Jan van Mill.\n    *   Van Mill proved that for **any** indecomposable continuum $X$ (it does not need to be hereditarily indecomposable or metric) and any point $x \\in X$, the resulting Stone-Cech remainder $K = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ has **at most two** composants.\n    *   The proof hinges on analyzing how the composants of the original space $X$ relate to the structure of the remainder $K$. The core idea is that for any three distinct composants of $X$, at least two of them must be \"tangled together\" near the point $x$. This tangling prevents their \"ends\" in the remainder from separating into three or more distinct groups, thus limiting the number of composants of the remainder to a maximum of two.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Results and Conclude:**\n    *   From Step 3, we know the number of composants of $K$ is $\\ge 2$.\n    *   From Step 4, we know the number of composants of $K$ is $\\le 2$.\n    *   Combining these two facts, the number of composants of $K$ must be exactly 2.\n    *   This result holds for any indecomposable continuum $X$, which includes the specified case of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   Since the number of composants is always 2, the maximum possible number is also 2. It is known that this number is achieved, for example, by the Knaster \"bucket-handle\" continuum.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The space in question is not $X$, but the Stone-Cech remainder $K$.\n*   The properties of $K$ (being an indecomposable continuum) are inherited from $X$, but this is a non-trivial theorem.\n*   The property of $X$ being \"hereditarily\" indecomposable is stronger than what is needed for the result, which holds for all indecomposable continua. It is a form of extra, non-essential information.\n*   The conclusion relies on two separate theorems: one giving a lower bound for the number of composants of any indecomposable continuum, and another giving a specific upper bound for this particular type of construction.\n*   It's important to distinguish between the composants of the original space $X$ (of which there are uncountably many) and the composants of the remainder $K$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nLet $K$ be the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n1. By a theorem of Bellamy, since $X$ is an indecomposable continuum, $K$ is also a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n2. By a property of indecomposable continua, $K$ must have at least 2 composants.\n3. By a theorem of van Mill, $K$ has at most 2 composants.\n4. Therefore, $K$ must have exactly 2 composants.\n5. The maximum possible number of composants is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
