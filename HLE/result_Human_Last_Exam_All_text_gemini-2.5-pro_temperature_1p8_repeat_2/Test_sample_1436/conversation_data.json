    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Theoretical Framework and Diagram Topology\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram within the context of perturbative Green's function analysis. The key features are:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's label them $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction is represented by a propagator, which is a line connecting two points (fields).\n\nTo have four propagators connecting just two vertices, all four lines must connect $v_1$ to $v_2$. This means each vertex must have four lines attached to it. An interaction vertex with four fields is characteristic of a **$\\phi^4$ theory**, where the interaction Lagrangian is of the form $L_{int} \\propto \\phi^4$.\n\nThe diagram in question is a second-order contribution (since it has two interaction vertices) to a process. Since all field lines are contracted internally (four lines originate from $v_1$ and terminate at $v_2$, and vice versa), there are no external legs. This diagram is a **vacuum bubble** diagram, often called the \"setting sun\" diagram.\n\n**Visual Representation:**\nThe diagram consists of two points ($v_1$, $v_2$) with four distinct lines running between them.\n\n```\n      /-----\\\n     /-------\\\n(v1) -------- (v2)\n     \\-------/\n      \\-----/\n  (4 parallel lines)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor (S)\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, is a combinatorial number that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams that arise from the application of Wick's theorem in the perturbative expansion. It is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which, in simpler terms, is the number of ways the components of the diagram (its lines and vertices) can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure (connectivity).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe need to count all the permutation operations that leave the diagram topologically invariant. We can categorize these symmetries into two types:\n\n1.  **Permutation of Lines:** The diagram has four lines connecting vertex $v_1$ to vertex $v_2$. From a topological standpoint, these four lines are indistinguishable. You can swap any of these lines with any other, and the diagram remains identical. The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is given by the factorial of the number of lines.\n2.  **Permutation of Vertices:** The diagram has two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$. These vertices are also indistinguishable. If you swap the labels of $v_1$ and $v_2$, the diagram's structure is unchanged. The four lines that previously ran from $v_1$ to $v_2$ now run from $v_2$ to $v_1$, which represents the same set of connections. The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is given by the factorial of the number of vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Contribution from Each Symmetry\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Line Symmetry.**\n    There are 4 identical lines connecting the same two vertices. The number of permutations for these lines is $4!$.\n    $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Vertex Symmetry.**\n    There are 2 identical vertices that can be swapped. The number of permutations for these vertices is $2!$.\n    $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the number of permutations from all independent symmetry operations.\n\n$S = (\\text{Number of line permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations})$\n$S = 4! \\times 2!$\n$S = 24 \\times 2$\n$S = 48$\n\nThis means that in the perturbative expansion, there are 48 ways to form this specific diagram through Wick contractions of the fields from the two $\\phi^4$ interaction terms, which needs to be corrected for by dividing by $S=48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
