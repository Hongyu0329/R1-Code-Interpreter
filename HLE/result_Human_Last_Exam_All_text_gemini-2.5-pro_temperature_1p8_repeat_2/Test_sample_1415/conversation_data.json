    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the functions:** The problem defines a sequence of functions, each built upon the previous one.\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n2.  **Analyze the integrand:** The question asks to evaluate the definite integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`.\n    *   This expression is a classic form related to the derivative of a logarithm. Recall the chain rule for derivatives applied to logarithms: `d/dx(ln(u(x))) = u'(x)/u(x)`.\n    *   Therefore, the integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the integral:** We need to compute the definite integral from 0 to 1.\n    *   The integral is `∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`.\n    *   The antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n    *   Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value of the definite integral is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\n    *   This results in the expression: `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the boundary values:** We need to find the values of `F₃(x)` at `x=1` and `x=0`.\n    *   **At x = 0:**\n        *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n        *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n    *   **At x = 1:**\n        *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (Note: the argument '1' is in radians)\n        *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation (V):** The value of the integral, let's call it `V`, is:\n    *   `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n    *   Before substituting, we need to consider the absolute value.\n    *   For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between `sin(0)=0` and `sin(1)≈0.84`. So, `sin(x) ≥ 0`.\n    *   This means `e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2`.\n    *   Finally, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2) ≈ 0.693`.\n    *   Since `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`, the absolute value signs can be removed.\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n        `V = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n6.  **Numerical evaluation:** The final step is to calculate the numerical value of `V` and then `10000*V`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Recognizing the Integral Form:** The crucial first step is to recognize that `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = ln|f(x)| + C`. Attempting to explicitly differentiate `F₃(x)` and then integrate the resulting complex fraction would be extremely difficult.\n*   **Radians vs. Degrees:** The trigonometric function `sin(1)` implies 1 radian, not 1 degree. This is standard in calculus.\n*   **Absolute Value:** Don't forget the absolute value in the general antiderivative `ln|f(x)|`. Always check if the function `f(x)` (in this case, `F₃(x)`) could be negative over the interval of integration.\n*   **Logarithm Properties:** Be careful with the nested logarithms in the final expression. The value of the integral is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, not `ln(F₃(1) - F₃(0))`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Set up the definite integral evaluation.**\nAs established, `V = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1).**\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute these values into the expression for V.**\n*   `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the numerical calculation.**\n*   `sin(1 radian) ≈ 0.841471`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.31977`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.31977) = ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.20000`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n*   Now calculate `V`:\n    `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.20000) - ln(0.69315)`\n    `V ≈ 0.18232 - (-0.36651) ≈ 0.54883`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final required value.**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54883 = 5488.3`\n*   The closest integer to `5488.3` is `5488`.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
