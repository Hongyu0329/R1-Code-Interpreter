The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for gyrotropy (a broader interpretation of optical activity) are $\bar{4}$, $\bar{4}2m$, and $\bar{4}3m$. Under the strictest definition of optical activity, no such crystal classes exist as the conditions are mutually exclusive.
