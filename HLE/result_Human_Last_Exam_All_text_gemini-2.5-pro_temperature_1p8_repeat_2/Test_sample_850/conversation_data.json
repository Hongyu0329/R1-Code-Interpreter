    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question's Conditions**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that meet three specific criteria:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal's structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The key symmetry elements that make a class achiral are **improper rotation axes** ($\\bar{n}$), which include a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) and mirror planes ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal has no unique polar axis, meaning there is no direction where the crystal's properties are different in the positive and negative sense. This symmetry forbids properties like pyroelectricity. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** This is the most critical and nuanced condition.\n    *   **Strict Definition:** Optical activity, defined as the rotation of the plane of polarized light propagating through the material, can only occur in **chiral** crystal classes. Chiral classes are those that lack *any* improper rotation axes ($\\bar{1}$, $m$, etc.).\n    *   **The Contradiction:** Based on the strict definition, a crystal class cannot be both **achiral** (Condition 1) and **optically active** (Condition 3). These two conditions are mutually exclusive. Therefore, no crystal class can satisfy the query as literally stated.\n\n**2. A Broader Interpretation of \"Optical Activity\"**\n\nTo find a meaningful answer, we must assume the question uses \"optical activity\" in a broader sense to mean **gyrotropy**. Gyrotropy is the underlying physical phenomenon that gives rise to optical activity.\n\n*   **Gyrotropy:** This property is described by a third-rank tensor ($\\gamma_{ijk}$). For this tensor to be non-zero, the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$).\n*   **Important Nuance:** While all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes could potentially show gyrotropy, the effect is forbidden in two of them ($\\bar{6}$ and $\\bar{6}m2$) because they possess a horizontal mirror plane ($m_h$).\n*   **Revised Goal:** We will search for crystal classes that are: **Achiral**, **Non-polar**, and **Gyrotropic** (non-centrosymmetric and not in the set {$\\bar{6}, \\bar{6}m2$}).\n\n**3. Filtering the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe will apply the conditions sequentially to find the answer.\n\n*   **Start with Gyrotropic Classes:**\n    First, we identify the classes that allow for gyrotropy. These are the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, minus the two exceptions.\n    *   21 Non-centrosymmetric classes: {1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, $\\bar{4}$, 422, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, $\\bar{6}$, 622, 6mm, $\\bar{6}$m2, 23, 432, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n    *   Remove non-gyrotropic exceptions ($\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2).\n    *   **Resulting 19 Gyrotropic Classes:** {1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, $\\bar{4}$, 422, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, 622, 6mm, 23, 432, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n\n*   **Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition:**\n    Next, from this list of 19 gyrotropic classes, we select those that are achiral (i.e., contain an improper rotation axis like $m$ or $\\bar{4}$). The chiral classes are {1, 2, 222, 4, 422, 3, 32, 6, 622, 23, 432}. Removing these leaves us with the achiral ones.\n    *   **Resulting 8 Gyrotropic and Achiral Classes:** {m, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3m, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n\n*   **Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition:**\n    Finally, from this list of 8, we remove any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n    *   Our list: {m, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3m, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n    *   Classes to remove from our list: {m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm}\n    *   **Final Resulting Classes:** {$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{4}$3m}\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  The primary challenge is recognizing the semantic contradiction between \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" in their standard definitions.\n2.  Resolving the contradiction requires a deeper physical understanding, reinterpreting \"optical activity\" as the more general phenomenon of \"gyrotropy.\"\n3.  The condition for gyrotropy is non-centrosymmetry, but with specific exceptions ($\\bar{6}$ and $\\bar{6}$m2) that also forbid the effect.\n4.  It is essential to correctly identify the polar crystal classes to apply the \"non-polar\" condition accurately.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy following the systematic filtering process based on a physically sound interpretation of the question's terms, we arrive at the final list of crystal classes.\n\n1.  Start with all 32 classes.\n2.  Select the 19 that are gyrotropic.\n3.  From these 19, select the 8 that are also achiral.\n4.  From these 8, select the 3 that are also non-polar.\n\nThe three crystal classes that satisfy all conditions are **$\\bar{4}$**, **$\\bar{4}2m$**, and **$\\bar{4}3m$**.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for gyrotropy (a broader interpretation of optical activity) are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, and $\\bar{4}3m$. Under the strictest definition of optical activity, no such crystal classes exist as the conditions are mutually exclusive.>>>"
