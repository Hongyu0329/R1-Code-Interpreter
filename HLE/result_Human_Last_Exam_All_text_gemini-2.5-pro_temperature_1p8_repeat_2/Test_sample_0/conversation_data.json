    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts**\n    *   **Population Ethics:** This field of ethics deals with questions about the value of populations of different sizes and with different levels of well-being. A key question is whether it's good, bad, or neutral to create new people.\n    *   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** Gustaf Arrhenius proved a series of theorems showing that it's impossible for any theory of population ethics to simultaneously satisfy a set of individually plausible and desirable conditions. The \"sixth impossibility theorem\" is one such collection of conditions.\n    *   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a family of theories in population ethics. They state that adding a new person to the world is a good thing only if that person's welfare is *above a certain positive critical level (c)*. If their welfare is below this level (even if it's still a positive, happy life), adding them makes the world worse. The value of a population is often calculated as the sum of (welfare - critical level) for everyone in the population.\n\n2.  **Define the Conditions in the Answer Choices**\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** For two populations of the same size, if one (A) has a perfectly equal distribution of welfare and the other (B) has an unequal distribution but the same average welfare, then A is better than B. This favors equality.\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** Gives priority to helping the worse-off. It states that adding one person with sufficiently bad welfare is worse than adding any number of people with high welfare. It prevents benefits to the best-off from always outweighing harms to the worst-off.\n    *   **C. Non-Elitism:** States that quantity can make up for quality. Specifically, for any two positive welfare levels, *h* (high) and *g* (good), no matter how high *h* is, a sufficiently large number of people at level *g* is better than a single person at level *h*. This rules out views that would prize one super-happy person over any number of moderately happy people.\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** A very basic principle. It says that adding a person with a happy life (positive welfare) is at least as good as adding a person with a miserable life (negative welfare), all else being equal.\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** States that there exists *at least one* positive welfare level such that adding a person with that level of welfare makes the world better. It means it must be possible, in principle, to improve the world by creating a happy person.\n\n3.  **Test Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition**\n    Let's use a simple critical-level view where the value of a population is the sum of (uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the welfare of individual *i* and *c* is the positive critical level (*c* > 0).\n\n    *   **vs. Egalitarian Dominance (A):** The simple sum-based critical-level view is indifferent to equality in same-sized populations with the same average welfare, because Σ(uᵢ - c) = n*(average(u) - c). It doesn't satisfy the condition, but it's not the primary, unavoidable conflict associated with these views. More complex versions can be made to satisfy it.\n\n    *   **vs. General Non-Extreme Priority (B):** Adding *n* people at high welfare *g* gives a value change of *n*(g-c). Adding one person at very low (negative) welfare *b* gives a value change of (b-c). Since we can make *b* arbitrarily negative, the value (b-c) can always be made lower than *n*(g-c). Thus, this condition is satisfied.\n\n    *   **vs. Non-Elitism (C):** The condition states that for any *h > g > 0*, there's a number *n* where *n* people at level *g* is better than one person at *h*.\n        *   Let's choose our levels strategically with respect to the critical level *c*. Pick a high welfare level *h* that is above the critical level (*h > c*). Pick a good, positive welfare level *g* that is *below* the critical level (*c > g > 0*).\n        *   Value of one person at level *h*: V₁ = (h - c). Since *h > c*, this value is positive.\n        *   Value of *n* people at level *g*: V₂ = n * (g - c). Since *c > g*, the term (g - c) is negative.\n        *   Therefore, V₂ is negative for any *n* ≥ 1.\n        *   The condition requires that we can find an *n* such that V₂ > V₁. But here, V₂ (negative) can *never* be greater than V₁ (positive).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The critical-level view violates Non-Elitism. It implies that one person with welfare above the critical level is better than any number of people whose happy lives fall below that same critical level.\n\n    *   **vs. Weak Non-Sadism (D):** Is adding a person with welfare *u > 0* at least as good as adding a person with welfare *v < 0*? The change in value is (u - c) vs (v - c). Since *u > v*, it follows that (u - c) > (v - c). The condition is satisfied.\n\n    *   **vs. Weak Quality Addition (E):** Is there at least one positive welfare level *g* where adding a person makes the world better? We need to find a *g > 0* such that the change in value, (g - c), is positive. This means we need *g > c*. Since *c* is just a finite positive number, we can always find such a *g* (e.g., *g = c + 1*). So, the condition is satisfied.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that critical-level views inherently violate the **Non-Elitism** condition. This happens because these views consider adding people with positive welfare that is below the critical level to be a bad thing, making the total value of the population decrease. Consequently, a large population of such people can be seen as worse than a small population (even a single person) with welfare above the critical level.\n\n<<<C>>>"
