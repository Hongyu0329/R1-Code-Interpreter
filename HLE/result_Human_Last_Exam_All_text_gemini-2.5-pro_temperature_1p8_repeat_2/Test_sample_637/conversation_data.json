    "This problem requires designing a deadbeat observer for a given discrete-time system. A deadbeat observer is one that forces the observation error to zero in the minimum possible number of time steps. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin (z=0).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. System and Observer Definition**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`, `B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`, `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe state vector `x` has dimension `n=4`. The output vector `y` has dimension `p=2`.\nA full-state observer has the following structure:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nwhere `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)` and `L` is the 4x2 observer gain matrix we need to design.\n\nThe observation error is defined as `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`. The dynamics of this error are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\n**2. Deadbeat Observer Requirement**\n\nThe goal is to make the error `e(k)` zero as quickly as possible. This is achieved by placing all the poles (eigenvalues) of the error dynamics matrix `A_c = A - LC` at the origin of the z-plane. This means the characteristic polynomial of `A_c` must be `det(λI - A_c) = λ^n = λ^4`.\n\n**3. Check for Observability**\n\nBefore we can place the observer poles arbitrarily, we must ensure the system is observable. A system is observable if its observability matrix `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ..., CA^(n-1)]` has full rank (`rank(O) = n = 4`).\n\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n    `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   `CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n    The matrix `[C; CA]` has 4 rows. We check its rank. The rows `[1,0,0,0]` (from C), `[0,0,0,1]` (from C, row2-row1), and `[0,0,1,0]` (from CA, row2+2*row1) are linearly independent. The rank is 3. We need to go further.\n*   `CA^2 = CA * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0] * A = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\n    The second row of `CA^2`, `[2, 1, 0, -3]`, is linearly independent of the previous rows. It introduces the missing `[0,1,0,0]` direction.\n\nThus, the rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]` is 4. The system is observable, and pole placement is possible. The smallest integer `v` for which `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]) = n` is `v=3`. This is the observability index. A deadbeat response can be achieved in at most `v=3` steps.\n\n**4. Pole Placement Strategy**\n\nWe need to find the gain matrix `L` such that `det(λI - (A-LC)) = λ^4`. This is a pole placement problem for a multi-output system. We can simplify this using the principle of duality. The eigenvalues of `A-LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of `A' - C'L'`. This transforms the observer design problem into a state-feedback controller design problem for the dual system `(A', C')` with feedback gain `L'`.\n\n*   **Dual System:**\n    `A' = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`, `C' = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\n*   **Simplification to SISO:** The dual system is a multi-input system (`m=p=2`). To simplify the design, we can find *a* solution by restricting the dual system's input `v` to a single direction `g`, where `g` is a column vector. The new system becomes `(A', C'g)`, which is a single-input single-output (SISO) system. We must choose `g` such that this SISO system is controllable. Let's try `g = [1; 0]`.\n    *   This choice is equivalent to restricting the structure of `L`. The dual feedback gain `L'` is related to a SISO gain `k'` by `L' = g k'`. This implies that `row2(L')` is zero, which in turn means `col2(L)` is a zero vector (`l_i2 = 0` for `i=1,2,3,4`).\n\n**5. Calculation of the Gain Matrix `L`**\n\nWith the constraint `l_i2 = 0`, the matrix `LC` becomes:\n`LC = [l_11; l_21; l_31; l_41] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]_row1 = [l_11; l_21; l_31; l_41] * [1 0 0 0]` -> No, `LC = L * C`.\n`LC = [l_11 0; l_21 0; l_31 0; l_41 0] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] = [l_11 0 0 0; l_21 0 0 0; l_31 0 0 0; l_41 0 0 0]`\n\nThe error dynamics matrix `A_c = A - LC` is:\n`A_c = [-1-l_11  0  0  1; 1-l_21  0  0  2; -l_31  1  0 -1; -1-l_41  0  1 -1]`\n\nNow, we compute its characteristic polynomial `det(λI - A_c)` and set it to `λ^4`.\n`det(λI - A_c) = det([λ+1+l_11  0  0  -1; -1+l_21  λ  0  -2; l_31  -1  λ  1; 1+l_41  0  -1  λ+1])`\n\nExpanding the determinant (e.g., along the third column) yields:\n`P(λ) = λ^4 + (2+l_11)λ^3 + (3+l_11+l_41)λ^2 + (-2+l_11+l_21+3l_31)λ + (l_21-2l_11-3)`\n\nWe set the coefficients of the polynomial to zero:\n1.  `coeff(λ^3): 2 + l_11 = 0   =>   l_11 = -2`\n2.  `coeff(λ^0): l_21 - 2l_11 - 3 = 0   =>   l_21 - 2(-2) - 3 = 0   =>   l_21 + 1 = 0   =>   l_21 = -1`\n3.  `coeff(λ^2): 3 + l_11 + l_41 = 0   =>   3 + (-2) + l_41 = 0   =>   1 + l_41 = 0   =>   l_41 = -1`\n4.  `coeff(λ^1): -2 + l_11 + l_21 + 3l_31 = 0   =>   -2 + (-2) + (-1) + 3l_31 = 0   =>   -5 + 3l_31 = 0   =>   l_31 = 5/3`\n\n**6. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nWe have found all the non-zero elements of the observer gain matrix `L`.\n`L = [l_11 l_12; l_21 l_22; l_31 l_32; l_41 l_42]`\n\nSubstituting the calculated values and remembering `l_i2=0`:\n`l_11 = -2`, `l_12 = 0`\n`l_21 = -1`, `l_22 = 0`\n`l_31 = 5/3`, `l_32 = 0`\n`l_41 = -1`, `l_42 = 0`\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [-2 0; -1 0; 5/3 0; -1 0]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Observability:** Pole placement for an observer is only possible if the system is observable. This must always be the first check.\n*   **MIMO vs SISO:** The pole placement procedure is more complex for multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems than for single-input/single-output (SISO) systems. Using duality to transform the problem into a state-feedback design is a standard technique.\n*   **Non-uniqueness of Solution:** For MIMO systems, the gain matrix `L` that achieves a specific pole placement is generally not unique. By simplifying the dual control problem to a SISO case (choosing a specific vector `g`), we find one valid solution out of many possible solutions. Any of these valid solutions would be a correct answer.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The derivation of the characteristic polynomial is the most error-prone step. Care must be taken during the determinant expansion and collection of coefficients.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [1.6666666666666667, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
