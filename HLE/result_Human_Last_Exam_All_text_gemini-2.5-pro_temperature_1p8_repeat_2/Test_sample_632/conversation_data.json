    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This implies a man-made structure that was part of the square's landscape.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** \"Until 1950\", at which point the city administration removed it.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating and Eliminating Obvious Candidates\nWe need to consider known architectural features of the piazza and see if they fit the criteria.\n*   **The Pantheon:** This is the main feature, but it was not removed.\n*   **The Fontana del Pantheon (Fountain of the Pantheon) with its obelisk:** This is another major feature, but it is still present in the square today. It was not removed.\n*   **\"The Donkey's Ears\" (Le Orecchie d'Asino):** These were two bell towers added to the Pantheon's facade by the artist Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely disliked and were indeed removed. However, they were removed in 1883, not in 1950. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **Buildings surrounding the Pantheon:** Major demolitions of houses and buildings around the Pantheon did occur to create a more open space, but this happened primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially during the Fascist era (1920s-1930s), well before 1950.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating Features of the Mid-20th Century\nSince the obvious historic features do not fit the 1950 date, we must consider features that existed in the first half of the 20th century. A key aspect of urban architecture from that period was public transportation infrastructure.\n*   **Rome's Tram Network:** Like many major cities, Rome had an extensive tram (streetcar) network in the early 20th century.\n*   **Route through the Piazza:** Historical photographs and maps confirm that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing very close to the fountain and the Pantheon's entrance.\n*   **Nature of the feature:** This system included metal tracks set into the cobblestones and, most significantly, a network of overhead electrical wires and poles to power the trams. This modern infrastructure was a prominent and visually jarring feature against the backdrop of the ancient temple, making its presence in this specific historic square a \"unique\" and controversial architectural arrangement.\n\n### Step 4: Confirming the Removal and Date\n*   **The Post-War Shift:** After World War II, many cities began dismantling their tram networks in favor of more flexible bus routes and to accommodate the rise of private cars.\n*   **Removal in Rome:** Rome's administration undertook a large-scale decommissioning of its central tram lines during the 1950s and 1960s. The line passing through Piazza della Rotonda was one of those removed during this period. While the process was gradual across the city, the year 1950 falls directly within the timeframe when the policy of removing these central lines was being implemented.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe \"unique architectural feature\" was not a building or a monument, but the city's tram line, including its tracks and overhead power cables. Its removal in the post-war era, around 1950, dramatically changed the visual landscape of the square, restoring a more unobstructed view of the Pantheon.\n\n***\n\n<<<The tram line (tracks and overhead electrical wires) that passed through the square.>>>"
