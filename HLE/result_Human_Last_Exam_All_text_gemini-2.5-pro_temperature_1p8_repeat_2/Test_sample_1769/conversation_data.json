    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word and its Origin:** The Modern English word is \"sister\". Etymologically, this word comes from Old Norse *systir*. While Old English had a native, related word, the form we use today was either directly borrowed from or heavily reshaped by the Old Norse word spoken by Viking invaders and settlers.\n\n2.  **Identify the Native Anglo-Saxon Word:** Before the Viking Age, the word for \"sister\" in Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) was *sweostor*. It also appeared in related forms like *swuster*. Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* descend from the same ancient root, the Proto-Germanic word **swestēr*. They are \"cognates\" – linguistic cousins.\n\n3.  **Understand the Historical Interaction:** Between the 7th and 12th centuries, Norse-speaking Vikings raided and settled large parts of England, an area that came to be known as the Danelaw. In this region, Old English and Old Norse speakers lived side-by-side. Because the languages were related, communication was possible, and words were frequently exchanged. In many cases where the two languages had a cognate word for the same thing, one version eventually won out. For the word \"sister\", the cleaner, simpler phonetics of the Old Norse *systir* (with a hard /s/ and /k/-like /t/) proved more resilient than the Old English *sweostor* (with its /sw/ cluster and /eo/ diphthong).\n\n4.  **Hypothesize a Timeline Without Norse Influence:** The question requires us to imagine an England where the Viking invasions never happened. In this alternate timeline, there would be no Old Norse *systir* to compete with the native Old English *sweostor*. Therefore, the Modern English word would be the natural evolution of *sweostor*.\n\n5.  **Trace the Natural Evolution of the Native Word:** We must look at how Old English words evolved into Middle and then Modern English, following natural sound changes. We can see this path by looking at how the word *sweostor* actually did evolve in parts of England with less Norse influence (like the South and West).\n    *   In late Old English and early Middle English, the Old English form *sweostor* commonly became *suster*.\n    *   The initial `sw-` sound was simplified to `s-`.\n    *   The `eo` vowel sound shifted, often towards a `u` sound.\n    *   This form, **suster**, was the common word for \"sister\" in the Middle English of writers like Geoffrey Chaucer (e.g., in *The Canterbury Tales*) and in Wycliffe's Bible during the 14th century. It survived in various dialects for centuries.\n\n6.  **Project the Evolution to Modern English:** Had the Norse-influenced \"sister\" not become dominant in London and later the standard language, the native form *suster* would have been the one to continue its evolution into Modern English. It is the most direct and historically attested descendant of the original Anglo-Saxon word.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **It's not about inventing a new word:** We are not making up a word from scratch. We are tracing the documented, historical evolution of the native word that was displaced.\n*   **Cognates vs. Borrowing:** This is a key point. The Norse didn't introduce a new concept, but their version of the word replaced the Anglo-Saxon one.\n*   **Dialectal Evidence:** The survival of *suster* in dialects and in major Middle English texts is the strongest piece of evidence for what the \"standard\" word would have been.\n*   **Phonetic Simplicity:** The replacement was likely driven by the fact that *systir* was phonetically simpler and clearer than *sweostor*, making it easier to adopt in a mixed-language environment.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the linguistic influence from Old Norse, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have followed its own evolutionary path. Historical and dialectal evidence strongly shows this path led to the Middle English word *suster*. This form would have likely carried on into Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
