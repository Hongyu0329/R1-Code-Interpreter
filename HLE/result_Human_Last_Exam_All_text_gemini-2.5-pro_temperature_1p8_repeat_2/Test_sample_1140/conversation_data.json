    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Molecule:** A 100-amino acid peptide (which can also be considered a small protein).\n    *   **Key Feature 1 (Length):** At 100 amino acids, this peptide is quite long.\n    *   **Key Feature 2 (Composition):** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically Azido Phenylalanine (let's call it AzF), at position 'X'.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the most helpful technique for its synthesis.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:** We need to consider common methods for making peptides and proteins and assess their suitability for this specific challenge.\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression**\n        *   **Process:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (e.g., *E. coli*), which then uses its ribosomal machinery to synthesize the peptide.\n        *   **Suitability:** This method is excellent for producing long peptides/proteins (>50 aa) made of the 20 standard amino acids. However, it fails here because the standard genetic code has no codon for Azido Phenylalanine. The cell's machinery cannot naturally incorporate this UAA.\n        *   **Verdict:** Inadequate on its own.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Direct Chemical Synthesis (Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis - SPPS)**\n        *   **Process:** Amino acids are sequentially added to a growing peptide chain anchored to a solid resin. The process is automated.\n        *   **Suitability for UAA:** This method is excellent for incorporating UAAs. One simply needs to use the appropriately protected building block (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) in the correct cycle.\n        *   **Suitability for Length:** This is the major drawback. The efficiency of each amino acid coupling step is not 100% (typically 99-99.8%). Over 100 coupling cycles, this small inefficiency compounds dramatically. For a 100-step synthesis with 99% efficiency per step, the theoretical maximum yield is (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, the yield is often much lower, making purification of the full-length product from a complex mixture of shorter, failed sequences extremely difficult and the overall process very expensive and impractical.\n        *   **Verdict:** Possible in theory, but highly impractical and not the \"most helpful\" due to the length of the peptide.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **Process:** This is a semi-synthetic method. It overcomes the length limitation of SPPS by breaking the target peptide into smaller, more manageable fragments. For a 100aa peptide, one might synthesize two 50aa fragments using SPPS. The UAA (AzF) would be incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its synthesis. Then, these fragments are chemically joined (ligated) in solution to form the full-length peptide. The classic NCL reaction requires one peptide to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal Cysteine.\n        *   **Suitability:** This is a very powerful method. A 50aa peptide is easily synthesized by SPPS with high purity and good yield. The ligation step is typically very efficient and specific. This method successfully combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis (for UAA incorporation) with the ability to create long peptides.\n        *   **Verdict:** A very strong candidate and a highly helpful technique for this specific problem.\n\n    *   **Technique 4: Genetic Code Expansion (Amber Suppression Method)**\n        *   **Process:** This is an advanced form of recombinant protein expression. It engineers the host organism to handle the UAA. It requires two special components:\n            1.  An **orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pair**: A synthetase enzyme is engineered to exclusively recognize the UAA (AzF) and attach it to a specific tRNA molecule.\n            2.  A **suppressor tRNA**: This tRNA is engineered to recognize a rare codon, usually a stop codon like the amber codon (UAG).\n            The gene for the peptide is modified to have the UAG codon at the position where 'X' (the UAA) should be. When the host cell is grown in media supplemented with AzF, the engineered system allows the ribosome to read the UAG codon, incorporate AzF, and continue synthesis, producing the full-length protein containing the UAA.\n        *   **Suitability:** This technique is specifically designed for site-specific incorporation of UAAs into recombinantly expressed proteins. The 100aa length is easily handled by the ribosome. It leverages the efficiency and scalability of biological production systems.\n        *   **Verdict:** Also a very strong candidate. This is the premier biological approach for solving this exact problem.\n\n3.  **Final Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   We have narrowed it down to two excellent techniques: **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** and **Genetic Code Expansion**.\n    *   **NCL** is a chemical biology approach. Its strength is in the direct control and its ability to bypass the complexities of optimizing a biological expression system.\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion** is a synthetic biology approach. Its strength is in leveraging the power and scalability of ribosomal synthesis once the initial molecular biology work is done. It is arguably the most common and powerful method for generating proteins with site-specifically incorporated UAAs in modern research, especially for production at a reasonable scale.\n    *   Given the question asks for the \"most helpful\" technique, Genetic Code Expansion is an exceptional answer because it directly modifies the most powerful protein production machinery (the ribosome) to perform the desired task. It elegantly solves the central problem of the UAA within a scalable biological framework.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **The length (100aa) is critical.** It pushes the limits of direct chemical synthesis (SPPS), making methods that bypass this limitation (NCL, Genetic Code Expansion) far more suitable.\n*   **The Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA) is critical.** It rules out standard recombinant expression and forces the use of more specialized techniques.\n*   **The term \"most helpful\" is subjective.** Both NCL and Genetic Code Expansion are excellent solutions. However, for producing a modified protein (as opposed to a purely chemically synthesized peptide), Genetic Code Expansion is a more direct *in vivo* solution that is highly scalable and widely used for this purpose. It modifies the fundamental process of protein synthesis itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the technique of expanding the genetic code to incorporate the unnatural amino acid during ribosomal synthesis is the most sophisticated and powerful solution.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion>>>"
