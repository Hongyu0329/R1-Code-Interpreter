    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom with a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a single *genus* of mushroom. The defining characteristic of this genus is that it produces a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the key terms**\n*   **Genus:** This is a formal taxonomic rank in biology, one level above species. We are looking for a scientific name, not a common name.\n*   **Spore Print:** This is a crucial tool for mushroom identification. It is the color of the powder-like deposit of microscopic spores that falls from the gills or pores of a mushroom cap onto a surface. The color is a consistent trait at the genus or species level.\n*   **Distinctly Blue:** This is a highly unusual color for a spore print. Most spore prints are in shades of white, pink, brown, or black.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate between mushroom color and spore print color**\nThis is a critical point of potential confusion. Many mushrooms have a blue color on their cap, stem, or flesh, but this does not mean their spore print is blue.\n*   **Example 1:** The Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) is a vibrant blue mushroom, but its spore print is cream to yellowish.\n*   **Example 2:** Many species in the *Boletus* and *Psilocybe* genera stain blue when bruised or cut, but their spore prints are olive-brown and purplish-brown, respectively.\nThe question is specifically about the spore print itself being blue.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct genus**\nWhile a blue spore print is exceptionally rare, mycological sources confirm that there is indeed one genus known to contain species that produce this color.\n*   The vast majority of mushroom genera do not produce blue spores.\n*   The family *Entolomataceae*, which includes the genus *Entoloma*, is primarily defined by its angular spores that typically create a pink or salmon-colored spore print.\n*   However, within the very large and diverse genus *Entoloma*, a small number of species, particularly those in the subgenus *Leptonia*, are notable exceptions. These species can produce a spore print that is described as sky-blue, lilac-blue, or grayish-blue. This makes *Entoloma* the only genus known to feature this rare trait.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Not all species in the genus have blue spores.** It is vital to remember that only a few species within the large *Entoloma* genus have a blue spore print. Most have the characteristic pink spore print of the family. The existence of any species with this trait within the genus makes *Entoloma* the answer.\n2.  **Color perception can be subtle.** The \"blue\" color can be faint and may appear more grayish-blue or have lilac tints depending on the species, the freshness of the sample, and the thickness of the spore deposit.\n3.  **Rarity.** This is an extremely rare characteristic in the fungal kingdom, which is why it is often the subject of trivia questions in mycology.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, we have filtered out mushrooms that are blue in color but lack a blue spore print. We have identified that while the *Entolomataceae* family is known for pink spores, the genus *Entoloma* is the sole genus that contains species reported to have a truly blue spore print. Therefore, the name of the genus is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
