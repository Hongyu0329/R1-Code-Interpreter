    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key clues.**\nThe question provides several specific pieces of information to identify the physicist:\n1.  **Field of Fame:** The person is a physicist best known for their work in microscopy.\n2.  **The Discovery:** They discovered an \"optical effect.\"\n3.  **Context of Discovery:** The effect relates to \"real imagery.\" Real images are formed by optical systems like concave mirrors and converging lenses where light rays physically converge.\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** The discovery was accidental and involved a custodial worker.\n5.  **Specific Object:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors when the phenomenon was observed.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential candidates based on the \"microscopy\" clue.**\nSeveral physicists have made foundational contributions to microscopy. Key figures include:\n*   Ernst Abbe (Abbe diffraction limit)\n*   Frits Zernike (Phase-contrast microscopy)\n*   Georges Nomarski (Differential Interference Contrast microscopy)\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each candidate against the other clues.**\n*   **Ernst Abbe:** His work was fundamental and theoretical, revolving around the limits of resolution. There is no widely known story connecting his discoveries to a custodial worker or an accidental observation on a mirror.\n*   **Frits Zernike:** He won the Nobel Prize for inventing phase-contrast microscopy, a method to see transparent specimens. His discovery was a brilliant insight into the physics of diffraction gratings, but it does not involve the story described in the question.\n*   **Georges Nomarski:** He was a Polish-French physicist who is famous for inventing Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, often called Nomarski microscopy. Let's check the story of his discovery.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the discovery story of Georges Nomarski.**\nThe story of Nomarski's discovery is a well-known anecdote in the field of optics.\n*   While working at the Institut d'Optique in Paris, a cleaner (custodial worker) was tasked with polishing some optical components, including concave mirrors.\n*   The cleaner inadvertently smeared some polishing compound (rouge) across the surface of one of the concave mirrors.\n*   When Georges Nomarski later looked at the mirror, he noticed something remarkable. Dust particles on the mirror's surface, which were previously invisible, suddenly appeared in stark, pseudo-3D relief.\n*   He realized that the smeared, uneven layer of polishing compound was acting as an imperfect phase plate. It was altering the phase of light reflecting off the surface in a way that depended on the local slope of the surface. This converted invisible phase differences (the tiny height of the dust particles) into visible intensity differences.\n*   This accidental observation of an optical effect on a concave mirror—caused by the action of a custodial worker—gave him the crucial insight that led to his invention of the Nomarski prism and the development of DIC microscopy.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion based on the evidence.**\nGeorges Nomarski perfectly matches every single detail provided in the question:\n*   He is a physicist renowned for his work in microscopy (DIC).\n*   He discovered a major optical effect (differential interference contrast).\n*   The effect was first seen in the context of a concave mirror, which forms real images.\n*   The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation linked directly to a custodial worker's actions.\n\nTherefore, the physicist in question is Georges Nomarski.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
