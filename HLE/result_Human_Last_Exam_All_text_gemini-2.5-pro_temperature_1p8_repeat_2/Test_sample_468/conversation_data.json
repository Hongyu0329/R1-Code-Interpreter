    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Genus and its Characteristics\nThe question asks about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. This is a very large genus of bees belonging to the family Andrenidae. They are native to North America, with the highest diversity in the arid desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico. A key characteristic of these bees is their extremely small size, with some species being among the smallest bees in the world.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Currently Used Common Name\nTo find the common name, we look at authoritative and popular sources such as entomological databases, field guides, and conservation literature.\n*   **Scientific Literature:** Older scientific monographs, such as those by P.H. Timberlake who extensively studied the genus, primarily use the scientific name *Perdita*.\n*   **Official Databases:** The Entomological Society of America (ESA) Common Names database does not list an official, standardized common name for the entire genus *Perdita*.\n*   **Modern Guides and Publications:** In more recent popular field guides and conservation resources, a specific common name is consistently used. Sources like \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016), \"California Bees and Blooms\" (Frankie, Thorp, et al., 2014), and resources from the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation all refer to the genus *Perdita* with a particular name.\n*   **Conclusion on Name:** The most widely adopted and currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is **Fairy bees**. This name aptly describes their diminutive size and often delicate, iridescent appearance.\n\n### Step 3: Determine When the Common Name Was Coined\nDetermining the exact \"coining\" date for an informal common name is challenging, as such names often develop through oral tradition among specialists before appearing in print. The best approach is to find the earliest verifiable use in a major, influential publication, which marks its formal introduction to a wider audience.\n*   **Pre-2000s Literature:** An examination of major 20th-century works, including the comprehensive volumes on *Perdita* by Timberlake and broad overviews like Michener's \"The Bees of the World\" (2007), shows no use of the term \"Fairy bees,\" indicating it is a relatively recent moniker.\n*   **21st-Century Publications:** The name began to appear in the early 21st century, often associated with entomologists on the West Coast of the United States, such as the late Dr. Robbin Thorp.\n*   **First Major Publication:** A key publication that solidified the name is **\"Attracting Native Pollinators: The Xerces Society Guide\"**, which was published in **2011**. In a comprehensive table of North American bee genera (page 248), this guide explicitly lists \"Fairy bee\" as the common name for *Perdita*. Given the Xerces Society's influence, this publication is a strong candidate for the first major, authoritative source to codify the name for public use.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the common name is \"Fairy bees,\" and the most reliable date for its establishment in a major publication is 2011.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2011>>>"
