    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:** The word in question is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Identify the Morae:** A mora is a unit of sound that determines syllable weight and timing. The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n\n3.  **Define the Pitch Accent Patterns:** Standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect) pitch accent is generally categorized into four main types:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. When a particle (like が, を) follows, the particle also remains high. The pitch does not fall. (Pattern: L-H-H-H...)\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, staying low for all subsequent morae, including any following particle. (Pattern: H-L-L-L...)\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, peaks somewhere in the middle of the word, and then drops *before* the last mora. The following particle is low. (e.g., for a 4-mora word: L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L)\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. (Pattern for the word: L-H-H...H; Pattern with particle: L-H-H...H-L)\n\n4.  **Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (おとうと):** To find the standard accent, we refer to Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation Accent Dictionary). These dictionaries assign a number to indicate the accent pattern.\n    *   For 「おとうと」, the standard pitch accent is denoted as **[0]**.\n\n5.  **Interpret the [0] Accent Notation:** In the numerical system for pitch accent:\n    *   **[0]** represents the **Heiban** pattern.\n    *   [1] represents the Atamadaka pattern.\n    *   [2], [3], etc., (up to one less than the number of morae) represent Nakadaka patterns.\n    *   A number equal to the number of morae represents the Odaka pattern.\n\n6.  **Apply the Pattern to 「おとうと」:** Since 「おとうと」 has the [0] accent, it follows the Heiban pattern.\n    *   The pitch contour is: **お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high)**.\n    *   If a particle like 「が」 follows, it would be: **お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) - が(high)**.\n\n7.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The determined pattern, Heiban, corresponds directly to answer choice A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It's important to distinguish between kanji, reading, and morae. The analysis is based on the morae of the reading 「おとうと」.\n*   The \"long vowel\" sound in 「とう」 (tou) is treated as two separate morae: と (to) and う (u).\n*   Standard Japanese pitch accent refers to the pattern used in the Tokyo dialect, which is considered the standard for broadcasting and formal education. Regional dialects may have different accent patterns for the same word.\n*   The notation system ([0], [1], [2], etc.) is a concise way to represent these patterns, and understanding what each number means is key to solving this type of question. [0] is unique to Heiban.\n\n**Final Answer:** Based on the step-by-step analysis, the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
