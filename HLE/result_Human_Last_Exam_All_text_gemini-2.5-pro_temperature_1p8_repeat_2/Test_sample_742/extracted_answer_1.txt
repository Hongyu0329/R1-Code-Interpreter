No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, which deals with physical states, observables, and probabilistic outcomes in our contingent universe, lacks any of the fundamental concepts required for Gödel's ontological proof. Key notions central to Gödel's argument, such as "positive property," "necessary existence," and "possible worlds" (in the modal logic sense), have no meaningful equivalent or representation in the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and operators. The two systems operate in fundamentally different domains (empirical physics vs. abstract metaphysics) and are conceptually incommensurable.
