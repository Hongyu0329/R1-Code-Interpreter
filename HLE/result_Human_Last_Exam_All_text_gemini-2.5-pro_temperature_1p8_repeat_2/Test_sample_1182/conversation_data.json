    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe user wants to determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $C$ given by the equation $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and concepts**\nThe stable reduction of a curve over a local field (like $\\mathbb{Q}_2$) is a specific type of singular curve, called a stable curve, that represents the \"limit\" of the original curve. A stable curve is a connected, reduced projective curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and has a finite automorphism group. The number of double points is a key feature of this stable reduction. For a hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$, the stable reduction is determined by how the branch points (roots of $f(x)$ and possibly $\\infty$) cluster in the 2-adic sense.\n\n**2. Identify the branch points of the curve**\nThe curve is given by $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The genus of this curve is $g = \\lfloor(\\text{deg}(f)-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nThe branch points are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and, because the degree of $f(x)$ is odd, the point at infinity.\nLet's find the roots of $f(x)=0$. We can factor out $x$:\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne root is $r_1=0$.\nLet $P(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The other four roots ($r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$) are the roots of $P(x)=0$.\n\n**3. Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots**\nWe use Newton polygons to find the 2-adic valuations ($v_2$) of the roots of $P(x)$. We list the valuations of the coefficients of $P(x)$ for powers $x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3, x^4$:\n- $c_0 = 8 \\implies v_2(c_0) = 3$\n- $c_1 = 1 \\implies v_2(c_1) = 0$\n- $c_2 = 4 \\implies v_2(c_2) = 2$\n- $c_3 = 4 \\implies v_2(c_3) = 2$\n- $c_4 = 8 \\implies v_2(c_4) = 3$\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(c_i))$: $(0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points is formed by the vertices $(0,3), (1,0), (4,3)$.\nThe slopes of the segments of the Newton polygon are:\n- Segment from $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$: slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. The length of the projection on the x-axis is 1. This means there is one root, say $r_2$, with valuation $v_2(r_2) = -(-3) = 3$.\n- Segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$: slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The length of the projection on the x-axis is $4-1=3$. This means there are three roots, say $r_3, r_4, r_5$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(1) = -1$.\nSo, the set of branch points is $B = \\{0, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\n\n**4. Group the branch points into clusters**\nTwo finite branch points $b_i, b_j$ are in the same cluster if $v_2(b_i - b_j) > 0$. A finite branch point $b_k$ is clustered with $\\infty$ if $v_2(b_k) < 0$.\nLet's check the clusters.\n- Cluster 1: Consider $0$ and $r_2$. $v_2(r_2 - 0) = v_2(r_2) = 3 > 0$. So, $0$ and $r_2$ are in the same cluster. Let's call it $S_1 = \\{0, r_2\\}$.\n- Cluster 2: Consider $r_3, r_4, r_5$ and $\\infty$. Since $v_2(r_3) = v_2(r_4) = v_2(r_5) = -1 < 0$, all three roots $r_3, r_4, r_5$ are in the same cluster as $\\infty$. Let's call it $S_2 = \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\n- We check if there are other relations. $v_2(r_3-0)=v_2(r_3)=-1 \\le 0$. No link between $S_1$ and $S_2$. $v_2(r_2-r_3) = \\min(v_2(r_2), v_2(r_3)) = \\min(3, -1) = -1 \\le 0$. No link.\nSo we have exactly two clusters of branch points. This implies that the stable reduction has $N=2$ components, let's call them $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n**5. Determine the genera of the components**\nThe genus of the original curve is related to the genera of the components ($g_1, g_2$) and the number of double points ($\\delta$) by the formula:\n$g = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - N + 1$.\nWe need to find $g_1$ and $g_2$. The genus of a component is the genus of the stable reduction of a curve whose branch points are given by the corresponding cluster.\n- For $C_1$, the cluster is $S_1 = \\{0, r_2\\}$, which has 2 branch points. A hyperelliptic curve with 2 branch points is rational (genus 0). So, $g_1 = 0$.\n- For $C_2$, the cluster is $S_2 = \\{r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$, which has 4 branch points. A hyperelliptic curve with 4 branch points has genus $g = \\lfloor (4-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. We must check if the curve corresponding to this cluster has good or bad reduction. To do this, we can analyze the polynomial whose roots are $r_3, r_4, r_5$. This requires a coordinate change $x \\mapsto 2x$ as found during the scratchpad analysis. The result of this technical check confirms that the curve has good reduction over an unramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, and its reduction is a smooth curve of genus 1. Therefore, the component $C_2$ has genus $g_2=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the number of double points**\nWe have:\n- Genus of the original curve, $g = 2$.\n- Number of components, $N=2$.\n- Genus of component 1, $g_1 = 0$.\n- Genus of component 2, $g_2 = 1$.\nNow we plug these values into the formula:\n$g = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - N + 1$\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThe stable reduction consists of two components: a rational curve $C_1$ (a projective line) and an elliptic curve $C_2$ (a curve of genus 1). These two components are connected at $\\delta=2$ nodes (double points).\n\n<<<2>>>"
