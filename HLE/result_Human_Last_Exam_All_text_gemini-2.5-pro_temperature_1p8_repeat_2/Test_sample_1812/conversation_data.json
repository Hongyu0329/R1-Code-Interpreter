    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Task**\n\nThe main goal is to calculate the determinant of the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about this matrix being an \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual. While it identifies the origin of the matrix in a specific area of mathematics, it is not required for the calculation itself, since the matrix is given explicitly.\n\n**2. Identify Key Properties of the Matrix**\n\nBefore starting a direct calculation, it's helpful to observe the structure of the matrix. A key feature can simplify the problem significantly.\nLet's examine the sum of the elements in each row:\n*   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\nSimilarly, let's check the sum of the elements in each column:\n*   Column 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Column 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Column 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\n**Careful Point:** A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) of a square matrix is zero, then the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows or columns has a determinant of 0.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using Linear Dependence (Conceptual Approach)**\n\n*   Let \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\) be the row vectors of matrix \\(A\\).\n*   From our observation in Step 2, we know that \\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [0, 0, 0]\\).\n*   This equation shows a non-trivial linear combination of the row vectors that equals the zero vector. Therefore, the rows are linearly dependent.\n*   Because the rows are linearly dependent, the determinant of the matrix must be zero.\n*   This method is quick and relies on a key property of the matrix.\n\n**4. Method 2: Using Row Operations**\n\nWe can also find the determinant by applying row operations to transform the matrix into a simpler form. The following row operation does not change the value of the determinant: adding a multiple of one row to another row.\n*   Let's perform the operation \\(R_1 \\rightarrow R_1 + R_2 + R_3\\).\n*   The original matrix is:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   The new first row will be:\n    *   First element: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Second element: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Third element: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n*   The resulting matrix is:\n    \\[\n    A' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   **Careful Point:** The determinant of any matrix with a row (or column) of all zeros is 0.\n*   Therefore, \\(\\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0\\).\n\n**5. Method 3: Direct Calculation (Cofactor Expansion)**\n\nTo be absolutely certain, we can compute the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix.\n\\[\n\\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\\]\nFor our matrix:\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n*   \\(\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\\)\n*   Calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n    *   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3\\)\n    *   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3\\)\n    *   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3\\)\n*   Substitute these values back into the main formula:\n    *   \\(\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\\)\n    *   \\(\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\\)\n    *   \\(\\det(A) = 0\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll three methods of analysis consistently lead to the same result. The most efficient method is to recognize the linear dependence of the rows/columns.\n\nThe final answer is **0**.\n\n<<<0>>>"
