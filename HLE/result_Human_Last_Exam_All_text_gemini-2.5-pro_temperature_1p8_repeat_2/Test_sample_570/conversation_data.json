    "Answering this question involves several steps, from understanding the conditions on the convex domain to using concepts from the geometry of numbers like polar duality and Minkowski's theorem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the problem:**\n    *   We are looking for a **convex domain** `D` in the plane `R^2`.\n    *   This domain `D` must intersect **every line** from a specific family.\n    *   The family of lines is given by `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are **coprime integers**. Let `S` be the set of vectors `v = (p,q)` where `p,q` are coprime integers.\n    *   The goal is to find the **minimal possible area** of such a domain `D`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the condition on the domain `D`:**\n    *   A convex domain `D` intersects a line `px + qy = 1` if and only if the set of values `{px + qy | (x, y) \\in D}` contains `1`.\n    *   This means that for every `v = (p, q)` in `S`, we must have:\n        `inf_{(x,y) \\in D} (px + qy) <= 1 <= sup_{(x,y) \\in D} (px + qy)`\n    *   This condition must hold for all `v \\in S`.\n\n3.  **Simplification using symmetry:**\n    *   Let `D` be any convex domain satisfying the condition. Consider its centrally symmetrized version, `D_s = (D - D) / 2 = { (x-y)/2 | x, y \\in D }`.\n    *   The area of the symmetrized set is less than or equal to the original area: `Area(D_s) <= Area(D)`.\n    *   It can be shown (a result by H.G. Eggleston) that if `D` satisfies the intersection property, then `D_s` also satisfies it.\n    *   Therefore, the domain with the minimal area must be among the centrally symmetric ones. We can restrict our search to convex domains `D` that are symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\n4.  **Condition for a centrally symmetric domain:**\n    *   If `D` is centrally symmetric, then `inf(px + qy) = -sup(px + qy)`.\n    *   The condition simplifies to `sup_{(x,y) \\in D} (px + qy) >= 1` for all `v = (p,q) \\in S`. (The `inf` part `(-sup <= 1)` is `sup >= -1`, which is weaker and automatically satisfied).\n    *   Let `h_D(u)` be the support function of `D`, defined as `h_D(u) = sup_{x \\in D} <x, u>` for a unit vector `u`.\n    *   The condition can be rewritten as `h_D(v/|v|) * |v| >= 1`, or `h_D(u_v) >= 1/|v|`, where `u_v = v/|v| = (p,q)/sqrt(p^2+q^2)`.\n\n5.  **Using Polar Duality:**\n    *   To find the minimum area of `D`, we can analyze its polar dual `D*`.\n    *   The polar dual is defined as `D* = { y | <x,y> <= 1 for all x in D }`.\n    *   For centrally symmetric convex bodies, the support function of `D` and the radial function of `D*` are related by `h_D(u) = 1/\\rho_{D*}(u)`. The radial function `\\rho_{D*}(u)` gives the distance from the origin to the boundary of `D*` in the direction `u`.\n    *   Substituting this into our condition: `1/\\rho_{D*}(u_v) >= 1/|v|`, which implies `\\rho_{D*}(u_v) <= |v|`.\n    *   This means that for any primitive integer vector `v = (p,q) \\in S`, the distance from the origin to the boundary of `D*` in the direction of `v` must be less than or equal to the length of `v`. This is equivalent to saying that the point `v` itself cannot be in the interior of `D*`.\n    *   So, the problem is transformed: `D*` must be a centrally symmetric convex body whose interior `int(D*)` contains no primitive integer points (`int(D*) \\cap S = \\emptyset`).\n\n6.  **Maximizing the area of the polar dual:**\n    *   The Blaschke-Santaló inequality for centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane states that `Area(D) * Area(D*) >= 8`. Equality holds if and only if `D` (and `D*`) is a parallelogram.\n    *   To minimize `Area(D)`, we must maximize `Area(D*)` subject to the condition `int(D*) \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n\n7.  **Finding the maximal `Area(D*)`:**\n    *   We need to find the centrally symmetric convex set `K^*` of maximal area such that `int(K^*)` contains no primitive integer points `(p,q)`.\n    *   Consider the square `T = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`. `T` is centrally symmetric and convex. Its interior is `int(T) = (-1, 1) x (-1, 1)`. This open square contains no non-zero integer points at all, so it certainly contains no primitive integer points. `Area(T) = 4`.\n    *   Could there be a set `K^*` with larger area? By Minkowski's first theorem, any centrally symmetric convex set in the plane with area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer lattice point `v = (p,q)` in its interior.\n    *   If `v = (p,q)` is in `int(K^*)`, and `g = gcd(p,q)`, then the primitive point `v' = v/g = (p/g, q/g)` must also be in `int(K^*)` due to convexity and symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, any centrally symmetric convex set with area greater than 4 must contain a primitive integer point in its interior.\n    *   This means the maximum possible area for `D*` is 4, and it is achieved by the square `T = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`.\n\n8.  **Calculating the minimal area of `D`:**\n    *   We have found the maximal body `D*` to be the square `T` with `Area(D*) = 4`.\n    *   The minimal `D` is the polar dual of `T`. The polar of the square `T = { (x,y) | |x|<=1, |y|<=1 }` is the square `D_T = { (x,y) | |x|+|y|<=1 }`.\n    *   The area of `D_T` (a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`) is 2.\n    *   The minimum value in the Blaschke-Santaló inequality is `Area(D) >= 8 / Area(D*) = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n    *   Since the pair `(D_T, T)` achieves this bound (as they are squares, a type of parallelogram), the minimal area is exactly 2.\n\n9.  **Final verification:**\n    *   The proposed minimal domain is `D = { (x,y) | |x|+|y| <= 1 }`. Its area is 2.\n    *   Let's check if it meets the condition. For any coprime integers `p, q`, we need to show that the range of `f(x,y) = px+qy` on `D` contains 1.\n    *   The maximum of `f(x,y)` on this domain occurs at a vertex. `max(f) = max(p(1)+q(0), p(0)+q(1), p(-1)+q(0), p(0)+q(-1)) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   Since the domain is centrally symmetric, the minimum is `min(f) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    *   The range of `f` on `D` is `[ -max(|p|,|q|), max(|p|,|q|) ]`.\n    *   For this interval to contain 1, we need `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n    *   Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of them has an absolute value of at least 1, which means `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n    *   The condition is satisfied for all coprime `(p,q)`.\n\nConclusion: The minimal area is 2.\n\n>>>2"
