    "An step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the vector field and its properties\nThe vector field is given by $\\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThe components $f$ and $G$ are defined as:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n\nThis vector field is a unit vector field, i.e., $|\\vec{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. It defines a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the 2D unit sphere $S^2$. The coordinates on the sphere can be identified as the polar angle $\\theta=G$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi=f$.\n\n### Step 2: Asymptotic behavior of the field\nTo define the Hopf charge, which is a topological invariant of maps from the 3-sphere $S^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$, we need to consider the behavior of the field at infinity. The space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ can be compactified to $S^3$ by adding a single point at infinity. The map $\\vec{n}$ must approach a constant value at infinity for this to be a continuous map from $S^3$.\nAs $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \\to \\infty$, the variable $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\nConsequently, $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to 0$.\nAs $G \\to 0$, we have:\n$\\sin(G) \\to 0$\n$\\cos(G) \\to 1$\nSo, the vector field $\\vec{n}$ approaches $(0, 0, 1)$ as $|\\vec{r}| \\to \\infty$, regardless of the direction.\nThis means the map is constant at infinity, and we can define a continuous map $\\vec{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$. The Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Hopf Charge\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) $Q_H$ is an integer that characterizes the homotopy class of the map $\\vec{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$. It can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular point is one whose preimage contains only points where the map's Jacobian has full rank.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the field structure and relation to Skyrmion number\nThe calculation of the Hopf charge via the Whitehead integral formula ($Q_H \\propto \\int \\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B} \\, dV$) or by direct computation of linking numbers of preimages can be very complex. A more insightful approach is to analyze the structure of the map and relate it to known topological objects.\n\nThe given vector field is a standard construction for a topological object called a hopfion (or a 3D skyrmion). The Hopf charge of such a field is known to be related to the topological charge of a 2D skyrmion obtained by restricting the field to a plane.\n\nLet's restrict the vector field to the $z=0$ plane. The map becomes a map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $S^2$.\nIn this plane, $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2} = |x^2+y^2-0.5|$. Let $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ be the radial coordinate in the plane. Then $r_2 = |\\rho^2-0.5|$.\nThis map from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $S^2$ describes a 2D skyrmion. Its topological charge, known as the skyrmion number, is given by the degree of this map. The degree can be calculated by seeing how many times the domain (the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, compactified to $S^2$) wraps around the target space ($S^2$).\n\n1.  **Boundary condition:** At the origin $(\\rho=0)$ and at infinity $(\\rho \\to \\infty)$, the field points to the north pole.\n    *   At $\\rho=0$, $r_2=0.5$, so $G=\\pi e^{-5} \\approx 0.02$. $\\cos(G) \\approx 1$. So $\\vec{n}(0,0) \\approx (0,0,1)$.\n    *   As $\\rho \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$, so $G \\to 0$. $\\cos(G) \\to 1$. So $\\vec{n}(\\infty) \\to (0,0,1)$.\n    Since the map is constant at the \"boundary\" of the plane (origin and infinity), it can be seen as a map from $S^2$ to $S^2$.\n\n2.  **Wrapping:** Let's trace the vector $\\vec{n}$ along a ray from the origin, for example, the positive x-axis ($f=0$).\n    *   At $x=0$, $\\vec{n} \\approx (0,0,1)$ (North Pole).\n    *   As $x$ increases from 0 to $\\sqrt{0.5}$, $\\rho^2$ goes from 0 to 0.5. $r_2=0.5-\\rho^2$ goes from 0.5 to 0. So $G$ goes from $\\pi e^{-5}$ to $\\pi$. The vector $\\vec{n}$ traces a path from the North Pole down to the South Pole $(\\vec{n}=(0,0,-1)$ at $x=\\sqrt{0.5})$.\n    *   As $x$ increases from $\\sqrt{0.5}$ to infinity, $\\rho^2$ goes from 0.5 to $\\infty$. $r_2=\\rho^2-0.5$ goes from 0 to $\\infty$. So $G$ goes from $\\pi$ to 0. The vector $\\vec{n}$ traces a path from the South Pole back to the North Pole.\n    Thus, along any radial line in the $xy$-plane, the vector $\\vec{n}$ sweeps out a full meridian on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\n3.  **Azimuthal dependence:** The azimuthal angle of $\\vec{n}$ on the sphere ($\\phi=f$) is the same as the azimuthal angle of the point in the $xy$-plane ($\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$).\n    As we rotate our ray in the $xy$-plane by $360^\\circ$, the meridian traced by $\\vec{n}$ also rotates by $360^\\circ$.\n\nThe combination of this radial sweep and azimuthal rotation ensures that the entire domain plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is mapped exactly once onto the target sphere $S^2$. The degree of this map is 1. Therefore, the skyrmion number of the field restricted to the $z=0$ plane is $Q=1$.\n\nFor this type of field construction, the Hopf charge of the 3D field is equal to the skyrmion number of its 2D cross-section. This is a known result in the theory of topological solitons.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1.\n\nFinal check of crucial points:\n*   The field is well-behaved and defines a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$.\n*   The function $G$ depends on $r_2$, the distance to a \"core\" circle defined by $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$. This is the defining feature of a toroidal hopfion.\n*   The azimuthal angle of the field directly follows the azimuthal angle of the point in space. This is characteristic of a configuration with winding number 1 in the toroidal direction.\n*   The function $G$ ensures that the field covers the polar angle range of the sphere once as we move across the core circle.\n\nThese features confirm that the configuration is a standard representation of a hopfion with the elementary topological charge.\n\nFinal Answer is 1.\n\n>>>1"
