    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements `g` in the group `G = PSU(4,997)` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g \\neq 1`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group PSU(4, 997)**\n    *   `PSU(n,q)` is the Projective Special Unitary group. It is defined as `PSU(n,q) = SU(n,q) / Z(SU(n,q))`.\n    *   `SU(n,q)` is the Special Unitary group, consisting of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in the finite field `GF(q^2)` satisfying:\n        *   `A * A^H = I` (Unitary condition), where `A^H` is the conjugate transpose (transpose and apply the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`).\n        *   `det(A) = 1` (Special condition).\n    *   `Z(SU(n,q))` is the center of `SU(n,q)`. It consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c^n=1` and `c^{q+1}=1`. Its order is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   In our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The field is `GF(997^2)`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The size of the center `Z(SU(4,997))` is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499` and `4 = 2^2`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   So, `Z(SU(4,997)) = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\n2.  **Lifting Involutions from PSU to SU**\n    *   An element `g \\in PSU(4,997)` is a coset `xZ` where `x \\in SU(4,997)` and `Z = Z(SU(4,997))`.\n    *   The condition `g^2 = 1` in `PSU` means `(xZ)^2 = x^2Z = Z`. This implies that `x^2` must be an element of the center `Z`.\n    *   The condition `g \\neq 1` means `xZ \\neq Z`, which implies `x` is not in the center `Z`.\n    *   So, we need to count the number of elements `x \\in SU(4,997)` such that `x^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}` and `x \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`. These are the pre-images of the involutions in `PSU`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Pre-images in SU(4, 997)**\n    We consider the two possibilities for `x^2`:\n\n    *   **Case A: `x^2 = -I`**\n        *   If `x^2 = -I`, any eigenvalue `λ` of `x` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\n        *   Since `x` is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues `λ` must also satisfy the condition `λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n        *   From these two conditions, we get `1 = λ^{q+1} = (λ^2)^{(q+1)/2} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2}`.\n        *   This implies that `(q+1)/2` must be an even integer.\n        *   For `q = 997`, we have `(q+1)/2 = (997+1)/2 = 998/2 = 499`.\n        *   **Careful Point 2:** `499` is an odd number. Therefore, `(-1)^{499} = -1`, which contradicts the requirement that `(-1)^{(q+1)/2} = 1`.\n        *   Conclusion for Case A: There are **no** elements `x` in `SU(4,997)` such that `x^2 = -I`.\n\n    *   **Case B: `x^2 = I`**\n        *   We need to find elements `x` such that `x^2 = I` but `x \\neq I` and `x \\neq -I`. These are precisely the non-central involutions in `SU(4,997)`.\n        *   An involution `x` in `SU(4,q)` must be diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the number of eigenvalues equal to `-1`.\n        *   Since `x` is in `SU(4,q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(x) = (-1)^k = 1`. This means `k` must be an even number.\n        *   `k` is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue -1. As `x \\neq I`, `k` cannot be 0. As `x \\neq -I`, `k` cannot be 4.\n        *   Therefore, the only possibility is `k=2`. These involutions have an eigenspace partition of `V = V_1 \\oplus V_{-1}` where `dim(V_1)=2` and `dim(V_{-1})=2`.\n        *   The number of such involutions in `SU(n,q)` (for `n=2m`) with a `-1`-eigenspace of dimension `k=2j` is a standard result in the theory of classical groups. For `n=4` and `k=2`, this corresponds to a single conjugacy class. The number of elements in this class, which we call `N_2`, is given by the formula:\n            `N_2 = |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(x)|`\n            where the centralizer `C_{SU(4,q)}(x)` is isomorphic to `S(U(2,q) x U(2,q))`.\n            This evaluates to the formula:\n            `N_2 = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n4.  **Counting the Involutions in PSU(4,997)**\n    *   We have found that the set of all pre-images of involutions in `PSU` is the set of involutions of type `k=2` in `SU`. The size of this set is `N_2 = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    *   Let `x` be one such pre-image. The coset it belongs to is `xZ = \\{x, -x\\}`.\n    *   This coset `xZ` is an involution in `PSU`.\n    *   The other element in the coset is `-x`. Let's check its properties: `(-x)^2 = x^2 = I`. The eigenvalues of `-x` are the negatives of the eigenvalues of `x`. If `x` has eigenvalues `{-1, -1, 1, 1}`, then `-x` has eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. So `-x` is also a type `k=2` involution.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Each involution `g` in `PSU(4,997)` has exactly two pre-images in `SU(4,997)`, namely `x` and `-x`, both of which are non-central involutions.\n    *   This means the `N_2` pre-images are partitioned into pairs `{x, -x}`. Each pair corresponds to a single involution in `PSU(4,997)`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of involutions is the number of such pairs, which is `N_2 / 2`.\n\n5.  **Final Formula**\n    The number of involutions in `PSU(4,q)` (for `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`) is:\n    Number = `(q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)) / 2`.\n\n    Substituting `q=997`:\n    Number = `(997^4(997^2+1)(997^2-997+1)) / 2`.\n\nFinal expression is the answer.\n\nNumber of involutions = `(q^4(q^4 + q^3 - q + 1)) / 2`. Mistake in expansion, let's stick to factored form.\nNumber = `(q^4 * (q^2+1) * (q^2-q+1)) / 2` with `q=997`.\n\nThe final answer is this expression.\n\n<<<`(997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2`>>>"
