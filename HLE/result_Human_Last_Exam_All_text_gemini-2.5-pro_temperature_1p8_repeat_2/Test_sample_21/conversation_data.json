    "Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial's structure.**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n    Let's test for a connection to Chebyshev-like polynomials. Consider the substitution $x = c \\cdot y$.\n    $f(c y) = c^7 y^7 - 14 c^5 y^5 + 56 c^3 y^3 - 56 c y + 22$.\n    The ratio of coefficients of $x^7$ to $x^5$ is $-14$, $x^5$ to $x^3$ is $-4$, $x^3$ to $x$ is $-1$.\n    Let's check the ratios for $f(cy)$:\n    $\\frac{-14c^5}{c^7} = \\frac{-14}{c^2}$, $\\frac{56c^3}{-14c^5} = \\frac{-4}{c^2}$, $\\frac{-56c}{-56c^3} = \\frac{1}{c^2}$.\n    This suggests that if we transform the variable, the new polynomial might have a simpler structure.\n    Let's consider the polynomials $U_n(y)$ defined by $U_n(2\\cos\\theta) = 2\\cos(n\\theta)$.\n    $U_7(y) = y^7 - 7y^5 + 14y^3 - 7y$.\n    The ratios of its coefficients are $\\frac{-7}{1}=-7$, $\\frac{14}{-7}=-2$, $\\frac{-7}{14}=-1/2$. These do not match.\n\n    Let's re-examine $f(x)$ with the substitution $x = \\sqrt{2}y$.\n    $f(\\sqrt{2}y) = (\\sqrt{2})^7y^7 - 14(\\sqrt{2})^5y^5 + 56(\\sqrt{2})^3y^3 - 56\\sqrt{2}y + 22$\n    $= 8\\sqrt{2}y^7 - 14(4\\sqrt{2})y^5 + 56(2\\sqrt{2})y^3 - 56\\sqrt{2}y + 22$\n    $= 8\\sqrt{2}y^7 - 56\\sqrt{2}y^5 + 112\\sqrt{2}y^3 - 56\\sqrt{2}y + 22$\n    $= 8\\sqrt{2} (y^7 - 7y^5 + 14y^3 - 7y) + 22$.\n    Let $g(y) = y^7 - 7y^5 + 14y^3 - 7y$. This is the polynomial $U_7(y)$ mentioned above.\n    The roots of $f(x)=0$ are of the form $x = \\sqrt{2}y$ where $y$ is a root of $g(y) = -22/(8\\sqrt{2}) = -11\\sqrt{2}/8$.\n\n2.  **Determine the roots of f(x).**\n    We use the property $g(2\\cos\\theta) = 2\\cos(7\\theta)$. Let $y=2\\cos\\theta$.\n    Then $2\\cos(7\\theta) = -11\\sqrt{2}/8$. Let $\\phi$ be an angle such that $2\\cos\\phi = -11\\sqrt{2}/8$.\n    Then $7\\theta = \\pm \\phi + 2\\pi k$ for integer $k$.\n    This gives 7 distinct values for $\\cos\\theta$, namely $\\cos((\\phi+2\\pi k)/7)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,6$.\n    The roots of $g(y)=-11\\sqrt{2}/8$ are $y_k = 2\\cos((\\phi+2\\pi k)/7)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,6$.\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $\\alpha_k = \\sqrt{2} y_k = 2\\sqrt{2}\\cos((\\phi+2\\pi k)/7)$ for $k=0,1,\\dots,6$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of f(x).**\n    Let's find the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$. The roots are $\\alpha_k$.\n    $\\cos\\phi = -11\\sqrt{2}/16$. $\\sin^2\\phi = 1 - (-11\\sqrt{2}/16)^2 = 1 - 242/256 = 14/256$.\n    So $\\sin\\phi = \\pm\\sqrt{14}/16$.\n    Let $u_1 = e^{i\\phi} = \\cos\\phi + i\\sin\\phi = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2} + i\\sqrt{14}}{16}$. Note that $u_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, i\\sqrt{14}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-7})$.\n    Let $y_0 = e^{i\\phi/7}$. Then $y_0^7 = u_1$. Let $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$.\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $\\alpha_k = \\sqrt{2}(y_0 \\zeta_7^k + y_0^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-k})$.\n    The splitting field is $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha_0, \\dots, \\alpha_6) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, y_0, \\zeta_7)$.\n    Since $y_0^7=u_1$ and $u_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-7})$, the field $K$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-7})$.\n    The field of 7th roots of unity, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$, contains the quadratic subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n    So the smallest field containing $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\zeta_7$ is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\zeta_7)$.\n    $K = L(y_0)$, where $y_0^7 = u_1 \\in L$.\n    The degree of $f(x)$ is 7, so if it is irreducible, the Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ must be transitive on the 7 roots, and its order must be a multiple of 7.\n    Let's determine the degree of the extension. $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\zeta_7)$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7) = \\mathbb{Q}$, we have $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}][\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7):\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\cdot 6=12$.\n    The Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_6$.\n    $K=L(y_0)$, so $K/L$ is a Kummer extension. Its degree is the smallest $d|7$ such that $u_1^d$ is a 7th power in $L$. Since $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ must be divisible by 7, and $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=12$ is not, we must have $[K:L]=7$. This also proves that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ fits into the short exact sequence:\n    $1 \\to \\text{Gal}(K/L) \\to G \\to \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\n    Here, $\\text{Gal}(K/L) \\cong C_7$. Thus $|G| = |\\text{Gal}(K/L)| \\cdot |\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})| = 7 \\cdot 12 = 84$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.**\n    The natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that act as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots of $f(x)$.\n    Density = $\\frac{|\\{g \\in G \\mid g \\text{ is a 7-cycle}\\}|}{|G|}$.\n\n5.  **Count the number of 7-cycles in G.**\n    The Galois group $G$ acts on the set of 7 roots $\\{\\alpha_0, \\dots, \\alpha_6\\}$. As $f(x)$ is irreducible, this action is transitive.\n    An element $g \\in G$ which acts as a 7-cycle must have order divisible by 7. In a group of order 84, an element whose order is divisible by 7 must have order 7, 14, 21, or 42. Since the permutation representation is on 7 elements, its order in $S_7$ must divide 7!, and the cycle type determines its order. A 7-cycle has order 7.\n    Let's find the elements of order 7 in $G$. The group $G$ is a semi-direct product $C_7 \\rtimes (C_2 \\times C_6)$. Any element of order 7 must lie in the normal Sylow 7-subgroup, which is $N = \\text{Gal}(K/L) \\cong C_7$. Let $g \\in G$. If $g^7=e$, then its image in the quotient group $G/N \\cong C_2 \\times C_6$ must also have order dividing 7. As $|C_2 \\times C_6| = 12$ which is coprime to 7, the image of $g$ must be the identity. Thus $g \\in N$.\n    The elements of order 7 are precisely the non-identity elements of $N$. There are $7-1=6$ such elements.\n    Now we must check that these 6 elements act as 7-cycles. Let $\\sigma$ be a generator of $N = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$. Then $\\sigma$ fixes elements of $L$, so $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta_7)=\\zeta_7$. Its action is determined by $\\sigma(y_0)=\\zeta_7 y_0$.\n    Let's see its action on the roots $\\alpha_k = \\sqrt{2}(y_0\\zeta_7^k + y_0^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-k})$.\n    $\\sigma(\\alpha_k) = \\sigma(\\sqrt{2})(\\sigma(y_0)\\sigma(\\zeta_7^k) + \\sigma(y_0)^{-1}\\sigma(\\zeta_7^{-k}))$\n    $= \\sqrt{2}((\\zeta_7 y_0)\\zeta_7^k + (\\zeta_7 y_0)^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-k})$\n    $= \\sqrt{2}(y_0\\zeta_7^{k+1} + y_0^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-(k+1)}) = \\alpha_{k+1}$ (indices mod 7).\n    So $\\sigma$ acts as the cycle $(\\alpha_0 \\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 \\alpha_3 \\alpha_4 \\alpha_5 \\alpha_6)$. This is a 7-cycle.\n    Any non-identity element of $N$ is a generator of this cyclic group, so it's of the form $\\sigma^j$ for $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,6\\}$. The action of $\\sigma^j$ is to send $\\alpha_k$ to $\\alpha_{k+j}$, which is also a 7-cycle.\n    Thus, there are exactly 6 elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles.\n\n6.  **Calculate the density.**\n    The number of 7-cycles is 6. The order of the Galois group is 84.\n    The density is $\\frac{6}{84} = \\frac{1}{14}$."
