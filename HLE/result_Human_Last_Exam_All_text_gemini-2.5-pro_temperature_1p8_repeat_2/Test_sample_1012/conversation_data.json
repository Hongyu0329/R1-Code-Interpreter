    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Threat:** The question specifies the adversary has an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This means we must consider the most effective attacks a quantum computer can perform against symmetric key cryptography.\n2.  **Classical vs. Quantum Attacks:**\n    *   **Classical Computers:** For a symmetric key of length *n* bits, there are 2^n possible keys. The best general attack on a classical computer is a brute-force search, which would take, on average, 2^(n-1) operations to find the key. Thus, a 128-bit key has a security level of 128 bits. A security level of 128 bits is considered computationally infeasible for classical computers and is a common standard (e.g., AES-128).\n    *   **Quantum Computers:** The most relevant quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric ciphers is **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm can search an unstructured database (like the space of all possible cryptographic keys) much faster than a classical computer.\n\n3.  **Impact of Grover's Algorithm:**\n    *   Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up. While a classical computer requires O(2^n) operations to search through 2^n items, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm only requires O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)) operations.\n    *   This means that for a symmetric key of *n* bits, the effective security level against a quantum computer is reduced from *n* bits to *n/2* bits.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Secure Key Length:**\n    *   The generally accepted benchmark for \"secure\" against any type of computer (including quantum) is a computational complexity of at least 2^128 operations. This is often referred to as a \"128-bit security level\".\n    *   We need to find the key length *n* such that the security level against a quantum attack is at least 128 bits.\n    *   Using the formula from Grover's algorithm, the quantum security level is *n/2*.\n    *   So, we need to solve the inequality: `n / 2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Solving for *n*, we get: `n ≥ 256`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **128 bits:** Quantum security level = 128 / 2 = 64 bits. An attack requiring 2^64 operations is considered feasible. This is **not secure**.\n    *   **256 bits:** Quantum security level = 256 / 2 = 128 bits. An attack requiring 2^128 operations is considered computationally infeasible. This is **secure**.\n    *   **512 bits:** Quantum security level = 512 / 2 = 256 bits. This is even more secure.\n    *   **1024 bits / 2048 bits:** These provide even higher levels of security (512 and 1024 bits, respectively).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the **minimum** key length required for security. While 512 bits and higher are also secure, 256 bits is the minimum length that provides the widely accepted 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   This analysis applies to **symmetric-key cryptography** (like AES). The impact of quantum computers on **asymmetric-key cryptography** (like RSA and ECC) is much more severe. Shor's algorithm can break them efficiently, rendering them completely insecure regardless of key size. They must be replaced with new post-quantum algorithms.\n*   The \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\" is a theoretical model. Building a quantum computer capable of running Grover's algorithm on such a large scale (e.g., to break AES-256) is an immense engineering challenge and is not expected to be realized in the near future. However, for long-term security, we must plan for this possibility.\n*   Doubling the key length (e.g., moving from AES-128 to AES-256) is the standard recommendation from cryptographic bodies like NIST (the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) to ensure quantum resistance for symmetric encryption.\n\n<<<A>>>"
