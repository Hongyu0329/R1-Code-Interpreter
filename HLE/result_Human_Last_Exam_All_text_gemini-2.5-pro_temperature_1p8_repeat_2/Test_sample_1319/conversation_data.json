    "Of course. Let's analyze this question systematically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Source Text:** The *Iliad*.\n2.  **Object of Interest:** A mountain.\n3.  **Key Condition:** It must be a \"historical\" mountain, meaning a real, physical location.\n4.  **Ranking Criterion:** \"Tallest\".\n5.  **Exclusion Clause:** \"After Mount Olympus\". This means we must first identify Mount Olympus and then find the next tallest from the remaining candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mount Olympus**\nMount Olympus is central to the *Iliad* as the home of the gods. It is also a real mountain and the highest in Greece, with its Mytikas peak at approximately 2,918 meters (9,573 feet). This will be our benchmark for exclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Other Historical Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nWe need to scan the epic for other named mountains that correspond to real geographical locations. The primary candidates are:\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is very prominent. Zeus sits on its peak (Gargarus) to watch the Trojan War. It is a historical mountain in the Troad, in modern-day Turkey. Its Turkish name is Kazdağı.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon sits on the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to watch the battle. This is the island of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea, and its highest peak is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her flight path takes her over several peaks, explicitly including \"snowy Athos.\" This is the famous mountain on the Athos peninsula in northern Greece.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), the poet describes the Maeonian contingent as being \"born under the snows of Tmolus.\" This refers to a historical mountain range in Lydia (western Anatolia, modern Turkey), whose highest peak is now called Bozdağ.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned several times, most famously as the source of the ash wood for the spear of Achilles, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron. This is a mountain in Thessaly, Greece, near Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Modern Elevations of These Mountains**\nTo determine the \"tallest,\" we need the current accepted heights for these historical mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ, Turkey):** Approximately **2,159 meters** (7,083 feet).\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** Approximately **2,033 meters** (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (Kazdağı, Turkey):** Approximately **1,774 meters** (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** Approximately **1,624 meters** (5,328 feet).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari peak, Greece):** Approximately **1,611 meters** (5,285 feet).\n\n**Step 5: Compare Heights and Determine the Winner**\nNow, we compare the elevations of the mountains identified in Step 4, all of which are shorter than Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** ~2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** ~1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** ~1,611 m\n\nThe tallest among this group is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Historical vs. Mythical:** All the mountains listed are \"historical\" in that they are real places you can visit today. The question correctly frames them this way.\n2.  **Confirmation in the Text:** It is essential that each mountain is explicitly named in the *Iliad*. A mountain being merely in the region is not enough. All the candidates listed above have direct textual evidence.\n3.  **Narrative Importance vs. Height:** Mount Ida and Samothrace play more active roles as divine vantage points than Mount Tmolus. However, the question asks for the *tallest*, not the most important. The brief mention of Tmolus in the Catalogue of Ships is sufficient for it to be a candidate.\n4.  **Which Mount Ida?** There is another famous Mount Ida on the island of Crete, associated with the birth of Zeus. However, the context of the *Iliad* (Zeus watching the Trojan War) makes it clear that the epic is referring to the Mount Ida in the Troad, overlooking Troy.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
