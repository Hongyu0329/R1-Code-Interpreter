    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a *fictional singer* whose *cardboard cutout* \"performs\" at the *Junior prom* in the *Homestar Runner* episode *Teen Girl Squad #15*.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode focuses on the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) getting ready for and attending their Junior prom. A significant part of their pre-prom excitement is about the musical guest.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the dialogue where the musical guest is introduced.**\nEarly in the episode, the girls are discussing the prom. The conversation goes as follows:\n- So and So says: \"and i heard that fictional new-wave sensation...\"\n- All four girls shout in unison: \"...KASPAROV!\"\n- Cheerleader adds: \"...was gonna be the musical guest!\"\n\n**Careful Point:** This dialogue explicitly names the fictional singer the girls are expecting to see. The name is Kasparov.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the scene at the Junior prom itself.**\nWhen the girls arrive at the prom, they see the \"musical guest\" on stage. It is not a live person.\n- What's Her Face exclaims: \"A cardboard cutout of Kasparov is the musical guest?\"\n\n**Careful Point:** This confirms two crucial details from the question: the performer is indeed a cardboard cutout, and the cutout is of the previously named fictional singer, Kasparov.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the information to form the final answer.**\nBased on the dialogue and events within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout performs at the Junior prom is named Kasparov.\n\n<<<Kasparov>>>"
