    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the core concepts.**\n\n*   **Phenotype:** A measurable trait of an individual, such as height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease.\n*   **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** A common type of genetic variation among people.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of *all* the common SNPs considered together. It is a theoretical maximum, representing the total genetic \"signal\" available from these SNPs. It is often estimated using methods like GREML (Genome-based Restricted Maximum Likelihood).\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS) or Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** This is an individual-level score calculated for a person. It is constructed by taking a sum of that individual's genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP weighted by its estimated effect on the phenotype. These effect sizes (weights) are typically estimated from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (measured by R²):** This is a measure of how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype. It's calculated as the squared correlation (R²) between the PGS and the phenotype in an independent test sample (one not used to create the score). It represents the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can successfully explain.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability.**\n\nThink of SNP heritability as the *potential* and the PGS predictive ability as the *actual* achievement.\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability is the Ceiling:** The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) sets the theoretical upper bound for how much of the phenotypic variance can *ever* be explained by a linear combination of SNPs. You cannot explain more variance than is explainable in principle by the genetic factors you are using.\n2.  **PGS is an Imperfect Estimator:** A PGS is a practical tool built from real-world data, and it is subject to several limitations that prevent it from reaching this theoretical ceiling:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The effect sizes used as weights in the PGS are estimated from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. This means the estimates are not perfectly accurate; they contain statistical \"noise\" or error. This error in the weights will always reduce the predictive accuracy of the final score.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes are located on chromosomes, and nearby SNPs tend to be inherited together (a phenomenon called Linkage Disequilibrium). A GWAS often identifies a SNP that is simply \"tagging\" a nearby true causal variant. The statistical methods used to build a PGS must account for this complex correlation structure, and they do so imperfectly, leading to a loss of predictive power.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** A PGS might not include all the relevant causal SNPs. Some causal SNPs may have effects that are too small to be detected by the source GWAS and are therefore not included in the score.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the comparison.**\n\n*   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the total amount of signal present.\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS (R²_PGS) is the amount of that signal we can successfully capture with our current methods and data.\n\nBecause the process of creating a PGS from a finite GWAS introduces noise and involves imperfect modeling, the amount of signal captured (R²_PGS) will inevitably be less than the total signal that is theoretically present (h²_SNP). The predictive accuracy of a PGS can get closer and closer to the SNP heritability as the size of the source GWAS increases (reducing the noise in effect size estimates), but it can never exceed it.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype\" is correct.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\nThe variance explained by a polygenic score is a measure of its performance in a test sample, whereas SNP heritability is the theoretical upper limit of variance explainable by all common SNPs. Due to practical limitations in building the score, such as finite sample sizes for estimating SNP effects (which introduces error) and imperfect modeling of genetic architecture, the performance of the polygenic score will always be lower than this theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True>>>"
