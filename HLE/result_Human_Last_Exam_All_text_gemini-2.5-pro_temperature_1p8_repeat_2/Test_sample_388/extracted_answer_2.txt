The pharmacist should advise Allison that the aspirin in Excedrin, when taken with her Fluoxetine, significantly increases the risk of stomach bleeding. She should be counseled to avoid using Excedrin or other NSAIDs (like ibuprofen or naproxen) and recommended to use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for her headaches instead. Additionally, she should be encouraged to follow up with her doctor about the headaches, as they could be a side effect of the Fluoxetine or the Junel Fe.
