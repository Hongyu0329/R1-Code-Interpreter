    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific \"Sir Launfal\":** The question refers to the preservation of a text, which points towards a historical manuscript. This indicates we are looking at the 14th-century Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, attributed to Thomas Chestre, not the later 19th-century poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell.\n\n2.  **Locate the manuscript:** The medieval romance *Sir Launfal* survives in only one manuscript. Identifying this manuscript is the key to finding what other works it was preserved alongside. Research shows that this manuscript is **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, now held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript:** Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is a miscellany, meaning it contains a collection of different texts. The task is to find a \"book of manners\" within this collection.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"book of manners\":** A book of manners is also known as a \"courtesy book\"—a popular genre in the Middle Ages that gave instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morality. By examining the contents of Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find several romances (like *Emaré* and *Octavian*) and, crucially, a text explicitly dedicated to this subject.\n\n5.  **Determine the title of the book:** The book of manners included in this specific manuscript is known as ***The Boke of Curtasye***, which translates to **The Book of Courtesy**. This work details how a young man should behave, particularly in a noble household, covering topics from table manners to personal hygiene and respectful address.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing between different versions of *Sir Launfal*:** It is crucial to focus on the medieval romance by Thomas Chestre, as the context of manuscript preservation does not apply to Lowell's much later poem.\n*   **Understanding the term \"book of manners\":** Recognizing that this is synonymous with a \"courtesy book\" is essential for identifying the correct text within the manuscript's table of contents.\n*   **Specificity of the manuscript:** The answer depends entirely on the contents of a single, specific historical artifact (Cotton MS Caligula A.ii), as this is the only manuscript in which the poem has been preserved.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe poem *Sir Launfal* is found in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii. This same manuscript contains a well-known Middle English courtesy book. The title of that book is *The Boke of Curtasye*, or in modern English, *The Book of Courtesy*.\n\n<<<The Book of Courtesy>>>"
