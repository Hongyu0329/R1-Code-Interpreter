    "Answering the question requires understanding the connection between rational numbers, generalized Markov numbers, and continued fractions. The question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), which suggests finding the fundamental continued fraction used in its definition, rather than computing the continued fraction *of* the number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the problem\nThe theory of generalized Markov numbers, particularly those indexed by a rational number \\(p/q\\), establishes a relationship that begins with the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\). This continued fraction then defines a canonical object, a purely periodic continued fraction, which in turn is used to calculate the Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) itself (often as a matrix trace or related to coefficients of a quadratic equation). The most natural interpretation of the question is to identify this foundational, purely periodic continued fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of the index \\(4/7\\)\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the partial quotients for the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).\n1.  Start with \\(4/7\\). The integer part is 0. The remainder is \\(4/7\\). We take the reciprocal: \\(7/4\\).\n2.  \\(7/4 = 1 + 3/4\\). The first partial quotient (after the initial 0) is \\(c_1 = 1\\). We are left with \\(3/4\\).\n3.  Take the reciprocal of \\(3/4\\), which is \\(4/3\\). \\(4/3 = 1 + 1/3\\). The second partial quotient is \\(c_2 = 1\\). We are left with \\(1/3\\).\n4.  Take the reciprocal of \\(1/3\\), which is \\(3\\). \\(3 = 3 + 0\\). The third partial quotient is \\(c_3 = 3\\). The remainder is 0, so the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe finite continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is therefore:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\]\nThe sequence of partial quotients is \\((c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Construct the associated periodic continued fraction\nThe generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is defined based on a quadratic irrational number, \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\), whose continued fraction is purely periodic with the partial quotients of \\(p/q\\).\nFor our index \\(4/7\\), the sequence of partial quotients is \\((1, 1, 3)\\). We form a purely periodic continued fraction with this sequence as the repeating block (the period).\n\nThis gives the continued fraction:\n\\[ \\alpha_{4/7} = [\\overline{1, 1, 3}] \\]\nThis notation means the sequence of partial quotients repeats indefinitely: \\([1; 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, \\dots]\\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\" is precisely this purely periodic continued fraction \\([\\overline{1, 1, 3}]\\). It is the fundamental object from which the number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself is derived. Any specific numerical value of \\(m_{4/7}\\) (which can vary depending on the normalization or specific definition used in different contexts) is secondary to this continued fraction."
