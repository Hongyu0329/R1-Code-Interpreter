    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conceptual entity in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The idea comes from Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his large-scale, global perspective. He is quoting another author, Paul Morand.\n    *   **What:** We are looking for a \"conceptual entity.\"\n    *   **Clue 1:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation is a specific instance or a symbol of this larger concept. The entity itself is not a nation, but something a nation belongs to or represents.\n    *   **Clue 2:** This entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" This is a metaphor suggesting it should be viewed in a global, holistic, and interconnected context, not as a flat or isolated object.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:**\n    *   The quote is found in the preface to Fernand Braudel's influential work, *A History of Civilizations* (also published as *Grammar of Civilizations*). In this preface, Braudel lays out his philosophical approach to history.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote:**\n    *   Braudel recounts a conversation with the writer and diplomat Paul Morand. The relevant passage is:\n        > \"Paul Morand, returning from a round-the-world tour, once said to me that **a civilization** is a continuity that, when we are away from it, we can recognize at a distance and find again with joy... 'This **civilization**,' he added, 'I would like to see drawn, not on a planisphere [a flat map], which flattens everything, but on a globe, in its authentic roundedness.'\"\n\n4.  **Connect the Quote to the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **The \"Conceptual Entity\":** The quote explicitly names the entity. Morand states, \"**a civilization** is a continuity...\" Therefore, the conceptual entity is **civilization**.\n    *   **\"Inscribed within a sphere\":** Morand's wish to see it drawn \"on a globe\" is a direct match for this clue. The globe is the sphere, representing a complete, global view.\n    *   **\"Exemplified by the symbol of a nation\":** In Braudel's historical framework, individual nations (like France, China, or Egypt) are key components, expressions, and symbols of larger, more enduring cultural entities, which he defines as civilizations (e.g., European Civilization, Chinese Civilization, Islamic Civilization). Thus, a nation is a prime example of the larger concept.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Attribution:** The idea originates from Paul Morand, but it is used by Braudel to support his own historical method.\n*   **The Metaphor's Meaning:** The sphere (globe) is contrasted with the planisphere (flat map). This emphasizes the need to study the entity in its three-dimensional, interconnected global context, avoiding the distortions and artificial separations created by flat projections.\n*   **Hierarchy of Concepts:** It is essential to distinguish between the \"nation\" and the entity it exemplifies. The nation is a part; the **civilization** is the whole.\n*   **Core Concept:** The entity, civilization, is central to Braudel's work on the *longue durée*—the long-term, slow-moving structures of history that underpin events and politics.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the specific quote from Fernand Braudel's writing, it is clear that the conceptual entity he discusses, which is exemplified by a nation and should be visualized on a globe, is **civilization**.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
