    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of K.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the tensor and the vector space**\n\nThe vector space $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on the Boolean cube $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. This is a vector space of dimension $2^n$. The space for the tensor is $W = V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, which corresponds to functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe given tensor $T$ is defined by the function:\n$T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\nwhere $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\nWe can decompose this tensor into two parts:\n1.  The product part, $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n2.  The constant part, $C(x, y, z) = 1$.\n\nSo, $T = P - C$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the structure of the tensor P**\n\nThe space $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $V_k = \\mathbb{C}^{\\{0,1\\}}$. Thus, the whole space $W$ can be viewed as the $n$-th tensor power of a smaller space:\n$W \\cong (V_1 \\otimes V_2 \\otimes V_3)^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $S_i(x_i, y_i, z_i) = x_i + y_i + z_i$. This is a function on $\\{0, 1\\}^3$, which corresponds to a tensor in $V_1 \\otimes V_2 \\otimes V_3$. Let's call this base tensor $\\mathbf{S}$.\n\nThe function $P(x, y, z)$ is a product of functions on individual coordinates. In the tensor framework, this corresponds to the tensor product of the individual tensors.\n$P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n S_i(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ corresponds to the tensor $\\mathbf{S}^{\\otimes n}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the slice rank of the base tensor S**\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor is the minimum number of \"slices\" (tensors that depend only on one variable and the rest) needed to represent it.\nThe function for $\\mathbf{S}$ is $S(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$. We can analyze its slice rank with respect to the first variable (1-slice rank). We can write:\n$S(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot (y_1 + z_1)$.\nThis is a sum of two 1-slices:\n- The first slice is $u_1(x_1) \\otimes A_1(y_1, z_1)$, where $u_1(x_1) = x_1$ and $A_1(y_1, z_1) = 1$.\n- The second slice is $u_2(x_1) \\otimes A_2(y_1, z_1)$, where $u_2(x_1) = 1$ and $A_2(y_1, z_1) = y_1 + z_1$.\nThis shows that the 1-slice rank, $SR_1(\\mathbf{S})$, is at most 2.\n\nTo show $SR_1(\\mathbf{S})$ is not 1, assume $S(x_1, y_1, z_1) = u(x_1)A(y_1, z_1)$.\nFor $x_1=0$, we have $y_1+z_1 = u(0)A(y_1, z_1)$.\nFor $x_1=1$, we have $1+y_1+z_1 = u(1)A(y_1, z_1)$.\nIf $u(0)=0$, then $y_1+z_1=0$ for all $y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$, which is false. So $u(0) \\neq 0$.\nIf $u(1)=0$, then $1+y_1+z_1=0$ for all $y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$, which is false. So $u(1) \\neq 0$.\nThen we must have $\\frac{1+y_1+z_1}{y_1+z_1} = \\frac{u(1)}{u(0)}$, a constant. This is not true (e.g., for $(y_1,z_1)=(1,0)$ the ratio is 2, for $(y_1,z_1)=(1,1)$ it's 3/2). Thus, $SR_1(\\mathbf{S}) \\neq 1$.\nSo, $SR_1(\\mathbf{S})=2$.\n\nThe tensor $\\mathbf{S}$ is symmetric with respect to its three variables, so the 2-slice rank and 3-slice rank are also 2. The slice rank of $\\mathbf{S}$ is the minimum of these, so $SR(\\mathbf{S}) = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the slice rank of P and C**\n\nA key property of slice rank is its multiplicativity under the tensor product: $SR(A \\otimes B) = SR(A)SR(B)$.\nUsing this property, we find the slice rank of $P = \\mathbf{S}^{\\otimes n}$:\n$SR(P) = SR(\\mathbf{S}^{\\otimes n}) = (SR(\\mathbf{S}))^n = 2^n$.\n\nNow, consider the constant tensor $C(x,y,z)=1$. This can be written as $u(x)v(y)w(z)$ where $u,v,w$ are constant-1 functions on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. This shows $C$ is a rank-1 tensor. A rank-1 tensor can be written as $u \\otimes (v \\otimes w)$, which is a slice. Therefore, its slice rank is 1. $SR(C) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Bounding the slice rank of T**\n\nWe use the triangle inequality for slice rank: $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$. This also implies a reverse inequality: $SR(A-B) \\ge |SR(A)-SR(B)|$.\nApplying these to $T = P-C$:\n- Upper bound: $SR(T) = SR(P-C) \\le SR(P) + SR(C) = 2^n + 1$.\n- Lower bound: $SR(T) = SR(P-C) \\ge SR(P) - SR(C) = 2^n - 1$.\n\nSo, we have established that $2^n - 1 \\le SR(T) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Asymptotic Analysis and Solving for K**\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank of the tensor is given by the formula $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ represents a sub-exponential factor, meaning it grows slower than any exponential function. Formally, $e^{o(n)} = e^{f(n)}$ where $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(n)/n = 0$.\n\nThe bounds we found, $2^n-1 \\le SR(T) \\le 2^n+1$, determine the asymptotic behavior of $SR(T)$. The base of the exponential growth is 2. Let's verify this by taking the $n$-th root and the limit:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (2^n-1)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2(1-1/2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (2^n+1)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 2(1+1/2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\nBy the squeeze theorem, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (SR(T))^{1/n} = 2$.\n\nNow we do the same for the given expression:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)} \\right)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (3/2^K) (e^{o(n)/n}) = (3/2^K) \\cdot e^0 = 3/2^K$.\n\nEquating the results from our analysis and the given formula:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation of K**\n\nWe solve the equation for $K$:\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3 = 2^{K+1}$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n$\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing logarithm properties, we can write $1 = \\log_2(2)$:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\n<<<log_2(3/2)>>>"
