    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ for a schema $S$ with 4 unary predicates.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Logic and Concepts**\n\n*   **Schema S**: We have $S = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, a set of 4 unary predicates.\n*   **Models**: A model (or structure) for $S$ consists of a domain of elements $U$ and an interpretation for each predicate. For any element $u \\in U$, its \"type\" can be described by which of the 4 predicates are true for it. A type is thus a subset of $S$. The set of all possible types is $\\mathcal{T} = \\mathcal{P}(S)$, so there are $2^4 = 16$ possible types.\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: Formulas are constructed from atomic formulas (like $P_i(x)$) using only existential quantification ($\\exists$) and conjunction ($\\land$). $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false) are also allowed. We are interested in sentences, which are formulas with no free variables.\n*   **Structure of Sentences**: A sentence in this logic is a formula built by applying $\\exists$ and $\\land$. Any sentence in this fragment can be shown to be logically equivalent to a conjunction of simpler sentences. Specifically, any sentence $\\phi$ is equivalent to a formula of the form:\n    $\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{k} \\left( \\exists x_j . \\psi_j(x_j) \\right)$\n    where each $\\psi_j(x_j)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas concerning the variable $x_j$. For instance, $\\psi_j(x_j) = P_{i_1}(x_j) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_m}(x_j)$.\n    Let's denote the sentence $\\exists x . \\bigwedge_{P \\in I} P(x)$ by $A_I$, for a non-empty set $I \\subseteq S$. A model $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $A_I$ if and only if there exists an element $u$ in the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$ such that its type, $t(u)$, is a superset of $I$ (i.e., $I \\subseteq t(u)$).\n    Thus, any concept defined by a sentence in our logic is equivalent to a concept defined by a conjunction of the form $\\phi = \\bigwedge_{j=1}^{k} A_{I_j}$.\n*   **Concept Class**: The concepts are sets of models. A model $\\mathcal{M}$ is in the concept defined by $\\phi = \\bigwedge_j A_{I_j}$ if $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi$. A model is entirely defined by the set of types it contains. Let $T(\\mathcal{M}) \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ be the set of types present in $\\mathcal{M}$. Then, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi$ if and only if for every $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, there exists a type $t \\in T(\\mathcal{M})$ such that $t \\supseteq I_j$.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding VC Dimension**\n\nThe VC dimension is the maximum size $d$ of a set of points (here, models) that can be \"shattered\" by the concept class. A set of models $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{M}_d\\}$ is shattered if for every subset $K \\subseteq \\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{M}_d\\}$, there is a sentence $\\phi$ in the logic that is true for every model in $K$ and false for every model not in $K$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension**\n\nWe can show that the VC dimension is at least 3 by constructing a set of 3 models that can be shattered.\nLet $S' = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\} \\subseteq S$. Consider the following three models, each containing a single element of a specific type:\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_1$: Contains one element of type $\\{P_1, P_2\\}$. Let its type set be $A_1 = \\{\\{P_1, P_2\\}\\}$.\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_2$: Contains one element of type $\\{P_1, P_3\\}$. Let its type set be $A_2 = \\{\\{P_1, P_3\\}\\}$.\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_3$: Contains one element of type $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$. Let its type set be $A_3 = \\{\\{P_2, P_3\\}\\}$.\n\nWe need to show that for any of the $2^3=8$ subsets of $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$, we can find a separating formula.\n*   $\\emptyset$: The formula $\\bot$ (or $A_{\\{P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4\\}}$) is false for all three models.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1\\}$: The formula $\\phi = A_{\\{P_1,P_2\\}}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_1 \\models \\phi$ because $\\{P_1, P_2\\} \\supseteq \\{P_1, P_2\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_2 \\not\\models \\phi$ because its only type $\\{P_1, P_3\\}$ does not contain $\\{P_1, P_2\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_3 \\not\\models \\phi$ because its only type $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$ does not contain $\\{P_1, P_2\\}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_2\\}$: By symmetry, use $\\phi = A_{\\{P_1,P_3\\}}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_3\\}$: By symmetry, use $\\phi = A_{\\{P_2,P_3\\}}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2\\}$: The formula $\\phi = A_{\\{P_1\\}}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_1 \\models \\phi$ because $\\{P_1, P_2\\} \\supseteq \\{P_1\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_2 \\models \\phi$ because $\\{P_1, P_3\\} \\supseteq \\{P_1\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathcal{M}_3 \\not\\models \\phi$ because $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$ does not contain $\\{P_1\\}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$: By symmetry, use $\\phi = A_{\\{P_2\\}}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$: By symmetry, use $\\phi = A_{\\{P_3\\}}$.\n*   $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$: The formula $\\top$ is true for all three.\n\nSince we can find a formula for every subset, the set $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$ is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 3.\n\n**Step 4: Finding an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension**\n\nWe now show that no set of 4 models can be shattered.\nLet $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_3, \\mathcal{M}_4\\}$ be an arbitrary set of four models. We will show it cannot be shattered.\nConsider the subset $K = \\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_2\\}$. To separate this set, we would need a formula $\\phi$ such that $\\mathcal{M}_1 \\models \\phi$, $\\mathcal{M}_2 \\models \\phi$, $\\mathcal{M}_3 \\not\\models \\phi$, and $\\mathcal{M}_4 \\not\\models \\phi$.\nNow, consider another subset $K' = \\{\\mathcal{M}_3, \\mathcal{M}_4\\}$. We would need a formula $\\phi'$ for this set.\nLet's analyze the properties required for a set to be shattered.\n\nConsider the following set of 4 models:\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_1$ with type set $A_1 = \\{\\{P_1\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_2$ with type set $A_2 = \\{\\{P_2\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_3$ with type set $A_3 = \\{\\{P_3\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_4$ with type set $A_4 = \\{\\{P_4\\}\\}$\n\nLet's try to find a formula $\\phi$ that selects the subset $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$ but excludes $\\{\\mathcal{M}_2, \\mathcal{M}_4\\}$.\nLet $\\phi = \\bigwedge_{j} A_{I_j}$.\n*   For $\\mathcal{M}_1$ to satisfy $\\phi$, for each $j$, there must be a type $t \\in A_1$ such that $t \\supseteq I_j$. Since $A_1=\\{\\{P_1\\}\\}$, this means for all $j$, $\\{P_1\\} \\supseteq I_j$. This implies that any non-empty $I_j$ must be $\\{P_1\\}$. So $\\phi$ must be logically equivalent to $A_{\\{P_1\\}}$ (or $\\top$).\n*   Similarly, for $\\mathcal{M}_3$ to satisfy $\\phi$, for each $j$, $I_j$ must be a subset of $\\{P_3\\}$.\nFor the same formula $\\phi$ to be satisfied by both $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_3$, every $I_j$ in its conjunction must be a subset of $\\{P_1\\}$ AND a subset of $\\{P_3\\}$. The only such set is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\nThis means the only formula that both $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_3$ can satisfy is $\\phi = A_\\emptyset$, which is equivalent to $\\top$.\nHowever, the formula $\\top$ is satisfied by all models, including $\\mathcal{M}_2$ and $\\mathcal{M}_4$. Thus, it is impossible to find a formula that selects exactly the set $\\{\\mathcal{M}_1, \\mathcal{M}_3\\}$. Therefore, this set of 4 models cannot be shattered.\n\nA more general argument:\nConsider any set of 4 models. Let's try to isolate the subset $K=\\{\\mathcal{M}_a, \\mathcal{M}_b\\}$. The required formula $\\phi_{ab}$ must be satisfied by both $\\mathcal{M}_a$ and $\\mathcal{M}_b$. Let the set of all predicates appearing in the types of a model $\\mathcal{M}_i$ be $S_i$. If $S_a \\cap S_b = \\emptyset$, then any formula $\\phi=\\bigwedge A_{I_j}$ satisfied by both must have all $I_j = \\emptyset$, meaning $\\phi=\\top$. This fails to separate them from any other model.\nSo, for a set of models to be shattered, it cannot contain two models whose types are predicate-disjoint. Let's try to build a set of 4 models that avoids this.\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_{12}$: type $\\{\\{P_1, P_2\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_{23}$: type $\\{\\{P_2, P_3\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_{34}$: type $\\{\\{P_3, P_4\\}\\}$\n*   $\\mathcal{M}_{41}$: type $\\{\\{P_4, P_1\\}\\}$\nThis set looks more promising. Let's try to select the subset $\\{\\mathcal{M}_{12}, \\mathcal{M}_{34}\\}$. Any formula $\\phi$ satisfied by $\\mathcal{M}_{12}$ must have its $I_j \\subseteq \\{P_1, P_2\\}$. Any formula satisfied by $\\mathcal{M}_{34}$ must have its $I_j \\subseteq \\{P_3, P_4\\}$. For the same formula to satisfy both, all its $I_j$ must be subsets of $\\{P_1, P_2\\} \\cap \\{P_3, P_4\\} = \\emptyset$. So again, the formula must be $\\top$, which does not separate this pair from the others. Thus, this set of 4 models cannot be shattered.\n\nThis indicates that no set of 4 models can be shattered. The VC dimension is therefore less than 4.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nSince we have shown that the VC dimension is at least 3 and less than 4, it must be 3. The fact that $|S|=4$ allows for the construction of the counterexamples used to prove VC-dim < 4. The same argument would hold for any $|S| \\ge 4$."
