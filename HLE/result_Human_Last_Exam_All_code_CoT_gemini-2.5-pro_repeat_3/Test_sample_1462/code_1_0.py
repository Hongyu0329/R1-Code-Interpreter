    # 2. Reasoning process.
    # The combination of severe respiratory distress (indicated by oxygen saturation of 89%)
    # and a "fluid-filled density in the left lung" is the classic presentation of a
    # Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH).
    #
    # A CDH is an anatomical defect caused by the failure of the pleuroperitoneal membrane
    # to close during development. This allows abdominal contents to herniate into the chest.
    #
    # This type of CDH (a Bochdalek hernia) is found on the left side in approximately 85%
    # of cases, which perfectly matches the clinical finding.
    #
    # While macrosomia (12-lb 1-oz weight) suggests maternal diabetes, this is a maternal
    # condition, not a fetal anatomical defect. Other options like a fistula or foregut defect
    # are less likely to present with a finding so specific to the left lung.
    #
    # Therefore, the pleuroperitoneal membrane defect is the most fitting anatomical defect.
