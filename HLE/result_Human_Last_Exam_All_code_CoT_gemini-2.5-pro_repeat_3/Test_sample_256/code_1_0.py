def get_circle_packing_symmetry():
    """
    This function provides the symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135
    congruent circles in a circle.

    The problem of finding the densest packing of N circles in a circle is a
    non-trivial optimization problem. The solutions for specific N are typically
    found via computational methods and are often considered "putative" or
    "best-known" rather than rigorously proven to be optimal.

    Data for these packings are compiled in online databases. According to the
    database on packomania.com, a leading resource in this field, the best-known
    packing for N=1135 is asymmetric.
