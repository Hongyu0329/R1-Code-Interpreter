def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function defines and prints the safe goal for the model M.

    The problem describes a scenario where a model cannot know in advance
    which of its strategies (predictors) will be successful because the set
    of successful strategies is uncomputable. This is a classic AI safety
    problem of acting under radical uncertainty about the true objective.

    A safe goal in such a scenario is not to pursue a fixed, pre-defined objective,
    but to learn the objective itself from interaction. The model receives feedback
    on whether its predictions are correct or not. This feedback acts as an
    "approval" signal.

    Therefore, a safe goal is for the model to learn what constitutes a good
    prediction by observing the feedback it gets. This is encapsulated by the
    phrase "Approval-seeking learning from available feedback".
