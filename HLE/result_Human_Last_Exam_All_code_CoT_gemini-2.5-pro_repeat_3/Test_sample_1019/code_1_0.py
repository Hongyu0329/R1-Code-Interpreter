# The problem asks for the d-threshold of Hamiltonicity for graphs H_n with
# minimum degree d = n/2 - eta, for eta in [1/2, n/64].
#
# Based on the analysis, the threshold behavior is determined by the parameter
# k = floor(n / (d+1)).
#
# The range for eta splits into two regimes:
# 1) For 1 <= eta <= n/64, we find that k = 2.
#    The threshold is p = ln(n) / (2*n).
# 2) For 1/2 <= eta < 1, we find that k = 1.
#    The threshold is significantly lower, on the order of p = O(n^-2).
#
# A single threshold for the entire range must be sufficient for the harder case,
# which requires a higher probability p. This corresponds to the k=2 case.
#
# Therefore, the d-threshold for the entire range is p = ln(n) / (2*n).
# The constant number in the denominator of this equation is 2.

# The constant k in the denominator of the threshold equation p = ln(n) / (k*n)
k = 2
