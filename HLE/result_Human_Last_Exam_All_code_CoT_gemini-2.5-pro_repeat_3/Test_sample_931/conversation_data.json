    "Of course. Here is a python script that determines the diet of adult Raphidiopterans based on established biological facts.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish a \"knowledge base\" of known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) in a Python dictionary. This knowledge includes their predatory nature and their supplemental feeding on nectar/pollen.\n2.  Represent the given multiple-choice options.\n3.  Write code to evaluate each option against the knowledge base.\n4.  The code will specifically check the validity of the combined options (like F and G).\n5.  Finally, it will print the analysis and the most accurate choice based on the evidence. The \"equation\" in this context will be showing how the components of the correct answer (A + E) lead to the final conclusion (F).\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish a knowledge base of known facts.\n    # Adult Raphidiopterans are primarily predatory but also consume nectar.\n    knowledge_base = {\n        \"Nectar\": True,\n        \"Pollen\": True, # They do eat pollen, but specific types can be tricky.\n        \"Aphids\": True, # A primary food source.\n        \"Leaf tissue\": False, # They are not phytophagous (leaf-eaters).\n        \"Fungus\": False\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': 'A and E',\n        'G': 'D and E'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate the components of the combined answers.\n    # Check component A: Nectar\n    is_a_correct = knowledge_base.get(\"Nectar\", False)\n    print(f\"Fact check for component A ({choices['A']}): {'Correct' if is_a_correct else 'Incorrect'}.
