    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this chess problem:\n\n1.  **Parse the Game**: I will first process the given chess moves to reconstruct the exact board position. For this, I'll use the `python-chess` library, which is excellent for handling chess logic.\n2.  **Analyze the Position**: The final position has the White king in a very exposed and dangerous spot on g5. Black is to move and has a significant attack brewing.\n3.  **Search for the Mating Sequence**: The goal is to find the *shortest* possible forced checkmate for Black. I will write a Python script to do this systematically:\n    *   First, the script will check for a mate-in-1 (a single move that is checkmate).\n    *   If no mate-in-1 is found, it will search for a mate-in-2. This means finding a move for Black such that for *every* possible reply by White, Black has a subsequent move that delivers checkmate.\n4.  **Format the Output**: Once the shortest mating sequence is found, I will format the moves in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), as requested, showing the moves for Black and White in order.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the solution:\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.pgn\nimport io\n\ndef solve_chess_mate():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a specific chess position to find the shortest\n    mating sequence for black.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The PGN of the game leading to the position\n    pgn_string = \"1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
