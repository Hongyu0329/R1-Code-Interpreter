    "My plan is to solve this geographical riddle by breaking it down into distinct clues and systematically checking them against known remote islands.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Isolation:** More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island. This points to extremely remote locations like Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or Pitcairn Island.\n    *   **Geography:** The town sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera. This is a very specific geological feature.\n    *   **Naming:** The bay and the town share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's extremely isolated, but the town's name does not match the bay's name.\n    *   **Pitcairn Island:** The main settlement is Adamstown, which sits above Bounty Bay. The names do not match.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is **Hanga Roa**, and it sits on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The names match, and the island is famously isolated (over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands). The island is volcanic and known for its calderas (like Rano Kau). Hanga Roa Bay is located on the coast between two of the island's main volcanoes, so its formation is directly linked to the volcanic landscape. This makes it the best fit for all the clues.\n\n3.  **Final Code:** I will create a Python script that prints the identified town's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the island town that meets all the given criteria.\n\n    The criteria are:\n    1. An island town.\n    2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4. The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n    The answer is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - It is the main town on Easter Island.\n    - It is over 2,000 km from the nearest inhabited land (Pitcairn Island), satisfying the > 500 km requirement.\n    - The town of Hanga Roa sits on Hanga Roa Bay. The names match.\n    - Easter Island is of volcanic origin, and the bay's geography is a direct result of the volcanic activity that also created the island's famous calderas.\n    \"\"\"\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
