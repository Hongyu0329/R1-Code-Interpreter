    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve this task.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided text to identify all the numbers, whether they are written as digits or words.\n- From the year \"2008\", I will extract the digits 2, 0, 0, and 8.\n- From the phrase \"single-turn\", I will extract the number 1.\n- From the phrase \"fifth position\", I will extract the number 5.\n- From \"Act l\", I will interpret the Roman numeral 'l' as the number 1.\n\nNext, I will determine the mathematical operations to form an equation.\n- I will start by summing the digits of the year: 2 + 0 + 0 + 8.\n- The word \"from\" in \"from the fifth position\" suggests subtraction. Based on this clue, I will subtract the remaining numbers from the sum.\n\nThis gives me the final equation: 2 + 0 + 0 + 8 - 5 - 1 - 1.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to calculate and display this equation and its result.\n\n```python\n# Extracting the numbers from the text\nyear_digits = [2, 0, 0, 8]\nposition = 5\nturn = 1\nact = 1\n\n# Calculating the sum of the digits of the year\nsum_of_year_digits = sum(year_digits)\n\n# Performing the final calculation based on the derived equation\nresult = sum_of_year_digits - position - turn - act\n\n# Printing the equation and the final answer\n# as requested in the prompt\nprint(f\"{year_digits[0]} + {year_digits[1]} + {year_digits[2]} + {year_digits[3]} - {position} - {turn} - {act} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
