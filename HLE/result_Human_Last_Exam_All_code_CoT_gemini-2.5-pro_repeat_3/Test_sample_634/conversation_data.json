    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. The method involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix:** Create a new matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations:** Apply a series of elementary row operations to the matrix `M`. These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying `M` by a unimodular matrix. The goal is to reduce `M` to an upper triangular form, specifically to the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is a 2x2 zero matrix.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD:** The resulting non-zero matrix `G` at the top is a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to carry out the polynomial matrix operations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices\n    using elementary row operations on a stacked matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M by joining P1 and P2 vertically\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # The following sequence of elementary row operations reduces M to the form [G; 0]\n\n    # Swap R1 and R3 to get a simpler pivot\n    M.row_swap(0, 2)\n    # R2 -> R2 + s*R1\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] + s * M[0, :]\n    # R3 -> R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] - (s + 1) * M[0, :]\n\n    # Swap R1 and R2 to bring [-1, s**2] to the top, then normalize it to [1, -s**2]\n    M.row_swap(0, 1)\n    M[0, :] = -1 * M[0, :]\n\n    # Use the new R1 = [1, -s**2] to eliminate the first element in other rows\n    # R2 -> R2 - s*R1\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - s * M[0, :]\n    # R4 -> R4 + (s+1)*R1\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + (s + 1) * M[0, :]\n    \n    # At this point, M has the form:\n    # [1,     -s**2]\n    # [0,     s**3]\n    # [0,     -s]\n    # [0,     1 - s**3 - s**2]\n\n    # We now focus on the second column.
