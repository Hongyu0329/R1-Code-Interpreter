def provide_vertex_algebra_answers():
    """
    This function provides answers to the theoretical questions about the
    simplicity and structure of the vertex algebra V(p).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The vertex algebra V(p) for p in Z_{>=1} is known as the triplet
        W-algebra. It is a standard result in the field that these algebras
        are not simple for these values of p; they possess non-trivial ideals.
    (b) A non-trivial ideal I in V(p) must be a module for the VOA V(p).
        Since the affine algebra L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p), I must
        also be a module for L_k(sl_2). As a non-trivial submodule of a
        highest-weight module, I must be generated by a singular vector.
        Therefore, an ideal must satisfy both properties.
    (c) If V(p) were reducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module, it would contain a
        singular vector v. This vector would generate a non-trivial proper
        ideal in the VOA V(p), which would contradict the assumption that
        V(p) is simple. Thus, simplicity implies irreducibility.
