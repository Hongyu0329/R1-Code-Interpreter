    "This is a linguistic task. The name \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized form of a Frankish (a Germanic tribe in Gaul) name, not strictly Gaulish (which is Celtic). To find its French equivalent, we look at how such names were adapted in French historiography. The historical figure Odobeccus, a Frankish general, is typically referred to as \"Eudoxe\" in French historical texts.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to state this fact.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the French equivalent for the Gaulish/Frankish name \"Odobeccus\".\n    \"\"\"\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    french_equivalent = \"Eudoxe\"\n    \n    print(f\"The equivalent of the Gaulish/Frankish name '{gaulish_name}' in French is '{french_equivalent}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Eudoxe>>>"
