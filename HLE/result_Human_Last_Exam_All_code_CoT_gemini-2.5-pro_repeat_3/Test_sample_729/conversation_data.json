    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. These groups are of order $2^n$. For a size of 128, we have $2^n = 128$.\n2.  **Determine n:** I will solve for $n$ using the logarithm function, $n = \\log_2(128)$.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem:** There is a known result in group theory for the number of power subgroups in $Q_{2^n}$. A power subgroup is a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ such that $H = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. The number of distinct power subgroups in $Q_{2^n}$ is exactly $n$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Using the value of $n$ found in step 2, I will determine the total number of power subgroups.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out the steps and the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_Q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # The problem asks for the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group\n    # of size 128. Let this group be G.\n    print(f\"The size of the generalized quaternion group G is {group_size}.\")\n\n    # The generalized quaternion groups are denoted Q_{2^n}, where 2^n is the order of the group.\n    # We need to find the value of 'n' for the group of size 128.\n    # This gives us the equation: 2^n = 128.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the parameter 'n' for the group Q_128.\")\n    print(f\"The group order is given by the equation: 2^n = {group_size}\")\n    \n    # To solve for n, we take the base-2 logarithm of the group size.\n    n = math.log2(group_size)\n    \n    print(\"Solving for n by taking the logarithm base 2:\")\n    print(f\"n = log2({group_size})\")\n    print(f\"n = {int(n)}\")\n\n    # A known result from group theory states that the number of power subgroups\n    # in the generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} is exactly n.\n    num_power_subgroups = int(n)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the theorem for the number of power subgroups.\")\n    print(\"For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}, the number of power subgroups is exactly n.\")\n    print(f\"Since n = {int(n)}, the number of power subgroups is {num_power_subgroups}.\")\n\ncount_power_subgroups_in_Q128()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
