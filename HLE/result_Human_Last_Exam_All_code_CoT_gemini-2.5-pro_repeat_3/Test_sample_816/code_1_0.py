    In most pure metals, Temperature goes UP -> Surface Tension goes DOWN. This causes outward flow.
    However, in 304 Stainless Steel, trace elements like Sulfur act as surfactants.
    For stainless steel, Temperature goes UP -> Surface Tension goes UP.
    The center of the weld pool is the hottest, so it has the highest surface tension.
    The edges are cooler, so they have lower surface tension.
    The Marangoni force pulls the fluid from low surface tension (edges) to high surface tension (center).
    This results in the observed INWARD flow on the surface.
