    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the mathematical formula for `a(n)`, which represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics. This sequence is given by the double factorial of `2n-1`. The formula is `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`.\n2.  The problem asks for the value of `a(3)`. I will substitute `n=3` into the formula, which gives `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n3.  The double factorial `5!!` is calculated as the product of all odd integers from 5 down to 1, which is `5 * 3 * 1`.\n4.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will define `n=3`, generate the numbers for the double factorial, calculate the final product, and print the entire equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate `a(3)`:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n - 1)!! (double factorial).\n    This function also prints the full equation for the calculation.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The input value for the function a(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The term for the double factorial is 2n - 1\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    # Check for non-positive k which is not standard for this problem\n    if k < 1:\n        print(f\"a({n}) = 0\")\n        return 0\n    \n    # Collect the terms for the equation string\n    terms = []\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        terms.append(str(i))\n        \n    # Calculate the result using math.prod for Python 3.8+ or a loop\n    # For compatibility, a loop is safer.\n    result = 1\n    for term in terms:\n        result *= int(term)\n\n    # Format the equation string\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(terms)\n    \n    # Print the final equation and result\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\n# The user is asking for a(3)\nn_value = 3\ncalculate_feynman_diagrams(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
