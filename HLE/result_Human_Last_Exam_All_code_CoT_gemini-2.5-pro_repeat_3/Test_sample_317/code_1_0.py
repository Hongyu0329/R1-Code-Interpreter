    Analyzes Kenneth Burke's concept of the "Tribal No" to determine
    if it belongs to the realm of motion or action.
    """

    # Step 1: Define Burke's distinction between Motion and Action.
    # Motion is the realm of the purely physical, non-symbolic, and sensory (e.g., a falling rock).
    # Action is the realm of the symbolic, language, meaning, and motive (e.g., a command).
    print("Step 1: According to Burke, 'motion' is the non-symbolic realm of nature, while 'action' is the symbolic realm of human meaning and language.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the "Tribal No".
    # The "Tribal No" is a foundational prohibition ("Thou shalt not").
    # For Burke, the Negative (the "not") is the quintessential invention of symbolism/language.
    # Nature has no concept of "not"; it only has presence.
    print("Step 2: The 'Tribal No' is a form of the Negative ('Thou shalt not').")

    # Step 3: Conclude the realm of the "Tribal No".
    # Since the Negative is purely symbolic, it must belong to the realm of Action.
    # This eliminates any choices suggesting it is in the realm of Motion.
    print("Step 3: Burke posits that the Negative is purely a creation of symbols and does not exist in the realm of motion.")
    print("Step 4: Therefore, the 'Tribal No' must belong to the realm of 'Action'. This eliminates choices B, C, and D.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the remaining justifications for 'Action'.
    # Choice A: Action; it is imaginal.
    # Choice E: Action; it is rational.
    # The "Tribal No" is constructed through the symbolic imagination of a culture via its language and myths.
    # While it can be subject to rational thought, its origin is in this symbolic, creative, "imaginal" capacity.
    # "Imaginal" is a more fundamental and accurate descriptor in Burke's terms.
    print("Step 5: We must now choose between the justifications for 'Action': A ('imaginal') and E ('rational').")
    print("Step 6: The Negative is created and sustained through the symbolic imagination; it is a concept 'imagined' into existence through language. This is more fundamental than it being simply 'rational'.")
    print("Step 7: 'Imaginal' better describes the foundational, symbolic nature of the 'Tribal No' than 'rational'.")
