    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of sticker colors one must see on the side of the last layer to uniquely determine which of the 21 PLL cases is present. This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of stickers required to deduce the exact permutation of all 4 corner pieces and all 4 edge pieces in the last layer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Determine Corner Permutation:** We'll figure out how many corner stickers must be seen to know where all 4 corners are supposed to go. To know the arrangement of 4 unique items, you only need to locate 3 of them; the 4th is then determined by elimination. To uniquely identify a corner piece, its two side stickers must be seen.\n2.  **Determine Edge Permutation:** We'll figure out how many edge stickers are needed. A key property of a Rubik's Cube is that the parity of the corner permutation (whether it took an even or odd number of swaps) must match the parity of the edge permutation. We can use this fact to our advantage. By locating just 2 of the 4 edge pieces, the remaining two can only be in their correct positions or swapped. These two scenarios have different parities. Since we already know the required parity from the corners, we can determine the full edge permutation without seeing the other two edge pieces.\n3.  **Sum for the Total:** The total minimum number of stickers is the sum of the stickers needed for the corners and the edges.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan and prints the reasoning for each step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_pll_stickers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to be seen to identify any PLL case.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Determine the corner permutation ---\n    # To determine the permutation of 4 unique pieces, we only need to\n    # find the identity and position of 3 of them.

Once we know the corner\n    # permutation, we know the required parity for the edges.\n    \n    # We only need to identify 2 of the 4 edges.
