    Analyzes the feasibility of the program described in question B.

    The core problem is the strict performance constraint: steps <= x + 50.
    This means the total number of non-booping "overhead" instructions must be
    less than or equal to 50.

    A simple loop like `BOOP; DECREMENT; JUMP` takes at least 3 steps per boop,
    which violates the constraint for large x (since 3x > x + 50).

    The only viable strategy is to have a long, straight-line block of BOOP
    instructions and halt execution after exactly x of them. This can be
    achieved by having the program write a HALT instruction at the correct
    future memory address (e.g., at address `k + x`).

    This requires the program to construct a `STORE (k+x) <- reg` instruction
    on the fly. We will calculate the minimum number of steps required to do this.
    """

    # According to the problem spec, the arguments for an instruction like
    # STORE adr <- reg are packed into the lower bits of the instruction word.
    # With A=64 (address bits) and R=64 (register bits), a reasonable
    # packing scheme for the arguments `(adr, reg)` is `(adr << 64) | reg`.
    # The program must compute this value to create the instruction.

    # Step 1: Calculate the target address for the HALT instruction.
    # Let's say the BOOP block starts at address 50. We want to write HALT to `50 + x`.
    # This requires loading the constant 50 and adding x (from reg0).
    # LOAD reg1 <- const_50   (1 step)
    # ADD reg1 <- reg1, reg0  (1 step)
    steps_calc_addr = 2

    # Step 2: Compute `address << 64` to position it correctly in the instruction word.
    # The instruction set only has ADD and BITWISENAND. A left shift by 1 (y << 1)
    # is equivalent to `y + y`, which takes one ADD instruction.
    # To shift left by 64 bits, we must perform this addition 64 times.
    steps_shift_64 = 64

    # Step 3: Assemble the full STORE instruction word.
    # The word is `(opcode << 509) | (address << 64) | reg_index`.
    # The parts have no overlapping bits, so they can be combined using ADD.
    # This involves loading the constant parts and adding everything together.
    # LOAD op_part; LOAD reg_idx_part; ADD to shifted_addr; ADD again.
    steps_assemble = 4

    # Step 4: Store the newly created instruction in memory to be executed later.
    # STORE some_addr <- new_instruction_reg
    steps_store_instr = 1

    # Total minimum overhead is the sum of these steps.
    min_overhead_steps = steps_calc_addr + steps_shift_64 + steps_assemble + steps_store_instr
    max_allowed_overhead = 50
