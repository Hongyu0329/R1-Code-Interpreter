    "My plan is to compute the continued fraction for the quadratic irrational number associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify the number:** The generalized Markov number \\( m_{r/s} \\) is associated with the quadratic irrational number \\( \\alpha_{r/s} = \\frac{3s-2r + \\sqrt{9s^2 - 4}}{2s} \\). For \\( r=4 \\) and \\( s=7 \\), this number is \\( \\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{3(7) - 2(4) + \\sqrt{9(7^2) - 4}}{2(7)} = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{437}}{14} \\).\n\n2.  **Algorithm for Continued Fraction of a Quadratic Irrational:** I will use the standard algorithm to compute the continued fraction. A number of the form \\( \\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q} \\) can be expanded using an efficient algorithm, but it requires that \\( Q \\) divides \\( D - P^2 \\).\n    For our number, \\( P=13, D=437, Q=14 \\). \\( D - P^2 = 437 - 169 = 268 \\). Since 14 does not divide 268, the standard algorithm cannot be applied directly.\n\n3.  **Adapt the Algorithm:** I will first compute the integer part, \\( a_0 \\), and the first remainder, \\( \\xi_1 \\).\n    *   \\( a_0 = \\lfloor \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{437}}{14} \\rfloor = 2 \\).\n    *   The remainder is \\( \\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{437}}{14}) - 2} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{437} - 15} \\).\n\n4.  **Transform the Remainder:** I will rationalize the denominator of \\( \\xi_1 \\) and manipulate it into the standard form \\( \\frac{P_1 + \\sqrt{D_1}}{Q_1} \\) where \\( Q_1 \\) divides \\( D_1 - P_1^2 \\).\n    *   \\( \\xi_1 = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{437} + 15)}{437 - 15^2} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{437} + 15)}{212} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{437} + 105}{106} \\).\n    *   To get a single integer under the square root, this is rewritten as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{49 \\cdot 437} + 105}{106} = \\frac{105 + \\sqrt{21413}}{106} \\).\n    *   Now, with \\( P_1=105, D_1=21413, Q_1=106 \\), we check the condition: \\( D_1 - P_1^2 = 21413 - 105^2 = 10388 \\). Since \\( 10388 / 106 = 98 \\), the condition is met.\n\n5.  **Compute the Repeating Part:** I will apply the standard continued fraction algorithm to \\( \\xi_1 = \\frac{105 + \\sqrt{21413}}{106} \\) to find the repeating sequence of coefficients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k) \\). The algorithm proceeds by generating a sequence of \\( (P_i, Q_i, a_i) \\) until a pair \\( (P_i, Q_i) \\) repeats.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Answer:** The final continued fraction will be \\( [a_0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k}] \\). The Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_continued_fraction_for_markov():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    r, s = 4, 7\n\n    # Calculate the components of the number alpha = (p0 + sqrt(d0)) / q0\n    p0 = 3 * s - 2 * r\n    d0 = 9 * s**2 - 4\n    q0 = 2 * s\n\n    print(f\"The number is alpha = ({p0} + sqrt({d0})) / {q0}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Compute a0\n    sqrt_d0 = math.sqrt(d0)\n    a0 = math.floor((p0 + sqrt_d0) / q0)\n    \n    coeffs = [a0]\n    \n    # Step 2: Transform the remainder to a form suitable for the PQa algorithm.\n    # The remainder is xi_1 = 1 / (alpha - a0).\n    # After rationalizing and rearranging, we get xi_1 = (P1 + sqrt(D1)) / Q1\n    # P1 = a0*q0^2 - p0*q0\n    # D1 = d0*q0^2\n    # Q1 = d0 - (p0 - a0*q0)^2\n    # To avoid large numbers, we simplify this transformation.\n    # xi_1 = q0 / (p0 - a0*q0 + sqrt(d0))\n    # Let num = p0 - a0*q0 = 13 - 2*14 = -15\n    # xi_1 = q0 * (-num + sqrt(d0)) / (d0 - num^2)\n    # xi_1 = (14 * 15 + 14 * sqrt(437)) / (437 - 225)\n    # xi_1 = (210 + 14 * sqrt(437)) / 212\n    # xi_1 = (105 + 7 * sqrt(437)) / 106\n    # xi_1 = (105 + sqrt(49*437)) / 106\n    # xi_1 = (105 + sqrt(21413)) / 106\n    P = 105\n    D = 21413\n    Q = 106\n\n    sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)\n    \n    # Keep track of (P, Q) pairs to detect the cycle\n    seen_states = {}\n    \n    # Step 3: Run the PQa algorithm\n    while (P, Q) not in seen_states:\n        seen_states[(P, Q)] = len(coeffs)\n        \n        a = math.floor((P + sqrt_D) / Q)\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        \n        P_next = a * Q - P\n        Q_next = (D - P_next**2) // Q\n        \n        P = P_next\n        Q = Q_next\n\n    # The cycle starts at the index stored in seen_states[(P,Q)]\n    start_of_period = seen_states[(P, Q)]\n    non_repeating_part = coeffs[:start_of_period]\n    repeating_part = coeffs[start_of_period:]\n\n    a0_str = str(non_repeating_part[0])\n    repeating_str = \", \".join(map(str, repeating_part))\n\n    print(\"\\nThe continued fraction is:\")\n    # Using overline for repeating part is standard but hard in plain text.\n    # We will show the equation with the coefficients.\n    print(f\"({p0} + sqrt({d0})) / {q0} = [{a0_str}; {repeating_str}, ...]\")\n    print(\"\\nEach number in the final equation:\")\n    print(f\"Integer part a_0: {a0_str}\")\n    print(f\"Repeating part: {repeating_part}\")\n\ncompute_continued_fraction_for_markov()\n<<<[2; 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2]>>>\n```"
