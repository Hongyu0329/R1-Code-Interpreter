    "My plan is to identify the radical for the kanji 謄 and then provide its name using Hepburn romanization.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji**: I will first break down the character 謄 into its constituent parts. The character is composed of a left part and a right part: 月 and 朕.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: In most characters structured this way, the left part is the radical (or *bushu*). In this case, the radical is 月.\n3.  **Determine the Radical's Name**: The radical 月 has a specific name when it appears on the left side of a character as a variant of 肉 (meat). This name is にくづき (nikuzuki).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: I will convert the hiragana name にくづき into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will create a simple Python script to state the character, its radical, and the Hepburn name of the radical, and then print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    radical_component = \"月\"\n    radical_name_japanese = \"にくづき\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzuki\"\n\n    print(f\"The Japanese character is: {kanji}\")\n    print(f\"The radical (bushu) is the left component: {radical_component}\")\n    print(f\"The name of this radical is '{radical_name_japanese}', which is transcribed as '{radical_name_hepburn}' in Hepburn romanization.\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
