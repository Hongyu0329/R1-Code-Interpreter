# This script demonstrates Agent A's flawed calculation based on a false premise.

# Define the initial parameters based on the problem description
initial_probability = 0.01
quarterly_increase = 0.01
duration_in_years = 5
quarters_per_year = 4

# Agent A's calculation steps
total_quarters = duration_in_years * quarters_per_year

# The first quarter has the initial probability. The increase is applied for the remaining quarters.
# Therefore, for 20 quarters in total, there are 19 increases.
number_of_increases = total_quarters - 1
total_increase_amount = number_of_increases * quarterly_increase

# The final probability is calculated by adding the total increase to the initial probability.
final_projected_probability = initial_probability + total_increase_amount

# Output the explanation and the flawed equation, showing each number.
