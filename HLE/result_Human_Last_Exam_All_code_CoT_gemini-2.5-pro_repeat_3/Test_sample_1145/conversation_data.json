    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a 1D box. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the Formula**: The probability `P` of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n2.  **Wavefunction for a 1D Box**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`.\n3.  **Probability Density**: The probability density is `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n4.  **Set up the Integral**: We need to calculate the integral `P = ∫ (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a) dx` from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a` for the quantum state `n = 2`.\n5.  **Simplify and Calculate**: The integral can be simplified by a change of variables (`u = x/a`), which shows the result is independent of the box length `a`. We can then use numerical integration to find the value accurately. The Python library `scipy.integrate.quad` is well-suited for this task.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.integrate\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_particle_in_box_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    within a specific interval for a given quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define the constants for the problem ---\n    # Quantum state\n    n = 2\n    # Lower bound of the interval as a fraction of box length 'a'\n    x1_norm = 0.495\n    # Upper bound of the interval as a fraction of box length 'a'\n    x2_norm = 0.505\n\n    # --- Explain the theory ---\n    # The probability P is the integral of the probability density |ψ(x)|² over the interval.\n    # P = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ(x)|² dx\n    # For a 1D box, |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a).\n    # The integral becomes: P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx.\n    # By substituting u = x/a, the integral simplifies to ∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2*sin²(2*π*u) du,\n    # which shows the result is independent of 'a'.\n\n    # --- Define the integrand for numerical integration ---\n    # The variable 'u' represents the normalized position x/a.\n    def probability_density_integrand(u, n_val):\n        return 2 * (math.sin(n_val * math.pi * u))**2\n\n    # --- Perform the numerical integration ---\n    # scipy.integrate.quad returns a tuple: (result, estimated_error)\n    probability, _ = scipy.integrate.quad(\n        probability_density_integrand,\n        x1_norm,\n        x2_norm,\n        args=(n,)\n    )\n\n    # --- Print the final results ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box.\")\n    print(f\"The quantum state is n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The interval is from x = {x1_norm}a to x = {x2_norm}a.\")\n    print(f\"The probability is found by solving the integral: P = integral from {x1_norm}a to {x2_norm}a of (2/a)*sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_particle_in_box_probability()\n<<<6.579708311379366e-06>>>"
