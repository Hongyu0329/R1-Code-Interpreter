    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. She died on September 12, 1368.\n\nSecond, I need to find records of Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368. Historical accounts show that during 1368, Chaucer, who was an esquire in the king's household, was sent on a diplomatic mission to the continent.\n\nThird, I must check if the exact dates of his mission are known. While we know he traveled abroad in 1368, the precise dates of his departure and return are not documented. Therefore, it is impossible to say with certainty whether he was still on the continent or had already returned to England on the specific day Blanche died. This historical ambiguity makes his exact location at that moment unknown.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate a Python script to present these facts and derive the most accurate conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes historical facts to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location\n    when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Known facts\n    blanche_death_date = \"September 12, 1368\"\n    blanche_death_location = \"England\"\n    chaucer_status_1368 = \"Esquire in the English royal court\"\n    chaucer_activity_1368 = \"Traveled to the continent on a diplomatic mission\"\n\n    # The problem: uncertainty in the timeline\n    uncertainty = \"The exact dates of Chaucer's 1368 diplomatic mission are not known.\"\n\n    print(\"Investigating the location of Geoffrey Chaucer on the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\")\n    print(f\"1.
