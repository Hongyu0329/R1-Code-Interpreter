    Calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks in CP^4 with boundary
    on the iterated monotone Biran circle bundle lift of a Chekanov torus from CP^2.
    
    The calculation proceeds as follows:
    1.  Start with the known number of Maslov 2 disks for the base Lagrangian,
        the Chekanov torus in CP^2. This number is 2.
    2.  The "iterated Biran lift" takes a Lagrangian from CP^n to CP^(n+1).
        We need two such lifts to go from CP^2 to CP^4.
    3.  Each Biran lift is known to increase the count of Maslov 2 disks by exactly 1.
    4.  The script will therefore start with 2 and add 1 for each of the two lifts.
