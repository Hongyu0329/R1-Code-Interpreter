    "Based on the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`, here is the step-by-step analysis to find White's optimal move.\n\n**1. Analyze the Position**\n\n*   **White's Pieces:** King on g1, Queen on f2, Pawn on a4, Pawn on d6.\n*   **Black's Pieces:** King on b6, Queen on c5, Pawn on a5, Pawn on c6, Pawn on d7.\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   It is White's turn to move.\n    *   Black's Queen on c5 is attacking White's Queen on f2. White must address this immediately.\n    *   White has a strong pawn on d6, which cramps Black's position. However, it is currently blocked by Black's pawn on d7 and cannot advance on its own.\n    *   White's king is somewhat exposed to potential checks from the active black queen.\n\n**2. Evaluate Candidate Moves**\n\n*   **`1. Qxc5+`**: Trading queens leads to a King and Pawn endgame. After `1...kxc5`, Black's king is on c5, very active and ready to attack White's d6 pawn (`...Kxd6`). White's king on g1 is too far away to defend. This line is losing for White.\n\n*   **`1. Qf7+`**: This move checks the black king and attacks the d7 pawn. After `1...Kb7`, White can play `2. Qxd7`, winning the pawn and unblocking the d-pawn. However, Black can respond with a series of checks starting with `2...Qc1+`, leading to a perpetual check. This results in a draw. While a draw is better than a loss, White has a winning line.\n\n*   **`1. Qf8+`**: This is the most forceful and ultimately winning move. Let's analyze the sequence:\n    1.  `1. Qf8+` This is a check, and Black has only one legal move: `1...Kc7`. The king cannot move to b7 because the White queen on f8 controls that square.\n    2.  `2. Qe7!` This is the brilliant follow-up. It puts Black in a dire situation with two simultaneous threats:\n        *   It attacks the black queen on c5.\n        *   It sets up a deadly checkmate threat on c7 (`Qxc7#`).\n    3.  Black must move the queen. Most moves lose instantly to `3. Qxc7#`. Black's only real try is to start a series of checks to buy time or to defend c7.\n        *   If Black tries to trade with `2...Qxc6`, White plays `3. Qxc6+ Kxc6`, which leads to a drawn King and Pawn endgame. But Black has a better try.\n        *   Black's best defense is `2...Qc1+`. The line continues: `3. Kh2 Qf4+ 4. g3 Qh6+ 5. Kg1`.\n    4.  Now, the checks have stopped for a moment. White is still threatening `Qxc7#`. Black's best attempt to defend is `5...Qc6`, hoping to trade queens and reach the drawn endgame mentioned earlier.\n    5.  However, White has a stunning winning resource: `6. Qe5+!`. This check avoids the queen trade and keeps the attack going. After the black king moves (e.g., `6...Kb7`), White can play `7. Qxd7+`, winning the d7 pawn. White's d-pawn is now unstoppable, and Black's checking possibilities have been exhausted. White will go on to win the game.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe move `Qf8+` forces a winning sequence for White. It is superior to other moves which lead to a loss or a draw.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the best move for White in the given chess position.\n    The FEN for the position is: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on the analysis, the winning move is Qf8+.\n    # 1.

Black's best defense involves a series of checks which White can parry.\n    # 4. White has a subtle winning resource (6.
