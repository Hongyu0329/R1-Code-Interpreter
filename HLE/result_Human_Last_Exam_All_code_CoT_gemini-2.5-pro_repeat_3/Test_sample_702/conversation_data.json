    "This is a question from the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. I will provide a brief explanation of the concepts involved and then use a known result to calculate the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects:** The question asks for the connectivity of a map between two topological spaces, $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  **Explain the concept of connectivity:** The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the map induces isomorphisms on the first $k-1$ homotopy groups ($\\pi_i$ for $i < k$) and a surjection on the $k$-th homotopy group ($\\pi_k$).\n3.  **Generalize the problem:** The map in question is a specific instance (for $m=4$ and $n=6$) of a general map studied in homotopy theory:\n    $\\lambda: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$\n4.  **Cite the relevant theorem:** The connectivity of this map has been studied by mathematicians. A key result states that for $m, n \\ge 2$, the connectivity of the map $\\lambda$ is given by the simple formula $m+n-1$.\n5.  **Calculate the specific case:** Apply the formula for $m=4$ and $n=6$ to find the connectivity.\n6.  **Provide the Python code:** Write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and display the result as requested.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the connectivity based on this established mathematical result.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the connectivity of the map\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n# This is an instance of a general map in homotopy theory:\n# f_mn: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n).\n# According to results in algebraic topology, the connectivity of this map\n# is given by the formula: m + n - 1.\n\n# Set the dimensions of the spheres from the problem.\nm = 4\nn = 6\n\n# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.\nconnectivity = m + n - 1\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation,\n# showing each number in the equation.\nprint(\"The connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n) is given by the formula m + n - 1.\")\nprint(f\"For the given map, m = {m} and n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{m} + {n} - 1 = {connectivity}\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
