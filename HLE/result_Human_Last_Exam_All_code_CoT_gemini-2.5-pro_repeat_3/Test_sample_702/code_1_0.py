# The user is asking for the connectivity of the map
# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).
# This is an instance of a general map in homotopy theory:
# f_mn: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n).
# According to results in algebraic topology, the connectivity of this map
# is given by the formula: m + n - 1.

# Set the dimensions of the spheres from the problem.
m = 4
n = 6

# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.
connectivity = m + n - 1

# Print the explanation and the final calculation,
# showing each number in the equation.
