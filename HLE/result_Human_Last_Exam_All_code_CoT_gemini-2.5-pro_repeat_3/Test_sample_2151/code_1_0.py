# The analytical derivation shows that the required quantity -u(0,1)/2
# is given by the expression 3 / (e^2 + 3).
# This script calculates the value of this expression and prints its components.

# The numbers that form the final equation
numerator = 3
denominator_constant = 3

# The mathematical constant e
e = math.e

# Perform the calculation
denominator = e**2 + denominator_constant
result = numerator / denominator

# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation and the result.
# The final equation is of the form: numerator / (e^2 + denominator_constant)
print(f"The equation for the final quantity is: {numerator} / (e^2 + {denominator_constant})")
