    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the specific time frame, which is from the beginning of World War II in September 1939 until the French armistice on June 22, 1940.\n2.  Next, I will search through historical records of both French naval and merchant vessels that were lost during this period.\n3.  I will filter this list to include only ships confirmed to have been sunk by German U-boats.\n4.  For the remaining candidates, I will find their displacement tonnage, which is the actual weight of the ship.\n5.  Finally, I will identify the ship with the largest displacement and present this information, along with key figures like its tonnage and the date it was sunk, using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and displays information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ship details based on historical research\n    ship_name = \"Sheherazade\"\n    ship_type = \"Tanker\"\n    \n    # Gross Register Tonnage is a measure of volume, not weight.\n    gross_register_tonnage = 13467\n    \n    # Displacement is the actual weight of the vessel.
