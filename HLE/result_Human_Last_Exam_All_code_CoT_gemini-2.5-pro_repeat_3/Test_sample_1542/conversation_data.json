    "To find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, we can perform a computational search. A quadratic form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ is defined by its coefficients $(a, b, c)$, where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\nTwo forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(T(x, y))$. This equivalence relation partitions the set of all 512 quadratic forms into disjoint equivalence classes (orbits). Our goal is to count the number of these orbits.\n\nWe can solve this problem by systematically exploring the space of all quadratic forms. We will treat the 512 forms as vertices in a graph. An edge exists between two forms if one can be transformed into the other by a generator of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. The equivalence classes are the connected components of this graph.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Create a list of all 512 possible forms $(a,b,c)$.\n2.  Maintain a `visited` set to keep track of forms that have already been assigned to an equivalence class.\n3.  Initialize a counter for the number of classes to zero.\n4.  Iterate through each of the 512 forms.\n5.  If a form has not been visited, it means we have found a new, uncounted equivalence class. Increment the class counter.\n6.  Start a graph traversal (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) from this unvisited form to find all other forms in its orbit.\n7.  Mark all forms found during the traversal as visited.\n8.  Once the iteration is complete, the counter will hold the total number of equivalence classes.\n\nThe group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by a small set of matrices. Applying these generators to a quadratic form will produce its neighbors in the graph. The necessary transformations on the coefficients $(a,b,c)$ are derived from these generator matrices:\n-   Shear transformations, like the one corresponding to $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n-   Lower triangular shear transformations, like from $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n-   Scaling transformations, corresponding to diagonal matrices like $T = \\begin{pmatrix} u & 0 \\\\ 0 & v \\end{pmatrix}$ where $u,v$ are units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e., $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$).\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm to compute the number of equivalence classes.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in 2 variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n\n    A quadratic form Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 is represented by a tuple\n    of its coefficients (a, b, c), where a, b, c are in Z/8Z.\n\n    Two forms are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an\n    invertible linear transformation (an element of GL(2, Z/8Z)).\n\n    The method is to iterate through all 512 possible forms.
