def solve_graph_harmony_problem():
    """
    Solves the graph harmony problem based on the derived values.

    The problem statement contains a contradiction between the number of edges (m=16)
    and the other parameters (n=9, h(G)=4). Based on a detailed analysis, the
    most plausible intended parameters lead to a graph with 18 edges and a vertex
    partition of sizes (n1, n2, n3, n4) = (2, 3, 2, 2).

    From these corrected parameters, we can derive the values for p, q, and r.

    # Path lengths are n_i - 1. Odd length means n_i is even.
    # Partition sizes are (2, 3, 2, 2). Even n_i are in S1, S3, S4.
    # p = n1 + n3 + n4 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
    p = 6

    # q = size of the largest induced cycle containing at least one vertex from each S_i
    # The necessary edges can exist to form an induced 4-cycle. Larger cycles
    # are not possible while satisfying all conditions.
