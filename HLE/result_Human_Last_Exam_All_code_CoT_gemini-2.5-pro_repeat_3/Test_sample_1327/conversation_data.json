    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, analyze the given sequence to find a pattern. The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  Calculate the differences between consecutive terms (the first-order differences).\n3.  If the first-order differences don't show a simple pattern, we'll look for a more complex relationship. We will test a hypothesis relating the differences to the terms of the original sequence.\n4.  Let `a` be the sequence and `d` be the sequence of differences. We will check if a new sequence `c`, defined as `c[n] = d[n+1] - a[n+1]`, has a discernible pattern.\n5.  We will then analyze the sequence `c` by calculating its differences (the second-order differences of our complex pattern). Let's call this sequence `e`.\n6.  We will find that `e` is a simple geometric progression. We can then predict the next term in `e`.\n7.  Using the next term of `e`, we will work backward to calculate the next term of `c`, then the next term of `d`, and finally, the next term of the original sequence `a`, which is the number that should be in the parentheses.\n8.  The code will print out each step of this calculation, including the final equation to find the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the next number in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The original sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, a))}, ()\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the first differences\n    d = [a[i+1] - a[i] for i in range(len(a)-1)]\n    print(f\"1.
