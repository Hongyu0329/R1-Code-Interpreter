# The problem is to find the maximum number of points, n, on a circle that can be connected
# along with the center O using 9 straight lines, with a path of at most 2 lines between any two points.

# Step 1: Analyze the connectivity requirement.
# A path of at most 2 lines between any two points A and B implies that if A is on line L_i
# and B is on line L_j, L_i and L_j must intersect. This means that all lines used to
# place the points must be pairwise non-parallel.

# Step 2: Determine the maximum number of points a line can define on a circle.
# A single straight line can intersect a circle at most at two points.
points_per_line = 2

# Step 3: Set the total number of lines available.
num_lines = 9

# Step 4: Calculate the theoretical maximum for n.
# The maximum n is found by multiplying the number of lines by the maximum number of points
# each line can create on the circle. This assumes we can arrange the lines such that
# their intersection points with the circle are all unique.
max_n = num_lines * points_per_line

# Step 5: Verify the solution.
# A configuration that achieves this maximum is having all 9 lines pass through the center O.
# These 9 diameters are non-parallel, and they intersect the circle at 18 distinct points.
# The connectivity condition is met for this configuration.

print("The maximum value of n is determined by the number of lines and the number of points each line can create on the circle.")
print(f"To satisfy the connectivity condition, the {num_lines} lines must be configured to be pairwise non-parallel.")
print(f"Each line can intersect the circle at most {points_per_line} times.")
print("The optimal configuration places the lines such that all these intersection points are distinct.")
print("\nThe calculation for the maximum value of n is:")
# The final part of the user request is to output the equation with numbers.
print(f"{num_lines} * {points_per_line} = {max_n}")

# Return the final answer in the specified format
# print(f"\n<<<{max_n}>>>")
