# The problem asks to identify which translation practices can solve a challenge
# related to phonetic ambiguity in two specific mystery stories.
# The effective practices were determined to be I, II, and VI.

# The final answer needs to be presented as a series of Roman numerals
# in ascending order, separated by hyphens.

# Define the individual components (the "numbers" or numerals) of the answer.
numeral_one = "I"
numeral_two = "II"
numeral_six = "VI"

# Combine the components into the final formatted string.
final_answer = f"{numeral_one}-{numeral_two}-{numeral_six}"

# Print the final answer.
print(final_answer)
