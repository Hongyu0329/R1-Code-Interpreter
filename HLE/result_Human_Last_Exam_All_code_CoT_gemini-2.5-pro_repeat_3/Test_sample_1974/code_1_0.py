    # --- Introduction ---
    print("Analyzing the cardinality of a special set of Diophantine equations.")
    print("The problem combines concepts from number theory (Diophantine equations),")
    print("computability theory (MRDP theorem), and set theory (ZFC, forcing).\n")

    # --- Step 1: The Upper Bound ---
    print("### Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound for |S| ###")
    print("A Diophantine equation is defined by a polynomial with integer coefficients, like P(x₁, ..., xₙ) = 0.")
    print("Any such polynomial can be uniquely specified by a finite sequence of integers (its coefficients and information about variables).")
    print("The set of all finite sequences of integers is countably infinite.")
    print("Therefore, the set of all possible Diophantine equations is countably infinite.")
    print("The cardinality of a countably infinite set is Aleph-null (ℵ₀).")
    print("Since S is a subset of all Diophantine equations, its cardinality |S| must be less than or equal to ℵ₀.")
    print("Conclusion of Step 1: |S| ≤ ℵ₀.\n")

    # --- Step 2: The Lower Bound ---
    print("### Step 2: Establishing the Lower Bound for |S| ###")
    print("To find the lower bound, we must show that a scenario exists where S is countably infinite.")
    print("1. Link to Logic: The MRDP (Matiyasevich) theorem states that 'a Diophantine equation D has no solution' is equivalent to a specific type of logical statement, a Π₁⁰ sentence.")

    print("   - Let φₙ = Con(ZFC + φ₀ + ... + φₙ₋₁).")
    print("   Assuming ZFC is consistent, each φₙ is a true Π₁⁰ sentence, but it is unprovable in ZFC.")

    print("\n3. Defining the Statement ψ:")
    print("   Let's define ψ as the single statement: 'For all natural numbers n, the statement φₙ is true.'")
    print("   This statement ψ can be shown to be independent of ZFC. Therefore, it is consistent with ZFC, and we can have a model M[G] where it is true, fulfilling the problem's premise.")

    print("\n4. Proving in ZFC + ψ:")
    print("   If we add ψ as an axiom to ZFC, the theory ZFC + ψ can now prove every single φₙ.")
    print("   For any given k, ZFC + ψ proves φₖ because ψ asserts that all φₙ are true.")

    print("\n5. Conclusion of Step 2:")
    print("   We have found a countably infinite set of Π₁⁰ sentences {φ₀, φ₁, φ₂, ...}, each corresponding to a Diophantine equation Dₙ, that satisfies the conditions:")
    print("   - Dₙ has no solutions (because φₙ is true).")
    print("   - The unsolvability of Dₙ is unprovable in ZFC.")
    print("   - The unsolvability of Dₙ is provable in ZFC + ψ.")
    print("   This means the set S can be countably infinite. Thus, |S| ≥ ℵ₀.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---
    print("### Step 3: Final Conclusion ###")
    print("From Step 1, we found that |S| ≤ ℵ₀.")
    print("From Step 2, we found that |S| ≥ ℵ₀.")
