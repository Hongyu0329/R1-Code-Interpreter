# Step 1: Define the properties of the knot components based on established theorems in knot theory.

# The simplicial volume is additive over connected sums.
# V = ||S^3 \ C_{4,3}(Conway)|| + ||S^3 \ Wh_-^2(Eight)||

# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of the first component, K1 = C_{4,3}(Conway).
# For a cable knot C_{p,q}(C), ||S^3 \ C_{p,q}(C)|| = ||S^3 \ C||.
# The companion knot C is the Conway knot.
V_Conway_complement = 0  # The simplicial volume of the Conway knot complement is 0.
V1 = V_Conway_complement
print(f"The simplicial volume of the first component is V1 = ||S^3 \\ C_4,3(Conway)||.")
print(f"This is equal to the simplicial volume of the companion knot's complement, ||S^3 \\ Conway||.")
print(f"The simplicial volume of the Conway knot complement is known to be 0.")
print(f"So, V1 = {V1}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of the second component, K2 = Wh_-^2(Eight).
# For a Whitehead double Wh_t(C), ||S^3 \ Wh_t(C)|| = |t| * ||S^3 \ C||.
# The companion knot C is the figure-8 knot, and the number of twists t = -2.
V_Eight_complement = 2  # The simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement is 2.
t = -2
V2 = abs(t) * V_Eight_complement
print(f"The simplicial volume of the second component is V2 = ||S^3 \\ Wh_-^2(Eight)||.")
print(f"This is equal to |t| * ||S^3 \\ Eight||, where t is the number of twists.")
print(f"The number of twists t = {t}. The simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement is {V_Eight_complement}.")
print(f"So, the equation for V2 is: |{t}| * {V_Eight_complement}")
print(f"V2 = {abs(t)} * {V_Eight_complement} = {V2}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Calculate the total simplicial volume V.
V = V1 + V2
print(f"The total simplicial volume V is the sum of V1 and V2.")
print(f"V = V1 + V2 = {V1} + {V2} = {V}")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 5: Compute the final requested value.
factor = 10**6
result = math.floor(factor * V)

print(f"The final task is to compute floor({factor} * V).")
print(f"floor({factor} * {V}) = floor({factor * V}) = {result}")
