    This script calculates the third cumulant of the limiting distribution of Yn
    by applying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the probability density function (PDF) of the random variables Xi.
    2. Assume the standard form for the normalized sum from the CLT: Y_n = sqrt(n)*(mean(X_i) - mu).
    3. According to the CLT, Y_n converges to a Normal distribution N(0, sigma^2),
       where mu is the mean and sigma^2 is the variance of Xi.
    4. Calculate mu and sigma^2 for the given PDF to verify the conditions for the CLT.
    5. The third cumulant of any Normal distribution is 0. Therefore, the third
       cumulant of the converged variable is 0.
