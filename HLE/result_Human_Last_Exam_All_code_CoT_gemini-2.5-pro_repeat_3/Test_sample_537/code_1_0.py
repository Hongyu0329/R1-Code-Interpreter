    This function decodes the word 'anhaeketn' based on the observed pattern.
    
    The pattern is as follows:
    1. The word is split into two parts by taking letters at alternating positions.
    2. One of these parts is an anagram of an English word.
    3. The length of this unscrambled word is the decoded number.
    4. The final answer is the English spelling of that number.
