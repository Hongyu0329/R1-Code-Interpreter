    "Of course. The formula for the fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time representation is a cornerstone of many-body quantum field theory. It is expressed as a path integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will write a Python script to present the formula.\n2.  The script will first print the general form of the partition function `Z` as an integral of the exponential of an action `S`.\n3.  Next, it will print the detailed expression for the action `S` for a non-interacting fermion gas. To adhere to the instruction to output each component, the script will print the terms within the action one by one.\n4.  Finally, it will print the crucial anti-periodic boundary condition required for fermionic fields in this formalism.\n\nHere is the Python script to display the formula.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.
