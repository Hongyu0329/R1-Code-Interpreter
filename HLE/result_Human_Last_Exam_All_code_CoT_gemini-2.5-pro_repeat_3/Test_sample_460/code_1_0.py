# Define the parameters given in the problem
m = 4  # The total number of items
t = 20 # The threshold for the number of agents assigned to an item

# The problem is to find the smallest integer u such that for any choice of agents and
# their preferences, a "suitable" subset O of items exists.
# This is a classic problem in matching theory. The minimum value for u that guarantees
# the existence of a suitable (or stable) set is given by the formula:
# u = (m - 1) * t

# Calculate the smallest value of u
u = (m - 1) * t

# Print the reasoning and the final calculation as an equation
print("The smallest value for u is determined by the formula u = (m - 1) * t.")
print("Given m = 4 and t = 20, the calculation is:")
print(f"{u} = ({m} - 1) * {t}")
