    "To find the best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8, we can first explore how lower bounds are constructed and then consult the established mathematical literature for the current record.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A cap set is a collection of points in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ with no three points forming a line. The maximum size of such a set is denoted by $r_3(n)$. A \"lower bound\" for $r_3(n)$ is the size of any known cap set.\n2.  We can generate good lower bounds by using the \"product construction\". If we have a cap set of size $S_1$ in dimension $n_1$ and another of size $S_2$ in dimension $n_2$, we can construct a cap set of size $S_1 \\times S_2$ in dimension $n_1 + n_2$.\n3.  We will use the known exact values of $r_3(n)$ for smaller dimensions to construct lower bounds for dimension 8 ($n=8$).\n    *   $r_3(2) = 4$\n    *   $r_3(3) = 9$\n    *   $r_3(4) = 20$\n    *   $r_3(5) = 45$\n    *   $r_3(6) = 112$\n4.  The Python script below will calculate the sizes of cap sets in dimension 8 that can be formed by combining these smaller, known cap sets (e.g., using dimensions 2+6, 3+5, and 4+4).\n5.  This will give us a strong lower bound and help eliminate some of the incorrect options.\n6.  Finally, the script will state the best-known lower bound from mathematical research, which is the definitive answer to the question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates lower bounds for the cap set problem in dimension 8\n    using the product construction and known values for smaller dimensions.\n    Then, it states the best-known lower bound from mathematical literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Known maximum cap set sizes (r_3(n)) for small dimensions n.\n    r3_known = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112\n    }\n    \n    target_dim = 8\n    max_lb = 0\n    best_combo_str = \"\"\n\n    print(\"Investigating lower bounds for the cap set size in dimension 8 using the product construction.\\n\")\n    \n    # We check partitions of 8 into two parts, e.g., 8 = n1 + n2\n    # We only need to check up to n1 = 8 // 2\n    for n1 in range(2, target_dim // 2 + 1):\n        n2 = target_dim - n1\n        if n1 in r3_known and n2 in r3_known:\n            val1 = r3_known[n1]\n            val2 = r3_known[n2]\n            \n            # The product construction gives a lower bound of val1 * val2\n            current_lb = val1 * val2\n            \n            # We output each calculation as an equation\n            equation_str = f\"Using dimensions {n1} and {n2}: r_3({n1}) * r_3({n2}) = {val1} * {val2} = {current_lb}\"\n            print(equation_str)\n            \n            if current_lb > max_lb:\n                max_lb = current_lb\n                best_combo_str = equation_str\n\n    print(f\"\\nFrom these simple product constructions, the best lower bound found is {max_lb}.\")\n    print(\"This result helps eliminate answer choices A, B, D, and E.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nHowever, more complex constructions have produced even larger cap sets.\")\n    best_known_bound = 496\n    print(f\"The best-known lower bound for dimension 8 was found by Yves Edel and is {best_known_bound}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis corresponds to one of the given choices.\")\n\nsolve_cap_set_bound()\n<<<F>>>"
