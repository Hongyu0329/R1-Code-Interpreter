    "My plan is to find the smallest single network block that can encompass all the addresses from the given networks. This is also known as route summarization or supernetting.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  List all the networks that need to be summarized.\n2.  Find the full range of IP addresses covered by these networks. This means finding the very first IP address (the network address of the first network) and the very last IP address (the broadcast address of the last network).\n3.  Convert both the starting and ending IP addresses of this range into their 32-bit binary representations.\n4.  Compare the two binary numbers from left to right and find how many initial bits they have in common. This count of common bits becomes the subnet mask length (prefix) for our summary network.\n5.  To find the network address of the summary route, I will take the common bits from the previous step and append zeros for all the remaining bits to make a 32-bit address.\n6.  The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask determined by the common prefix length.\n7.  Finally, I will present the calculated summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask as the ACL entry.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single IP access control list entry that covers\n    a given list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
