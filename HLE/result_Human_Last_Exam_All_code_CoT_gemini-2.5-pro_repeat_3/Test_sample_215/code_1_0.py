# The user wants to determine the number of expected chemotypes from the provided R script.
# My plan is to analyze the script's logic and then use a simple Python script to state the conclusion.

# 1. Analyze the `generate_chemistry` function in the R script.
#    - A key line is `baseline = runif(n_peaks, 0, 1)`. This creates a SINGLE, fixed baseline vector for each run of the function.
#    - The `for` loop then subtracts this SAME baseline from every specimen within that run.

# 2. Analyze the 'controls' group.
#    - The script calls `generate_chemistry(360, 340, 'control')`.
#    - All 360 specimens are generated and then have the same baseline subtracted.
#    - This means they are all variations of a single underlying pattern.
#    - Therefore, the control group should have 1 chemotype.

# 3. Analyze the 'water_stress' group.
#    - The script calls `generate_chemistry(510, 340, 'water_stress')`.
#    - This is a new, separate call, so a new baseline is generated.
#    - This new baseline is subtracted from all 510 specimens in this group.
#    - Similar to the controls, all specimens in this group are variations of a single pattern.
#    - Therefore, the water-stressed group should also have 1 chemotype.

# 4. Conclusion: We expect 1 chemotype for controls and 1 for water_stress. This corresponds to answer B.

# Now, I will create the Python code block to present this finding.
# The code will explicitly state the numbers as requested.
