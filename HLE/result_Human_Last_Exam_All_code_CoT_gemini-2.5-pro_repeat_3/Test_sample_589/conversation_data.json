    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the film:\n\n1.  I will analyze the key visual and narrative elements from your query:\n    *   **Protagonist:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bicycle.\n    *   **Action:** Pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n    *   **Production:** A Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n2.  I will search my knowledge base of film plot summaries and iconic scenes for a match to these specific details.\n3.  The combination of these elements points to a pivotal, dramatic scene in a specific movie.\n4.  I will then write a simple Python script to print the name of the identified film.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the film based on a specific scene.\n# The scene involves a young protagonist riding a pink bike toward an oncoming car\n# in a moment of emotional distress. This occurs in the 2006 film produced by Lionsgate.\n\nmovie_title = \"Akeelah and the Bee\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<Akeelah and the Bee>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
