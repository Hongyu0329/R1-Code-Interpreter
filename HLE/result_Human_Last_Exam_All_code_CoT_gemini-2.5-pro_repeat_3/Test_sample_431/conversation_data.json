    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker of the human GABAAρ1 receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Protein and Sequence:** The protein in question is the human GABA-A receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1). I will retrieve its canonical amino acid sequence from the UniProt database, which is the authoritative source for protein sequence and functional information. The UniProt accession number for this protein is P24046.\n2.  **Define the TM3-TM4 Linker Domain:** I will consult the topological domain annotations within the UniProt entry for P24046. The TM3-TM4 linker is the large intracellular loop situated between the third (TM3) and fourth (TM4) transmembrane helices. According to UniProt, this domain spans residues 339 to 430.\n3.  **Write and Execute a Script:** I will write a Python script to perform the analysis. The script will:\n    a. Programmatically fetch the most up-to-date sequence for P24046 directly from the UniProt database.\n    b. Extract the subsequence corresponding to the TM3-TM4 linker (residues 339-430).\n    c. Count the number of Cysteine residues, represented by the single-letter code 'C', within the extracted linker sequence.\n    d. Print the linker sequence and the final count.\n\nThis method ensures accuracy by using live data from a primary scientific database.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport io\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker of the \n    human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor (UniProt P24046).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
