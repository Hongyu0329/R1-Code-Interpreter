# The reaction described is an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, which is an intramolecular
# rearrangement. This means the product is an isomer of the starting material, and
# no atoms are lost or gained during the reaction. Therefore, the molecular formula
# of the product is identical to that of the starting material.

# Molecular formula of the starting material:
# (1S,2R,4S)-2-((S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclopent-1-en-1-yl)-7,7-dimethoxybicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-ol
# C = 7 (bicycloheptene) + 5 (cyclopentenyl) + 2 (dimethoxy) + 6 (TBS group) = 20
# H = 12 (C-H on skeleton) + 1 (OH) + 6 (dimethoxy) + 15 (TBS group) = 34
# O = 1 (OH) + 2 (dimethoxy) + 1 (silyl ether) = 4
# Si = 1 (silyl ether) = 1
# Formula: C20 H34 O4 Si
