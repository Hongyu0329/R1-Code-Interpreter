# Final working code explanation:
# 1. input() reads the string.
# 2. findall(r'\d+', ...) finds all number strings.
# 3. The set comprehension {int(i) for i in ...} iterates through the found number strings,
#    converts each to an integer, and stores them in a set to ensure uniqueness.
# 4. sorted(...) takes the set of unique integers and returns a sorted list.
# 5. If the list from sorted() is empty (which is a "falsy" value), the 'or ["NO"]' part
#    makes the expression evaluate to ["NO"]. Otherwise, it's the list of numbers.
# 6. print(*...) unpacks the final list. If it's [50, 100, 150], it prints '50 100 150'.
#    If it's ["NO"], it prints 'NO'.

# The 32 characters to be placed at '@' are shown below.
# Note: The original snippet in the problem has typos in its closing parentheses.
# This solution assumes a corrected structure to be functional.
