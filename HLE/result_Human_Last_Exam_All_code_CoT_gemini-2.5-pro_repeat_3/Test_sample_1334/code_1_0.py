    # Part (a): If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, must N act semi-regularly?
    # A smooth covering implies that for g in {b, w, wb}, <g> intersect N = {1}.
    # The stabilizer of a vertex or face is a conjugate of <g>, let's say H = h<g>h^{-1}.
    # N acts semi-regularly if for any point, the stabilizer in N is trivial, i.e., N intersect H = {1}.
    # Let x be in N intersect H. Then x is in N, and x = hg^k h^{-1}.
    # Since N is normal, h^{-1}xh = g^k must be in N.
    # So g^k is in <g> intersect N, which is {1}. So g^k=1.
    # This implies x = h*1*h^{-1} = 1.
    # So N intersect H = {1}, and the action is semi-regular.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Is it necessary for G to be a perfect group if G is quasi-simple?
    # A group G is defined as quasi-simple if it is perfect (G=G') and G/Z(G) is simple.
    # The condition of being perfect is part of the definition of being quasi-simple.
    # Thus, it is necessary.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive on a regular dessin that is a smooth
    # covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # G is face-quasiprimitive => any minimal normal subgroup N is transitive on faces.
    # Smooth covering => the stabilizer of a face in N is trivial.
    # Transitive + trivial stabilizer => N acts regularly on the set of faces.
    # The O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive groups states that if a minimal normal subgroup N
    # is regular, the group is of type HA (Holomorph Affine, N abelian) or TW (Twisted Wreath, N non-abelian).
    # G/N is cyclic because D_N is unicellular and regular.
    # If G is of type HA, N is abelian. G/N cyclic => G' <= N. Minimal normality of N implies G'={1} or G'=N.
    # G'=N implies N is perfect, but N is abelian so N={1}, a contradiction.
    # G'={1} implies G is abelian. This leads to a contradiction with G = <b,w> and the smooth covering conditions.
    # Thus, HA is not possible.
    # This leaves only the TW type.
