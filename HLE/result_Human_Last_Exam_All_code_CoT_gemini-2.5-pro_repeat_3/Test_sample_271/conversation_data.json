    "To solve this problem, we need to find the degrees of all proper normal intermediate field extensions between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the splitting field $K$ of the given polynomial. The steps to solve this are as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Polynomial**: The first step is to analyze the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We will try to factor it over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, the subfields of the splitting field $K$ correspond to the subgroups of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Normal subfields correspond to normal subgroups. The degree of a subfield extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the index of the corresponding subgroup in $G$.\n    *   We will find the Galois group for each irreducible factor of the polynomial.\n    *   The Galois group of the original polynomial will be the direct product of the Galois groups of its factors, provided their splitting fields have a trivial intersection (only $\\mathbb{Q}$). We will verify this condition.\n3.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: Once we have the Galois group $G$, we need to find all its proper, non-trivial normal subgroups. A subgroup $H$ is proper and non-trivial if $H \\neq \\{e\\}$ (the identity subgroup) and $H \\neq G$.\n4.  **Calculate Degrees**: For each such normal subgroup $H$, the degree of the corresponding normal field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n5.  **List the Degrees**: Finally, we will collect all the unique degrees calculated in the previous step.\n\nI will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the necessary computations, such as factoring the polynomial, finding Galois groups, and identifying normal subgroups.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, factor, discriminant\nfrom sympy.polys.galoistools import galois_group\nfrom sympy.combinatorics import PermutationGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.group_constructs import DirectProduct\n\ndef solve_field_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q where Q < L < K,\n    with K being the splitting field of the given polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = symbols('x')\n    \n    # Step 1: Define and factor the polynomial\n    poly_expr = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n    p = Poly(poly_expr, x, domain='ZZ')\n    \n    factored_poly = factor(p)\n    \n    # The factors are (x**2 - 2) and (x**5 - 9*x + 3)\n    # We can extract them programmatically, but for clarity, we define them directly\n    f1 = Poly(x**2 - 2)\n    f2 = Poly(x**5 - 9*x + 3)\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) = {poly_expr} factors over Q into:\")\n    print(f\"f1(x) = {f1.expr}\")\n    print(f\"f2(x) = {f2.expr}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the Galois Group\n    # Find Galois groups for each factor\n    G1 = galois_group(f1)\n    G2 = galois_group(f2)\n    \n    print(f\"The Galois group of f1(x) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, with order {G1.order()}.\")\n    print(f\"The Galois group of f2(x) is the symmetric group S_5, with order {G2.order()}.\\n\")\n\n    # Check if the intersection of splitting fields is trivial\n    # The splitting field of f1 is Q(sqrt(2)).\n    # The unique quadratic subfield of the splitting field of f2 is Q(sqrt(D)),\n    # where D is the discriminant of f2.\n    d1 = discriminant(f1) # This is 8, so the field is Q(sqrt(2))\n    d2 = discriminant(f2)\n    \n    # Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(d2)) are different since d2 is not of the form 2*q^2.\n    # Therefore, the intersection of the splitting fields is Q.\n    # The Galois group of f(x) is the direct product G1 x G2.\n    G = DirectProduct(G1, G2)\n    print(f\"The Galois group G of f(x) is the direct product Z/2Z x S_5.\")\n    print(f\"The order of G is {G.order()}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups\n    normal_subgroups = G.normal_subgroups()\n    \n    proper_normal_subgroups = []\n    for H in normal_subgroups:\n        if not H.is_trivial and H.order() < G.order():\n            proper_normal_subgroups.append(H)\n            \n    # Step 4: Calculate the degrees of the corresponding normal subfields\n    possible_degrees = set()\n    for H in proper_normal_subgroups:\n        degree = G.order() / H.order()\n        possible_degrees.add(int(degree))\n        \n    # Step 5: List the degrees\n    sorted_degrees = sorted(list(possible_degrees))\n    \n    print(\"The possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q such that Q < L < K are the indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of G.\")\n    print(\"The calculated degrees are:\")\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the list of numbers.\n    for i, degree in enumerate(sorted_degrees):\n        if i < len(sorted_degrees) - 1:\n            print(degree, end=\", \")\n        else:\n            print(degree)\n\nsolve_field_degrees()\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>\n```"
