  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem. Answer m as the total memory in bytes used for variables of this problem. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\nFirst, I will provide a Python script that solves the problem of rearranging the sum. The script will read the input, extract the numbers, sort them, and then print the properly formatted new sum.\n\nNext, I will analyze the problem to design the most memory-efficient C program, as requested by the specific task. The most efficient approach avoids storing the entire input string. Instead, it processes the input character by character, using a small array to count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). After counting, it reconstructs and prints the sorted sum.\n\nFinally, I will calculate the total memory `m` in bytes used by the variables in this optimized C program and provide the answer in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input sum as a string\n    s = input()\n\n    # The numbers are separated by '+'. We can split the string by '+',\n    # which gives us a list of the numbers as strings.\n    summands = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since they are all single-digit numbers,\n    # lexical sorting is equivalent to numerical sorting.\n    summands.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted numbers back together with '+' and print the result.\n    # This outputs the final equation containing each sorted number.\n    print('+'.join(summands))\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nNow, for the task of writing the most memory-efficient C program and calculating its memory usage.\n\nAs outlined in the plan, the most memory-efficient C program would not store the entire input string. It would read the input one character at a time. It only needs a few variables to accomplish the task:\n\n1.  An array to count the occurrences of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can use `int counts[5];`.\n2.  A variable to store the character being read from the input, for which `getchar()` is suitable. `getchar()` returns an `int`, so we need `int c;`.\n3.  A loop counter for printing the result, `int i;`.\n4.  A flag to handle the printing of the '+' separator correctly, `int first;`.\n\nLet's calculate the memory usage (`m`) for these variables on a typical system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes:\n\n*   `int counts[5]`: `5 * sizeof(int)` = 5 * 4 = 20 bytes.\n*   `int c`: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int i`: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int first`: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 bytes.\n\n<<<32>>>"
