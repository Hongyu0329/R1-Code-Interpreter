# The problem asks for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom in a specific
# theory of massive gravity.
# The theory is linearized gravity with a mass term of the form -m^2/2 * h_uv h^uv.
# This corresponds to a well-studied class of theories with a general mass term
# -m^2/2 * (h_uv h^uv - c*h^2). Our case is c=0.
# For any case where c is not equal to 1 (the Fierz-Pauli case), the theory
# propagates 6 degrees of freedom: 5 for a massive spin-2 particle and 1 for a
# scalar particle (known as the Boulware-Deser ghost).

# According to established results in the field, the 5 spin-2 modes have a squared mass of m^2,
# as stated in the problem. The sixth mode, the scalar, has a different mass.
# For D=4 spacetime dimensions, the squared mass of the scalar mode is given by the formula:
# M_scalar^2 = m^2 * (D-2 - (D-3)*c) / ((D-1)*(1-c))

# In our case, D=4 and the coefficient c=0.
D = 4
c = 0

# We calculate the numerator and denominator of the factor multiplying m^2.
numerator = D - 2 - (D - 3) * c
denominator = (D - 1) * (1 - c)

# Print the final equation for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom.
