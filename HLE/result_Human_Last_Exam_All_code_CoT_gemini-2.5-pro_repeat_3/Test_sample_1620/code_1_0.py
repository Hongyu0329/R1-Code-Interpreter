# The ethical issue at hand is whether lawyer James was justified in breaking client confidentiality.
# The general rule is that all communications between a lawyer and client are confidential.
# However, there is a critical exception known as the "public safety" or "future harm" exception.

# This exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information if they have a reasonable belief
# that there is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to an identifiable person or group,
# and the disclosure is necessary to prevent the harm.

# Let's apply this to James's situation:
# 1. Reasonable Belief: Eric made a specific threat ("I bought a gun," "end things for both of us"). This belief is reasonable.
# 2. Imminent Threat: Eric stated his plan was for "tonight." This is an imminent threat.
# 3. Death or Serious Bodily Harm: A murder-suicide plan clearly meets this criterion.
# 4. Necessary Disclosure: Contacting the police and providing information to help them locate Eric and his ex-wife was a necessary step to prevent the tragedy.

# Based on this analysis, James's actions were in accordance with his professional obligations under the public safety exception.
# Answer choice E correctly summarizes this justification.

final_answer = 'E'

# Final Answer: Yes, because James reasonably believed that there was an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure was necessary to prevent the possible harm.
