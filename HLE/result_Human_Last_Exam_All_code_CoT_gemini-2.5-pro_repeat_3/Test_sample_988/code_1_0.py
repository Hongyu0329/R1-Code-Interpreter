    Explains the initial antioxidant response in Microcystis aeruginosa to heat stress.

    explanation = """
    High temperature exposure (29°C) induces oxidative stress in Microcystis aeruginosa by causing an overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The cell's primary and most immediate defense mechanism against a sudden surge in ROS is the enzymatic antioxidant system. This system includes key enzymes such as:

    1. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD): This enzyme is the first line of defense, converting the highly reactive superoxide radical (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).
    2. Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (APX): These enzymes then act to neutralize hydrogen peroxide, breaking it down into harmless water and oxygen.

    This enzymatic response is considered the initial activation because it is the fastest way for the cell to counteract the damaging effects of ROS. While other systems like non-enzymatic antioxidants (both hydrosoluble and liposoluble) and pigments also play a role, the enzymatic machinery is the first to be mobilized. Therefore, enzymatic antioxidants are the initial system activated.
