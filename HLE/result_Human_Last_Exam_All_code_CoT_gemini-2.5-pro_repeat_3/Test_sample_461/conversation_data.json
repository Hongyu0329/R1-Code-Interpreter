    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon you're looking for is named **Pterodactyladiene**. It's named after the pterodactyl, a flying reptile (pterosaur) that went extinct along with the dinosaurs about 66 million years ago. Its chemical structure resembles a pterodactyl in flight.\n\nHere is a Python script that calculates the molecular weight of Pterodactyladiene (C₃₀H₁₆).\n\n```python\n# Pterodactyladiene has the chemical formula C30H16.\n# This script calculates its molecular weight.\n\n# Define the atomic weights (in atomic mass units, u)\natomic_weight_C = 12.011\natomic_weight_H = 1.008\n\n# Define the number of atoms for each element in the molecule\nnum_C = 30\nnum_H = 16\n\n# Calculate the total mass from each element\ntotal_weight_C = num_C * atomic_weight_C\ntotal_weight_H = num_H * atomic_weight_H\n\n# Calculate the total molecular weight\nmolecular_weight = total_weight_C + total_weight_H\n\n# Print the name of the molecule\nprint(\"Molecule: Pterodactyladiene (C30H16)\")\nprint(\"Calculation of Molecular Weight:\")\n\n# Print the equation with all the numbers used\nprint(f\"({num_C} * {atomic_weight_C}) + ({num_H} * {atomic_weight_H}) = {molecular_weight:.3f} u\")\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
