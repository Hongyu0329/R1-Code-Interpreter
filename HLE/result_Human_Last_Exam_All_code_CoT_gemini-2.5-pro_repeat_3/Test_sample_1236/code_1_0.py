    This function calculates the number of solvability conditions for the given boundary-value problem.

    The problem is a countable system of differential equations:
    x'(t) = A(t)x(t) + f(t)
    x(2024) - x(2023) = alpha

    where A(t) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements a_i(t).
    The system can be decoupled and analyzed component by component.

    Case 1: For i = 1, 2, ..., 2024, a_i(t) = tanh(t).
    The homogeneous equation x_i' = tanh(t) * x_i has the general solution x_i(t) = C * cosh(t).
    The only bounded solution on the entire real line R is the trivial solution x_i(t) = 0 (when C=0).
    For the problem with f(t)=0, the boundary condition becomes 0 - 0 = alpha_i, which implies alpha_i = 0.
    This is one solvability condition for each of the first 2024 components.

    Case 2: For i > 2024, a_i(t) = -tanh(t).
    The homogeneous equation x_i' = -tanh(t) * x_i has the general solution x_i(t) = C / cosh(t).
    This solution is bounded for any constant C.
    For the problem with f(t)=0, the boundary condition is x_i(2024) - x_i(2023) = alpha_i.
    Substituting the general solution: C/cosh(2024) - C/cosh(2023) = alpha_i.
    This gives C * (1/cosh(2024) - 1/cosh(2023)) = alpha_i.
    Since cosh(2024) is not equal to cosh(2023), the coefficient of C is a non-zero constant.
    Therefore, for any given alpha_i, we can find a unique C.
    This means a solution exists for any alpha_i, so there are no solvability conditions for these components.
