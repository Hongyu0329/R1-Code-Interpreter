    "This is a question from the field of point-set topology. I will provide a Python script that explains the reasoning based on the properties of continua and then prints the final answer.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will clarify the mathematical terms used in the question: \"continuum\", \"indecomposable continuum\", and \"composant\".\n2.  Next, I will state the main theorem from topology that describes the possible number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n3.  Then, I will analyze the possibilities given by the theorem. I will show why the number cannot be one.\n4.  Finally, by comparing the remaining possibilities, I will deduce the smallest possible number and construct a Python script to print this explanation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_number_of_composants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning and provides the answer to the question about\n    the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    The reasoning is based on established theorems in topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understand the definitions.\")\n    print(\" - A continuum is a compact, connected topological space (in this context, also Hausdorff).\")\n    print(\" - An indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\" - A composant is a specific type of subset within a continuum.
