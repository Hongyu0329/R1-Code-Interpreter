    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Qe), and the price is the equilibrium price (Pe). After finding the equilibrium, we can calculate the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total welfare can be computed by integrating the difference between the demand curve and the supply curve from the minimum supply quantity to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Set up the equations:** Define the supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):** Solve the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` for the equilibrium quantity, Qe. Since this equation is complex, we will solve it numerically. Then, we'll substitute Qe back into either function to find the equilibrium price, Pe.\n3.  **Determine Integration Limits:** The demand curve is defined for all non-negative Q. The supply curve `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined when `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This will be the lower limit of our integration. The upper limit will be the equilibrium quantity, Qe.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** The total welfare is the area between the demand and supply curves. We will calculate this by evaluating the definite integral: `∫ [from 2^(1/3) to Qe] (Demand(Q) - Supply(Q)) dQ`. This integral will also be computed numerically.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the market equilibrium and total welfare for the given\n    supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Find the market equilibrium\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        \"\"\"\n        The equilibrium occurs where Demand Price = Supply Price.\n        This function returns the difference, which we'll solve for zero.\n        \"\"\"\n        return demand_price(Q) - supply_price(Q)\n\n    # We need an initial guess to find the root.
