# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem.
p = 43
n = 18  # Degree of extension K/Q_p
e = 3   # Ramification index

# Step 2: Calculate the residue field degree f.
f = n // e

# As explained in the plan, the problem of counting the equivalence classes on B(1,0) = O_K^x x O_K
# with the interpreted distance threshold reduces to counting the number of residue classes.
# The number of equivalence classes is given by the formula: N = |(O_K / p_K^k)^x| * |O_K / p_K^k|
# where k = e + 1 = 4.
# This formula evaluates to p^(7f) * (p^f - 1).

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of equivalence classes using the formula.
# N = p^(7*f) * (p^f - 1)
total_power_of_p = 7 * f
base_for_factor = p**f
factor = base_for_factor - 1

# Using Python's arbitrary-precision integers for calculation.
total_classes = (p**total_power_of_p) * factor

# Step 4: Print the result in the requested format.
# The final equation is N = 43^(7*6) * (43^6 - 1)
print(f"The number of equivalence classes is determined by the formula p^(7f) * (p^f - 1).")
print(f"With p = {p} and f = {f}, the equation is:")
print(f"{p}^({7*f}) * ({p}^{f} - 1) = {p}^{total_power_of_p} * ({base_for_factor} - 1)")
print(f"= {p**total_power_of_p} * {factor}")
print(f"= {total_classes}")

# Final Answer
final_answer = total_classes
