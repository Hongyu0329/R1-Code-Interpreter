    "This is a classic movie trivia question. The user is likely thinking of a pivotal and shocking scene from a well-known, Oscar-winning film, but has misremembered a key detail.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the film that most closely matches the user's description.\n2.  Describe the specific scene, pointing out the likely discrepancy in the user's memory (a different mode of transport).\n3.  Confirm that the film was indeed Oscar-nominated.\n\nThe film you are likely thinking of is **The Departed** (2006), which won the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nHowever, the scene does not take place on a bus, but in an **elevator**. This is a common point of misremembering due to the transit-like nature of the space.\n\nIn the scene, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just arrested Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). As the elevator doors open, Trooper Barrigan is waiting. Billy, believing he is safe and about to be assisted by a fellow officer, acknowledges him. This act of recognition seals his fate, as Barrigan immediately shoots and kills him. While he doesn't explicitly say \"Thank you,\" his glance of acknowledgement to someone he thinks is an ally serves the same narrative purpose described in your question.\n\n<<<The Departed>>>"
