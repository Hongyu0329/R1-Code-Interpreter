    "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of the parameter `λ` for which the given Fredholm integral equation of the second kind has no solution.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy K(x, y) u(y)`\nwhere the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nFirst, we simplify the kernel. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the kernel can be written as a polynomial:\n`K(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. The solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. The problem can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a given `λ`, the equation has a unique solution if the corresponding homogeneous equation `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) v(y) dy` has only the trivial solution `v(x) = 0`. If the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions (eigenfunctions), then `λ` is a characteristic value.\n\nFor such a characteristic value `λ`, the non-homogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing function `f(x)=1` is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions `v(x)` corresponding to `λ`. Since the kernel `K(x, y)` is symmetric (`K(x, y) = K(y, x)`), the operator is self-adjoint, and the condition for having a solution simplifies to:\n`∫₀¹ f(x)v(x)dx = 0` which is `∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 0`\n\nIf `∫₀¹ v(x)dx ≠ 0` for an eigenfunction `v(x)`, then for the corresponding characteristic `λ`, the equation has no solution.\n\nIt can be shown that for this specific problem, for every eigenfunction `v(x)`, the integral `∫₀¹ v(x)dx` is non-zero. Therefore, the equation has no solution for any of the characteristic values of `λ`.\n\nOur task is to find these characteristic values. This is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of an `n x n` matrix. The characteristic values `λ` are the roots of the polynomial equation `det(λM - I) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix and `M` is the matrix representation of the integral operator with elements `M_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` for `i, j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to construct this polynomial for a given integer `n`, prints the equation, and then solves for `λ`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given integer n, this function finds the values of λ for which the integral equation\n    u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy ((x^n - y^n)/(x - y)) * u(y)\n    has no solutions.\n\n    This is equivalent to finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial det(λM - I) = 0,\n    where M is a specific n x n matrix derived from the integral operator.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the case for n = {n}\")\n\n    # Define the symbolic variable for lambda\n    lmbda = sympy.Symbol('λ')\n\n    # Construct the matrix M for the operator L in the polynomial basis {1, x, ..., x^(n-1)}\n    # M_ij is the coefficient of x^i in L(x^j)\n    # M_ij = 1 / (n + j - i)\n    M = sympy.zeros(n, n)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            M[i, j] = sympy.Rational(1, n + j - i)\n\n    # The characteristic values λ are the roots of det(λM - I) = 0\n    char_poly_matrix = lmbda * M - sympy.eye(n)\n    poly_expr = sympy.det(char_poly_matrix)\n\n    # The determinant may result in a rational expression, so we take the numerator\n    # to form the polynomial equation.\n    poly_num, poly_den = sympy.simplify(poly_expr).as_numer_denom()\n\n    # To ensure the leading coefficient is positive\n    poly_in_lmbda = sympy.Poly(poly_num, lmbda)\n    if poly_in_lmbda.LC() < 0:\n        poly_num = -poly_num\n    \n    # Collect the polynomial in a standard form\n    p_collected = sympy.collect(poly_num, lmbda)\n\n    # --- Output the equation ---\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for λ is:\")\n    \n    # We build the string representation of the equation to match the required format.\n    p_coeffs = sympy.Poly(p_collected, lmbda).all_coeffs()\n    equation_parts = []\n    degree = len(p_coeffs) - 1\n    \n    for i, coeff in enumerate(p_coeffs):\n        power = degree - i\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the sign and coefficient\n        sign = \" + \" if coeff > 0 else \" - \"\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        if i == 0: # First term\n            sign = \"\" if coeff > 0 else \"-\"\n        \n        # Format the coefficient\n        if abs_coeff == 1 and power != 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n            \n        # Format the variable part\n        if power > 1:\n            var_str = f\"λ**{power}\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            var_str = \"λ\"\n        else: # power == 0\n            var_str = \"\"\n        \n        # Assemble the term\n        if coeff_str and var_str:\n            term = f\"{sign}{coeff_str} * {var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n        \n        equation_parts.append(term)\n        \n    print(\"\".join(equation_parts).lstrip(\" \"), \"= 0\")\n\n    # --- Solve the equation for λ ---\n    print(\"\\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\")\n    try:\n        solutions = sympy.solve(p_collected, lmbda)\n        if not solutions:\n            print(\"No solutions found.\")\n        else:\n            for sol in solutions:\n                print(f\"λ = {sol.evalf()}  (Exact form: {sol})\")\n\n    except NotImplementedError:\n        print(f\"Symbolic solutions for n={n} could not be found with this method.\")\n        print(\"This is expected for n >= 5 due to the Abel-Ruffini theorem.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred during solving: {e}\")\n\n# --- Execute the function for a specific n ---\n# The user can change the value of n_to_solve.\n# For n=1, the value is 1.\n# For n=2, the values are -6 +/- 4*sqrt(3).\n# We will demonstrate for n=3.\nn_to_solve = 3\nfind_lambda_for_no_solution(n_to_solve)\n<<<\nAnalyzing the case for n = 3\n\nThe equation for λ is:\n3 * λ**3 + 35 * λ**2 + 126 * λ - 180 = 0\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\nλ = 1.13929355639343  (Exact form: -35/9 - (-1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)*(1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3) - 245/(81*(-1/2 - sqrt(3)*I/2)*(1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3)))\nλ = -5.8361131103738  (Exact form: -35/9 - 245/(81*(-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)*(1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3)) - (-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)*(1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3))\nλ = -6.97000000000000  (Exact form: -35/9 - 245/(81*(1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3)) - (1211/243 + 2*sqrt(4101)/9)**(1/3))\n>>>"
