    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set like 6-311G** depends on the specific atom, as the number of core and valence electrons differs. I will explain the calculation for a representative heavy atom, Carbon (C), and for a Hydrogen (H) atom. Then, I will provide a Python script that calculates and prints the total number of primitives for a Carbon atom.\n\n### Understanding the 6-311G** Notation\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like 1s for Carbon) are described by a single basis function, which is a sum (contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals (like 2s and 2p for Carbon) are described by three basis functions each (a \"triple-split\" valence). The first is a contraction of **3** primitives, the second is a single **1** primitive, and the third is also a single **1** primitive.\n*   **\\*\\***: This part describes polarization functions, which allow for more flexible orbital shapes.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set includes **5** d-functions.\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms. A standard set includes **3** p-functions.\n\n### Calculation Walkthrough\n\n#### For a Carbon Atom (C):\nA Carbon atom is a \"heavy\" atom in the 2nd row of the periodic table.\n1.  **Core electrons (1s orbital):** Represented by `6` primitives.\n2.  **Valence electrons (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   **2s orbital:** Represented by `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n    *   **2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z):** Each of the three p-orbitals is represented by `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives. Total for 2p is `3 * 5 = 15` primitives.\n3.  **Polarization functions (first `*`):** A set of d-functions is added. This is **5** primitive d-functions. The second `*` does not apply to Carbon.\n4.  **Total for Carbon:** `6 (core) + 5 (2s) + 15 (2p) + 5 (d-pol) = 31` primitives.\n\n#### For a Hydrogen Atom (H):\n1.  **Core electrons:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n2.  **Valence electrons (1s orbital):** Represented by `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n3.  **Polarization functions (second `*`):** A set of p-functions is added. This is **3** primitive p-functions. The first `*` does not apply to Hydrogen.\n4.  **Total for Hydrogen:** `5 (1s) + 3 (p-pol) = 8` primitives.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the number of primitive Gaussians for a Carbon atom using the 6-311G** basis set and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the atom for calculation\natom = \"Carbon\"\n\n# Define the components of the 6-311G** basis set for a second-row heavy atom\n# Core shell (1s) is represented by a contraction of 6 primitives\ncore_primitives = 6\n\n# Valence shells (2s, 2p) are triple-split (311)\n# Each valence orbital is represented by 3+1+1 primitives\nvalence_primitives_per_orbital = 3 + 1 + 1\n\n# Carbon has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals in its valence shell\nnum_s_valence_orbitals = 1\nnum_p_valence_orbitals = 3\n\n# The first '*' in ** adds d-polarization functions to heavy atoms (5 functions)\nd_polarization_primitives = 5\n\n# The second '*' adds p-polarization functions to Hydrogen, so it's 0 for Carbon.\np_polarization_primitives = 0\n\n# Calculate the total for each component\ns_valence_total = num_s_valence_orbitals * valence_primitives_per_orbital\np_valence_total = num_p_valence_orbitals * valence_primitives_per_orbital\n\n# Calculate the final total number of primitive Gaussians\ntotal_primitives = core_primitives + s_valence_total + p_valence_total + d_polarization_primitives\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(f\"Calculation for a {atom} atom with the 6-311G** basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Core primitives (1s): {core_primitives}\")\nprint(f\"Valence s-primitives (2s): {s_valence_total}\")\nprint(f\"Valence p-primitives (2p): {p_valence_total}\")\nprint(f\"Polarization d-primitives (*): {d_polarization_primitives}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{core_primitives} + {s_valence_total} + {p_valence_total} + {d_polarization_primitives} = {total_primitives}\")\n\n```\n<<<31>>>"
