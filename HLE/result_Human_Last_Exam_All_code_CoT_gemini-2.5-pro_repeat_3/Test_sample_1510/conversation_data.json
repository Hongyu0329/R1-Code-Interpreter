    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we first need to know the point groups associated with each of the 17 wallpaper groups. The order of a point group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. We are looking for point groups with exactly two symmetry operations (the identity and one other). The point groups of order 2 are C2 (180-degree rotation) and D1 or Cm (reflection).\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a data structure, such as a dictionary, to store the 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point groups.\n2.  Iterate through this data structure to find the groups whose point group order is 2.\n3.  Store the names of these groups.\n4.  Print the names of the identified groups.\n5.  Print the final count as a sum to show how the total was calculated.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    In this case, it finds the groups with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        # Oblique lattice\n        'p1': 1,  # Point group C1\n        'p2': 2,  # Point group C2\n        # Rectangular lattice (primitive)\n        'pm': 2,  # Point group D1 (cm)\n        'pg': 2,  # Point group D1 (cm)\n        'p2mm': 4, # Point group D2 (c2v)\n        'p2mg': 4, # Point group D2 (c2v)\n        'p2gg': 4, # Point group D2 (c2v)\n        # Rectangular lattice (centered)\n        'cm': 2,  # Point group D1 (cm)\n        'c2mm': 4, # Point group D2 (c2v)\n        # Square lattice\n        'p4': 4,  # Point group C4\n        'p4m': 8,  # Point group D4 (c4v)\n        'p4g': 8,  # Point group D4 (c4v)\n        # Hexagonal lattice\n        'p3': 3,  # Point group C3\n        'p3m1': 6, # Point group D3 (c3v)\n        'p31m': 6, # Point group D3 (c3v)\n        'p6': 6,  # Point group C6\n        'p6m': 12, # Point group D6 (c6v)\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n    \n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group_name)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group in found_groups:\n        print(group)\n\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    # e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\"\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThere are a total of {count} such groups.\")\n    if count > 0:\n        print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
