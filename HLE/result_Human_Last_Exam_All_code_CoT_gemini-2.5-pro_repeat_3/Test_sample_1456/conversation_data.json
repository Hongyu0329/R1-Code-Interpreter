    "This is a problem in point-set topology. The solution does not involve a numerical calculation but rather relies on a key theorem about the properties of topological spaces.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the key terms: continuum, composant, and decomposability.\n2.  State the relationship between the decomposability of a continuum and its number of composants. A decomposable continuum has 1 composant, while an indecomposable one has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n3.  Introduce the specific problem: finding the maximum number of composants for a product space `X x Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n4.  Cite the crucial theorem: The product space `X x Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n5.  Combine these facts to find the two possible outcomes for the number of composants of `X x Y`: 1 or `c`.\n6.  The largest of these two is `c`.\n7.  The provided Python code will walk through this logical deduction and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the topological problem regarding the number of\n    composants in a product of two continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Introduction to Concepts ---\n    print(\"This program determines the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Background Concepts:\")\n    print(\"1.
