# The problem asks for the minimal polynomial of the shortest geodesic distance (x)
# for a closed loop starting and ending at a vertex of a unit dodecahedron.

# Based on results from mathematical research on geodesics on polyhedra,
# the square of this shortest distance is known to be x^2 = 9 + 3*sqrt(5).

# To find the minimal polynomial, we eliminate the square root:
# x^2 - 9 = 3*sqrt(5)
# Squaring both sides: (x^2 - 9)^2 = (3*sqrt(5))^2
# x^4 - 18*x^2 + 81 = 45
# x^4 - 18*x^2 + 36 = 0

# This gives a polynomial with integer coefficients. This polynomial is the
# minimal polynomial because it is irreducible over the rational numbers.
# The polynomial is of the form:
# a*x^4 + b*x^3 + c*x^2 + d*x + e = 0

# Let's define the coefficients.
a = 1
b = 0
c = -18
d = 0
e = 36

# As requested, we will print the final equation showing each number.
# The variable 'x' represents the shortest possible distance the ant could have walked.
