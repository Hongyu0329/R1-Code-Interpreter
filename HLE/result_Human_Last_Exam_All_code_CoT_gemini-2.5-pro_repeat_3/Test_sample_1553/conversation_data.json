    "I will find the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries. The main character is Adam Zamoyski. The character he has a profound relationship with and ultimately creates a new universe for, which can be considered a form of marriage in the context of the book, is Angelina.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this name.\n\n```python\n# The main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# The character he marries (or forms a cosmic union with, which is the book's equivalent) is Angelina.\n# This script will print her name.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
