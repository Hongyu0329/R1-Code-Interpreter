    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`, with the membership degree of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. This combination is done using a t-norm operation.\n\nThe most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. The formula is:\n\nRule Activation Level = t-norm(`Phi_k(x′)`, `μG_k_j(y_j)`) = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nWe will calculate `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the firing level and membership degree\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to calculate the rule activation level.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common choice.\n# The calculation is activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level using the minimum t-norm is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
