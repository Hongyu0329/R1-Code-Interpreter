    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the System**: The problem describes an elementary cellular automaton. This is a system where a row of cells (each 0 or 1) evolves over time. The state of a cell in the next step is determined by a fixed \"rule\" based on its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. There are 256 possible rules (Rule 0 to Rule 255). We will assume the ends of the row wrap around (cyclic boundaries).\n\n2.  **Brute-Force Strategy**: Since the rule is unknown, the most straightforward approach is to test every single one of the 256 possible rules.\n\n3.  **Two-Step Verification**: For each rule, we will perform a two-step simulation:\n    a.  **Step 1**: Apply the rule to the given top row (`01101001`) to generate a potential middle row.\n    b.  **Step 2**: Apply the same rule to this new middle row to generate a test bottom row.\n\n4.  **Find the Match**: We will compare our test bottom row with the given bottom row (`10000111`). If they are identical, the rule is valid, and the corresponding middle row is a potential solution.\n\n5.  **Identify the Unique Solution**: The problem states there is \"only valid solution for the intermediate step\". We will collect all valid middle rows found. If there is indeed only one unique solution among them, that is our answer. The code will then print this unique intermediate row.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique intermediate step in a 3-generation elementary cellular automaton sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row = '01101001'\n    target_bottom_row = '10000111'\n    \n    def apply_rule(rule_binary, input_row):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given ECA rule to an input row with cyclic boundaries.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(input_row)\n        next_row = []\n        \n        # A mapping from the neighborhood (e.g., '111') to the rule's output bit.\n        # The rule_binary string corresponds to outputs for neighborhoods \n        # '111', '110', '101', '100', '011', '010', '001', '000' in that order.\n        rule_map = {f'{i:03b}': rule_binary[7 - i] for i in range(8)}\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors with cyclic boundary conditions\n            left = input_row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = input_row[i]\n            right = input_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            neighborhood = left + center + right\n            next_row.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n            \n        return \"\".join(next_row)\n\n    valid_solutions = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # Format the rule number as an 8-bit binary string\n        rule_binary = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        \n        # 1.
