# The user wants to find the second critical exponent for the following reverse square function estimate in R^3:
# ||f||_{L^p(R^3)} <= C * R^alpha * ||(sum_{theta}|f_{theta}|^2)^(1/2)||_{L^p(R^3)}
#
# We are given that the optimal exponent, alpha, is a piecewise linear function of 1/p for p > 2.
# The points where the slope changes are called critical exponents. One such exponent is p = 4.

# From the theory of harmonic analysis on the cone, the sharp exponent alpha(p) is known.
# It is determined by the maximum of several linear functions of x = 1/p. Each function
# arises from analyzing a specific geometric configuration that can serve as an approximate extremizer.

# The equation for the sharp exponent alpha for p > 2 is:
# alpha(p) = max(0, 1/p - 1/4, 1/2 - 3/p)

# To satisfy the user's request, let's print the numbers in this equation.

# The critical exponents are the values of p where the slope of alpha (as a function of 1/p) changes.
# This occurs when the function determining the maximum switches. We find these points by setting
# the terms inside the max() equal to each other. Let x = 1/p.
#
# 1. 0 = x - 1/4  => x = 1/4. This corresponds to p = 4.
#    This is the given critical exponent.
#
# 2. 0 = 1/2 - 3x => 3x = 1/2 => x = 1/6. This corresponds to p = 6.
#    This is a candidate for the other critical exponent.
#
# 3. x - 1/4 = 1/2 - 3x => 4x = 3/4 => x = 3/16. This corresponds to p = 16/3.
#    However, at x = 3/16, both sides are -1/16, which is less than the first term, 0.
#    So, the maximum is 0, and the slope does not change here.

# The analysis shows that the slope of alpha(1/p) changes at p = 4 and p = 6.
# Given that one critical exponent is 4, the other must be 6.
