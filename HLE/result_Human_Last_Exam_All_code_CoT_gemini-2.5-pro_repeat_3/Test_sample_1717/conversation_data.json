    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this is 3,640.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, we need the formula Terraria uses to scale boss health for multiple players in Expert Mode. The health is increased by 35% for each additional player beyond the first one. This can be expressed in the formula: `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))`, where `n` is the number of players.\n3.  **Analyze the Formula for Infinite Players:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health with an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to analyze the formula as `n` approaches infinity.\n4.  **Simplify the Equation:** We can simplify the health formula:\n    *   `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35n - 0.35)`\n    *   `Total Health = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35n)`\n    *   `Total Health = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35)n`\n    *   `Total Health = 2366 + 1274n`\n5.  **Determine the Limit:** The resulting equation, `Total Health = 2366 + 1274n`, is a linear function. As the number of players (`n`) increases, the health increases without any upper bound. Therefore, as `n` approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\n6.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this entire explanation, showing the formula, the numbers involved, the simplification, and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the\n    Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the constants from the game's source code for Expert Mode\n    base_expert_health = 3640\n    player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the base values for the health calculation.\")\n    print(f\"The base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode (1 player) is: {base_expert_health}\")\n    print(f\"The health scaling factor per additional player is: {player_scaling_factor} (or {player_scaling_factor * 100}%)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: State the health scaling formula.\")\n    print(\"The formula for total health based on the number of players (n) is:\")\n    # The final code outputs each number in the final equation, as requested.\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_expert_health} * (1 + {player_scaling_factor} * (n - 1))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Simplify the formula to analyze its behavior.\")\n    print(\"Let's expand the equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_expert_health} * (1 + {player_scaling_factor}n - {player_scaling_factor})\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_expert_health} * ({(1 - player_scaling_factor):.2f} + {player_scaling_factor}n)\")\n    \n    # Perform the final multiplications\n    constant_term = base_expert_health * (1 - player_scaling_factor)\n    n_coefficient = base_expert_health * player_scaling_factor\n    \n    print(\"Total Health = \" + str(base_expert_health) + \" * \" + f\"{(1 - player_scaling_factor):.2f}\" + \" + \" + str(base_expert_health) + \" * \" + str(player_scaling_factor) + \"n\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {constant_term:.0f} + {n_coefficient:.0f}n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Draw the final conclusion.\")\n    print(\"The health of the Eye of Cthulhu is a linear function of 'n', the number of players.\")\n    print(\"As 'n' approaches infinity, the total health also increases without any upper bound.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<Infinity>>>"
