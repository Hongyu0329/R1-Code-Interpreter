    # Step 1: Define the family of sets C_n
    # Each C_n is a union of two closed intervals. For n=1, it's {-1, 1}. For n=2, it's [-1, -0.5] U [0.5, 1], and so on.

    explanation_closed = "1. Each set C_n is closed in the standard Euclidean topology. Since the given topology is finer than the Euclidean one (it has more open sets), any Euclidean-closed set is also closed in this topology."

    # Step 3: Calculate the intersection of the entire family
    # A point x is in the intersection if for all n, |x| >= 1/n.
    # No point x in [-1, 1] satisfies this property. If x is not 0, we can always find an n large enough such that 1/n < |x|, meaning x is not in C_n. The point 0 is in no C_n.
    # Thus, the intersection is the empty set.
