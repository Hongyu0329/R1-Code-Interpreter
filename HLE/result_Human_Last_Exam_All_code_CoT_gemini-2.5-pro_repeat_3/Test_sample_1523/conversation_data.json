    "In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field theory at finite temperature, the action is defined over a Euclidean spacetime where the time dimension `τ` is compactified with period `β = 1/T`.\n\nMy plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first define the standard Euclidean action `S_E` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`.\n2.  By focusing on the free (quadratic) part of the action and applying integration by parts, I will rewrite the action in the form `½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`.\n3.  This form allows for the identification of the operator `D`, which is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n4.  The inner product `(f, g)` is defined as an integral over the Euclidean spacetime.\n5.  Finally, I will construct the expression for `(ϕ, Dϕ)`, which is twice the free part of the Euclidean action.\n6.  The Python code will use the `sympy` library to symbolically represent this physical expression and print the final equation.\n\nThe Euclidean action `S_E` is given by:\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d³x [ ½(∂_μϕ)² + ½m²ϕ² + V(ϕ) ]`\nwhere `(∂_μϕ)² = (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`.\n\nBy performing an integration by parts on the kinetic term (and assuming vanishing boundary terms), the free part of the action (`V(ϕ)=0`) can be written as:\n`S_free[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dτ d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_μ² + m²) ϕ(x)`\nwhere `∂_μ² = ∂_τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n\nComparing this to the general quadratic form `S_free[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`, where the inner product is `(f, g) = ∫ dτ d³x f(x)g(x)`, we can identify the operator `D` as `D = -∂_μ² + m²`.\n\nTherefore, the inner product you're asking for, `(ϕ, Dϕ)`, is:\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_μ² + m²) ϕ(x)`\n\nThe following Python code defines the components of this equation symbolically and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically computes and displays the inner product (phi, D*phi)\n    in finite-temperature scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols and functions\n    m = sympy.Symbol('m')\n    tau = sympy.Symbol('τ')\n    x1, x2, x3 = sympy.symbols('x1 x2 x3')\n    phi = sympy.Function('ϕ')(tau, x1, x2, x3)\n\n    # Define the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator acting on phi\n    # Note: ∂_μ² = ∂_τ² + ∇²\n    d2_dtau2 = sympy.Derivative(phi, tau, 2)\n    d2_dx1_2 = sympy.Derivative(phi, x1, 2)\n    d2_dx2_2 = sympy.Derivative(phi, x2, 2)\n    d2_dx3_2 = sympy.Derivative(phi, x3, 2)\n    box_E_phi = d2_dtau2 + d2_dx1_2 + d2_dx2_2 + d2_dx3_2\n\n    # Define the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator D acting on phi\n    # D = -∂_μ² + m²\n    D_phi = -box_E_phi + m**2 * phi\n\n    # The inner product (ϕ, Dϕ) is the integral of ϕ * (Dϕ) over spacetime.\n    # We will print the full expression symbolically.\n    \n    # Using unicode characters for a clearer mathematical representation\n    integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    partial_symbol = \"∂\"\n    \n    # Constructing the string for the final equation\n    # The term (-∂_μ² + m²)ϕ\n    operator_term = f\"(-{partial_symbol}_τ² - ∇² + m²)ϕ\"\n    \n    # The full inner product equation\n    final_equation = f\"(ϕ, Dϕ) = {integral_symbol} dτ d³x  [ ϕ * ({operator_term}) ]\"\n    \n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the operator D in the quadratic action S = ½(ϕ, Dϕ) is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\")\n    print(\"The inner product (ϕ, Dϕ) is therefore given by the following expression:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # As requested by the prompt, we also output each component of the equation\n    # from the symbolic calculation.\n    # The term inside the brackets is the integrand ϕ * Dϕ\n    integrand = phi * D_phi\n    print(\"\\nSymbolic representation of the integrand ϕ * (-∂_μ² + m²)ϕ:\")\n    sympy.pprint(integrand, use_unicode=True)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_inner_product_expression()\n\n```\n<<<(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d³x ϕ(x) (-∂_μ² + m²) ϕ(x)>>>"
