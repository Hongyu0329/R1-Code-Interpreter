    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shape of the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron and then count the number of triangles on its surface.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Outer Hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its outer hull (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. Since the 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are arranged in the same way as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the Faces of the Outer Hull:** The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed entirely of equilateral triangles.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Faces:** We can find the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron using Euler's polyhedral formula, which states that for any convex polyhedron, `V - E + F = 2`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (`V = 12`).\n    *   It has 30 edges (`E = 30`).\n4.  **Solve for F:** We will plug the known values of V and E into the formula and solve for F. The result will be the number of triangles on the surface of the outer hull.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We can find the number of its faces (F) using Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2\n# where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n\n# For a regular icosahedron:\n# Number of vertices (V)\nV = 12\n# Number of edges (E)\nE = 30\n\n# Using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2, we can solve for F:\n# F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"To find the number of triangular faces, we use Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron has {V} vertices and {E} edges.\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging these values into the formula:\")\n# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"{V} - {E} + F = 2\")\nprint(f\"F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"F = {F}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull is {F}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
