    This function calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains 
    in the divisor poset of N = 823564528378596.

    The solution is based on the interpretation that the problem considers the poset
    of divisors of N. A k-antichain is a set containing no chain of length k+1.
    We first find the length of the longest chain in the divisor poset of N.
    If this length is less than 21, then any subset of divisors is a 20-antichain,
    and the largest such set is the set of all divisors of N. Its size is tau(N).
