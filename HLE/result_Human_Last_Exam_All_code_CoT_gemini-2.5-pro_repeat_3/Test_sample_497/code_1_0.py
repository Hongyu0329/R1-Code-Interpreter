    # The input capacitance (C_in) of a cell terminated by a load (C_L) is:
    # C_in = 1 / (1/c + 1/(2*c + C_L))
    # The characteristic capacitance C_h is found when C_in = C_L = C_h.

    # In the half-circuit model, the floating terminating capacitor 'x' becomes
    # a shunt capacitance of '2*x' to ground.

    # terminated by its characteristic capacitance. So, 2*x = C_h.
