    This function solves for |α|² based on the properties of the quantum circuit.
    The problem reduces to solving a quadratic equation for x = |α|².
    The equation is derived from two conditions:
    1. |α|² + |β|² = 1 (Normalization)
    2. |β|² = (|α|²)² (Property 1 of the circuit applied to state |ψ⟩)
    Substituting (2) into (1) gives: |α|² + (|α|²)² = 1
    Letting x = |α|², we get the equation: x² + x - 1 = 0.
