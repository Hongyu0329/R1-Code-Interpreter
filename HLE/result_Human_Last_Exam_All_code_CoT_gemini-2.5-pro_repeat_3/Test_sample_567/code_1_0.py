# The problem asks for the value of 'a' where the only obstruction for
# the symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a ball becomes
# the volume constraint. This occurs when the embedding capacity c(a) equals sqrt(a).
# Based on the work of McDuff and Schlenk, this transition happens at a = phi^4,
# where phi is the golden ratio.

# The golden ratio, phi
# phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2

# We need to calculate a = phi^4 = ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^4.
# This expression can be simplified algebraically to:
# a = (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2

# Let's compute this value.
sqrt_5 = math.sqrt(5)
a_value = ((1 + sqrt_5) / 2)**4

print("The value 'a' is given by the fourth power of the golden ratio, phi.")

print("This simplifies to the exact form: a = (7 + 3*sqrt(5))/2\n")
