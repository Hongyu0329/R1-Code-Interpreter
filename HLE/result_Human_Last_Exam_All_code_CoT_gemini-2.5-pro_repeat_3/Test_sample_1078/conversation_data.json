    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to systematically count all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Building Blocks:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. A group is either *irreducible* (its Dynkin diagram is connected) or *reducible* (it's a direct product of irreducible groups, and its diagram is a disjoint union of connected diagrams). The rank of a group is the total number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n2.  **Identify Irreducible Weyl Groups:** First, we list all non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Rank 1: $A_1$\n    *   Rank 2: $A_2, B_2, G_2$ (note: $W(C_2) \\cong W(B_2)$)\n    *   Rank 3: $A_3, B_3$ (note: $W(C_3) \\cong W(B_3)$ and $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$)\n    *   Rank 4: $A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$ (note: $W(C_4) \\cong W(B_4)$)\n3.  **Consider Partitions of Rank 4:** A Weyl group of rank 4 can be formed by combining irreducible components whose ranks sum to 4. We need to consider all integer partitions of 4:\n    *   `4`: A single irreducible component of rank 4.\n    *   `3 + 1`: One component of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   `2 + 2`: Two components of rank 2.\n    *   `2 + 1 + 1`: One component of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`: Four components of rank 1.\n4.  **Count Combinations for Each Partition:** We will count the number of non-isomorphic ways to form a group for each partition using our list of irreducible groups.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n\nThis process will be implemented in the Python script below, which calculates the number for each case and then sums them to find the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    The calculation is based on the classification of finite root systems and their\n    corresponding Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group is the sum of the ranks\n    of its irreducible components.
