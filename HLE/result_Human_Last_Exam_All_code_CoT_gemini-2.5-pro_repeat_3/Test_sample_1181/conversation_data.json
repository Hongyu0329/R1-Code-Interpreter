    "My plan is to identify the main character of the 1972 film *Solaris* and recall a key scene related to their nostalgia for Earth. The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is sent from Earth to a space station and experiences profound homesickness. I will write a Python script that outlines this context and identifies the specific quote where he expresses shame over forgetting the sound of rustling leaves, thereby determining the correct answer from the given choices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' (1972)\n    who misses the sound of rustling leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the film and characters\n    movie_title = \"Solaris (1972)\"\n    protagonist = \"Kris Kelvin\"\n    \n    # The key piece of dialogue/character motivation\n    character_reflection = (\n        \"In the film, the protagonist, psychologist Kris Kelvin, is sent to a space station. \"\n        \"Overwhelmed and isolated, he becomes deeply nostalgic for Earth.
