    print("\n[Step 1] Understanding the Definitions")
    print(" - omega (ω): The set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...}, which is the first infinite cardinal number.")
    print(" - omega_1 (ω₁): The first uncountable cardinal number.")
    print(" - 2^omega (2^ω): The cardinality of the power set of ω. This is the number of all subsets of natural numbers.")
    print(" - Almost Disjoint Family (ADF): A collection of infinite subsets of ω where the intersection of any two distinct sets is finite.")
    print(" - Maximal Almost Disjoint Family (MADF): An ADF that cannot be extended; no infinite subset of ω can be added to it while maintaining the almost disjoint property.")
    print(" - X: The set of all possible cardinal numbers that can be the size of a MADF.")
    print(" - The problem assumes the Continuum Hypothesis (CH): 2^ω = ω₁.")

    print("\n[Step 2] Finding Bounds for the Cardinality of a MADF")
    print("Let κ be the cardinality of an arbitrary MADF.")
    
    print("\n  (a) Lower Bound:")
    print("A MADF must be uncountable. To prove this, we show that any countable ADF, A = {A₀, A₁, A₂, ...}, is not maximal.")
    print("We can construct an infinite set B ⊂ ω that is almost disjoint from every Aₙ in A.")
    print("Construction: We build B = {b₀, b₁, b₂, ...} by picking bₖ for k=0, 1, 2, ... inductively.")
    print("Let bₖ be an integer greater than bₖ₋₁ that is not in the union A₀ ∪ A₁ ∪ ... ∪ Aₖ.")
    print("Such a bₖ always exists because the finite union of infinite sets cannot cover all of ω.")
    print("For any specific set Aₙ, the intersection B ∩ Aₙ can only contain elements from {b₀, b₁, ..., bₙ₋₁}, because all subsequent elements of B were chosen to be outside Aₙ.")
    print("Therefore, B ∩ Aₙ is finite. Since B can be added to A, A is not maximal.")
    print("This implies that any MADF must be uncountable, so κ ≥ ω₁.")

    print("\n  (b) Upper Bound:")
    print("A MADF is a collection of subsets of ω. The total number of subsets of ω is |P(ω)| = 2^ω.")
    print("Therefore, the size of any MADF cannot exceed this number. So, κ ≤ 2^ω.")

    print("\n[Step 3] Applying the Continuum Hypothesis")
    print("From Step 2, we have the inequality: ω₁ ≤ κ ≤ 2^ω.")
    print("The problem assumes the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which states that 2^ω = ω₁.")
    print("Substituting CH into our inequality, we get: ω₁ ≤ κ ≤ ω₁.")

    print("\n[Step 4] Determining the Set X")
    print("The inequality ω₁ ≤ κ ≤ ω₁ forces κ to be exactly ω₁.")
    print("This means that under the Continuum Hypothesis, every MADF must have cardinality ω₁.")
    print("Thus, the set X of all possible cardinalities of MADFs is a singleton set: X = {ω₁}.")

    print("\n[Step 5] Finding the Order Type of X")
    print("The set X has only one element. In the order topology, a singleton set is a simple ordered set.")
    print("The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal number it is order-isomorphic to.")
    print("A set with one element is order-isomorphic to the ordinal 1 (which is the set {0}).")
