    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is one that provides complete protection to a fraction of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the rest. Let's analyze how the standard vaccine efficacy formula, `1 - IRR`, behaves with this type of vaccine.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Model:** We'll define the parameters of our model. Let `VE_true` be the fraction of vaccinated people who are fully protected. This is the true efficacy. The remaining fraction, `1 - VE_true`, is still fully susceptible.\n2.  **Define Incidence Rates:** Let `λ` (lambda) be the force of infection, or the incidence rate among susceptible individuals.\n    *   The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`) is simply `λ`, as everyone is susceptible.\n    *   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is more complex. Cases can only occur in the non-protected fraction (`1 - VE_true`). So, the overall rate in the vaccinated group is `λ * (1 - VE_true)`.\n3.  **Calculate Estimated VE:** We will calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`) and then use it to find the estimated Vaccine Efficacy (`VE_est = 1 - IRR`).\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the `VE_est` with the `VE_true` to determine if the formula overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the efficacy. The python code below will demonstrate this with a numerical example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1 - IRR correctly estimates the efficacy of an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the model parameters with a numerical example.\n    # Let's assume the true vaccine efficacy (VE_true) is 85%, meaning it provides\n    # complete protection to 85% of vaccinated individuals.\n    ve_true = 0.85\n\n    # Let lambda be the force of infection (incidence rate in a fully susceptible population).\n    # We can use an arbitrary value, as it will cancel out.
