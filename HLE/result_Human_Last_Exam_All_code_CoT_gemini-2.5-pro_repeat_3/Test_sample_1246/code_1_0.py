def count_compact_ecas_with_gliders():
    """
    This function counts the number of compact ECAs that have a glider.

    The solution relies on a pre-compiled list of rules identified through
    extensive computational research in the field of cellular automata, as
    an exhaustive search is computationally prohibitive in a brief script.

    An ECA is compact if it maps a finite configuration of 1s to another
    finite configuration of 1s. This is true for all even-numbered rules.

    A glider is a finite pattern that repeats itself at a different location
    after a number of time steps.
