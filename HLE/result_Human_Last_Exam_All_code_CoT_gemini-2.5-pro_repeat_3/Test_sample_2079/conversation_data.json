    "This is a historical question. I will find the name of the judge and then use a Python script to present the answer, as requested by the instructions.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the name of the judge of Bártfa (modern-day Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n2.  **Research the answer:** Historical records and academic sources, such as lists of town officials from that period, indicate that the judge (in Slovak: *richtár*) of Bardejov in 1461 was a man named Gregor. He is sometimes also identified by his profession as Gregor Tischler (or Tyschler), which means \"carpenter\" or \"joiner\".\n3.  **Formulate Python code:** I will create a simple Python script that stores this information in variables and then prints it in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name_old = \"Bártfa\"\n    city_name_modern = \"Bardejov\"\n    year = 1461\n    judge_name = \"Gregor\"\n    judge_alternative_name = \"Gregor Tischler\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of {city_name_old} (now {city_name_modern}) in the year {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n    print(f\"He is also sometimes recorded as {judge_alternative_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Gregor>>>"
