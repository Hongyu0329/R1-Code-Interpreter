    # --- Interpretation 1: Uniform selection from representable values ---

    # The number of representable floating-point values in [0, 1] is N = B * 2^m + 1.
    # This includes zero, subnormals, and normals.
    
    # For our example:
    # N = (2^(11-1) - 1) * 2^52 + 1 = 1023 * 2^52 + 1
    # N_val = bias * (2**m_bits) + 1

    # The minimum number of bits required to uniquely select one value from N is ceil(log2(N)).
    # Let's calculate this value.
    # N = (2^(e-1) - 1) * 2^m + 1 = 2^(m+e-1) - 2^m + 1
    # Since 2^(m+e-2) < N < 2^(m+e-1), ceil(log2(N)) = m + e - 1.

    # Let's verify with our example:
    # ideal_bits = m_bits + e_bits - 1  # 52 + 11 - 1 = 62
    
    # N_val = (2**(e_bits-1) - 1) * (2**m_bits) + 1
    # calculated_bits = math.ceil(math.log2(N_val))

    # print(f"Number of representable values in [0, 1] is N = B * 2^m + 1")
    # print(f"Theoretically required bits = ceil(log2(N)) = {calculated_bits}")
    # print(f"The formula m + e - 1 gives: {ideal_bits}")
    # print("The theoretical minimum bits is m + e - 1.")
    
    # --- Interpretation 2: Bits required for direct generation ---
    # The result m + e - 1 is not an option. The closest option is m + e.
    # This answer can be justified by considering a simple generation algorithm:
    # 1. Fix the sign bit to 0 (since the number is non-negative).
    # 2. Generate 'e' random bits for the exponent field E.
    # 3. Generate 'm' random bits for the mantissa field M.
    # This procedure requires a total of 'e + m' random bits.
    # While this method doesn't result in a truly uniform distribution of values in [0, 1]
    # without a rejection step, it represents the number of bits in the non-sign part
    # of the floating point representation. Given the available choices, this is the
    # most plausible interpretation.
