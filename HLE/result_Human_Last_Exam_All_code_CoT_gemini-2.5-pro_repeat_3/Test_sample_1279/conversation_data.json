    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** First, I will identify the relevant Feynman diagrams. In $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction vertex connects four lines. For a second-order process ($\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda^2)$), we need two such vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram has no external lines, so all lines must be internal (propagators). I will determine the distinct connected topologies for connecting the 8 half-lines from the two vertices. This results in two diagrams: the \"setting-sun\" diagram and the \"figure-eight\" diagram.\n\n2.  **Method for Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry factor, $S$, for a diagram is a crucial element that corrects for overcounting identical topological structures during Wick expansion. I will calculate it using a robust combinatorial formula:\n    $S = \\frac{V! \\times (v!)^V}{N_{\\text{wick}}}$\n    where:\n    *   $V$ is the number of vertices in the diagram (here, $V=2$).\n    *   $v$ is the number of lines at each vertex (here, $v=4$ for $\\phi^4$ theory).\n    *   $N_{\\text{wick}}$ is the number of distinct ways to form the specific diagram using Wick contractions from the initial set of fields.\n\n3.  **Calculate for Each Diagram:**\n    *   For the \"setting-sun\" diagram, I will calculate $N_{\\text{wick}}$ by counting the ways to connect the four legs of the first vertex to the four legs of the second.\n    *   For the \"figure-eight\" diagram, I will calculate $N_{\\text{wick}}$ by counting the ways to form two internal loops (one at each vertex) and two connecting lines.\n\n4.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, I will sum the individual symmetry factors of the two diagrams to get the total requested value. The code will print out each step of the calculation, including the numbers used in the final sum equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr(n, r):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the binomial coefficient 'n choose r'.\"\"\"\n    f = math.factorial\n    return f(n) // (f(r) * f(n - r))\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubbles in phi^4 theory.\")\nprint(\"The theory has a L_int = -lambda/4! * phi^4 interaction.\")\nprint(\"Second-order diagrams contain V=2 vertices, each with v=4 legs.\")\nprint(\"The symmetry factor S is calculated as S = (V! * (v!)^V) / N_wick, where N_wick is the number of Wick contractions for the diagram.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# --- Diagram 1: Setting-Sun Diagram ---\nprint(\"Diagram 1: The 'Setting-Sun' Diagram\")\nprint(\"This diagram consists of two vertices connected directly by four propagators.\")\nprint(\"Let's calculate its Wick contraction count (N_A):\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to the number of ways to pair the 4 legs of vertex 1 with the 4 legs of vertex 2.\")\n\n# N_A is 4!\nN_A = math.factorial(4)\nprint(f\"The number of ways is 4! = {N_A}.\")\n\n# Calculate S_A\nV = 2\nv = 4\nS_A = (math.factorial(V) * math.factorial(v)**V) / N_A\nprint(f\"The symmetry factor S_A = (2! * (4!)^2) / {N_A} = (2 * {math.factorial(v)}^2) / {N_A} = {int(S_A)}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# --- Diagram 2: Figure-Eight Diagram ---\nprint(\"Diagram 2: The 'Figure-Eight' Diagram\")\nprint(\"This diagram consists of two vertices, each with one loop, connected by two propagators.\")\nprint(\"Let's calculate its Wick contraction count (N_B):\")\n\n# Step 1: Choose legs for loop at vertex 1\nways_v1_loop = nCr(4, 2)\nprint(f\"1.
