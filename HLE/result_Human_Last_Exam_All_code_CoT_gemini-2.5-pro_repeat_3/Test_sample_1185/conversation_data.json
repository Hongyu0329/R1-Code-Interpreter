    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to enumerate the possible combinatorial structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected curve with only nodal singularities, where any rational (genus 0) component has at least three special points (nodes).\n\nThe classification can be broken down by the genera of the irreducible components and the structure of their connections (the dual graph). A stable curve's arithmetic genus is given by the formula: `g = h^1(G) + Î£ g_i`, where `G` is the dual graph, `h^1(G)` is its first Betti number (number of loops), and `g_i` are the geometric genera of the components. For a genus 2 curve, we need `g=2`.\n\nThe enumeration of all possible stable graphs satisfying the stability condition (`2g_i - 2 + n_i > 0`, where `n_i` is the number of nodes on component `i`) yields the following distinct types:\n\n1.  **The smooth curve itself:** The curve is already stable. This is the generic case.\n2.  **Irreducible, singular:**\n    *   One rational (genus 0) component with two nodes.\n3.  **Reducible, containing elliptic components:**\n    *   Two elliptic (genus 1) components meeting at a single node.\n    *   One elliptic component with one node (i.e., it is attached to itself).\n    *   One elliptic component and one rational component, where the rational component has a node and is also attached to the elliptic curve.\n4.  **Reducible, with only rational components:**\n    *   Two rational components meeting at three nodes.\n\nThese are all the possible configurations. I will now write a Python script to print out this classification and the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and counts the number of different types of stable\n    reduction for curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2 are classified by the combinatorial structure of the resulting stable curve.\")\n    print(\"There are 6 distinct types in total:\\n\")\n\n    types_description = [\n        \"1.
