    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the additional symmetries imposed by the Kähler condition on top of the usual Riemannian symmetries.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Start with the basics**: Recall the definition of a Kähler manifold and its dimension. A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold, so its real dimension, let's call it `n`, must be even. We can write `n = 2m`, where `m` is the complex dimension.\n2.  **Introduce complex coordinates**: The symmetries are most easily analyzed in complex coordinates. In these coordinates, the Riemann tensor components that are non-zero are of the form $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$, where indices $\\alpha, \\gamma$ are holomorphic and $\\bar{\\beta}, \\bar{\\delta}$ are anti-holomorphic.\n3.  **List the symmetries**: The Kähler conditions and Bianchi identities impose the following symmetries on these non-zero components:\n    *   $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma \\bar{\\beta} \\alpha \\bar{\\delta}}$ (Symmetry in the two holomorphic indices)\n    *   $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\delta} \\gamma \\bar{\\beta}}$ (Symmetry in the two anti-holomorphic indices)\n    *   $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma \\bar{\\delta} \\alpha \\bar{\\beta}}$ (Pair-swapping symmetry)\n    *   $\\overline{R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}} = R_{\\beta \\bar{\\alpha} \\delta \\bar{\\gamma}}$ (Reality condition)\n4.  **Count the components**: These symmetries imply that the Riemann tensor is equivalent to a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric $m \\times m$ matrices.\n    *   The space of symmetric tensors on an m-dimensional complex vector space has a dimension of $N = \\binom{m+1}{2} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n    *   A Hermitian form on an N-dimensional complex vector space is determined by $N^2$ independent real numbers.\n5.  **State the formula**: Therefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is $N^2 = \\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.\n6.  **Provide Python Code**: Write a Python script that takes the real dimension `n` as input, calculates the complex dimension `m`, and then uses the formula to compute the number of independent components, printing out each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation. It will prompt you to enter the real dimension of the manifold.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given real dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        n_str = input(\"Enter the real dimension of the Kähler manifold (n): \")\n        n = int(n_str)\n\n        if n < 2 or n % 2 != 0:\n            print(\"Error: The real dimension 'n' of a Kähler manifold must be a positive even integer.\")\n            return\n\n        # Calculate complex dimension m\n        m = n // 2\n\n        # The number of ways to choose 2 indices from m with replacement\n        num_symmetric_pairs = (m * (m + 1)) // 2\n\n        # The number of independent components is the square of the above\n        result = num_symmetric_pairs ** 2\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor a Kähler manifold of real dimension n = {n}:\")\n        print(f\"The complex dimension is m = n / 2 = {n} / 2 = {m}.\")\n        print(\"The number of independent components is given by the formula: (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\")\n        print(\"This represents the real dimension of the space of Hermitian forms on the space of symmetric m x m matrices.\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n        print(f\"1.
