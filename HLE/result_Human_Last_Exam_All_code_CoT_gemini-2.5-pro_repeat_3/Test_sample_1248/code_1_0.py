    Solves the three-part question about Hopf algebra actions.

    # Part (a)
    # The term "symmetric" is not defined, and the given conditions are too weak
    # to imply a general property for all j >= 2 and all r in R.
    # For example, if q=-1, the condition on x^2 * 1_R is trivial,
    # yet the structure of x^j * r can be complex and shows no obvious symmetry.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    # We calculate x^2 * a * 1_R for q = -1.
    # The formula is: sum_{k=0 to 2} C_k * w^(2-k) * (g^k*a*1_R) * w^k
    # w = x * 1_R
    # C_k = (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * binom(2,k)_{q^-1}

    # k=0: C_0 = 1. Term: w^2 * (a * 1_R)
    # k=1: binom(2,1)_{-1} = 0. Term: 0
    # k=2: C_2 = (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-1) * binom(2,2)_{-1} = -1. Term: -(g^2 * a * 1_R) * w^2

    # Part (c)
    # We calculate x^3 * a * 1_R for w in Z(R).
    # This suggests q=-1 is carried over from part (b), otherwise the result depends on q.
    # With w in Z(R), the formula simplifies to:
    # w^3 * sum_{k=0 to 3} C_k * (g^k * a * 1_R)
    # C_k = (-1)^k * (-1)^(-k(k-1)/2) * binom(3,k)_{-1}

    # k=1: C_1 = -1
    # k=2: C_2 = -1
    # k=3: C_3 = 1
