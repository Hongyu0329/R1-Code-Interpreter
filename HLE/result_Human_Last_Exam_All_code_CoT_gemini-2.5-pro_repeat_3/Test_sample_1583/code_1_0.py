# Based on research:
# X is the building number of the former exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly st. in Minsk.
# The BelExpo hall was located at Yanki Kupaly, 27.
x = 27

# Y is the number of the historic tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
# Tram route #1 is one of the oldest in Minsk and ran along this street.
y = 1

# Calculate X to the power of Y
result = x ** y

# Print the equation and the final answer
print(f"{x} ^ {y} = {result}")
