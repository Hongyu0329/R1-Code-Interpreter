    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required to color its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** For any graph with $n$ vertices, we can always color it using $n$ distinct colors (one for each vertex). Therefore, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices: $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n3.  **Identify the Case for Maximum Chromatic Number:** The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$). In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so we need a unique color for each one.\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices. So, for our graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, we must have $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n5.  **Prove the Upper Bound is Achievable:** To show that 12344 is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to construct a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete but requires 12344 colors.\n    *   Consider a graph $G$ constructed by taking a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and adding one more vertex that is completely disconnected from all other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   The $K_{12344}$ subgraph requires 12344 distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these 12344 colors. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed for the entire graph $G$ is 12344.\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have established that any non-complete graph on 12345 vertices can be colored with at most 12344 colors, and we have found an example that requires exactly 12344 colors. Thus, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\n# Number of vertices in the graph\nnum_vertices = 12345\n\n# For any graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\n# chi(G) = n if and only if G is a complete graph.\n# The problem states that the graph is NOT a complete graph.\n# Therefore, the chromatic number must be less than n.\n# The maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n# We can construct such a graph, for example, by taking a complete graph on n-1 vertices\n# and adding one isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete,\n# and its chromatic number is n-1.\n\nmax_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n# Output the equation and the result\nprint(f\"The maximum number of colors needed is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
