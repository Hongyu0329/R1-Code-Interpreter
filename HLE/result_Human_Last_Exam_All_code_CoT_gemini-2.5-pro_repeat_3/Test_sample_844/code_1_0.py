In many biological systems (substrate induction), a lower concentration of a substrate leads to decreased production/activity of the enzyme that breaks it down. This is a logical conclusion."

While high glucose can sometimes inhibit other sugar-metabolizing enzymes (catabolite repression), this is a more complex mechanism that is not mentioned or implied in the text. Attributing the effect to glucose instead of the more direct cause (lack of raffinose) makes this statement the least accurate and most likely to be untrue.",
