# The problem asks to compute the value of inf_{f in S} f(pi).
# Our derivation shows this infimum is given by the expression:
# pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1))
# where k_0=1.

# As requested, we will first output the values of the numbers
# in this final expression.
p = math.pi
p_plus_1 = p + 1
log_p_plus_1 = math.log(p_plus_1)

# The final equation for the infimum is I = p / (p_plus_1 * log_p_plus_1)

print(f"pi: {p}")
print(f"pi + 1: {p_plus_1}")

# Now, we compute the final result.
