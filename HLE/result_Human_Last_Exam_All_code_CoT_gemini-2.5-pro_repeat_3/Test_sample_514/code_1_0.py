    This function explains the reasoning and prints the number of components.
    
    The space in question is constructed in a way that makes it highly disconnected.
    1. A path in the space must have a constant x-coordinate because the Cantor set K is totally disconnected.
    2. A path must also have a constant y-coordinate because the vertical fibers (subsets of D or its complement) are also totally disconnected.
    3. Therefore, the only paths are trivial (constant) paths, and the path components of the initial space X are its individual points.
    4. When we identify the set S = Q x {1} to a single point p*, we check if any new paths are formed.
    5. No path can be formed from any point outside of S to a point in S, so p* cannot be connected to any other point.
    6. The path components of the new space Y are p* and every other point.
    
    To find the number of components, we count these points:
    - One component is p*.
    - The other components correspond to the points in X \ S.
    
    The size of X \ S is the sum of the sizes of two disjoint sets:
    - A = Q x (D \ {1})
    - B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D)
    
    Let aleph_0 be the cardinality of countable sets and c be the cardinality of the continuum.
    - |Q| = aleph_0
    - |D| = aleph_0, so |D \ {1}| = aleph_0
    - |K| = c
    - |K \ Q| = c
    - |[0,1] \ D| = c
    
    Cardinality of A = aleph_0 * aleph_0 = aleph_0 (countably infinite).
    Cardinality of B = c * c = c (uncountably infinite).
    
    Total number of components = 1 (for p*) + |A| + |B|
