    "The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This number corresponds to the dimension of the n-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y). This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** The number of distinct Lie polynomials of degree `n` with `k` generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    `l_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Define the parameters:**\n    *   The order is `n = 10`.\n    *   The number of generators is `k = 2` (since the BCH formula involves two non-commuting variables, X and Y).\n\n3.  **Calculate the components for Witt's formula:**\n    *   Find all positive divisors `d` of `n=10`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n\n4.  **Sum the terms:** Add all the calculated terms together.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Multiply the sum by `1/n` to get the final result.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that automates these steps. The script will define helper functions for finding divisors and calculating the Möbius function. The main part of the script will then apply Witt's formula and print out each step of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    For example, prime_factors(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function μ(n).\n    μ(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    μ(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    μ(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Möbius function is defined only for positive integers.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = prime_factors(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # n has a squared prime factor\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors) # n is square-free\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    # Explain the method\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for k generators\")\n    print(\"is given by Witt's formula, which counts the dimensions of the graded components of a free Lie algebra.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nWitt's formula is:\")\n    print(f\"  l_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ (over d|n) [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]\")\n    print(f\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  n = order = {n}\")\n    print(f\"  k = number of generators = {k}\")\n    print(f\"  d = divisors of n\")\n    print(f\"  μ = the Möbius function\")\n\n    # Step 1: Get divisors\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The divisors of n = {n} are: {divisors}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate each term in the summation\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the terms μ(d) * k^(n/d) for each divisor d.\")\n    sum_terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_val = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * term_val\n        total_sum += term\n        sum_terms.append(term)\n        print(f\"  For d={d:2d}: term = μ({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d}) = {mu_d:2d} * {k}^{power} = {mu_d:2d} * {term_val:4d} = {term:5d}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Complete the calculation\n    result = total_sum // n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the full formula with the calculated sum.\")\n    print(f\"  l_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * (Sum of terms)\")\n    \n    # Build the string for the sum to show each number in the final equation\n    sum_string = \" + \".join(map(str, sum_terms)).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    print(f\"  l_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ({sum_string})\")\n    print(f\"  l_{k}({n}) = (1/{10}) * ({total_sum})\")\n    print(f\"  l_{k}({n}) = {result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\n# Execute the solution\nsolve_bch_problem()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
