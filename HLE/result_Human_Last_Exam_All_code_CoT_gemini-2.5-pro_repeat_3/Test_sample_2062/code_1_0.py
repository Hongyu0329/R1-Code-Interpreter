    Solves the three-part question about the similarity of diagonal matrices.

    # --- Part (a) Analysis ---
    # Two matrices A and B are similar if B = PAP^-1 for some invertible P.
    # A key property of similar matrices is that they have the same characteristic
    # polynomial, det(λI - A) = det(λI - B).
    # For a diagonal matrix D = diag(d1, ..., dn), the characteristic polynomial is
    # (λ - d1)(λ - d2)...(λ - dn). The roots are the eigenvalues d1, ..., dn.
    # Therefore, two diagonal matrices are similar if and only if their characteristic
    # polynomials are the same, which means their multisets of eigenvalues are identical.
    # This is exactly what "the multiplicities of each eigenvalue are identical" means.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # --- Part (b) Calculation ---
    # A similarity class is determined by the multiset of eigenvalues. The question asks
    # for the number of similarity classes for a 3x3 matrix whose eigenvalues are chosen
    # from a set of 3 distinct values {α, β, γ}.
    # This is a combinations with repetition problem: choosing k items from n types.
    # Here, k=3 (matrix size) and n=3 (number of distinct eigenvalues).
    # The formula is C(n + k - 1, k).
    n = 3  # number of distinct eigenvalues to choose from
    k = 3  # number of eigenvalues to choose (size of multiset)

    print(f"The result is: {num_classes}")

    # --- Part (c) Analysis ---
    # The number of similarity classes for diagonal matrices in M_n(F_q) is the number of
    # multisets of size n that can be formed from the q elements of the field F_q.
    # Using the same formula, this is C(n + q - 1, n).
    # As a function of n for a fixed q, C(n + q - 1, n) = [(n+q-1)...(n+1)] / (q-1)!
    # is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
    # Polynomial growth is slower than exponential growth.
