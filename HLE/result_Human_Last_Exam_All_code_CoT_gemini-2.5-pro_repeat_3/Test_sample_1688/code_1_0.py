def analyze_crypto_scenario():
    """
    Analyzes a cryptographic scenario based on Kerckhoffs's Principle.

    The principle states a system should be secure even if everything *except the key* is public.
    The question asks for a system to be secure even if the *key is also known*.
    This fundamentally violates the basis of modern cryptography.

    Let's analyze the options:
    A, D, E (Quantum Methods): These focus on secure key generation or distribution. They don't help if the key is already compromised.
    B (Fast Key Rotation): This limits the *time window* of a compromise, but doesn't secure data encrypted with a known key.
    C (Perfect Forward Secrecy): This protects *past* data from a future key compromise, not *current* data from a current key compromise.

    Conclusion: If an adversary has the key, they can decrypt the data. No system described in options A-E can prevent this.
    Security is theoretically impossible under the conditions described in the question.
    """
    conclusion = """
The core premise of the question describes a scenario where the fundamental requirement for security—a secret key—is violated.
If an adversary has complete knowledge of the protocol, system architecture, AND the encryption keys, then by definition, they can decrypt any communication.
The options provided describe methods for key protection, key distribution, or damage mitigation, but none can provide security once the key itself is known.
Therefore, maintaining security is theoretically impossible in this scenario.
