    # The core equation derived from the problem description is:
    # 2 * sum_{i=1 to l} ((1-a_i)(1-b_i)) = l-1
    # Minimal l is 3. For l=3, the equation is:
    # sum_{i=1 to 3} ((1-a_i)(1-b_i)) = 1

    # We need to find three pairs (a_i, b_i) where a_i, b_i are non-negative
    # integers not equal to 1, that satisfy the equation and result in the
    # lexicographically smallest tuple (a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3).

    # The pairs that give the smallest integers a_i, b_i and their corresponding
    # X_i = (1-a_i)(1-b_i) values are:
    # (0,0) -> X=1
    # (0,2) -> X=-1
    # (2,0) -> X=-1
    # (2,2) -> X=1
    
    # To get a sum of 1 from three X_i values, using the smallest possible
    # integers for a_i and b_i, we choose the set of X values {1, 1, -1}.
    # This corresponds to the set of pairs {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)}.

    # minimal, we order these pairs.
