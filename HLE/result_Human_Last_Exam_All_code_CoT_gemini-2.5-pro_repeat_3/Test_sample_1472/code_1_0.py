    print("Molecule: bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper")
    print("  - Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print("  - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3). This is a bidentate ligand, coordinating through its two sulfur atoms.")
    print("  - Stoichiometry: 'bis' indicates two ligands. The complex is [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)2].")
    print("  - Coordination Number: 2 ligands * 2 donor atoms/ligand = 4.")

    print("Step 2: Determine the coordination geometry")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("A 4-coordinate complex can be either tetrahedral or square planar.")
    print("  - If Copper is in the +1 oxidation state (Cu(I), a d10 ion), the geometry is almost always tetrahedral.")
    print("  - If Copper is in the +2 oxidation state (Cu(II), a d9 ion), the geometry can be distorted tetrahedral or square planar.")
    print("Since the oxidation state is not given, we consider the most likely structures. For soft sulfur donors, a tetrahedral Cu(I) complex is very common and stable.")

    print("Step 3: Identify symmetry elements for the tetrahedral [Cu(ligand)2] complex")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The molecule consists of a central Cu atom with two identical, non-planar chelate ligands wrapped around it.")
    print("Let's look for symmetry elements:")
    print("  - Identity (E): Always present in every molecule.")
    print("  - Proper Rotation Axis (Cn):")
    print("    - A C2 axis passes through the copper atom and bisects the angle between the two ligands, effectively swapping the two ligands upon a 180-degree rotation. This element is present.")
    print("  - Mirror Plane (Ïƒ):")
    print("    - The ligand itself is not planar. The six-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S) is puckered (like a chair or twist-boat conformation). This puckering, along with the attached methyl groups, prevents the existence of any mirror planes.")
    print("  - Center of Inversion (i):")
    print("    - There is no center of inversion.")
    print("  - Improper Rotation Axis (Sn):")
    print("    - The lack of mirror planes means that an Sn axis (which involves a reflection) is also absent.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Assign the point group")
    print("--------------------------------")
    print("The only symmetry elements present in the molecule are the identity element (E) and a single two-fold rotation axis (C2).")
    print("A molecule with only these two symmetry elements belongs to the C2 point group.")
    print("Note: Even if the geometry were square planar, the puckered nature of the ligands would also result in a C2 point group.")
