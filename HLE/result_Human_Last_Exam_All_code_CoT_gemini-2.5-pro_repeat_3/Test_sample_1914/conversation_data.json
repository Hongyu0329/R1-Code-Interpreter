    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Identity Morphisms**: A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must contain two identity morphisms, `id_A` and `id_B`. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms.\n\n2.  **Distribute the Remaining Morphisms**: We have 2 remaining non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. Let the number of non-identity morphisms in these sets be `n_AA'`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n_BB'`. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to `n_AA' + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB' = 2`.\n\n3.  **Account for Isomorphism**: An isomorphism between categories can swap the objects `A` and `B`. This means a distribution of morphisms `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` is equivalent to `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)`, where `n_AA = n_AA' + 1` and `n_BB = n_BB' + 1`. We will group the distributions that are equivalent under this swapping.\n\n4.  **Define and Count Composition Laws**: For each unique distribution of morphisms, we must define the composition laws. These laws must be associative and respect the identity morphisms. We will count the number of valid, non-isomorphic ways to define these compositions.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each unique case.\n\nThe following Python code systematically performs this case analysis, explains the reasoning for each case, and calculates the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    The problem is broken down into cases based on the distribution of the 2 non-identity\n    morphisms into the 4 Hom-sets.
