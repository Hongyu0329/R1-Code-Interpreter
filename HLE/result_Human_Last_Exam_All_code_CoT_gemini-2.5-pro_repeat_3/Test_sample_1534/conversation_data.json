    "This is a biological question rather than a computational one. My plan is to provide the answer based on established cephalopod neuroanatomy, presented within a Python script as requested. The script will store the names of the relevant brain regions and neural structures in a list and then print them in a clear format. The palliovisceral lobe is the most posterior part of the subesophageal mass in the cuttlefish brain. The structures directly adjacent and extending posteriorly are other lobes and the major nerves that originate from the palliovisceral lobe itself.\n\n```python\ndef get_posterior_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions and major neural structures\n    that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    The information is based on established knowledge of cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The palliovisceral lobe is the most posterior major lobe of the subesophageal mass.\n    # The structures adjacent to it and extending posteriorly include another lobe and the major nerves that arise from it.\n    posterior_structures = {\n        \"Adjacent Lobe\": \"Posterior Pedal Lobe\",\n        \"Posterior Nerves\": [\n            \"Pallial Nerves\",\n            \"Visceral Nerves\"\n        ]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Brain regions and major neural structures adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish include:\")\n    print(f\"- {posterior_structures['Adjacent Lobe']} (which lies adjacent)\")\n    print(\"- The large nerves that originate from the lobe and extend posteriorly:\")\n    for nerve in posterior_structures['Posterior Nerves']:\n        print(f\"  - {nerve}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nget_posterior_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions and major neural structures lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior pedal lobe, and the pallial and visceral nerves.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
