    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large x**: The provided third-order ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. For large $x$, the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ likely tends to zero. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is a rapidly oscillating function with an average value of $0.5$.\n\n2.  **Examine the initial conditions**: The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 3$, and $y''(0) = 2$. At $x=0$, the term $(y')^4 = 3^4 = 81$ is the largest term on the right-hand side of the equation. This suggests that the solution will grow very rapidly, driven by the $(y')^4$ term.\n\n3.  **Approximate the ODE**: Because the $(y')^4$ term dominates, the ODE can be approximated by $y''' \\approx (y')^4$, especially as $y'$ grows. This simplified ODE is known to have solutions that reach a singularity at a finite time, $x_0$. Therefore, the \"large $x$ regime\" in this problem refers to $x$ approaching this singularity time $x_0$.\n\n4.  **Find the asymptotic form**: By performing an asymptotic analysis on $y''' = (y')^4$, we can determine the functional form of $y(x)$ as $x \\to x_0$. This analysis reveals the solution behaves as:\n    $y(x) \\approx A - B(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$\n    where the constant $B$ can be determined analytically to be $B = \\sqrt[3]{30}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the constants numerically**: The constants $A$ (which is the value of $y$ at the singularity, $y(x_0)$) and the singularity time $x_0$ depend on the full ODE and its initial conditions. These values must be found by numerically integrating the ODE from the initial point $x=0$ until the singularity is reached. The numerical solver will effectively stop at $x_0$.\n\n6.  **Construct the final expression**: I will provide a Python script that implements this plan. The script will:\n    *   Define the system of first-order ODEs. For numerical stability, the oscillating $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ term will be replaced by its average value, $0.5$.\n    *   Use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to solve the system. The solver will automatically stop near the singularity.\n    *   Extract the values of $A$ and $x_0$ from the numerical solution.\n    *   Calculate $B = \\sqrt[3]{30}$.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the analytical expression with the constants $A$, $B$, and $x_0$ rounded to two decimal places, as requested. It will also explicitly print each number used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve_and_find_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ODE numerically to find the constants for the asymptotic expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ODE is approximated by replacing the oscillating tan term with its average value 0.5.\n    # This simplifies numerical integration and is justified because the (y')^4 term\n    # dominates near the singularity.\n    def ode_system(x, Y):\n        y, yp, ypp = Y  # y, y', y''\n        \n        # Denominator for the y'' term, ensuring it's not zero at x=0\n        den = 3*x**2 + 2\n        \n        # The ODE: y''' = y^4 + (y')^4 - y''/(3x^2+2) + 0.5\n        yppp = y**4 + yp**4 - ypp/den + 0.5\n        return [yp, ypp, yppp]\n\n    # Initial conditions\n    y0 = [0.00, 3.00, 2.00]\n\n    # Time span for integration.
