# Step 1: Define the constants for the calculation.
# Gas constant in J/(mol*K)
R = 8.314
# Temperature in Kelvin (assuming 100 degrees Celsius for "thermal condition")
T_C = 100
T_K = T_C + 273.15
# The difference in activation energy (G_B - G_A) in J/mol.
# This is estimated from the steric strain difference between a Methyl-Hydrogen interaction
# and a Hydrogen-Hydrogen interaction, which is approximately 1.7 kcal/mol.
delta_G_kcal_per_mol = 1.7
# Conversion factor from kcal to Joules
kcal_to_J = 4184
delta_G_J_per_mol = delta_G_kcal_per_mol * kcal_to_J

# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of product A to product B.
# The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation: ratio = exp(delta_G / (R * T))
ratio_A_to_B = math.exp(delta_G_J_per_mol / (R * T_K))

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the result.
