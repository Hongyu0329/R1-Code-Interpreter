    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction is the thermal electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a polyene with 8 π-electrons (an octatetraene system).\n\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For an 8 π-electron system (which is a 4n system, where n=2), the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict a **conrotatory** motion for a thermal electrocyclization.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reactant Stereochemistry and Products:**\n    *   The problem states that two isomeric products are formed: *cis*-isomer A and *trans*-isomer B. These are the cis- and trans-5,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,6-trienes.\n    *   The formation of two products implies two competing reaction pathways from the starting material. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the stereochemistry of the product depends on the stereochemistry of the terminal substituents of the reacting polyene.\n        *   A **cis** product (A) from a conrotatory closure requires an `(in, out)` arrangement of the terminal methyl groups in the reactive helical conformation.\n        *   A **trans** product (B) requires an `(in, in)` or `(out, out)` arrangement.\n    *   This suggests that the reaction proceeds under Curtin-Hammett conditions, where a rapid thermal equilibrium exists between two isomers of the starting material, each leading to a different product. The most likely equilibrium is between the (8E) and (8Z) isomers of the tetraene.\n        *   **Path A (to cis-product):** The starting material specified, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, will adopt a helical conformation where the C2-methyl group is `in` (due to the 2Z geometry) and the C9-methyl group is `out` (due to the 8E geometry). This `(in, out)` arrangement leads to the *cis*-isomer A via conrotatory closure.\n        *   **Path B (to trans-product):** The formation of the *trans*-isomer B requires an `(in, in)` arrangement. This geometry arises from the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-isomer, which can be formed via thermal E/Z isomerization of the C8=C9 double bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze Transition State Energies (Torquoselectivity):**\n    *   The ratio of products A and B is determined by the difference in the activation energies (\\(\\Delta \\Delta G^\\ddagger\\)) of the two competing transition states (TS_A and TS_B).\n    *   **TS_A (leading to cis-A):** This TS arises from the `(in, out)` reactant. The most favorable conrotatory motion involves the inward rotation of two hydrogen atoms to minimize steric hindrance. The steric clash is therefore between two H atoms.\n    *   **TS_B (leading to trans-B):** This TS arises from the `(in, in)` reactant. Any conrotatory motion will involve the inward rotation of a methyl group and a hydrogen atom, leading to a significant Me-H steric clash.\n    *   Since the Me-H interaction is much more repulsive than the H-H interaction, the transition state TS_B is higher in energy than TS_A (\\(G^\\ddagger_B > G^\\ddagger_A\\)). Therefore, the formation of the *cis*-isomer A is kinetically favored.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    *   The ratio of products can be calculated using the Boltzmann equation: \\(\\frac{[A]}{[B]} = e^{-\\Delta \\Delta G^\\ddagger / RT}\\), where \\(\\Delta \\Delta G^\\ddagger = G^\\ddagger_A - G^\\ddagger_B\\).\n    *   Since \\(G^\\ddagger_B > G^\\ddagger_A\\), the equation becomes \\(\\frac{[A]}{[B]} = e^{(G^\\ddagger_B - G^\\ddagger_A) / RT}\\).\n    *   We can estimate the energy difference \\((G^\\ddagger_B - G^\\ddagger_A)\\) by the steric energy difference between a Me-H interaction and an H-H interaction. A standard value for a gauche Me/H interaction, like the one in the transition state, is approximately 1.7 kcal/mol (or 7.1 kJ/mol).\n    *   Assuming the thermal reaction is carried out at 100 °C (373.15 K), we can calculate the numerical ratio.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants for the calculation.\n# Gas constant in J/(mol*K)\nR = 8.314\n# Temperature in Kelvin (assuming 100 degrees Celsius for \"thermal condition\")\nT_C = 100\nT_K = T_C + 273.15\n# The difference in activation energy (G_B - G_A) in J/mol.\n# This is estimated from the steric strain difference between a Methyl-Hydrogen interaction\n# and a Hydrogen-Hydrogen interaction, which is approximately 1.7 kcal/mol.\ndelta_G_kcal_per_mol = 1.7\n# Conversion factor from kcal to Joules\nkcal_to_J = 4184\ndelta_G_J_per_mol = delta_G_kcal_per_mol * kcal_to_J\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of product A to product B.\n# The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation: ratio = exp(delta_G / (R * T))\nratio_A_to_B = math.exp(delta_G_J_per_mol / (R * T_K))\n\n# Step 3: Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(\"This problem is solved using Frontier Molecular Orbital theory combined with transition state analysis.\")\nprint(\"1.
