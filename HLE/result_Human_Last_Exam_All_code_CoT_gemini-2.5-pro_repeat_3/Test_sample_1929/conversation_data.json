    "This is a problem of predicting the product of an organic chemistry reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:** The reactants are butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** 1,3-butadiene is a conjugated diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is an alkene (a dienophile), especially one activated by electron-withdrawing halogen atoms. This setup is perfect for a Diels-Alder reaction. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n3.  **Predict the Product:**\n    *   The four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond will form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The reaction is concerted, meaning the bonds are formed and broken simultaneously.\n    *   A new double bond will form between the two central carbons of the original diene.\n    *   The two carbons from the dienophile will be incorporated into the ring as single-bonded carbons. The substituents on these carbons (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) will remain attached.\n4.  **Name the Product:** The resulting six-membered ring is a cyclohexene derivative. According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2) and the substituents the lowest possible locants. This leads to the name **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script to state the reactants, the reaction type, and then print out the full name of the product. This will fulfill the request to provide a coded solution and to output the numbers in the final product's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the product of the reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the reactants\n    diene = {\n        \"name\": \"1,3-Butadiene\",\n        \"formula\": \"C4H6\"\n    }\n    dienophile = {\n        \"name\": \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\",\n        \"formula\": \"C2Cl2F2\"\n    }\n\n    # Identify the reaction type\n    reaction_type = \"Diels-Alder [4+2] Cycloaddition\"\n\n    # Define the product\n    product_name_parts = {\n        \"locant_Cl\": \"3,3\",\n        \"substituent_Cl\": \"dichloro\",\n        \"locant_F\": \"4,4\",\n        \"substituent_F\": \"difluoro\",\n        \"parent_ring\": \"cyclohexene\"\n    }\n    \n    product_name = (\n        f\"{product_name_parts['locant_Cl']}-\"\n        f\"{product_name_parts['substituent_Cl']}-\"\n        f\"{product_name_parts['locant_F']}-\"\n        f\"{product_name_parts['substituent_F']}\"\n        f\"{product_name_parts['parent_ring']}\"\n    )\n    \n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n\n    # Print the reaction summary\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Reactant 1 (Diene): {diene['name']} ({diene['formula']})\")\n    print(f\"Reactant 2 (Dienophile): {dienophile['name']} ({dienophile['formula']})\")\n    print(f\"Reaction Type: {reaction_type}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The reaction forms a six-membered ring.\")\n    \n    # Print the final product information, including the numbers in its name\n    print(\"\\nProduct Information:\")\n    print(f\"Name: {product_name}\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {product_formula}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the reaction equation using names, and the product name contains the required numbers.\n    equation = f\"{diene['name']} + {dienophile['name']} -> {product_name}\"\n    print(equation)\n    print(f\"\\nThe numbers in the product name are {product_name_parts['locant_Cl']} and {product_name_parts['locant_F']}.\")\n\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
