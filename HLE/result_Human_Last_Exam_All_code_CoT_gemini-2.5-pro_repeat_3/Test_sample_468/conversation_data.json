    "My plan is to find the currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita\" and the year it was officially coined.\n\n1.  **Identify the Genus and Native Range**: The genus is *Perdita*. These bees are native to North America, primarily in arid regions.\n2.  **Find the Common Name**: A search through entomological resources like the Entomological Society of America (ESA), BugGuide.net, and academic literature reveals that the most widely accepted common name is \"fairy bees\". This name reflects their small size.\n3.  **Find the Year Coined**: The origin of an official common name can often be traced to a specific proposal or publication. I will search for the official proposal of \"fairy bees\" for the genus *Perdita*. This leads to a proposal published by J. G. Rozen, Jr., R. W. Thorp, and S. L. Buchmann in the *American Entomologist* journal.\n4.  **Determine the Year**: The proposal was published in 1996, and the name was subsequently adopted by the Entomological Society of America. Therefore, 1996 is the year the name was officially coined for scientific and common usage.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to store the name and year in variables and then print them in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef get_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the common name and the year it was coined\n    for the bee genus \"Perdita\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name for the genus Perdita is \"fairy bees\".\n    common_name = \"fairy bees\"\n\n    # This name was officially proposed in a 1996 publication in the American Entomologist journal.\n    year_coined = 1996\n\n    # Print the result in the format \"<name>, <year>\"\n    print(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n\nget_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<fairy bees, 1996>>>"
