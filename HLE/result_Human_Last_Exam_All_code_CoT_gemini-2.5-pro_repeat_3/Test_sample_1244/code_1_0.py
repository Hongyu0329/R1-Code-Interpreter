    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Question: Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    #
    # Plan: We analyze the structure of a unimodular 2-neighbor of Z^n.
    # A lattice L is a unimodular d-neighbor of Z^n if it's constructed from a
    # d-primitive vector v in Z^n satisfying v.v = d^2.
    # For d=2, we need a 2-primitive vector v in Z^12 with v.v = 4.
    # A vector such as v = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0) satisfies these conditions.
    #
    # The resulting neighbor lattice L is the union of cosets L = K U (v/2 + K),
    # where K = {x in Z^12 | x.v is even}.
    #
    # For L to be even, the norm of every vector must be an even integer.
    # Let's check the norm of a generic vector y = x + v/2, where x is in K.
    # y.y = (x + v/2).(x + v/2) = x.x + x.v + v.v/4
    # With v.v = 4, this becomes y.y = x.x + x.v + 1.
    # Since x is in K, x.v is an even integer. So, y.y = x.x + (even number) + 1.
    # This means that y.y and x.x have different parity (one is even, one is odd).
    #
    # For L to be even, both x.x and y.y must be even for any x in K.
    # This is a contradiction. Therefore, the lattice L constructed this way cannot be even.
    # As this construction is general for any unimodular 2-neighbor of Z^n,
    # an even unimodular lattice cannot have farness 2.
    answer_a = "No"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Question: Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
    # Can L have a vector x such that x.x = 0 (mod 6) and x is a 3-primitive vector?
    #
    # Plan: We use proof by contradiction. Assume such a vector x exists.
    # 1. x is in L and is 3-primitive, meaning x/3 is not in L.
    # 2. x.x = 6k for some integer k.
    #
    # Let's see what is required to form a new integral lattice M by adding x/3 to L.
    # For M to be an integral lattice, the dot product z.(x/3) must be an integer for all z in L.
    # This means z.x must be a multiple of 3 for all z in L.
    #
    # In the language of dual lattices, this condition means x is in 3L*, where L* is the dual of L.
    # Since L is unimodular, its dual L* is equal to L.
    # So, the condition simplifies to x being in 3L.
    #
    # If x is in 3L, it can be written as x = 3y for some vector y in L.
    # This implies x is divisible by 3 in L, which directly contradicts the
    # assumption that x is 3-primitive.
    # The initial assumption must be false.
    answer_b = "no"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Question: If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24,
    # what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    #
    # Plan: We identify the lattices and check the definition of a d-neighbor.
    # L is the Niemeier lattice N(D_24). It's constructed from the D_24 lattice:
    # D_24 = {x in Z^24 | sum of coordinates is even}.
    # N(D_24) = D_24 U (g + D_24), where g is the glue vector (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2).
    #
    # Let M = Z^24. Two lattices L and M are d-neighbors if their intersection K = L intersect M
    # has index d in both L and M (and the quotient groups are cyclic).
    #
    # The intersection K consists of vectors that are in both N(D_24) and Z^24.
    # Vectors in N(D_24) have either all integer or all half-integer coordinates.
    # For a vector to also be in Z^24, its coordinates must be all integers.
    # This means K = N(D_24) intersect Z^24 = D_24.
    #
    # Now we find the indices.
    # Index [M : K] = [Z^24 : D_24]. The subgroup D_24 is of index 2 in Z^24. The quotient
    # group Z^24/D_24 is cyclic of order 2.
    index_M_K = 2
    # Index [L : K] = [N(D_24) : D_24]. By construction, N(D_24) is the union of two
    # cosets of D_24, so the index is 2. The quotient group is cyclic of order 2.
    index_L_K = 2
    #
    # Since both indices are 2, L is a 2-neighbor of M. So d=2 is possible.
    d = 2
    #
    # Could d=1? If d=1, L would be isometric to Z^24. But L is an even lattice, while
    # Z^24 is odd (it has vectors of norm 1). Thus, they are not isometric, so d cannot be 1.
    # The smallest possible integer d is therefore 2.
    answer_c = d
