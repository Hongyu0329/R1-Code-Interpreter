    "My plan is to solve this by checking Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"Book of the Duchess,\" for the presence and rhyming patterns of the words provided in the answer choices.\n\n1.  **Fetch the Poem**: First, I will write a script to download the full text of \"Book of the Duchess\" from a reliable public source like the Project Gutenberg archive.\n2.  **Isolate the Poem's Text**: The downloaded file contains other works, so I'll extract only the lines that belong to \"Book of the Duchess.\"\n3.  **Analyze the Words**: I will check for each word from the list: \"Wente\", \"Here\", \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\". The most straightforward way a word cannot be rhymed is if it doesn't appear in the poem at all. My script will search for the presence of each word (including common Middle English variants like \"fol\" for \"fool\").\n4.  **Identify the Unrhymed Word**: I will determine which word from the list is absent from the poem's text. An absent word cannot be part of a rhyme, making it the correct answer.\n5.  **Present the Conclusion**: The script will print the analysis for each word and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes \"Book of the Duchess\" to determine which word from a given list\n    is not used in a rhyme by Chaucer.
