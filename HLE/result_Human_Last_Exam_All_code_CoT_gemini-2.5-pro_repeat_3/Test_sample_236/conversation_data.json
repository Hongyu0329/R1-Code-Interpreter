    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct homology cobordism classes of 3-manifolds that can be created by integer surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **List the knots:** First, we identify all knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\n2.  **Identify valid surgeries:** A surgery on a knot K results in a homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose homology groups are the same as the 3-sphere) only if the surgery framing is an integer `n` where `|n|=1`. So, for each knot, we only need to consider framings of `+1` and `-1`.\n3.  **Identify resulting manifolds:** We will determine the specific homology 3-spheres that result from these surgeries. This relies on well-known results in low-dimensional topology:\n    *   **Unknot (0_1):** Any integer surgery on the unknot results in a lens space. For `+1` or `-1` surgery, the result is the 3-sphere, `S³`, which represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Trefoil knot (3_1):** The `+1` surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the famous Poincaré homology sphere (`P`). The `-1` surgery yields its mirror image (`-P`). These represent two distinct, non-trivial elements in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Figure-eight knot (4_1):** It is a known theorem that `-1` surgery on the figure-eight knot is homeomorphic to `+1` surgery on the trefoil knot (giving `P`), and `+1` surgery on the figure-eight knot is homeomorphic to `-1` surgery on the trefoil (giving `-P`).\n4.  **Count the unique elements:** By collecting all the resulting manifolds, we can count the number of unique homology cobordism classes.\n\nThe following Python code systematically implements this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the number of elements of the homology cobordism group from knots with at most four crossings, we proceed as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
