    "My plan is to identify the Christian theologian who fits the specific criteria mentioned in the query. The key is not just a theologian who discussed miracles or the Fall, but one who developed a \"specialized terminology\" to distinguish between different types of divine interaction with the laws of nature, specifically one that can be applied to both a temporary miracle (the virgin birth) and a lasting change in the natural order (the Fall). I will search for a theologian known for creating such a systematic classification. My research points to the systematic theologian and apologist Norman Geisler, who created a framework distinguishing between the origination, regularity, suspension, and re-ordering of natural laws.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the theologian\n  who developed specialized terminology for changes in the laws of nature.\n  \"\"\"\n  theologian_name = \"Norman Geisler\"\n  \n  # Norman Geisler developed a framework to describe God's actions in relation to natural law.\n  # He used the term \"suspension of natural law\" for a temporary event like the virgin birth.\n  # He used the term \"re-ordering of natural law\" for the lasting changes to nature after the Fall.\n  \n  print(f\"The Christian theologian who developed this specialized terminology is: {theologian_name}\")\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Norman Geisler>>>"
