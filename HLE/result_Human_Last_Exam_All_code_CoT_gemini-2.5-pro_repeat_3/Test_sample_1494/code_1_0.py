    This function determines the best time-decay for ||∂xρ(t,·)||_L2.
    
    The problem describes a Stokes transport system. The long-time behavior of such systems
    often exhibits algebraic decay due to a phenomenon called enhanced dissipation.
    
    1.  The system is linearized around a stable stratified equilibrium ρ_s = 1-z. The perturbation is denoted by θ.
    2.  We are interested in the L^2 norm of φ = ∂xθ.
    3.  Analysis of the linearized system in Fourier space shows that the dissipation rate for a mode with horizontal wavenumber k and vertical mode number j behaves like μ_{k,j} ~ k^2/j^4 for large j and μ_{k,j} ~ 1/k^2 for large k.
    4.  The dissipation approaches zero for high wavenumbers (large k or j), which leads to algebraic decay instead of exponential decay.
    5.  The decay is limited by the slowest decaying modes, which correspond to the smallest dissipation rates. The high-k modes (μ_k ~ 1/k^2) are the bottleneck.
    6.  For similar fluid dynamics problems involving mixing and enhanced dissipation in two dimensions, the L^2 norm of the perturbation is known to decay like t^{-1/2}. We adopt this established result as the best expected decay rate.
