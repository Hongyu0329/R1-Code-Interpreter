# Number of choices for placing each element in the chain of sets.
# Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The chain is S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ S3 ⊂ S4 ⊂ U.
# This creates 5 disjoint regions for any element x to be in:
# S1, S2 \ S1, S3 \ S2, S4 \ S3, U \ S4

# The condition i ∈ Si restricts the placement of elements i=1, 2, 3.

# For element 1: 1 ∈ S1. It must be in the first region.
choices_for_1 = 1

# For element 2: 2 ∈ S2. It can be in S1 or S2 \ S1.
choices_for_2 = 2

# For element 3: 3 ∈ S3. It can be in S1, S2 \ S1, or S3 \ S2.
choices_for_3 = 3

# For element 4: No restrictions. It can be in any of the 5 regions.
choices_for_4 = 5

# For element 5: No restrictions. It can be in any of the 5 regions.
choices_for_5 = 5

# The total number of ways is the product of the choices for each element.
total_sets = choices_for_1 * choices_for_2 * choices_for_3 * choices_for_4 * choices_for_5

# Print the final calculation and the result.
