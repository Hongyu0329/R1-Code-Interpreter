print("- D provides the most logical explanation: As dots get smaller, the surface-to-volume ratio increases dramatically. This means there is a much larger amount of surface ligands relative to the core material. Disrupting the van der Waals and other interactions within this tightly packed ligand shell requires a significant amount of energy (an endothermic process). This large surface-related energy cost, which is much greater for smaller dots, provides a plausible explanation for the large observed increase in endothermicity.")
