    "No, the provided Java program does not solve the problem correctly. The problem states that the operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable (`X`) can be in any order. The Java code only checks for `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`. It completely misses the cases \"X++\" and \"X--\". If the input is \"X++\", the program will not increment the result, leading to an incorrect final value.\n\n### Plan for an Efficient C Solution\n\nI will write a program in C that correctly and efficiently solves the problem.\n1.  Initialize a variable `x` to 0. This will hold the final result.\n2.  Read the number of statements, `n`.\n3.  Loop `n` times to process each statement.\n4.  Inside the loop, read the statement string. A statement is always 3 characters long (e.g., \"X++\", \"++X\"). The most efficient way to determine the operation is to check the middle character (at index 1). It will always be either `+` or `-`.\n5.  If the character at index 1 is `+`, we increment `x`. Otherwise, it must be `-`, so we decrement `x`. This requires only one character comparison per statement.\n6.  After the loop finishes, print the final value of `x`.\n\nThis approach is the fastest because it minimizes the work done for each statement to a single character check. It uses minimal memory by declaring only a few necessary variables and reusing a small character buffer for input.\n\n*   **Character Comparisons (x):** For 100 instructions, this method performs exactly one comparison per instruction, totaling `100 * 1 = 100` comparisons.\n*   **Memory (y):** The program requires variables for the count `n` (4 bytes), the result `x` (4 bytes), the loop counter `i` (4 bytes), and a character array to hold the statement `s[4]` (4 bytes). The total memory usage is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16` bytes.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    // Read the number of statements\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int x = 0;\n    char statement[4]; // Buffer for the 3-character statement + null terminator\n\n    // Loop through each statement\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n        \n        // The most efficient check is the character at index 1.\n        // For \"++X\" and \"X++\", statement[1] is '+'.\n        // For \"--X\" and \"X--\", statement[1] is '-'.\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+16>>>"
