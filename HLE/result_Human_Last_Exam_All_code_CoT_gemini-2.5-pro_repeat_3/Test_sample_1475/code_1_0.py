    This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably
    many open dense subsets of a specific topological space P(X).
    
    The analysis, based on the Baire Category Theorem and descriptive set theory,
    shows that this cardinality is always the same value, regardless of the specific
    space X (given the conditions) or the choice of the dense open sets.
    
    The resulting set is a non-empty perfect Polish space, which is known to have
    the cardinality of the continuum.
