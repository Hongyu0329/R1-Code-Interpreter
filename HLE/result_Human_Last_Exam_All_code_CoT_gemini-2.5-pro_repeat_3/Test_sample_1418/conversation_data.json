    "Here is a plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n1.  **Define the fields**: Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field in question is $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension**:\n    *   The extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a biquadratic extension of degree 4. Its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    *   The extension $L/K$ is generated by $\\sqrt{\\beta}$. The degree $[L:K]$ is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and 1 otherwise. We can check this by calculating the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, this is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, and $[L:K]=2$.\n    *   The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n3.  **Check if the extension is Galois**: The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois if for every automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$. By explicit calculation, we can verify this condition holds. For instance, for $\\sigma_2$ which sends $\\sqrt{2} \\to -\\sqrt{2}$, we have $\\sigma_2(\\beta)/\\beta = (3-2\\sqrt{2}) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$, which is a square in $K$. Similar checks for other automorphisms confirm that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n4.  **Determine the group structure**: The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8. Let $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and the quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. This means $G$ is a group extension of $C_2 \\times C_2$ by $C_2$. A detailed analysis of the extension shows that it is a direct product, leading to $G \\cong C_2 \\times (C_2 \\times C_2)$.\n\nTo verify this result and provide an executable solution, we can use SageMath, a powerful open-source mathematics software system based on Python.
