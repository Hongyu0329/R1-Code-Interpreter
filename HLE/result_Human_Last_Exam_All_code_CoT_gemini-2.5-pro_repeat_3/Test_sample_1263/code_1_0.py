# The user wants to know if the calculation is feasible.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the Titan architecture's 4-bit integer constraint on numerators and denominators
# makes it impossible to perform the necessary multiplications.
#
# For instance, calculating the mass or the final v_e^2 requires multiplying several terms.
# Let's check the multiplication of the mantissas from the simplified formula:
# v_e^2 is proportional to (8/3) * pi * G * rho_shell * R_planet^2
# The mantissas are (8/3), (~3), (~6.5), (3), and (4).
#
# Let's try to multiply them step-by-step as the Titan computer would:
# Step 1: MOV AX, 3/1  (rho_shell mantissa)
# Step 2: MUL AX, 4/1  (R_planet^2 mantissa)
#         - Numerator becomes 3 * 4 = 12. This is <= 15. OK. AX is now 12/1.
# Step 3: MUL AX, 3/1  (pi mantissa, approximated as 3)
#         - Numerator becomes 12 * 3 = 36. This is > 15. The operation fails.
#
# Let's try another order.
# Step 1: MOV AX, 8/3
# Step 2: MUL AX, 3/1 (rho_shell mantissa)
#         - Numerator becomes 8 * 3 = 24. This is > 15. The operation fails.
#
# The constraints of the Titan architecture, specifically the 4-bit limit on numerators in intermediate
# calculations, prevent the computation of Pandora's escape velocity. The physical constants and planetary
# dimensions result in products that exceed the allowed range.
#
# Therefore, the answer is No.
