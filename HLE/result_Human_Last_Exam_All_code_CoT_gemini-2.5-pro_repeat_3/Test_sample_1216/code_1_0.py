    Solves the puzzle about Augustus's imperial records.
    The solution is derived by setting up a system of equations based on the problem's constraints.
    A key finding is that a literal interpretation of the text leads to contradictions.
    The puzzle is solved by assuming the fraction '2/5' is a typo and should be '1/5',
    which allows for a consistent integer solution.
