    This function implements the logic to find the minimum number of variables.

    Let n be the number of syntactic variables in φ (n >= 2).
    Let k be the number of essential variables of φ (1 <= k <= n).
    Let f(p_1, ..., p_k) be the k-variable Boolean function that φ is equivalent to.
    Let m be the number of models for f.

    The total number of models for φ over its n variables is m * 2^(n-k).
    We are given this is equal to 2^(n-1).
    So, m * 2^(n-k) = 2^(n-1), which simplifies to m = 2^(k-1).

    We need to find the minimum k for which a k-variable function with m models exists.
