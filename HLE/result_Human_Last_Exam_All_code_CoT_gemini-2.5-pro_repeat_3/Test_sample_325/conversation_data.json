    "To find the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical context:** This question belongs to the field of harmonic analysis, specifically decoupling theory. The answer is given by a theorem for non-degenerate curves.\n2.  **Verify the curve's non-degeneracy:** A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-degenerate if its first $n$ derivatives are linearly independent. For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to compute the first three derivatives and check if they are linearly independent by calculating the determinant of the matrix they form.\n3.  **Apply the correct theorem:** The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for non-degenerate curves in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ was established by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. We will use their formula for the sharp exponent, $p_c$.\n4.  **Calculate the exponent:** We will substitute the dimension $n=3$ into the formula to get the final numerical answer.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation, printing out each step of the formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_decoupling_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for the curve\n    gamma(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the curve and the dimension of the space.\n    n = 3\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n    gamma = sympy.Matrix([sympy.cos(t), sympy.sin(t), t])\n\n    # Step 2: Verify the non-degeneracy of the curve.\n    # A curve in R^n is non-degenerate if its first n derivatives are linearly independent.\n    # We check this by computing the determinant of the Wronskian matrix.\n    gamma_p1 = sympy.diff(gamma, t)\n    gamma_p2 = sympy.diff(gamma_p1, t)\n    gamma_p3 = sympy.diff(gamma_p2, t)\n\n    # Create the Wronskian matrix\n    W = sympy.Matrix([gamma_p1.T, gamma_p2.T, gamma_p3.T]).T\n    \n    # Calculate the determinant\n    det_W = W.det()\n    # The determinant simplifies to cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2 = 1.\n    # Since the determinant is non-zero (it's 1), the curve is non-degenerate.\n    \n    # Step 3: State the theorem for the sharp exponent.\n    # According to a theorem by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, the sharp l^2\n    # decoupling exponent p_c for a non-degenerate curve in R^n (for n >= 2) is:\n    # p_c = n(n+1) / (n-1)\n\n    print(\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent p_c for a non-degenerate curve in R^n is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"p_c = n * (n + 1) / (n - 1)\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The given curve is gamma(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t) in R^3, so the dimension n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"This curve is non-degenerate because the determinant of its first three derivatives is 1, which is non-zero.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the exponent for n=3.\n    numerator_val = n * (n + 1)\n    denominator_val = n - 1\n    p_c = numerator_val / denominator_val\n    \n    print(\"Plugging n = 3 into the formula gives:\")\n    print(f\"p_c = ({n} * ({n} + 1)) / ({n} - 1)\")\n    print(f\"p_c = ({n} * {n + 1}) / {denominator_val}\")\n    print(f\"p_c = {numerator_val} / {denominator_val}\")\n    print(f\"p_c = {int(p_c)}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent is {int(p_c)}.\")\n\nsolve_decoupling_exponent()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
