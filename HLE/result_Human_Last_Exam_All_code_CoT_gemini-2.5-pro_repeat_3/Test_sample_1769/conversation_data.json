    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\":\n\n1.  **Analyze Etymology**: I will first examine the origin of our current word, \"sister.\" It's a blend of a native Old English word and an Old Norse word brought by Viking invaders.\n2.  **Isolate Native Form**: I will identify the purely Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister, which existed before the Norse influence. This word was *sweostor* (with a common variant *swuster*).\n3.  **Trace Sound Changes**: I will trace the likely evolution of the native Old English word *sweostor*/*swuster* through Middle English and into Modern English, following established patterns of sound change in the English language. For instance, the /w/ sound was often dropped after an initial /s/ (as in *sword*, pronounced 'sord'), and vowels shifted in predictable ways.\n4.  **Compare with Cognates**: To support the hypothesis, I will look at the word for \"sister\" in other related Germanic languages like German (*Schwester*) and Dutch (*zuster*), which were not subject to the same Old Norse influence.\n5.  **Final Word**: Based on this linguistic evidence, the most probable descendant of the Old English word would have been *suster*. This form was actually common in Middle English but was eventually replaced by the Norse-influenced \"sister.\" I will write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the likely Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if Old Norse influence from Viking invasions had not occurred.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The current word \"sister\" comes from Middle English, which was a blend of\n    # the native Old English \"sweostor\" and the Old Norse \"systir\". The Norse\n    # form influenced the vowel sound and reinforced the hard 's' sound.\n\n    # The purely native Old English word was \"sweostor\", with a common variant \"swuster\".\n    # Without Norse influence, one of these forms would have evolved naturally.\n\n    # Let's trace the evolution of the variant \"swuster\", which was common in Middle English\n    # as \"suster\". This form competed with \"sister\" for centuries.\n    # The loss of 'w' after 's' is seen in other words (e.g., Old English 'swa' -> 'so').\n    # The 'u' sound would likely have been preserved, similar to words like 'dust'.\n\n    # Therefore, the most probable word to have survived into Modern English\n    # from the native Anglo-Saxon root is \"suster\". This is supported by the\n    # cognate in Dutch, \"zuster\".\n\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"The current word 'sister' is a mix of Old English 'sweostor' and Old Norse 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"Without the Norse influence, the native Old English word (in its common form 'swuster') would have likely evolved naturally.\")\n    print(\"Following known English sound changes, the hypothetical Modern English word would be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_word}'\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
