    # The current word "sister" comes from Middle English, which was a blend of
    # the native Old English "sweostor" and the Old Norse "systir". The Norse
    # form influenced the vowel sound and reinforced the hard 's' sound.

    # The purely native Old English word was "sweostor", with a common variant "swuster".
    # Without Norse influence, one of these forms would have evolved naturally.

    # Let's trace the evolution of the variant "swuster", which was common in Middle English
    # as "suster". This form competed with "sister" for centuries.
    # The loss of 'w' after 's' is seen in other words (e.g., Old English 'swa' -> 'so').
    # The 'u' sound would likely have been preserved, similar to words like 'dust'.

    # Therefore, the most probable word to have survived into Modern English
    # from the native Anglo-Saxon root is "suster". This is supported by the
    # cognate in Dutch, "zuster".
