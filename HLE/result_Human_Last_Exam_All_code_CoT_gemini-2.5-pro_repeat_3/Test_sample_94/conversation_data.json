    "This is a historical trivia question. My plan is to identify the key elements from your question and use them to determine the correct physicist.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues:** The main clues are a physicist, microscopy, an optical effect in real imagery, and an accidental discovery by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\n2.  **Identify the physicist:** This well-known story in physics history refers to Paul Kirkpatrick. A janitor at Stanford University noticed a peculiar, bright, focused line of light (a caustic) on the floor while cleaning a large concave searchlight mirror. He pointed this out to Professor Kirkpatrick, who realized the phenomenon could be used to focus X-rays, leading to the development of the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, a foundational technology for X-ray microscopy.\n3.  **Create the script:** I will write a simple Python script that assigns the physicist's name to a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The physicist known for work in microscopy who discovered an optical effect\n# after it was pointed out by a janitor cleaning concave mirrors.\nphysicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\n\n# Print the name to the console.\nprint(physicist_name)\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
