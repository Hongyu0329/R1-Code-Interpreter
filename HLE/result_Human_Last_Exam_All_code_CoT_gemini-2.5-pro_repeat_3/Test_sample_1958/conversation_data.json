    "To answer this question, I will perform a systematic search of William Shakespeare's complete works.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will create a list of the books of the Bible in their canonical order (from Genesis to Revelation).\n2.  Next, I will programmatically download the complete works of Shakespeare from an open source, such as the Project Gutenberg archive.\n3.  I will then process this text, splitting it into individual plays to make it easier to search.\n4.  Finally, I will write a script that iterates through the canonical list of Bible books. For each book, it will search through all the plays. The script will stop as soon as it finds the first match, which will give us the first book in canonical order and the play in which it is mentioned. I will look for the specific phrase \"the book of [Book Name]\" to ensure the reference is to the biblical text itself.\n\nThis method will ensure a thorough and accurate result.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_bible_book_mention():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name\n    in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Create a list of Bible books in canonical order.\n    # We use base names (e.g., \"Samuel\" for \"1 Samuel\" and \"2 Samuel\")\n    # as the likely phrasing would be \"the book of Samuel\".\n    bible_books = [\n        # Old Testament\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\", \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\",\n        \"Samuel\", \"Kings\", \"Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\", \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\",\n        \"Proverbs\", \"Ecclesiastes\", \"Song of Solomon\", \"Isaiah\", \"Jeremiah\", \"Lamentations\",\n        \"Ezekiel\", \"Daniel\", \"Hosea\", \"Joel\", \"Amos\", \"Obadiah\", \"Jonah\", \"Micah\", \"Nahum\",\n        \"Habakkuk\", \"Zephaniah\", \"Haggai\", \"Zechariah\", \"Malachi\",\n        # New Testament\n        \"Matthew\", \"Mark\", \"Luke\", \"John\", \"Acts\", \"Romans\", \"Corinthians\", \"Galatians\",\n        \"Ephesians\", \"Philippians\", \"Colossians\", \"Thessalonians\", \"Timothy\", \"Titus\",\n        \"Philemon\", \"Hebrews\", \"James\", \"Peter\", \"Jude\", \"Revelation\"\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Download Shakespeare's complete works.\n    try:\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt\"\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=15)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        # Use 'utf-8-sig' to handle the potential BOM (Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file\n        shakespeare_text = response.content.decode('utf-8-sig')\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not download the text file. {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Split the text into individual plays.\n    # This list of titles helps to reliably separate the plays from the Gutenberg text.\n    play_titles = [\n        \"THE TEMPEST\", \"THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA\", \"THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR\",\n        \"MEASURE FOR MEASURE\", \"THE COMEDY OF ERRORS\", \"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING\",\n        \"LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST\", \"A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM\", \"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE\",\n        \"AS YOU LIKE IT\", \"THE TAMING OF THE SHREW\", \"ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\",\n        \"TWELFTH NIGHT;
