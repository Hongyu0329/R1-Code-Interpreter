    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the System**: I will start by analyzing the given system of differential equations to understand its structure.\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting both derivatives, `d'(t)` and `u'(t)`, to zero. These points are crucial as they are the destinations or origins of trajectories, including separatrices.\n3.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: I will classify the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system and calculating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each point. This is key to identifying saddle points, which are fundamental to finding separatrices.\n4.  **Identify Separatrices**: A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are classic examples of separatrices. I will focus on finding the manifolds associated with any saddle points.\n5.  **Derive the Separatrix Equation**: To find the analytical form of the separatrix, I will solve the differential equation for the phase plane trajectories, `dd/du = d'(t) / u'(t)`. I will look for a simple polynomial solution that passes through the relevant equilibrium points.\n6.  **Present the Final Equation**: After deriving and verifying the equation of the separatrix, I will write a Python script to present the step-by-step reasoning and print out the final equation and its numerical coefficients, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step process to find the separatrix\n    for the given system of differential equations and presents the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the system of differential equations.\")\n    print(\"d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)^3*(1-u(t))\")\n    print(\"u'(t) = (u(t)-1)*u(t)^2\")\n    print(\"\\nWe are looking for a separatrix in the (u, d) phase plane for u >= 0.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the equilibrium points (where d'=0 and u'=0).\")\n    print(\"From u'(t) = 0, we find u=0 or u=1.\")\n    print(\" - If u=0, the first equation becomes d'(t) = 2*d^2.
