    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the condition that the convex domain `K` must intersect all lines of the form `px + qy = 1` for coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n2.  By choosing specific pairs of `(p, q)`, I will derive lower bounds on the \"width\" of the convex set `K` in the `x` and `y` directions. The width of a set in a given direction is the distance between two parallel supporting lines perpendicular to that direction.\n3.  Next, I will use a known geometric inequality that relates the area of a convex set to its widths in two orthogonal directions. This will give a lower bound for the area of `K`.\n4.  Then, I will propose a specific convex set that achieves this calculated lower bound area.\n5.  Finally, I will verify that this proposed set indeed intersects all the required lines, proving that its area is the minimum possible.\n\nThe python code below will walk through these logical steps and print the reasoning along with the values used in the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to find the minimal area of a\n    convex domain that intersects all lines px + qy = 1 for coprime integers p, q.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the intersection conditions for specific lines.\")\n    print(\"The convex domain K must intersect px + qy = 1 for all coprime integers p and q.\")\n    print(\"Let's test some simple cases:\")\n    print(\"- For (p, q) = (1, 0), the line is x = 1.
