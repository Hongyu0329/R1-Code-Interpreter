    "My plan is to demonstrate that it is possible for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ to have 9 fixed points, given the constraints on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\nHere's the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the maximum number of fixed points for a composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to $h(x) = x$.\n2.  **Analyze the Functions:**\n    *   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The equation for fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n    *   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a degree 9 polynomial can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n3.  **Check for Achievability:** The main challenge is to determine if 9 fixed points is actually achievable under the given constraints: $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ implies that both functions are strictly increasing.\n    *   The derivative of the composite function is $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive, $h'(x)$ is also always positive, meaning $h(x)$ is also strictly increasing.\n4.  **Formulate a Strategy for Construction:** To show that 9 fixed points are possible, I will construct an example.\n    *   Let $k(x) = h(x) - x$. We need to show that $k(x) = 0$ can have 9 distinct real roots.\n    *   For $k(x)$ to have 9 roots, its derivative, $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$, must have 8 real roots (by Rolle's Theorem). This means the graph of $h'(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 points.\n    *   $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. For it to intersect a horizontal line 8 times, it needs to have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n    *   The number of extrema of $h'(x)$ is determined by the roots of its derivative, $h''(x)$. The degree of $h''(x)$ is 7, so it can have up to 7 real roots, which allows for the required 7 extrema for $h'(x)$.\n5.  **Implement a Numerical Demonstration:** I will write a Python script to perform this construction.\n    *   I'll choose specific polynomials $f_0(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the derivative conditions and are likely to produce the necessary \"wiggles\" in $h'(x)$. The key is to choose polynomials that are not symmetric around their inflection points.\n    *   I'll scale $f_0(x)$ by a factor `A` to create $f(x) = A \\cdot f_0(x)$. This allows me to scale $h'(x)$ up or down to ensure it crosses the line $y=1$ eight times.\n    *   I'll define the final polynomial for the fixed-point equation, $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n    *   I'll add a constant term `d` to $f(x)$, which shifts $k(x)$ vertically. This will allow me to position the graph of $k(x)$ so that it crosses the x-axis 9 times. I can determine a suitable `d` by analyzing the values of $k(x)$ at its critical points.\n    *   Finally, I'll use NumPy to find the roots of the constructed degree-9 polynomial $k(x)$ and count the number of real roots.\n    *   The script will print the number of roots found, along with the equation, to provide a concrete answer.\n\nThis plan confirms that the maximum of 9 is not just a theoretical limit but an achievable number, by providing a constructive example.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import Polynomial\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs two cubic polynomials f(x) and g(x) with positive\n    derivatives and demonstrates that their composition f(g(x)) can have 9 fixed points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
