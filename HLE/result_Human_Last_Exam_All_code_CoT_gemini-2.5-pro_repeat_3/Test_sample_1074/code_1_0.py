# The problem is a theoretical question from abstract algebra (finite group theory).
# The reasoning is based on Sylow's Theorems and other theorems about the structure of finite groups.
# The core logic is explained above.

# Step 1: Analyze the question. We need the minimum y such that:
# (n_3 <= 9 AND n_5 = y) => G is nonsolvable.

# Step 2: Check y=1, the smallest possibility for n_5.
# The group G = A_4 x Z_5 is solvable.
# n_3(G) is 4 (which is <= 9).
# n_5(G) is 1.
# The premise is true, but the conclusion (G is nonsolvable) is false. So y=1 fails.

# Step 3: Check y=6, the next possibility for n_5.
# A theorem states that if n_p = p+1, then G has a composition factor PSL(2,p) (unless n_p=1).
# For p=5, n_5 = 5+1 = 6. This means any group with n_5=6 must have a composition factor PSL(2,5) = A_5.
# If G has a composition factor A_5, then n_3(A_5) must divide n_3(G).
# n_3(A_5) = 10.
# So, if n_5=6, then n_3(G) must be a multiple of 10.
# This means n_3(G) cannot be <= 9.

# Step 4: Conclude.
# The condition (n_3 <= 9 AND n_5 = 6) can never be true for any group G.
# In logic, if a premise is always false, the implication is "vacuously true".
# So for y=6, the statement holds.

# Step 5: Final Answer.
# Since y=1 fails and y=6 succeeds, the minimum value for y is 6.

y = 6
print(f"The minimum value of y is determined by theorems of finite group theory.")
print(f"The analysis shows that if the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 6, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must be a multiple of 10.")
print(f"Therefore, it's impossible for a group to have n_5=6 and n_3<=9 simultaneously.")
print(f"This makes the logical implication vacuously true for y=6.")
print(f"For y=1, a counterexample exists, so 1 is not the answer.")
print(f"The minimum value of y is {y}.")
