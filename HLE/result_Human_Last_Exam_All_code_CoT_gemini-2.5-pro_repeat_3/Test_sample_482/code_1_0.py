    """
    Calculates the critical covariance between two input populations v and s
    required to balance potentiation and depression.

    The learning rule is dW/dt ~ r(x - theta), where r is the postsynaptic rate
    and x is the presynaptic rate. For the weights to be stable, we require
    <r*v_k> = <r*s_k>.

    Expanding this equality and simplifying under the assumption of local correlations
    yields the condition: Cov(v_k, s_k) = Var(v_k).

    For a Poisson-like process modeled as a Bernoulli variable with probability mu,
    the variance is mu - mu**2.

    Args:
        mu (float): The average rate of activation for the input neurons.
                    This should be a value between 0 and 1.

    Returns:
        float: The critical covariance value.
