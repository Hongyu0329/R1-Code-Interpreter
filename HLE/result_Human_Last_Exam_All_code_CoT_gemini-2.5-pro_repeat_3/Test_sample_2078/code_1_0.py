def solve_system_probability():
    """
    Calculates the probability of a complex adaptive system reaching a specific state.

    The solution follows these steps:
    1.  Identify the unique path the S1 subsystem must take to satisfy the S1 and S2 components of the final target state (D, Z, N).
    2.  Calculate the probability of this S1 path occurring over 3 transitions.
    3.  Determine the state of the S2 subsystem at the critical time step (t=2) based on the S1 path.
    4.  Calculate the probability of the S3 subsystem transitioning to its target state (N) based on the state of S2 at t=2.
    5.  Multiply the probabilities of these independent events to get the final answer.
