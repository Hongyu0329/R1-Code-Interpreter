    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we first need to establish the chemical structure of a standard \"nanocar\". A nanocar is a molecule designed to resemble a macroscopic car, typically with a chassis, axles, and wheels.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define a Nanocar Structure:** We will base our calculation on a common nanocar model. This model consists of a chassis made from an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) derivative and four buckminsterfullerene (C60) molecules as wheels.\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:** We will use a specific, representative chassis structure: `1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene`. We'll calculate its chemical formula to find the number of hydrogen atoms. The C60 wheels have no hydrogen atoms.\n3.  **Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:** The prefix \"perfluoro-\" in chemistry means that all hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton of the molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The number of fluorine atoms in the \"perfluoronanocar\" will be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule.\n\nThis process will be performed in the following Python script.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on a model of a nanocar with a \n    1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene chassis and C60 fullerene wheels.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Determine the number of hydrogen atoms in the nanocar chassis.\n    # The chassis is 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene.\n    # - The central benzene ring (C6H2) has 2 hydrogens.\n    # - Each of the 4 attached '4-ethynylphenyl' groups (-C6H4-Câ‰¡CH) has 5 hydrogens (4 on the ring, 1 on the alkyne).\n    # Total hydrogens in chassis = 2 + (4 * 5) = 22.\n    num_hydrogens_in_chassis = 22\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the number of hydrogen atoms in the wheels.\n    # The wheels are buckminsterfullerene (C60), which contains no hydrogen.\n    num_hydrogens_in_wheels = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the entire nanocar molecule.\n    total_hydrogens = num_hydrogens_in_chassis + num_hydrogens_in_wheels\n    \n    # Step 4: A \"perfluoronanocar\" is one where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    # Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = total_hydrogens\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final result.\n    print(\"Hypothetical Nanocar Structure:\")\n    print(\"- Chassis: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene\")\n    print(\"- Wheels: 4 x C60 fullerene\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculation Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
