    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can employ tools from algebraic topology, specifically the long exact sequence of homotopy groups and the Hurewicz theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Properties of X and $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**: We start by recalling the relevant topological properties of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the hypersurface $X$. $X$ is a smooth quintic, meaning it's defined by a degree 5 polynomial. It is a complex surface, which is a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n2.  **Long Exact Sequence**: We will use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. This sequence connects the homotopy groups of $X$, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, and the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n3.  **Compute Necessary Homotopy Groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$**: The homotopy groups of complex projective spaces can be determined from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration $\\mathbb{S}^1 \\to \\mathbb{S}^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$. We will find that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$ and $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n4.  **Relate Relative Homotopy to Homology**: Using the relative Hurewicz theorem, we can relate the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to the relative homology groups $H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$, as the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is sufficiently connected.\n5.  **Compute Relative Homology**: The relative homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ can be calculated using the long exact sequence of homology for the pair. This involves knowing the map on homology induced by the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$, which is determined by the degree of the hypersurface.\n6.  **Synthesize Results**: By substituting the computed groups back into the long exact sequence of homotopy, we can determine the structure of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n7.  **Determine the Rank**: The rank of an abelian group is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors in its free part. From the structure of $\\pi_3(X)$, we can find its rank.\n\nThe following Python code carries out the calculations for the key quantities involved in this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic\n    hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is set in CP^n with a hypersurface of degree d.\n    n = 3\n    d = 5\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem.\")\n    print(f\"The ambient complex projective space is CP^{n}.\")\n    print(f\"The hypersurface X is of degree d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the long exact sequence of homotopy for the pair (CP^3, X).\")\n    print(\"The relevant part of the sequence is:\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_4(CP^3) -> pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> ...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the homotopy groups of the ambient space CP^3.\")\n    print(\"From the fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3, we know pi_k(CP^3) is isomorphic to pi_k(S^7) for k > 2.\")\n    # pi_k(S^m) = 0 for k < m.\n    pi_3_cp3 = 0  # Since pi_3(S^7) = 0\n    pi_4_cp3 = 0  # Since pi_4(S^7) = 0\n    print(f\"pi_3(CP^3) = {pi_3_cp3}\")\n    print(f\"pi_4(CP^3) = {pi_4_cp3}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Simplify the exact sequence with the known groups.\")\n    print(f\"Substituting pi_3(CP^3) = {pi_3_cp3} and pi_4(CP^3) = {pi_4_cp3}, the sequence becomes:\")\n    print(f\"... -> {pi_4_cp3} -> pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) -> {pi_3_cp3} -> ...\")\n    print(\"This implies that the map pi_4(CP^3, X) -> pi_3(X) is an isomorphism.\")\n    print(\"So, pi_3(X) is isomorphic to pi_4(CP^3, X).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Compute pi_4(CP^3, X) using the Hurewicz Theorem.\")\n    print(\"The relative Hurewicz theorem implies pi_4(CP^3, X) is isomorphic to H_4(CP^3, X).\")\n    print(\"We compute H_4(CP^3, X) from the long exact sequence of homology:\")\n    print(\"... -> H_4(X) --i_*--> H_4(CP^3) -> H_4(CP^3, X) -> H_3(X) -> ...\")\n    # H_4(X) is Z, H_4(CP^3) is Z, H_3(X) is 0.\n    # The map i_*: H_4(X) -> H_4(CP^3) is multiplication by the degree d.\n    # So we have the sequence: Z --(x d)--> Z -> H_4(CP^3, X) -> 0\n    print(f\"This gives H_4(CP^3, X) = coker(i_*) = Z / {d}*Z.\")\n    print(f\"So, pi_3(X) is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_{d} = Z_{d}.\")\n    final_group_order = d\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 6: Determine the rank of the resulting group.\")\n    # The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the dimension of its\n    # rationalization, which corresponds to the number of Z summands.\n    # For a finite cyclic group Z_d, this is 0.\n    rank = 0\n    print(f\"The group pi_3(X) is Z_{final_group_order}, a torsion group.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of a torsion group is 0.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the rank of pi_3(X) is {rank}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    return rank\n\nfinal_rank = solve_homotopy_rank()\n#<<<0>>>\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {final_rank}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
