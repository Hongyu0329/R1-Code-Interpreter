def solve_l_d(d):
    """
    Calculates the exact value of l(d) based on analytical simplification.

    The problem defines l(d) as the minimum of a complex limit expression f(d, p, o).
    A step-by-step analysis shows that the limit f(d, p, o) is always 0,
    regardless of the parameters d, p, and o.

    1. Numerator Analysis: The numerator N(x) tends to 0 as x -> infinity.
       Its dominant behavior is proportional to x*exp(-2x).

    2. Denominator Analysis: The denominator D(x), under any plausible correction
       of a typo in its definition, either tends to infinity (e.g., as cosh(4x))
       or a non-zero constant.

    3. Limit Evaluation: The limit of N(x)/D(x) is 0.

    4. Minimization: Since f(d, p, o) is always 0, its minimum value, l(d), is also 0.

    Args:
        d (int): The dimension, d >= 2.

    Returns:
        int: The exact value of l(d).
