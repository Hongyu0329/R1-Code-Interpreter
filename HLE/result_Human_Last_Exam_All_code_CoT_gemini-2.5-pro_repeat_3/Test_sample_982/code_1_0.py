    Reasoning:
    The film confronts the May 13, 1969 racial riots, a taboo subject in Malaysia.
    Option B states that it lacked funding from FINAS (National Film Development Corporation Malaysia) yet gained international renown.
    This is the most critical point because:
    1.  It highlights the film's independence from official state narratives about a sensitive historical event.
    2.  Its success on the world stage, despite the lack of local institutional support, is a powerful statement about artistic freedom and the importance of telling stories that challenge national silence.
    The awards (A, E), the director's fame (C), and its eventual release (D) are all important, but they are all secondary to this core reason. The film is significant *because* it broke barriers to tell a difficult truth, and its production journey as described in option B is the primary evidence of that struggle and achievement.
