def find_correct_statements():
    """
    This function identifies the correct statements based on the principles of 
    multichannel quantum scattering theory.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Statement 1: Correct. A nontrivially coupled S-matrix must arise from a 
      nontrivially coupled potential.
    - Statement 2: Correct. A diagonal S-matrix implies a diagonal potential 
      in the same basis.
    - Statement 3: Correct. A nontrivially coupled potential will result in a
      nontrivially coupled Jost matrix.
    - Statement 4: Correct. A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix will result in a
      nontrivially coupled S-matrix.
    - Statement 5: False. A diagonal Jost matrix implies a diagonal S-matrix,
      which in turn implies a trivially coupled (diagonal) potential, a contradiction.
