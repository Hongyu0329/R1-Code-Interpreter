    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon (ε) expansion, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters**: We are given the spatial dimension `d=3`. For the class of models described by the φ⁴ theory (which includes Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is `d_c=4`. The epsilon expansion is performed in powers of `ε = d_c - d`.\n2.  **State the Formula**: The scaling exponent α can be calculated to the first order in ε using the formula derived from renormalization group analysis for a general O(n)-symmetric model:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\n    Here, `n` is the number of components of the order parameter.\n3.  **Select the Model**: Since the problem does not specify the model (e.g., Ising, XY), we will assume the most common and fundamental case: the **Ising model**, for which `n=1`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We will substitute the values `d=3`, `d_c=4`, `ε=1`, and `n=1` into the formula to find the value of α.\n5.  **Present the Result**: The python script below will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, including the final equation with all the numerical values substituted.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α for d=3 using the\n    first-order epsilon expansion for the Ising model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
