    Analyzes the provided Chef script and identifies the critical error.

    The Chef script uses a recipe "Caramel Sauce" to recursively calculate
    Fibonacci numbers. However, a recursive function needs a base case to stop
    the recursion.

    The "Caramel Sauce" recipe contains the line "Serve with caramel sauce.",
    which is a call to itself. Since this call is not inside any conditional
    logic, it will execute every time, leading to infinite recursion.
    This is a fatal error that will prevent the program from ever finishing.

    To fix this error, the infinite recursion must be stopped. The only
    answer choice that addresses this is removing the recursive call itself.
