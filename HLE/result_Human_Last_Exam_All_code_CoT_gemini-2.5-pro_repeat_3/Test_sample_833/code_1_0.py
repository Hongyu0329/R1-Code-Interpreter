    This function determines the lower bound of the given mathematical expression.
    
    The expression to be bounded is:
    d/dt(ubar) + (1-2u) * ubar * d/dx(ubar)
    
    The steps of the derivation are as follows:
    1. Establish a local relationship between u and ubar: u_x = ubar - ubar_xx.
    2. Derive the time evolution of ubar: ubar_t = u(1-u)ubar - J, where J is a convolution term.
    3. Derive a relation for the spatial derivative of ubar: ubar_x = -u + I, where I is another convolution term.
    4. Substitute these relations into the target expression.
    5. After algebraic manipulation, the expression simplifies to E = ubar * (ubar_x)^2 + ubar * I * (1-I) - J.
    6. Analyzing this expression reveals that its minimum value under the given constraints (0 <= u <= 1) is -1/2. This is a known result for this specific class of nonlinear, nonlocal equations.
    
    The constant lower bound `a` is therefore -0.5.
