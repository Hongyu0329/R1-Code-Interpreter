    print("\n1. Is the relativity of simultaneity still true?")
    print("   Answer: True. Events simultaneous at different locations in one frame are not simultaneous in a moving frame.")

    print("\n2. Is the relativity of lengths still true?")
    print("   Answer: True. However, it manifests as length EXPANSION, not contraction. Moving objects appear longer.")

    print("\n3. Is the relativity of time still true?")
    print("   Answer: True. However, it manifests as time CONTRACTION, not dilation. Moving clocks appear to run faster.")

    print("\n4. Is the invariance of the speed of light still true?")
    print("   Answer: False. The speed of light changes between reference frames.")

    print("\n5. Is the non-Newtonian addition of speeds still true?")
    print("   Answer: True. The formula for velocity addition is not the simple Galilean u' = u - v.")
