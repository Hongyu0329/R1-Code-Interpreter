    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations and display the results.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and since it's an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series, ranging from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Find Eigenstates and Eigenvalues:** We need to find the states `|j, m_j>` that are common eigenstates to both `J²` and `Jz`.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for `J²` is `J²|j, m_j> = j(j+1)ħ² |j, m_j>`.\n    *   For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take `2j + 1` values, from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n    *   The eigenvalue equation for `Jz` is `Jz|j, m_j> = m_jħ |j, m_j>`.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to calculate all possible values for `j` and `m_j`, and then print the complete eigenvalue equations for each common eigenstate. The `fractions` library will be used to display the half-integer values clearly.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the J^2 and Jz common eigenvalues for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum for p-shell\n    s = 0.5  # spin for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, the quantum numbers are l = {l} and s = {Fraction(s)}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible j values\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    # In this case, j can be |1-1/2|=1/2 and 1+1/2=3/2\n    j_values = [j_min, j_max] \n    \n    j_values_str = ', '.join([str(Fraction(j)) for j in j_values])\n    print(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers are j = {j_values_str}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate eigenvalues for each j\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j)\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        j2_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(j2_eigenvalue)\n        \n        print(f\"--- For the case j = {j_frac} ---\")\n        \n        # Calculate possible m_j values\n        m_j_values = [x * 0.5 for x in range(int(-j * 2), int(j * 2) + 2, 2)]\n        mj_values_str = ', '.join([str(Fraction(mj)) for mj in m_j_values])\n        print(f\"The possible magnetic quantum numbers m_j are: {mj_values_str}.\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe eigenvalue equations for the common eigenstates |j, m_j> are:\")\n        \n        # Print the final equations for each state\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            m_j_frac = Fraction(m_j)\n            \n            # Print state information\n            print(f\"For the state |{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}>:\")\n            \n            # Print J^2 eigenvalue equation\n            print(f\"  J²|{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}> = {j2_eigenvalue_frac}ħ² |{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}>\")\n            \n            # Print J_z eigenvalue equation\n            print(f\"  Jz|{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}> = {m_j_frac}ħ |{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}>\\n\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n<<<The possible j values are 1/2 and 3/2.>>>\n```"
