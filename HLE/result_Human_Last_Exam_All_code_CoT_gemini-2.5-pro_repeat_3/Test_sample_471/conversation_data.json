    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we can use a powerful result from differential topology called Morse theory. This theory relates the number of critical points of a function to the topological properties of its domain, which are quantified by Betti numbers.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the Betti numbers** for the 2-torus ($T^2$). The Betti numbers ($b_k$) describe the \"holes\" of a topological space.\n    *   $b_0$ is the number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$ is the number of one-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    *   $b_2$ is the number of two-dimensional \"voids\".\n2.  **Apply the Morse inequalities**. These state that for a \"generic\" smooth function (a Morse function), the number of critical points of index $k$ ($c_k$) must be at least the $k$-th Betti number ($b_k$).\n    *   $c_0$ (number of local minima) $\\ge b_0$\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddle points) $\\ge b_1$\n    *   $c_2$ (number of local maxima) $\\ge b_2$\n3.  **Calculate the minimum total number of critical points**. By summing these inequalities, we find a lower bound for the total number of critical points ($C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$).\n4.  **Confirm the bound is achievable**. For the torus, this theoretical minimum is actually achievable. There exist functions on the torus with exactly this many critical points. Therefore, this lower bound is the minimal number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the minimal number of critical points.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # b_0: number of connected components.\n    # b_1: number of 1-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    # b_2: number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    b_0 = 1\n    b_1 = 2\n    b_2 = 1\n\n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we use Morse theory.\")\n    print(\"The Betti numbers of the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b_0} (it has 1 connected component)\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b_1} (it has 2 independent loops)\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b_2} (it encloses 1 void)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Apply the Morse inequalities and sum them.\n    # The total number of critical points C must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    # C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    print(\"The Morse inequalities provide a lower bound for the number of critical points:\")\n    print(\"Number of minima (c_0) >= b_0\")\n    print(\"Number of saddles (c_1) >= b_1\")\n    print(\"Number of maxima (c_2) >= b_2\")\n    print(\"\\nSumming these gives the minimum total number of critical points, C_min.\")\n    print(\"C_min = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final number.\n    # This bound is sharp for the torus, meaning a function exists with this exact number of critical points.\n    min_critical_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    \n    print(\"The final calculation for the minimal number of critical points is:\")\n    # We print the final equation showing how the numbers sum up.\n    print(f\"{min_critical_points} = {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2}\")\n\nsolve_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
