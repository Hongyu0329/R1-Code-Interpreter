# Step 1: Define the constants as determined by the analysis.

# From comparing the calculated norm-squared of the eigenfunction with the given denominator form:
# ||phi_m||^2 = integral from 0 to l of sin^2(sqrt(lambda_m)*x) dx
# = [x/2 - sin(2*sqrt(lambda_m)*x) / (4*sqrt(lambda_m))] from 0 to l
# = l/2 - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda_m)) / (4*sqrt(lambda_m))
# = (1 / (4*sqrt(lambda_m))) * (2*l*sqrt(lambda_m) - sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda_m)))
# = (1 / (4*sqrt(lambda_m))) * (2*l*sqrt(lambda_m) + (-1)*sin(2*l*sqrt(lambda_m)))
#
# Comparing this with the given form:
# (1 / (K1*sqrt(lambda_m))) * (K2*l*sqrt(lambda_m) + K3*sin(K4*l*sqrt(lambda_m)))
# We can identify the constants:
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# From analyzing the condition sqrt(lambda_m) > K.
# For the given boundary value problem, all eigenvalues lambda_m are strictly positive.
# Therefore, sqrt(lambda_m) is always a positive real number.
# The condition must hold for any k >= 0 and l > 0.
# The smallest eigenvalue can be made arbitrarily close to 0 (e.g., by making l very large).
# Thus, the only constant K that satisfies the condition for all cases is 0.
K = 0

# Step 2: Calculate the product.
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 3: Print the final equation with the determined values.
