print(f"In contrast, the Anti-TNF antibody resulted in a paw swelling change of {anti_tnf_efficacy} mm.")
print("Conclusion: Since a lower value indicates better inflammation control, the ADC is significantly more effective than the Anti-TNF antibody.")

# Step 2: Compare Side Effects of ADC vs. Anti-TNF
print("\n2. Side Effect Analysis (from Experiment 3 data):")

print(f"The Anti-TNF antibody caused a bone density change of {anti_tnf_side_effect} cubic millimeters.")
print("Conclusion: Since a more negative number means more bone loss, the ADC has substantially lower side effects than the Anti-TNF antibody. The risk of osteoporosis is not the same; it is higher with Anti-TNF.")

# Step 3: Perform Rate Calculation for ADC vs. GRM side effects

print(f"ADC side effect rate = {adc_side_effect} mm^3 / {adc_dose} mg/kg = {adc_rate:.4f} mm^3 per mg/kg")
print(f"GRM side effect rate = {grm_side_effect} mm^3 / {grm_dose} mg/kg = {grm_rate:.4f} mm^3 per mg/kg")
print("Conclusion: The side effect rate for GRM is higher than for the ADC. This suggests that at an equal dose, GRM would cause MORE bone loss than the ADC, contradicting claims in options F and I.")

# Step 4: Evaluate Answer Choices
print("\n4. Final Evaluation of Answer Choices:")
print("A: Incorrect. The ADC is more, not less, efficient than Anti-TNF.")
print("B, D, H: Incorrect. The risk of osteoporosis is clearly different between ADC and Anti-TNF (-0.3 vs -0.75).")
print("E: This is a correct statement about the experimental design, but it doesn't summarize the findings.")
print("F, I: Incorrect. These claim GRM would have fewer side effects at the same dose, which is contradicted by our rate calculation in step 3.")
print("G: Incorrect. Experiment 2 shows that GRM is also effective against inflammation.")
print("\nGiven that all choices from A to I (excluding C) contain factual errors or are incomplete, the correct option is C.")
