    This function calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.
    Let the polynomial be P(x) = sum(a_k * x^k). We want to find sum(a_k^2).
    This value is the constant term of the product P(x) * P(x^{-1}).

    Let T_m be the constant term of the partial product for i from 0 to m-1.
    Let V_m be a helper value in the recurrence, representing the coefficient of x^1 in a related polynomial.
    We derive the following linear recurrence relations:
    T_{m+1} = 4 * T_m + 2 * V_m
    V_{m+1} = 3 * T_m + 2 * V_m

    The initial conditions for m=1 (the i=0 term) are:
    T_1 = 4 (the constant term of Q_0(x))
    V_1 = 3 (the coefficient of x^1 in Q_0(x))

    We need to compute T_20, which involves iterating this recurrence 19 times.
