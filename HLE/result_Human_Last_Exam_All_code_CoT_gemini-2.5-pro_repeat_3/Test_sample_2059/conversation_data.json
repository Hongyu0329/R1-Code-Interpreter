    "This problem asks for the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. The value we want to find is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate the sum of squares to a constant term:** The sum $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. This is a standard identity in polynomial theory.\n\n2.  **Simplify the product term:** Let $p_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\n    Then $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} p_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} p_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(p_i(x)p_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\n    Let $Q_i(x) = p_i(x)p_i(x^{-1})$.\n    Let $y = x^{3^i}$. Then $p_i(x) = 1+y+y^2+y^3$.\n    $Q_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3)(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$.\n    Expanding this gives:\n    $Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(y+y^{-1}) + 2(y^2+y^{-2}) + 1(y^3+y^{-3})$\n    $Q_i(x) = 4 + 3(x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i}) + 2(x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) + (x^{3\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\n    Let $C(k)$ be the coefficient of the term with exponent $\\pm k \\cdot 3^i$ in $Q_i(x)$. So $C(0)=4, C(1)=3, C(2)=2, C(3)=1$.\n\n3.  **Set up a recurrence relation:** We need to find the constant term of the full product $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)$.\n    Let $S_m$ be the constant term of the partial product $\\prod_{i=0}^{m-1} Q_i(x)$. We are looking for $S_{20}$.\n    $S_1$ is the constant term of $Q_0(x)$, which is $C(0)=4$.\n    To find the constant term of a product of two polynomials, we sum the products of coefficients of terms with opposite exponents. The exponents in $Q_m(x)$ are multiples of $3^m$. The exponents in $\\prod_{i=0}^{m-1} Q_i(x)$ are sums of multiples of $3^i$ for $i < m$.\n    This leads to a system of recurrence relations. Let $T_m = S_m$ and let $V_m$ be the sum of coefficient products for the terms that sum to 1 (which turns out to be the coefficient of $x^1$ in the \"base polynomial\" $Q_0(x)$ and its corresponding constructions).\n    The recurrence relations are:\n    $T_{m+1} = 4 T_m + 2 V_m$\n    $V_{m+1} = 3 T_m + 2 V_m$\n    The initial conditions are for $m=1$ (the product with only the $i=0$ term).\n    $T_1$ is the constant term of $Q_0(x)$, so $T_1 = C(0) = 4$.\n    $V_1$ is the coefficient of $x^1$ in $Q_0(x)$, so $V_1 = C(1) = 3$.\n\n4.  **Solve the recurrence:** We can solve this by iterating 19 times starting from $(T_1, V_1)$ to find $(T_{20}, V_{20})$. The final answer is $T_{20}$. A Python script is well-suited for this calculation due to the large numbers involved.\n\nThe recurrence relations can be written in matrix form:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} T_{m+1} \\\\ V_{m+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} T_m \\\\ V_m \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe need to compute the 19th power of this matrix acting on the initial vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe final python code will implement this iterative calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.\n    Let the polynomial be P(x) = sum(a_k * x^k). We want to find sum(a_k^2).\n    This value is the constant term of the product P(x) * P(x^{-1}).\n\n    Let T_m be the constant term of the partial product for i from 0 to m-1.\n    Let V_m be a helper value in the recurrence, representing the coefficient of x^1 in a related polynomial.\n    We derive the following linear recurrence relations:\n    T_{m+1} = 4 * T_m + 2 * V_m\n    V_{m+1} = 3 * T_m + 2 * V_m\n\n    The initial conditions for m=1 (the i=0 term) are:\n    T_1 = 4 (the constant term of Q_0(x))\n    V_1 = 3 (the coefficient of x^1 in Q_0(x))\n\n    We need to compute T_20, which involves iterating this recurrence 19 times.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initial values for T_1 and V_1\n    T = 4\n    V = 3\n\n    # We need to compute T_20.
