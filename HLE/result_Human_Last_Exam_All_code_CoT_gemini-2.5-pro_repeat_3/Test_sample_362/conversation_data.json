    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The problem describes a Wittig reaction, which converts a carbonyl group (from an aldehyde or ketone) into an alkene (a carbon-carbon double bond).\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. The reacting part is the `C=O` group.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). The reacting part is the `PPh₃=C` group.\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:** The Wittig reaction mechanism involves swapping the `=O` from the aldehyde with the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` group from the ylide.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde fragment: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n    *   Ylide fragment: `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`\n    *   Combining these fragments gives the alkene product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n4.  **Name the Product:** The systematic IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n5.  **Determine Stereochemistry:** The ylide used is non-stabilized (it lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups on the ylide carbon), which typically favors the formation of the **Z-isomer** (cis). Therefore, the major product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to formally represent the chemical equation. The script will define the molecular formulas of the reactants and calculate the formulas of the products to display the balanced chemical equation, confirming the conservation of atoms.\n\nHere is the Python code to illustrate the reaction:\n```python\ndef get_product_of_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the products of a Wittig reaction between\n    pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenylphosphane.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecular formula is represented as a dictionary of {atom: count}\n\n    # 1.
