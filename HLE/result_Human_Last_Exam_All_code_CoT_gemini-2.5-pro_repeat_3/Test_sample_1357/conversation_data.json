    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Interpret the technical question**: The user is asking about a specific topic in algebraic geometry. The key is the condition that the \"Jacobian has good reduction.\" I will first state the central theorem that connects this condition to the structure of the curve's stable reduction.\n2.  **Simplify the problem**: According to a theorem by Raynaud and Deligne-Mumford, the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of the curve is *irreducible* (consists of a single component). This simplifies the problem to counting the types of irreducible stable curves of genus 4.\n3.  **Classify irreducible stable curves**: An irreducible stable curve of a given arithmetic genus `g` is characterized by its number of nodes, let's call it `δ`. The relationship between the arithmetic genus `g` and the geometric genus `g_norm` of its normalization (the smooth curve you get by \"un-pinching\" the nodes) is `g_norm = g - δ`.\n4.  **Establish the constraints**: Since the geometric genus `g_norm` cannot be negative, we must have `g - δ >= 0`, which implies `δ <= g`. For genus `g=4`, this means the number of nodes `δ` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these values corresponds to a distinct combinatorial type of stable reduction.\n5.  **Perform the calculation**: The total number of types is the number of possible integer values for `δ`, which is `g + 1`. For `g=4`, this is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n6.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a Python script that follows these steps, explains the reasoning, and prints the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve\n    whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The genus of the curve in question.\n    g = 4\n\n    print(\"This problem can be solved by applying a key theorem from arithmetic geometry.\")\n    print(\"The theorem states: A curve's Jacobian has good reduction if and only if the curve's stable reduction is irreducible (i.e., it has only one component).\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to counting the number of types of irreducible stable curves of arithmetic genus 4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(f\"An irreducible stable curve of arithmetic genus g = {g} is classified by its number of nodes, denoted by 'δ'.\")\n    print(\"The number of nodes determines the geometric genus of the curve's normalization via the formula: g_normalization = g - δ.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSince the geometric genus of any curve must be non-negative (>= 0), we get the following constraint:\")\n    print(f\"  g - δ >= 0   =>   {g} - δ >= 0   =>   δ <= {g}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis means the number of nodes 'δ' can be any integer from 0 to {g}.\")\n    possible_delta_values = list(range(g + 1))\n    print(f\"The possible values for δ are: {possible_delta_values}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Each possible value for δ corresponds to a unique type of stable reduction:\")\n    print(f\" δ=0: A smooth curve of genus {g-0}\")\n    print(f\" δ=1: An irreducible curve with 1 node (normalization has genus {g-1})\")\n    print(f\" δ=2: An irreducible curve with 2 nodes (normalization has genus {g-2})\")\n    print(f\" δ=3: An irreducible curve with 3 nodes (normalization has genus {g-3})\")\n    print(f\" δ=4: An irreducible curve with 4 nodes (normalization has genus {g-4})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # The final calculation is the total count of these possibilities.\n    num_types = len(possible_delta_values)\n    \n    print(\"The final calculation is the count of possible types, which is based on the genus.\")\n    print(f\"Number of Types = (genus) + 1\")\n    # As requested, printing the numbers in the final equation\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {g} + 1 = {num_types}\")\n\ncount_stable_reduction_types()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
