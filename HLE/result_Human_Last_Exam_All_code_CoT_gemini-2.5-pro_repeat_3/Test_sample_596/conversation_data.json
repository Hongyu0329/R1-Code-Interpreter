    "This problem asks for a quantity that sounds like a simple count of combinatorial objects, but is in fact a deep result in algebraic topology that equates this count to a topological invariant. The phrase \"how many\" in this context refers to a signed count, which can be a negative integer. The specific invariant is the **reduced Euler characteristic** of the underlying space, which in this case is the Möbius band.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the topological space in question, which is the Möbius band.\n2.  Determine the reduced Betti numbers of the Möbius band. The Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle ($S^1$), so they share the same Betti numbers. I will compute the Betti numbers for $S^1$.\n3.  The reduced Betti numbers $\\tilde{b}_i$ are the ranks of the reduced homology groups $\\tilde{H}_i$.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_0(S^1) = 0 \\implies \\tilde{b}_0 = 0$\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z} \\implies \\tilde{b}_1 = 1$\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_k(S^1) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2 \\implies \\tilde{b}_k = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n4.  Apply the formula for the reduced Euler characteristic, which is the alternating sum of the reduced Betti numbers: $\\tilde{\\chi}(K) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\tilde{b}_i(K)$.\n5.  Construct a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation step-by-step as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mobius_forest_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R)\n    on a Möbius band that fail to have F simplicially collapse onto R.\n\n    This quantity is a signed count equal to the reduced Euler characteristic of the\n    Möbius band.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle (S^1), so they have the\n    # same reduced Betti numbers.\n    \n    # The reduced homology groups of S^1 (and thus the Möbius band) are:\n    # H_tilde_0 = 0\n    # H_tilde_1 = Z\n    # H_tilde_k = 0 for k >= 2\n\n    # The reduced Betti numbers (b_tilde_i) are the ranks of these groups.\n    b_tilde_0 = 0\n    b_tilde_1 = 1\n    # All higher reduced Betti numbers are 0.\n\n    # The number is the reduced Euler characteristic, calculated as the alternating\n    # sum of the reduced Betti numbers:\n    # N = b_tilde_0 - b_tilde_1 + b_tilde_2 - ...\n\n    sign_0 = 1\n    val_0 = b_tilde_0\n\n    sign_1 = -1\n    val_1 = b_tilde_1\n    \n    # Higher terms are all zero and do not contribute to the sum.\n    result = (sign_0 * val_0) + (sign_1 * val_1)\n\n    print(\"The 'number' of non-collapsing rooted forests is the reduced Euler characteristic.\")\n    print(\"This is the alternating sum of the reduced Betti numbers of the Möbius band.\")\n    print(f\"The non-zero terms in the calculation are:\")\n    print(f\"({sign_0}) * {val_0} + ({sign_1}) * {val_1} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_mobius_forest_problem()\n```\n<<<-1>>>"
