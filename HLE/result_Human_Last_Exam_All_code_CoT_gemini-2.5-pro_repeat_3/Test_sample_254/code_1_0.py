    print("1. Transitivity/Similarity: This is a fundamental conceptual assumption. However, even if transitivity is assumed to be plausible, the statistical data might show significant inconsistency, invalidating the results.")
    print("\n2. Consistency: This is the statistical ramification of transitivity. A lack of inconsistency is necessary, but not sufficient. One might find consistency simply due to a lack of data to test it (no closed loops), or by chance, while the underlying trials are not truly comparable.")
    print("\n3. Homogeneity: This assumption applies within each pairwise comparison. Its violation (heterogeneity) can be addressed with appropriate statistical models (like random-effects models) and does not, by itself, invalidate the entire network structure.")
    print("\nConclusion: A valid NMA relies on a combination of plausible assumptions. The conceptual assumption of transitivity must be justified, and it must be supported by the statistical finding of consistency. Therefore, no single listed option is sufficient on its own.")
