    "My plan to solve this problem is to use a recursive backtracking algorithm. This approach is well-suited for path-finding problems on a grid.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the Lattice and Walk**: The Manhattan lattice is a 2D grid. A walk starts at the origin (0, 0). The path of the walk will be stored in a `set` of visited coordinates to efficiently check for the \"self-avoiding\" condition (i.e., ensuring we don't visit the same point twice).\n2.  **Define a Recursive Function**: I will create a function, let's call it `_recursive_walk(steps_left, x, y)`, which calculates the number of valid walks from a given state.\n    *   `steps_left`: The number of steps remaining.\n    *   `x`, `y`: The current coordinates.\n3.  **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `steps_left` is 0. This signifies that one valid n-step walk has been successfully completed, so the function returns 1.\n4.  **Recursive Step**: For the current position `(x, y)`, the function will try to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n    *   For each direction, it calculates the new coordinates.\n    *   It checks if the new coordinates are already in the `visited` set.\n    *   If not visited, it adds the new coordinates to the `visited` set, makes a recursive call with `steps_left - 1`, and adds the returned value to a running total.\n    *   Crucially, after the recursive call returns, it **backtracks** by removing the new coordinates from the `visited` set. This allows the exploration of other possible paths.\n5.  **Initial Call**: The main part of the script will set the number of steps `n` to 10 and start the process by calling the recursive function from the origin `(0, 0)`.\n6.  **Final Output**: The script will print the final count in an equation format, as requested.\n\nThis method systematically explores every possible self-avoiding walk of length 10 and counts them.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_self_avoiding_walks(n_steps):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n    This function uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible\n    self-avoiding paths of a given length starting from the origin (0,0).\n    The set of visited coordinates is managed in the outer scope to be modified\n    by the recursive helper function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The visited set stores the coordinates (x, y) of the path taken so far.\n    # We start at the origin (0,0), so it's the first point in our path.\n    visited = {(0, 0)}\n\n    def _recursive_walk(current_n, x, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        A helper function to perform the recursive search.\n        \n        Args:\n            current_n: The number of steps remaining to take.\n            x, y: The current coordinates on the lattice.\n            \n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current position.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete valid walk.\n        if current_n == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        \n        # Explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n        # The moves are represented as changes in x and y coordinates.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n        \n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # If not visited, explore this path.\n                # 1.
