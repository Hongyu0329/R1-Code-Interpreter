    "The statement is True.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the *theoretical upper limit* of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered. It's a population parameter that assumes we know the *true* effect size of every SNP and can combine them perfectly. It is the ceiling for prediction accuracy using a linear model of SNPs.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** A PGS is constructed using *estimated* effect sizes from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). These estimations are derived from a finite sample of individuals and are therefore subject to statistical noise and error. They are not the *true* effect sizes.\n\nBecause the PGS is built with imperfect, estimated weights rather than the true, unknown weights, its ability to predict the phenotype (measured by R²) in a new sample will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum possible (the SNP heritability). The gap between the PGS R² and h²_SNP is influenced by factors like the size of the GWAS sample (larger samples lead to better estimates and higher R²), the genetic architecture of the trait, and the statistical methods used to build the score.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this concept. It defines a \"true\" SNP heritability, simulates a phenotype based on it, then mimics a GWAS to get *estimated* effects. Finally, it builds a PGS and shows that its predictive R² is lower than the true SNP heritability we started with.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef simulate_pgs_performance():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the predictive R^2 of a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability (h_snp^2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
