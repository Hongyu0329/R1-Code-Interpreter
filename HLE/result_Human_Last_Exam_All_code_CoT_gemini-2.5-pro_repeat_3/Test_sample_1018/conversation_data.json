    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the established formulas for the simplicial volume of surfaces and their products.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** The simplicial volume of a closed oriented surface of genus $g \\ge 1$, denoted $\\Sigma_g$, is given by the formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$.\n    We will use this to calculate $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\|$ and $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product:** The simplicial volume of a product of two closed oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = C_{\\dim(M)+\\dim(N)}^{\\dim(M)} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$\n    where $C_{n}^{k}$ is the binomial coefficient. For the product of two surfaces, both have dimension 2, so the formula becomes:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = C_{2+2}^{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = C_{4}^{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$.\n\n3.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   Calculate $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4$.\n    *   Calculate $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4$.\n    *   Calculate the binomial coefficient $C_{4}^{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$.\n    *   Multiply these three values together to find the final simplicial volume.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef simplicial_volume_surface(g):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the simplicial volume of a surface of genus g.\"\"\"\n    if g < 1:\n        return 0\n    # For g >= 1, the formula is 4g - 4\n    return 4 * g - 4\n\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Dimensions of the surfaces are both 2\ndim1 = 2\ndim2 = 2\ntotal_dim = dim1 + dim2\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the simplicial volume of the first surface\nsv1 = simplicial_volume_surface(g1)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of the second surface\nsv2 = simplicial_volume_surface(g2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(4, 2)\nbinom_coeff = math.comb(total_dim, dim1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the simplicial volume of the product\nproduct_sv = binom_coeff * sv1 * sv2\n\n# Print the final result showing the full equation\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_{g1} x Sigma_{g2} is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{{{g1}}} x Sigma_{{{g2}}}|| = C({total_dim}, {dim1}) * ||Sigma_{{{g1}}}|| * ||Sigma_{{{g2}}}||\")\nprint(f\"Where ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4.\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{{{g1}}}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{{{g2}}}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}\")\nprint(f\"C({total_dim}, {dim1}) = {binom_coeff}\")\nprint(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{{{g1}}} x Sigma_{{{g2}}}|| = {binom_coeff} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {product_sv}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
