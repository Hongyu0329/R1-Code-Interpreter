    "This is a classic but complex geometry problem known as the circle packing problem. Finding the radius of the large circle that can tightly pack a specific number of smaller circles requires finding the optimal arrangement of those smaller circles.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Problem:** The task is to find the radius of a large circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius 1. This is the circle packing problem for n=14.\n2.  **Find the Optimal Arrangement:** The optimal (tightest) packing arrangement for 14 circles is not a simple, symmetrical pattern. It has been found through computational methods to consist of a central circle, surrounded by a ring of 5 circles, which is in turn surrounded by an outer ring of 8 circles. This is often denoted as a (1, 5, 8) packing.\n3.  **Use the Known Packing Constant:** The ratio of the large circle's radius (R) to the small circle's radius (r) for this optimal packing does not have a simple formula. It is a known mathematical constant found through numerical optimization. This constant, let's call it `k_14`, is approximately 3.3640289.\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** The radius of the large circle (R) can be calculated with the simple equation: `R = r * k_14`.\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation, print out the equation with the numbers plugged in, and give the final answer rounded to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_circle_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The radius of the 14 small circles.\n    small_circle_radius = 1\n\n    # For n=14, the optimal packing arrangement is complex. The ratio of the\n    # radius of the containing circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r)\n    # is a known constant found via computational geometry.\n    # This constant is R/r.\n    packing_constant_k14 = 3.364028931\n\n    # The equation to find the radius of the large circle (R) is:\n    # R = small_circle_radius * packing_constant_k14\n    large_circle_radius = small_circle_radius * packing_constant_k14\n\n    print(\"The equation to find the radius of the large circle (R) is:\")\n    print(f\"R = (radius of small circle) * (packing constant for n=14)\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values:\")\n    print(f\"R = {small_circle_radius} * {packing_constant_k14}\")\n    print(f\"R = {large_circle_radius}\")\n\n    # Round the result to 4 significant digits.\n    # The '{:.4g}'.format() method is used for rounding to significant figures.\n    final_radius = '{:.4g}'.format(large_circle_radius)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe radius of the large circle up to 4 significant digits is: {final_radius}\")\n\nsolve_circle_packing()\n```\n<<<3.364>>>"
