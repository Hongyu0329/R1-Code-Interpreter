    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of X.
    # X is a compact connected metric space (a continuum).
    # The configuration space C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2.
    
    # Step 2: Introduce a standard simplifying assumption.
    # General continua can be very complex. The problem is typically understood
    # in the context of "nice" spaces. We assume X is also locally connected,
    # which makes it a Peano continuum. This class includes manifolds, graphs, etc.
    # Without this assumption, one can construct an infinite number of solutions.
    
    # Step 3: Apply a key theorem from topology.
    # Theorem (C. E. Burgess): For a Peano continuum X, C_n(X) is connected for all n >= 2
    # if and only if X is NOT an arc (a space homeomorphic to [0,1]).
    
    # Step 4: Use the theorem to identify the nature of X.
    # The problem states that C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2.
    # This is the contrapositive of the theorem's statement.
    # Therefore, X must be an arc.
    
    # Step 5: Count the number of homeomorphism classes.
    # All arcs are, by definition, homeomorphic to the interval [0,1].
    # This means they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.
