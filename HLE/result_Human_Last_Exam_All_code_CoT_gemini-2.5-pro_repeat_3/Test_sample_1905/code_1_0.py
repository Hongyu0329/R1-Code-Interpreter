# This script demonstrates that for a finite set M, any derivation D on the
# algebra of functions C(M) must be the zero derivation (D=0).
# This provides a concrete verification of statement (C).

# Let M be a finite set with n points, for this example we choose n=3.
n = 3
print(f"Let M be a finite set with n = {n} points.")

# The algebra V of functions f: M -> R is isomorphic to R^n.
# A derivation D: V -> V is a linear map, so it can be represented by an n x n matrix.
# We will show that this matrix must be the zero matrix by enforcing the Leibniz rule.

# The standard basis functions e_i (where e_i is 1 at point i and 0 elsewhere)
# correspond to the standard basis vectors in R^n.

# Step 1: Prove the derivation matrix D must be diagonal.
# We test the Leibniz rule D(fg) = D(f)g + fD(g) with f=e_i and g=e_j for i!=j.
# Let's take i=0 and j=1.
i = 0
j = 1
f = E[:, i]
g = E[:, j]

# The product fg is component-wise, so e_i * e_j = 0 for i!=j.
fg = f * g

print("Therefore, the left side of the Leibniz rule, D(f*g), is the zero vector.")

# The right side is D(f)g + fD(g). This must also be the zero vector.
# Let the matrix be D_mat. D(f) is the i-th column of D_mat, and D(g) is the j-th column.
# The product D(f)*g isolates the j-th element of the i-th column, D_mat[j, i].
# The product f*D(g) isolates the i-th element of the j-th column, D_mat[i, j].
# So, for the sum to be zero, we must have D_mat[j, i] = 0 and D_mat[i, j] = 0.
# This holds for all i != j.
print(f"The right side, D(f)g + f*D(g), forces the matrix element D[{j},{i}] and D[{i},{j}] to be 0.")
print("Generalizing this, all off-diagonal elements of the D matrix must be 0.")

# Step 2: Prove the diagonal elements of D must be zero.
# We test the Leibniz rule with f = g = e_i. Let's use i=0.
f = E[:, 0]
# In this case, f*f = f.
print(f"Step 2: Proving the diagonal elements of D must be zero.")
print(f"Let f = e_{i}. Then f*f = f.")
print("The Leibniz rule becomes D(f) = D(f*f) = D(f)*f + f*D(f) = 2*f*D(f).")

# Let d_i be the i-th diagonal element of D.
# D(e_i) is a vector that is d_i at position i and 0 elsewhere.
# So the equation D(e_i) = 2 * e_i * D(e_i) becomes:
# d_i = 2 * 1 * d_i
d_i_lhs = "d_i"
d_i_rhs = f"2 * {1} * d_i"
print(f"This leads to the equation: {d_i_lhs} = {d_i_rhs}")
# This equation, d_i = 2*d_i, only holds if d_i = 0.
