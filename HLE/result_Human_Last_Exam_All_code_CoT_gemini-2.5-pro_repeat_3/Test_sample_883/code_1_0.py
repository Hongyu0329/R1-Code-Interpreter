# --- Step-by-step Analysis ---

print("Step 1: Determine the function of molecule Al1.")
kcat_control = experiments["Control"]["kcat"]
kcat_al1 = experiments["Al1"]["kcat"]
print(f"The kcat of the control reaction is {kcat_control}/second.")
print(f"With the addition of Al1, the kcat increases to {kcat_al1}/second.")
print(f"Since {kcat_al1} > {kcat_control}, Al1 functions as an activator, likely an allosteric activator.\n")


print("Step 2: Determine the function of molecule Rga1.")
kcat_rga1 = experiments["Rga1"]["kcat"]
kcat_rga1_substrate = experiments["Rga1+Substrate"]["kcat"]
print(f"The addition of Rga1 drastically reduces the kcat from {kcat_control}/second to {kcat_rga1}/second, indicating it is a potent inhibitor.")
print(f"When a high concentration of substrate (molecule A) is added in the presence of Rga1, the kcat remains at {kcat_rga1_substrate}/second.")
print("The inability of excess substrate to reverse the inhibition is the key characteristic of an irreversible inhibitor. A reversible competitive inhibitor's effect would have been overcome (as seen with XAG1).\n")


print("Step 3: Analyze other molecules to evaluate the answer choices.")
# Analysis of XAG1
kcat_xag1 = experiments["XAG1"]["kcat"]
kcat_xag1_substrate = experiments["XAG1+Substrate"]["kcat"]
print(f"XAG1 is an inhibitor (kcat drops to {kcat_xag1}/s). However, its effect is largely reversed by excess substrate (kcat recovers to {kcat_xag1_substrate}/s). This means XAG1 is a reversible, competitive inhibitor.")

# Analysis of Al2 and the combination with Al1
kcat_al2 = experiments["Al2"]["kcat"]
kcat_al1_al2 = experiments["Al1+Al2"]["kcat"]
print(f"Al2 is an inhibitor (kcat drops to {kcat_al2}/s). When Al1 (the activator) and Al2 (the inhibitor) are added together, the kcat is {kcat_al1_al2}/s, which is the same as with Al2 alone. This suggests they compete for the same allosteric site, and the inhibitory effect of Al2 is dominant.\n")


print("Step 4: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the analysis.")
print("A: Incorrect. Claims Rga1 is a reversible inhibitor, which is contradicted by the data.")
print("B: Incorrect. Claims CaCl2 is a cofactor, but it had no effect on the reaction.")
print("C: Correct. States that Al1 and Al2 are allosteric modulators, they bind the same site, and Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor. This aligns with all our findings.")
print("D: Incorrect. Claims XAG1 is an irreversible inhibitor, but the data shows it is reversible and competitive.")
print("E: Incorrect, as C is a correct statement.")
print("F: Incorrect. Claims CaCl2 and CuCl2 are cofactors. CaCl2 has no effect and CuCl2 is an inhibitor.")
print("G: Incorrect. Claims Al2 is an activator, but it is an inhibitor.")
print("H: Incorrect. Claims Rga1 is a reversible inhibitor, which is contradicted by the data.")
