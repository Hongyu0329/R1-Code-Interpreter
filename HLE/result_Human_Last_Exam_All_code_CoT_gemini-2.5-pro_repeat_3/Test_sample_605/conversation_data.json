    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will explain the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant. This invariant, denoted as `c_N`, is defined for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface given by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial `f` of degree `d` in a weighted projective space with weights `w_i`. The formula is:\n\n`c_N = (sum of weights) - degree`\n`c_N = (w_1 + w_2 + ... + w_n) - d`\n\nA key property for such a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is that its degree `d` must be equal to the sum of the weights `Σ w_i`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the weights `w_i` from the problem statement.\n2.  Calculate the sum of the weights, `Σ w_i`.\n3.  Based on the Calabi-Yau condition, set the degree `d` of the polynomial equal to this sum. I will also verify the degrees of the monomials in the given polynomial to confirm this, while noting a likely typo in the problem's equation.\n4.  Substitute the sum of weights and the degree `d` into the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n5.  The Python script below will perform these calculations and print out the final equation with all the numbers, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the weights for the variables (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5).\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the weights.\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the degree 'd' of the polynomial.\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' of the defining polynomial\n    # must be equal to the sum of the weights.\n    # We can verify that most monomials in the given polynomial have a weighted\n    # degree of 225, which matches the sum of weights.\n    # For example, for the term z_1^8 * z_3, the degree is 8*22 + 1*49 = 225.\n    # For the term z_5^3, the degree is 3*75 = 225.\n    # The sum of weights is 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n    # We will therefore use d = 225.\n    d = sum_of_weights\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n    # The formula is c_N = sum(w_i) - d.\n    crawley_nordstrom_invariant = sum_of_weights - d\n\n    # Step 5: Print the detailed calculation as requested.\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant (c_N) is calculated as the sum of the weights minus the degree 'd'.\")\n    \n    weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    \n    print(f\"The sum of weights is: {weights_str} = {sum_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"For a Calabi-Yau Link, the degree d must equal the sum of the weights, so d = {d}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the invariant is:\")\n    # The final output shows each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"c_N = ({weights_str}) - {d}\")\n    print(f\"c_N = {sum_of_weights} - {d} = {crawley_nordstrom_invariant}\")\n\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
