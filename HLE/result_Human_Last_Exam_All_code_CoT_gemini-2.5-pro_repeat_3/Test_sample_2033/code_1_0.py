    This function calculates the value of l(a,b,c,d) based on the problem description.
    
    The detailed derivation shows that the expression for l simplifies to:
    l = - (1/(2*sigma**2)) * Delta_E1 - ((n-1)/2) * Delta_E2
    
    where:
    - Delta_E1 is the change in the sum of squares of the log-eigenvalues.
    - Delta_E2 is the change in the sum of the log-eigenvalues.
    
    Delta_E2 can be calculated analytically as:
    Delta_E2 = ln(det(Y1)) - ln(det(Y2)) = (n*(n+1)/2) * ln(c/d)
    
    The problem's formulation, requiring a single numerical answer independent of the
    parameters a, b, c, and d, implies that the final value of l must be a constant.
    This is possible if the term involving Delta_E1 exactly cancels the term 
    involving Delta_E2.
    
    This code calculates the coefficients of these two terms to demonstrate their cancellation.
