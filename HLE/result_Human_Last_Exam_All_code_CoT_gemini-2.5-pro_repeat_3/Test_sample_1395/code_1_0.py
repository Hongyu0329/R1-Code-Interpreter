# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A map of countries is a planar graph. By the Four-Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# The pre-1991 Asian map was complex enough to require 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before the dissolution (chi_before) was {chi_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The dissolution created new countries but the map remained planar. The graph's complexity did not decrease.
# The new map of Asia still required 4 colors to be properly colored.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after the dissolution (chi_after) was {chi_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed.
# A graph of bordering countries is inherently planar. Subdividing a region doesn't change this fact.
# Therefore, the planarity did not change.
planarity_changed = False
if planarity_changed:
    beta = 2
else:
    beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, therefore beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.")
print(f"The equation is: {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")

print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
