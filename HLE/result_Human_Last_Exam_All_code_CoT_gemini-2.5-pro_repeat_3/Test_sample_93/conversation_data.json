    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach. The variables $x_i$ must be non-negative integers, and the order matters, meaning $(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ is a different solution from $(0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Reduce Search Space:** A naive brute-force search by checking every possible tuple $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ would be computationally infeasible. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44$. This would mean checking up to $45^5$ combinations.\n\n2.  **Use Symmetry:** To make the search efficient, we can find the number of *unordered* sets of solutions $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation, with the constraint that $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$.\n\n3.  **Count Permutations:** For each unique unordered set found, we calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples that can be formed from it. If a set has numbers with frequencies $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ (where $\\sum k_i = 5$), the number of distinct permutations is given by the multinomial coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! \\cdots k_m!} $$\n    For example, the set $\\{a, a, b, c, c\\}$ would have $5! / (2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 2!) = 30$ permutations.\n\n4.  **Implement Efficiently:** We can implement this using four nested loops for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ under the ordering constraint. The value of $x_5^2$ can then be calculated as $2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)$. We then check if this value is a perfect square and if the resulting $x_5$ maintains the order ($x_5 \\le x_4$). The loops' bounds can be dynamically adjusted to further prune the search space.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all unique unordered sets found.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n    \n    # Pre-calculate factorials for permutation calculation (0! to 5!)\n    factorials = [math.factorial(i) for i in range(6)]\n\n    limit1 = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    # Loop for x1 with constraint x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 0\n    for x1 in range(limit1 + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        limit2 = min(x1, int(math.sqrt(target - s1)))\n        for x2 in range(limit2 + 1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2 * x2\n            limit3 = min(x2, int(math.sqrt(target - s2)))\n            for x3 in range(limit3 + 1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3 * x3\n                limit4 = min(x3, int(math.sqrt(target - s3)))\n                for x4 in range(limit4 + 1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4 * x4\n                    \n                    x5_sq = target - s4\n                    \n                    # Check if the remainder is a perfect square\n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(x5_sq))\n                    if x5 * x5 == x5_sq:\n                        # Check if the ordering constraint is maintained\n                        if x5 <= x4:\n                            # Found a valid unordered solution set\n                            solution_set = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]\n                            \n                            # Count the frequency of each number in the set\n                            value_counts = Counter(solution_set)\n                            \n                            # Calculate the number of distinct permutations\n                            # This is 5! / (k1! * k2! * ...)\n                            permutations = factorials[5]\n                            for count in value_counts.values():\n                                permutations //= factorials[count]\n                            \n                            total_solutions += permutations\n\n    # As requested, printing the numbers from the equation\n    print(\"The equation is: x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\")\n    print(\"The numbers in the equation are: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2024\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is: {total_solutions}\")\n\nsolve_sum_of_squares()\n<<<40040>>>"
