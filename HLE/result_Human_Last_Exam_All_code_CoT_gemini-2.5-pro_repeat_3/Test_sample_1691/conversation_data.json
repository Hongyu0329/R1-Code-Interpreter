    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the plan to develop the analytical formula for the integral.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the integral:** The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)} dx$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the integrand becomes very large near the points where $g(x)$ is zero. In the given range $[0, 15.00]$, this happens only at $x=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from a small region around $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the function `g(x)`:** Near $x=0$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ dominates. So, we can approximate $g(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This is the leading-order behavior. Let's denote this as $g(x) \\approx c_0 x^p$, with $c_0 = 9.0$ and $p = 5.0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the integral:** The integral can be approximated as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c_0 x^p} dx$. Since the contribution is from a small region near $x=0$, the upper limit of 15.00 is large enough to be treated as infinity without affecting the leading-order result.\n\n4.  **Solve the approximate integral:** The resulting integral can be solved analytically using a change of variables and its relation to the Beta function. This leads to an approximation of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{\\alpha}$.\n\n5.  **Derive the formula for `C` and `alpha`:**\n    *   The exponent $\\alpha$ is determined by the power $p$: $\\alpha = -(p-1)/p$.\n    *   The coefficient $C$ depends on $c_0$ and $p$: $C = \\frac{c_0^{-1/p}}{p} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that calculates the numerical values for `C` and `alpha` and prints the final analytical formula in a clear, step-by-step manner, showing how each number in the formula is derived.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script develops and presents an analytical approximation for the integral\n# I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (epsilon + 9*x^5 + 5*x^6 + 9*x^8) dx\n# for the small epsilon regime.\n\n# 1. Identify parameters from the dominant term near x=0.\n# The denominator's polynomial is g(x) = 9.0*x**5.0 + 5.0*x**6.0 + 9.0*x**8.0.\n# For small x, g(x) is approximated by its leading term, c0*x**p.\nc0 = 9.0\np = 5.0\n\n# 2. The approximation for I(epsilon) has the form C * epsilon^alpha.\n# Calculate the exponent alpha.\nalpha = -(p - 1.0) / p\n\n# 3.
