    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve and its Genus:** The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. The genus $g$ of the curve is determined by the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$. The formula for the genus is $g = \\lfloor (\\text{deg}(f) - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$.\n\n2.  **Understand Stable Reduction and Double Points:** The \"stable reduction\" is the simplest possible version of the curve when considered modulo $p=2$. Its singularities, if any, are ordinary double points (also called nodes). We need to find the number of these nodes.\n\n3.  **Method: Analyze Branch Points:** The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the branch points of the curve map $x: C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. These are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and, if the degree of $f(x)$ is odd, the point at infinity. We will analyze how these branch points cluster together when considered with 2-adic valuations.\n\n4.  **Find Valuations of Branch Points:**\n    *   We will find the roots of $f(x)$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$). We don't need the exact roots, only their 2-adic valuations (i.e., the power of 2 that divides them).\n    *   One root is clearly $x=0$.\n    *   For the other roots, we will use the Newton polygon method for the polynomial $f(x)/x$. This is a graphical tool that determines the valuations of the roots from the valuations of the coefficients.\n\n5.  **Group Branch Points into Clusters:**\n    *   Branch points with a positive 2-adic valuation \"reduce\" to 0.\n    *   Branch points with a negative 2-adic valuation \"reduce\" to infinity. The point at infinity also belongs to this group.\n    *   All branch points that reduce to the same point form a cluster. Each cluster will correspond to a component in the stable reduction.\n\n6.  **Calculate Component Genera:** For each cluster $B_i$, the corresponding component $C_i$ in the stable reduction has a geometric genus $g_i = \\lfloor (|B_i| - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$, where $|B_i|$ is the number of branch points in the cluster.\n\n7.  **Apply the Genus Formula:** The genus of the original curve $g$ is related to the genera of the components $g_i$, the number of components $k$, and the number of double points $\\delta$ by the formula:\n    $g = (\\sum g_i) + \\delta - k + 1$\n\n8.  **Solve for the Number of Double Points ($\\delta$):** By substituting all the calculated values into this formula, we can solve for $\\delta$.\n\nThis plan avoids complex computations by using the combinatorial structure of the branch points, which is a standard technique in modern number theory.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above p=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the curve and find its genus\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x\n    # The degree of f(x) is 5.\n    deg_f = 5\n    g = math.floor((deg_f - 1) / 2)\n    print(f\"The curve is y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve is g = floor(({deg_f} - 1) / 2) = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Explain the method based on branch points\n    print(\"To find the number of double points, we analyze the 2-adic valuations of the curve's branch points.\")\n    print(\"The branch points are the roots of f(x) and the point at infinity (since the degree is odd).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Find the valuations of the roots of f(x)\n    # f(x) = x * (8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)\n    # One root is alpha_1 = 0.
