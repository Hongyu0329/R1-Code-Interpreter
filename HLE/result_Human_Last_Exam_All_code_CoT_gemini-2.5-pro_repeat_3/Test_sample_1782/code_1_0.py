def solve_set_theory_question():
    """
    This function addresses a question in advanced set theory concerning the existence of a specific type of tree in the poset P(omega_1)/<omega_1.

    The question is: Does there always exist a tree T of height omega_1, where each level is a maximal antichain in P(omega_1)/<omega_1, each level refines the one above it, but there is no common refinement for all levels?

    This is not a computational problem. The answer depends on the axioms of set theory used.

    1.  The existence of such a tree is not provable within the standard ZFC axioms.
    2.  Specifically, under the axiom known as Martin's Axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis (MA + not CH), such a tree is proven *not* to exist.
    3.  Because there is a consistent model of set theory (ZFC + MA + not CH) in which the tree does not exist, the answer to the question "Does there *always* exist..." is no.
    """
    answer = "No"
    explanation = "The existence of such a tree is independent of the standard ZFC axioms of set theory. For instance, under Martin's Axiom and the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis, such a tree does not exist. Therefore, it does not 'always' exist."
