    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a false premise. The former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria. They are two different individuals, and there is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to find a year for an event that did not occur. I will provide a Python script that explains this clarification.\n\n```python\ndef clarify_identity():\n  \"\"\"\n  Addresses the user's question by clarifying the identities of\n  Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n  \"\"\"\n  name_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\"\n  actual_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  other_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n  print(f\"The user is asking for the year when '{name_in_question}' publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\")\n  print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n  print(f\"This question appears to confuse two different historical figures from Nigeria.\")\n  print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
