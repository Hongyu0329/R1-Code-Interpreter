    "Of the dances listed, the European Tango is unique in its technique, which makes overturning a reverse turn a fundamental violation of its principles. Here is the step-by-step reasoning presented in a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a Python script to analyze the provided multiple-choice question.\n2.  The script will define the options and explain the core techniques of each dance style, particularly focusing on the characteristics relevant to turning.\n3.  It will highlight why the European Tango's technique (staccato movement, no sway, no rise and fall) makes it impossible to properly overturn a reverse turn without disregarding its fundamental technique. The other dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) have a flowing nature with sway and rise/fall, which allows for variations in rotation.\n4.  To satisfy the prompt's requirement, the script will represent the choices numerically and print out an \"equation\" of elimination to find the correct answer.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer a specific question\n    about the reverse turn.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The options provided in the question.\n    options = {\n        'A': \"Viennese Waltz\",\n        'B': \"English Waltz\",\n        'C': \"European Tango\",\n        'D': \"Slow Foxtrot\",\n        'E': \"Quickstep\"\n    }\n\n    # Assigning numbers to each option to fulfill the \"equation\" requirement.\n    option_numbers = {\n        'A': 1,\n        'B': 2,\n        'C': 3,\n        'D': 4,\n        'E': 5\n    }\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process: Analyzing the Reverse Turn in different dances.\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(\"The question is: 'In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?'\")\n    print(\"\\n1. In dances like Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique involves body sway, rise and fall, and continuous, flowing movement. This allows skilled dancers to modify figures, including overturning or underturning them, for choreographic effect without necessarily 'disregarding' the core technique.\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The European Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique is characterized by:\")\n    print(\"   - No body sway.\")\n    print(\"   - No rise and fall.\")\n    print(\"   - Staccato (sharp, clipped) action.\")\n    print(\"   - A compact frame and specific, grounded footwork.\")\n    print(\"\\n3. A standard Reverse Turn in Tango is designed around these principles. Attempting to 'overturn' it—to add more rotation than the figure allows—would force the dancers to introduce sway, break the staccato timing, and lose the grounded feeling. This would be a clear violation of fundamental Tango technique, not just a variation.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nDeriving the answer from the analysis:\")\n    # This section fulfills the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement\n    # by showing a process of elimination with the assigned numbers.\n    print(\"\\nLet's form a logical equation to find the answer:\")\n    print(f\"Is it option {option_numbers['A']} (Viennese Waltz)?
