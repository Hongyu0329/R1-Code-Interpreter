    print("\n1. In dances like Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique involves body sway, rise and fall, and continuous, flowing movement. This allows skilled dancers to modify figures, including overturning or underturning them, for choreographic effect without necessarily 'disregarding' the core technique.")
    print("\n2. The European Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique is characterized by:")
    print("   - No body sway.")
    print("   - No rise and fall.")
    print("   - Staccato (sharp, clipped) action.")
    print("   - A compact frame and specific, grounded footwork.")
    print("\n3. A standard Reverse Turn in Tango is designed around these principles. Attempting to 'overturn' it—to add more rotation than the figure allows—would force the dancers to introduce sway, break the staccato timing, and lose the grounded feeling. This would be a clear violation of fundamental Tango technique, not just a variation.")
