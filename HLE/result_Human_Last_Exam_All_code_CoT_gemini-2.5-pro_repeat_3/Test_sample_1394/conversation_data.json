    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this differential equation:\n\n1.  The given differential equation is a non-linear, first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). It is complex, so I will try to simplify it with a suitable substitution.\n2.  I'll rewrite the equation using the notation $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n3.  The structure of the equation suggests that a substitution might simplify it. The terms involve $y$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in the combination $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests the substitution $v = y^2$, which makes $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2y\\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n4.  After the substitution, the original equation transforms into a new ODE in terms of $v$ and $x$. This new equation is a type of d'Alembert-Lagrange equation, which is of the form $v = g(x, \\frac{dv}{dx})$.\n5.  I will solve this d'Alembert-Lagrange equation by differentiating it with respect to $x$. This will lead to a simpler, factorable equation for $\\frac{d^2v}{dx^2}$.\n6.  Solving the resulting equation will provide the general solution for $\\frac{dv}{dx}$.\n7.  By integrating $\\frac{dv}{dx}$, I will find the general solution for $v(x)$.\n8.  Finally, I will substitute back $y^2=v$ to obtain the general solution of the original equation in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n9.  The solution will contain an arbitrary constant, which I will denote by $C$.\n10. I will then provide a Python script to print the final equation, clearly stating the numerical coefficients as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables and the constant\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\nC = sympy.Symbol('C')\n\n# The general solution to the differential equation is given by the following implicit equation:\n# 4*y**2 - 2*C*x**2 - C**2 - 2*C - 36 = 0\n# We can represent this equation using sympy\ngeneral_solution = 4*y**2 - 2*C*x**2 - C**2 - 2*C - 36\n\n# Print the general solution\nprint(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{general_solution} = 0, where C is an arbitrary constant.\")\n\n# As requested, output each number in the final equation.\n# The equation is of the form: A*y**2 + B*C*x**2 + D*C**2 + E*C + F = 0\nA = 4\nB = -2\nD = -1\nE = -2\nF = -36\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers (coefficients) in the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"A (coefficient of y**2): {A}\")\nprint(f\"B (coefficient of C*x**2): {B}\")\nprint(f\"D (coefficient of C**2): {D}\")\nprint(f\"E (coefficient of C): {E}\")\nprint(f\"F (constant term): {F}\")\n```\n<<<4*y**2 - 2*C*x**2 - C**2 - 2*C - 36 = 0>>>"
