    # Part B: Number of Energy Coefficients
    # The energy E is a quadratic form in the derivatives of A, respecting cubic symmetry.
    # This reduces to counting the number of quadratic invariants of a 3x3 matrix
    # under the cubic group O_h. This is equivalent to the number of irreducible
    # representations into which the space of 3x3 matrices decomposes under O_h.
    # The decomposition is A_1g + T_1g + E_g + T_2g.
    # Each of the 4 irreps provides one quadratic invariant.
