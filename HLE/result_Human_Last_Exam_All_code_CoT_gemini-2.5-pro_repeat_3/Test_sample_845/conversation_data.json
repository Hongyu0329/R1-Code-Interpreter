    "The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats. This is most commonly known as the R-R interval, which refers to the interval between the peaks of the 'R' waves in an ECG (electrocardiogram) signal. When using PPG (photoplethysmography), it's also called the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or Pulse-to-Pulse interval.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The value is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n  # The most common technical term is \"R-R interval\".\n  value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n  print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats for HRV is called the '{value_name}'.\")\n\nget_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
