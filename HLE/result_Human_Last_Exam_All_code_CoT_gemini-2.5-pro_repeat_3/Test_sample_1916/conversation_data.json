    "To solve this problem, we can rephrase it in algebraic terms. A category with a single object is equivalent to a structure called a **monoid**.\n\n- The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid.\n- The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation.\n- The identity morphism corresponds to the monoid's identity element.\n\nAn isomorphism between two such categories is the same as a monoid isomorphism. Therefore, the task is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid of order 3 has three elements. Let's call them `e` (the identity), `a`, and `b`. The structure of the monoid is defined by a multiplication table. Since `e` is the identity, its products with any element are fixed (e.g., `e * x = x * e = x`). We only need to define the four products involving the non-identity elements `a` and `b`: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  Represent the elements numerically as `0` (for `e`), `1` (for `a`), and `2` (for `b`).\n2.  Iterate through all `3^4 = 81` possible ways to define the four products `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`.\n3.  For each of the 81 potential structures, check if it satisfies the associative property: `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)`.\n4.  Collect all valid, associative structures. These are the monoids of order 3.\n5.  Group these monoids into isomorphism classes. Two monoids are considered isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by swapping the roles of the non-identity elements `a` and `b`.\n6.  Count the number of unique isomorphism classes to find the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_monoids():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and\n    three morphisms by finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define elements and setup iteration\n    # Let elements be 0 (identity 'e'), 1 ('a'), 2 ('b')\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    non_identity = [1, 2]\n    num_possibilities = len(elements) ** 4\n    \n    print(f\"A category with one object is a monoid.
