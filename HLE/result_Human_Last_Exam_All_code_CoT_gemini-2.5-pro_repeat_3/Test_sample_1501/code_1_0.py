    This script solves a theoretical problem about the doubling construction
    for Steiner Quadruple Systems (SQS).

    The solution is based on the following analysis:

    1.  **Fundamental SQS Parameters:**
        - For any SQS of order w, the number of blocks containing a given pair of points
          is constant, denoted by λ₂, and is calculated as λ₂ = (w - 2) / 2.
        - The original system is an SQS(v). A pair {x, y} in it has multiplicity μ.
          Therefore, μ = (v - 2) / 2.
        - The new system is an SQS(2v). Any pair in it has a multiplicity of
          (2v - 2) / 2 = v - 1.

    2.  **Interpretation of "ND-pair":**
        The term "ND-pair" is not universally standard, but in the context of a
        doubling construction on the point set Q × {0, 1}, it logically refers
        to pairs of points on the same "level" (e.g., both having the second
        coordinate as 0). These are pairs of the form {(x, i), (y, i)} where x ≠ y.

    3.  **Step-by-step Answer Derivation:**

        (a) To determine if each element is in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs:
            - Consider an arbitrary element, (z, 0).
            - According to our interpretation, the ND-pairs containing it are of the
              form {(z, 0), (y, 0)}, where y ∈ Q and y ≠ z.
            - The number of choices for y is v - 1.
            - Thus, the statement is True.

        (b) To find the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)}:
            - The multiplicity of any pair in the resulting SQS(2v) is v - 1.
            - We are given that μ = (v - 2) / 2 for the original SQS(v).
            - From this, we can express v as v = 2*μ + 2.
            - Substituting this into the new multiplicity formula (v - 1):
              (2*μ + 2) - 1 = 2*μ + 1.
            - The expression for the new multiplicity is 2*μ + 1.

        (c) To determine if an ND-pair can have multiplicity v:
            - The multiplicity of any ND-pair is v - 1.
            - The question asks if it's possible for v - 1 = v.
            - This equation simplifies to -1 = 0, which is a contradiction.
            - Therefore, no ND-pair can have multiplicity v. The answer is No.
