    # The user wants to identify the false statement about the pulpit in the Baptistery of Pisa.
    # Let's analyze each option step-by-step.

    print("Step-by-step analysis of each statement:")
    print("-----------------------------------------")

    # Statement A: The pulpit’s narrative scenes show the influence of antique Roman sculpture.
    print("A: TRUE. Nicola Pisano's work is a key monument of the classicizing trend in 13th-century Italian sculpture. The dense composition and the statuesque, solid figures were heavily influenced by his study of ancient Roman sarcophagi.")

    # Statement B: Nicola Picasso inscribed his name on the pulpit and dated it 1260.
    print("B: FALSE. This statement contains a major error. The artist who created the pulpit was Nicola Pisano, not the 20th-century artist Pablo Picasso. While the pulpit is indeed inscribed with the artist's name and the date 1260, the name is wrong in this statement.")

    # Statement C: The pulpit is hexagonal.
    print("C: TRUE. The pulpit has a six-sided (hexagonal) plan, which is one of its defining features.")

    # Statement D: The figure of Fortitude on the pulpit is notable for its nudity and heroic musculature.
    print("D: TRUE. At one of the corners of the pulpit is a nude male figure representing Fortitude (or sometimes identified as Hercules). It is the first known monumental nude in Italian sculpture since antiquity and is clearly classical in inspiration.")

    # Statement E: The pulpit’s hexagonal structure echoes the Baptistery’s octagonal font by Guido da Como.
    print("E: This is a statement of artistic interpretation, but it is generally considered plausible. Both are centrally-planned, multi-sided structures within the same building. It is not a clear factual error.")

    # Statement F: All six sides of the pulpit’s upper section have narrative relief carvings with scenes from the life of Christ carved from Carrara marble.
    print("F: FALSE. The hexagonal pulpit has only five narrative reliefs. The sixth side is left open to accommodate the staircase for entry. Therefore, the claim that 'All six sides' have carvings is factually incorrect.")
    
    # Statement G: Triple colonettes separate the narrative scenes on the pulpit’s upper section.
    print("G: TRUE. At the corners of the hexagonal box, clusters of three small columns (colonettes) frame the five narrative panels.")

    # Statement H: The pulpit is a free-standing structure supported by its own columns.
    print("H: TRUE. It is a freestanding pulpit, not one attached to a wall (an ambo).")

    # Statement I: One of the narrative scenes on the pulpit depicts the Crucifixion.
    print("I: TRUE. The five narrative scenes are the Nativity, the Adoration of the Magi, the Presentation in the Temple, the Crucifixion, and the Last Judgment.")
    
    # Statement J: Three of the pulpit’s six outer columns rest on a marble lion and the lectern rests on a marble eagle.
    print("J: TRUE. Of the six outer columns, three rest on the floor plinth and three are supported by sculpted lions. The lectern is indeed supported by a sculpted eagle.")
    
    print("-----------------------------------------")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Both statements B and F are factually false.")
    print("- Statement B incorrectly names the artist as 'Nicola Picasso'.")
    print("- Statement F incorrectly states there are six narrative panels when there are only five.")
    print("However, the error in statement B is a fundamental misattribution to a completely different artist from a different century, making it the most egregiously false statement.")
