    This function provides the solution to the three-part trivia question.
    Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School". The misleading tracks were those of a cow.
    Part B: The allusive act underscores the theme of education vs mis-education.
    Part C: Nabokov's translation of "Eugene Onegin" was his most pervasive experience with intricate back-referencing.
    The corresponding numbers are 6, 3, and 7.
    Their sum is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
