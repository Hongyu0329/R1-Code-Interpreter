    Calculates the minimum number of operations n needed to transform any
    given initial sequence into any target sequence.

    This is determined by finding the maximum of the minimum operations
    required over all possible pairs of sequences. We found a worst-case
    pair to establish this number.

    Initial Sequence (S_i): A sequence of 100 zeros ('0' * 100).
    Target Sequence (S_t): An alternating sequence '0101...01'.

    Transformation Steps and Cost:
    1. S_i has 0 blocks of '1's. S_t has 50 blocks of '1's. To create these,
       we need 50 insertion operations.
    2. S_i has 100 '0's. S_t has 50 '0's. We need to remove 50 '0's.
       The 50 insertions split the initial block of '0's into 50 separate
       blocks. Removing '0's from each of these requires 50 removal operations.
