    This script explains the reasoning to find the largest positive integer n
    such that AC(2) implies AC(n) in ZF set theory without the Axiom of Choice.

    AC(n) stands for the statement: "Every family of n-element sets has a non-empty product."
    This is equivalent to saying a choice function exists for any such family.

    The question asks for the largest integer n such that ZF proves that AC(2) implies AC(n).
