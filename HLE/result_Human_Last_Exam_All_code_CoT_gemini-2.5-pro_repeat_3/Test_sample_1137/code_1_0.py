    Analysis of Litigation Forum Options:

    1.  A. Ontario Court of Appeal: Incorrect. This is an appellate court for hearing appeals, not for starting a new case.

    2.  D. Small Claims Court: Incorrect. The monetary value of a dispute over six large commercial real estate properties far exceeds the court's jurisdictional limit (currently $35,000).

    3.  E. Federal Court of Canada: Incorrect. This court's jurisdiction is limited to specific federal matters. A private commercial dispute under provincial law does not qualify.

    4.  C. Superior Court of Justice: A possible, but not the best, option. This is the general trial court in Ontario. However, a more specialized forum exists within it.

    5.  B. Commercial List: Correct. This is a specialized list within the Superior Court of Justice designed to handle complex commercial litigation. Its key features are expert judges and active case management aimed at achieving timely and efficient resolutions, which directly matches the needs of RE1.

    Conclusion: Given the complex commercial nature of the dispute and the desire for a speedy resolution, the Commercial List is the best available choice.
