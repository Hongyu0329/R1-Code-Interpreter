# The problem asks for the limit of M(theta) as theta approaches 0.
# Based on the step-by-step derivation, we found that for any theta > 0,
# it is possible to construct a valid billiard trajectory for which the angle alpha
# between the trajectory vector and the inner normal vector is exactly pi.

# This trajectory starts at x = e^(i*theta/2) and proceeds along the angle
# bisector of the main triangle vertex at the origin.
# The direction of this trajectory vector is e^(i*theta/2).
# The direction of the inner normal vector to the side A is -e^(i*theta/2).
# The angle between a vector and its negative is pi.

# Since alpha can be pi, the supremum M(theta) must be pi for any theta > 0.
# M(theta) = pi

# The limit is therefore the limit of a constant.
# lim_{theta -> 0} M(theta) = lim_{theta -> 0} pi = pi.

# The final equation is simply: limit = pi.
# We are asked to output the numbers in the final equation.
# In this case, the result is the constant pi.
