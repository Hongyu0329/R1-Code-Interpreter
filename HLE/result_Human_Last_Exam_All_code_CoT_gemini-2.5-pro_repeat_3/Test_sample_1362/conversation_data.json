    "The user wants to identify which of the given curves has \"good ordinary reduction above 2\".\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Terminology**:\n    *   A curve has **good reduction** at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a smooth (non-singular) curve. For a hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = P(x)`, where `P(x)` has integer coefficients, this means that the discriminant of `P(x)` is not divisible by `p` (for `p > 2`).\n    *   A curve has **ordinary reduction** at `p` if the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism on its Jacobian is not divisible by `p`. For `z^2 = P(x)` and `p > 2`, this is true if the coefficient of `x^((p-1)/2)` in the polynomial `P(x)^((p-1)/2)` is non-zero when calculated modulo `p`.\n    *   **\"Above 2\"**: This phrase can be interpreted in two ways:\n        *   Strictly: For all prime numbers `p > 2`. This would require the discriminant of `P(x)` to be `+/- 2^k` for some integer `k`. A quick check shows none of the options satisfy this very strong condition.\n        *   Practically (in a multiple-choice context): For the smallest prime `p > 2`, which is `p=3`. This interpretation allows for a unique answer among the choices.\n\n2.  **Adopt the Practical Interpretation**: I will test each curve for good ordinary reduction at `p=3`.\n    *   **Good Reduction at p=3**: The discriminant of `P(x)` must not be divisible by 3.\n    *   **Ordinary Reduction at p=3**: The coefficient of `x^((3-1)/2) = x^1` in `P(x)^((3-1)/2) = P(x)` must not be zero modulo 3. In simpler terms, the coefficient of the `x` term in `P(x)` must not be divisible by 3.\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to:\n    *   Define each polynomial `P(x)`.\n    *   Calculate the discriminant for each and check its divisibility by 3.\n    *   For those with good reduction, check the coefficient of the `x` term for divisibility by 3.\n    *   Identify the single curve that satisfies both conditions.\n    *   Print the final analysis and the numbers in the equation of the winning curve as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve_at_p3(label, poly_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a curve z^2 = P(x) for good ordinary reduction at p=3.\n    Returns True if the curve satisfies the conditions, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    try:\n        P = sympy.sympify(poly_str)\n        poly_obj = sympy.Poly(P, x)\n    except (sympy.SympifyError, TypeError):\n        print(f\"--- Could not parse polynomial for Curve {label} ---\")\n        return False\n\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Curve {label}: z^2 = {P} ---\")\n    \n    # 1.
