    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the rarest noble gas and its percentage.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will identify all the noble gases.\n2.  Next, I will research their respective abundances on Earth. The question specifies \"terrestrial matter,\" but the most consistent and standard measurements for noble gases are their concentrations in the atmosphere. I will use these values as a proxy.\n3.  I will determine which of these gases is the rarest. My research indicates that Radon (Rn) is significantly rarer than any other noble gas because it is radioactive and decays very quickly. The second rarest, and the rarest stable noble gas, is Xenon (Xe). The question asks for the \"rarest noble gas,\" which includes radioactive ones, so Radon is the correct answer.\n4.  Radon's approximate concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 part per 10^21. This value is generally stable in terms of its order of magnitude and would be representative for the year 2002.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to convert this fractional abundance into a percentage and print the full calculation as requested. The script will explicitly show how the percentage is derived from the fractional concentration.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn).\n# Its extreme rarity is due to it being radioactive with a short half-life.\n# Its concentration in the atmosphere is highly variable but is estimated to be\n# approximately 1 part in 10^21 (one sextillion). This is the best available\n# figure to represent its percentage in terrestrial matter.\n\ngas_name = \"Radon\"\n# Representing 1 part per 10^21 as a fraction\nconcentration_as_fraction_numerator = 1\nconcentration_as_fraction_denominator = 1e21\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100\npercentage = (concentration_as_fraction_numerator / concentration_as_fraction_denominator) * 100\n\nprint(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {gas_name}.\")\nprint(f\"Its approximate concentration in the atmosphere is {concentration_as_fraction_numerator} part per {concentration_as_fraction_denominator:.0e}.\")\nprint(\"To express this as a percentage, we perform the following calculation:\")\n\n# The final print statement shows the full equation as requested.\n# Using scientific notation for clarity.\nprint(f\"({concentration_as_fraction_numerator} / {concentration_as_fraction_denominator:.0e}) * 100 = {percentage:.1e}%\")\n\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
