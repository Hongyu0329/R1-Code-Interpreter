# The problem asks for the cardinality of a set of functions.
# Based on mathematical analysis, the set of continuous functions f(x)
# such that f(f(x)) = exp(x) can be divided into two cases:
# 1. f is strictly decreasing: The number of such functions is 0.
# 2. f is strictly increasing: The number of such functions is equal to
#    the cardinality of the continuum.
#
# The total cardinality is 0 + c = c.
#
# The cardinality of the continuum is the cardinality of the set of real numbers,
# denoted by the symbol 'c' (a Fraktur letter in mathematics) or |R| or 2^aleph_0.
# Since the result is a mathematical concept and not a numerical value that can be computed,
# this script will print the standard symbol 'c' to represent this cardinality.
