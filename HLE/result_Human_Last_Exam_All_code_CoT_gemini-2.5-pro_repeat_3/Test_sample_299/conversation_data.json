    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties of f:** I'll start by establishing that any continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ must be injective. Since it's also continuous, it must be strictly monotonic (either increasing or decreasing).\n\n2.  **Case 1: f is Strictly Decreasing:** I will prove that this case is impossible. My argument will show that the existence of such a function implies the existence of a real number $x_0$ such that $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. This equation has no real solutions, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the set of decreasing solutions is empty.\n\n3.  **Case 2: f is Strictly Increasing:** I will show that solutions in this class exist and determine their cardinality. I'll outline a method for constructing these functions. The construction depends on making two choices:\n    *   A real number $c \\in (0, 1)$.\n    *   An arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $h$ that maps the interval $[\\ln c, 0]$ onto $[0, c]$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Cardinality:** I'll argue that there are continuum-many choices for the number $c$ (the cardinality of the interval $(0,1)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$). For each such choice, the set of possible functions $h$ also has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. The total number of solutions is the product of these cardinalities, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion & Code:** The total cardinality of the set is the sum of the cardinalities from both cases, which is $0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$. The final answer is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum. I will provide a Python script to print a symbol representing this cardinality.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the cardinality of a set of functions.\n# Based on mathematical analysis, the set of continuous functions f(x)\n# such that f(f(x)) = exp(x) can be divided into two cases:\n# 1. f is strictly decreasing: The number of such functions is 0.\n# 2. f is strictly increasing: The number of such functions is equal to\n#    the cardinality of the continuum.\n#\n# The total cardinality is 0 + c = c.\n#\n# The cardinality of the continuum is the cardinality of the set of real numbers,\n# denoted by the symbol 'c' (a Fraktur letter in mathematics) or |R| or 2^aleph_0.\n# Since the result is a mathematical concept and not a numerical value that can be computed,\n# this script will print the standard symbol 'c' to represent this cardinality.\n\nprint('c')\n```\n<<<c>>>"
