def solve_dimension_problem():

    Calculates the largest possible dimension for the quotient ring R/I.

    The dimension of the coinvariant ring R/I is equal to the order of the
    group effectively acting on the space, which is |rho(G)|, where rho is
    the representation.

    By the First Isomorphism Theorem, |rho(G)| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.

    To maximize this dimension, we need to choose a group G and a representation
    rho that minimizes the size of the kernel, |ker(rho)|. The smallest
    possible size for a subgroup is 1 (the trivial subgroup). This occurs
    when the representation is faithful.

    A faithful 10-dimensional representation exists for groups of order 10000
    (e.g., the cyclic group C_10000). Thus, the maximum dimension is achievable.
