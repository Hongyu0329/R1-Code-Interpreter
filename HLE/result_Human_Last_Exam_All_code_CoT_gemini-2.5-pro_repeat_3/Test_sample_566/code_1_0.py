    print("### Step-by-Step Analysis of Broadband CARS Microscopy ###\n")

    print("Step 1: Understand the basic CARS process.")
    print("Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a technique used to probe molecular vibrations.")
    print("It uses input laser beams (Pump and Stokes) to excite a vibration. A Probe beam then interacts with this excitation to generate an output signal.\n")

    print("Step 2: Examine the CARS signal equation.")
    print("The energy (and frequency) of the generated signal is key. The process is as follows:")
    print("  - A pump photon (ω_p) and a Stokes photon (ω_s) excite a molecular vibration (Ω).")
    print("  - The vibrational frequency excited is Ω = ω_p - ω_s.")
    print("  - A probe photon (ω_pr) scatters off this excited vibration.")
    print("  - This creates a new, higher-energy 'anti-Stokes' photon (ω_as).\n")
    
    print("The final equation for the output signal's frequency is:")
    # The following lines print the terms of the equation as requested by the prompt.
    print("  ω_as (anti-Stokes) = ω_pr (probe) + (ω_p (pump) - ω_s (stokes))")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyze the effect of a 'broadband pump beam'.")
    print("'Broadband' means the beam consists of a wide range of frequencies, not just a single one.")
    print("In this scenario, the pump frequency ω_p is a continuum (a range of values).")
    print("Therefore, the difference frequency (Ω = ω_p - ω_s) will also be a continuum.")
    print("This means that a whole range of molecular vibrations are excited simultaneously.\n")

    print("Step 4: Determine the nature of the anti-Stokes signal.")
    print("Since a range of vibrations (Ω) is excited, the resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as = ω_pr + Ω) will also be a broadband continuum.")
    print("This broadband signal is not just a blur; it is a spectrum. It can be sent to a spectrometer to be analyzed.")
    print("Each frequency component within the anti-Stokes signal directly corresponds to a specific molecular vibration that was excited in the sample.\n")

    print("Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on this conclusion.")
    print("  A. You can only generate a Stokes beam -> Incorrect. The signal of interest is the anti-Stokes beam.")
    print("  B. You can generate an anti Stokes beam, but it doesn't contain separate vibrational information -> Incorrect. The purpose of broadband CARS is to capture this very information across a spectrum.")
    print("  C. You can generate a anti Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information -> Correct. The broadband anti-Stokes signal is a spectrum where different frequencies correspond to different vibrations, which can be distinguished by a spectrometer.")
    print("  D. None of the above -> Incorrect.")
    print("  E. You cannot generate an anti Stokes beam -> Incorrect. The process inherently generates an anti-Stokes beam.")
    print("\n-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: Broadband CARS generates a broadband anti-Stokes signal that contains a spectrum of distinguishable vibrational information.")
