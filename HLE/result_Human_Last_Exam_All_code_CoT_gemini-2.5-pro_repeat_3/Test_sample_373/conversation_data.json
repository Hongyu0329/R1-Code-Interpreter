    "My plan is to calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** A 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K₅) connected by a single \"bottleneck\" edge.\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:**\n    *   Most nodes (8 of them) are only connected to other nodes within their own K₅ clique, so their degree is `5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   The two nodes at either end of the bottleneck edge are connected to 4 nodes in their own clique *and* one node across the bridge. Their degree is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n3.  **Analyze the Gossiping Process:** The process involves two steps:\n    *   Step A: Select a node `u` uniformly at random from all 10 nodes (probability `1/10`).\n    *   Step B: Select a neighbor `v` of `u` uniformly at random from its `deg(u)` neighbors (probability `1/deg(u)`).\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   By picking the first bottleneck node (let's call it `u_b`) and then its neighbor across the bridge (`v_b`). The probability for this is `P(picking u_b) * P(picking v_b | u_b) = (1/10) * (1/deg(u_b)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   By picking the second bottleneck node (`v_b`) and then its neighbor across the bridge (`u_b`). The probability is `P(picking v_b) * P(picking u_b | v_b) = (1/10) * (1/deg(v_b)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n5.  **Sum the Probabilities:** The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive events: `1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n6.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this calculation, print the step-by-step logic with the values, and output the final numerical result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_barbell_gossip_prob():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes under uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    n = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with n nodes is formed by two complete graphs (cliques)\n    # connected by a single edge (the bottleneck).\n    # Each clique has m = n / 2 nodes.\n    m = n / 2\n\n    # In a complete graph K_m, each node has a degree of m-1.\n    # The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge have one additional connection.\n    # Therefore, their degree is (m - 1) + 1 = m.\n    deg_bottleneck_node = m\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"1.
