# The quantum group is u_q(sl_2) with q being a primitive third root of unity.
# The representation theory for this group depends on the integer l,
# which is the order of q^2. Since q is a primitive 3rd root of unity, l = 3.

# Number of irreducible representations:
# For a given l, there are exactly l non-isomorphic irreducible representations.
num_irreducible = 3

# Total number of indecomposable representations:
# The category of indecomposable representations contains:
# 1. The l=3 irreducible representations.
# 2. The l-1=2 projective indecomposable representations that are not irreducible.
# 3. Two infinite families of representations parameterized by non-zero complex numbers.
# The presence of these infinite families means the total count of
# non-isomorphic indecomposable representations is infinite.
# We represent infinity for the purpose of explaining the calculation.
total_indecomposable = float('inf')
total_indecomposable_str = "infinity"

# Calculate the percentage.
# A finite number divided by infinity is 0.
percentage = (num_irreducible / total_indecomposable) * 100
