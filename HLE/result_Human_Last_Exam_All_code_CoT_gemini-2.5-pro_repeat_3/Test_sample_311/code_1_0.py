    # Compound 11 has 2 oxygens. After protection and ozonolysis, one fragment (aldehyde 12)
    # contains one of these original oxygens within a TESO- group.
    # This TESO- group, with its oxygen atom, is preserved through the reaction sequence to compound 14.

    # Compound 7 is then made from compound 10, retaining that nitrogen atom (contains 1 N).
