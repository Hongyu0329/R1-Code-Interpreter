    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Subgroups to Homomorphisms**: The number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ is related to the number of homomorphisms from $G$ into the symmetric group $S_n$. Specifically, each subgroup $H$ of index 4 corresponds to a transitive action of $G$ on the 4 cosets of $H$, which is defined by a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_4$ whose image is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The number of subgroups is the sum of contributions from each possible transitive image.\n\n2.  **Identify Properties of the Grigorchuk Group ($G$)**:\n    *   **Finite Quotients**: All finite quotient groups of the Grigorchuk group are finite 2-groups (their order is a power of 2). This means the image of any homomorphism from $G$ to a finite group must be a 2-group.\n    *   **Abelianization**: The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, $G_{ab} = G/G'$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group must factor through this group.\n\n3.  **Constrain Possible Transitive Images in $S_4$**:\n    The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $C_4$ (cyclic), $V_4$ (Klein four-group), $D_4$ (dihedral of order 8), $A_4$ (alternating), and $S_4$.\n    *   $A_4$ (order 12) and $S_4$ (order 24) are not 2-groups, so they cannot be quotients of $G$.\n    *   $C_4$ has an abelianization of $C_4$. There is no surjective homomorphism from $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to $C_4$, so $C_4$ cannot be a quotient of $G$.\n    *   This leaves two possibilities for the transitive image: $V_4$ and $D_4$. Both are 2-groups.\n\n4.  **Calculate Contributions from $V_4$ and $D_4$**:\n    The number of subgroups corresponding to a transitive image $T$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ N_T = \\frac{|\\text{Epi}(G, T)|}{|\\text{Aut}(T)|} $$\n    where $|\\text{Epi}(G, T)|$ is the number of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $T$, and $|\\text{Aut}(T)|$ is the size of the automorphism group of $T$.\n\n    *   **For $T=V_4$**: Since $V_4$ is abelian, $|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)| = |\\text{Epi}(G_{ab}, V_4)|$. We can calculate this by counting surjective linear maps from $\\mathbb{F}_2^3$ to $\\mathbb{F}_2^2$. We also calculate $|\\text{Aut}(V_4)| = |GL(2, \\mathbb{F}_2)|$.\n    *   **For $T=D_4$**: The number of epimorphisms $|\\text{Epi}(G, D_4)|$ is more complex to compute from first principles but is a known result in the literature on the Grigorchuk group. We will use this known value. We also calculate $|\\text{Aut}(D_4)|$.\n\n5.  **Sum the Contributions**: The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers of subgroups of type $V_4$ and $D_4$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_num_subgroups_index_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of contributions\n    # from subgroups whose quotient group G/core(H) is isomorphic to V4 or D4.\n\n    # Part 1: Contribution from V4 (Klein four-group)\n    # Number of subgroups = |Epi(G, V4)| / |Aut(V4)|\n    \n    # We calculate |Epi(G, V4)|, which equals |Epi(G_ab, V4)| since V4 is abelian.\n    # G_ab is (Z/2Z)^3, V4 is (Z/2Z)^2.
