    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will follow the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This protocol introduces quantum effects, such as entanglement and superposition, into the classical game, which can lead to new, more favorable equilibrium outcomes.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Game:** We start with the given payoff matrix. For player 1 (Alice), the payoffs are: Cooperate-Cooperate (CC) = 5, Cooperate-Defect (CD) = 0, Defect-Cooperate (DC) = 7, and Defect-Defect (DD) = 1.\n2.  **Introduce Entanglement:** The key to the quantum version is to have the players' initial states entangled. We use an entangling operator `J` on the initial state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>`. For an optimal outcome that resolves the dilemma, we will assume maximal entanglement (`gamma = pi/2`). The initial state becomes `|ψ_initial> = (1/√2) * (|CC> + i|DD>)`.\n3.  **Define Quantum Strategies:** Players' strategies are now quantum operations (unitary matrices). Besides the classical strategies `Cooperate` (Identity matrix) and `Defect` (Pauli-X matrix), a new \"quantum\" strategy `Q` is available. The optimal quantum strategy, which forms a new equilibrium, is `Q = (i/√2) * H`, where H is the Hadamard matrix.\n4.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Outcome:** We will analyze the case where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. The final state of the system will be `|ψ_final> = (Q ⊗ Q)|ψ_initial>`.\n5.  **Determine Payoffs:** From the final state, we will calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD). The expected payoff for a player is then the sum of each outcome's payoff multiplied by its probability. This resulting payoff is the equilibrium point we are looking for.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the payoff at the quantum equilibrium.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol with maximal entanglement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
