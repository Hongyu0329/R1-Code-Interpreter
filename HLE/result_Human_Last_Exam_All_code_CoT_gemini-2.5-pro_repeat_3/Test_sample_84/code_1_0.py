    # both an upper and a lower bound for the degree d_n.

    # 1. Upper Bound: We constructed a polynomial of degree O(n^5) that satisfies
    #    the given conditions. This implies d_n <= C1 * n^5 for some constant C1.

    # 2. Lower Bound: We showed that any polynomial satisfying the conditions must
    #    have a degree of at least Omega(n^5). This implies d_n >= C2 * n^5 for
    #    some constant C2.

    # Combining these two bounds gives d_n = Theta(n^5).
