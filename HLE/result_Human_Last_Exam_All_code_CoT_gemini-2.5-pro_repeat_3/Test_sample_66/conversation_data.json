    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the flag:** The flag of Tonga is composed of a large red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. Inside this white canton, there is a red cross.\n2.  **Model the flag as a matrix:** We'll represent the flag as a matrix where red pixels have a value `a` and white pixels have a value `b`.\n3.  **Identify the types of rows:** Based on the flag's design, any row of this matrix must pass through a specific combination of colored regions. We can analyze the structure of these rows.\n    *   A row can be entirely within the red field (either the main part or the horizontal bar of the cross). All such rows will consist of only the value `a`.\n    *   A row can pass through the white part of the canton. Such a row will have `b`'s where it crosses the white background and `a`'s where it crosses the vertical bar of the red cross and the main red field to the right.\n4.  **Determine the basis for the row space:** We will see that regardless of the matrix's dimensions (i.e., the image resolution), there are only two distinct types of row vectors. The set of all rows in the matrix is a collection of these two vector types. The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows, which cannot be greater than the number of distinct row types, i.e., 2.\n5.  **Find the condition for maximal rank:** The rank will be 2 if and only if these two row vectors are linearly independent. We can achieve this by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b` (for example, `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`). If `a=b` or `a=0`, the vectors become linearly dependent, and the rank is 1. If `a=b=0`, the rank is 0.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since we can choose `a` and `b`, we can choose them to make the rank 2. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this reasoning. The script will define the two fundamental row vectors and compute the rank of the matrix formed by them, demonstrating that the maximal rank is 2.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the Tongan flag.\n\n    The flag's matrix has two types of pixels: red (value 'a') and white (value 'b').\n    The analysis reveals that no matter the resolution of the image, the resulting\n    matrix will only contain two distinct types of rows.\n\n    1. Row Type 1 (All Red): A row that passes through the main red field or the\n       horizontal bar of the red cross. It consists entirely of the value 'a'.\n       Example: [a, a, a, a, ...]\n\n    2. Row Type 2 (Mixed): A row that passes through the white background of the\n       canton. It will contain 'b's for the white parts and 'a's for the red\n       parts (the vertical bar of the cross and the main field).\n       Example: [b, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, ...]\n\n    The rank of the entire matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by these two\n    row vectors. The rank is maximized when these two vectors are linearly independent.\n    We can choose values for 'a' and 'b' to ensure this. For example, setting\n    a=1 and b=2 makes them independent.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let's choose values for a and b that ensure linear independence.\n    # a != b and a != 0\n    a = 1  # Value for red pixels\n    b = 2  # Value for white pixels\n\n    # Let's define the structure of the two row types using arbitrary (but valid)\n    # dimensions. The exact dimensions do not change the number of unique row types.\n    # A row is conceptually split into 4 parts:\n    # 1. Left white part of canton\n    # 2. Vertical red bar of the cross\n    # 3. Right white part of canton\n    # 4. Main red field to the right of the canton\n    len_part1 = 10\n    len_part2 = 5\n    len_part3 = 10\n    len_part4 = 50\n\n    # Construct the 'All Red' row vector.\n    row_type_1 = [a] * (len_part1 + len_part2 + len_part3 + len_part4)\n\n    # Construct the 'Mixed' row vector.\n    row_type_2 = [b] * len_part1 + [a] * len_part2 + [b] * len_part3 + [a] * len_part4\n\n    # The row space of the flag matrix is spanned by these two vectors.\n    # The maximal rank is the number of linearly independent vectors in this spanning set.\n    # We form a matrix from these basis vectors and find its rank.\n    row_space_basis = np.array([row_type_1, row_type_2])\n\n    # Calculate the rank using numpy.\n    maximal_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(row_space_basis)\n\n    print(\"The maximal possible rank of the matrix is determined by the number of unique, linearly independent rows it can contain.\")\n    print(\"For the flag of Tonga, there are two such row types.\")\n    print(f\"By choosing a={a} and b={b}, we ensure these rows are linearly independent.\")\n    print(\"The maximal possible rank is:\")\n    print(maximal_rank)\n\nsolve_flag_rank()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
