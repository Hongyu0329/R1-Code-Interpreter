def solve_flag_rank():
    """
    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the Tongan flag.

    The flag's matrix has two types of pixels: red (value 'a') and white (value 'b').
    The analysis reveals that no matter the resolution of the image, the resulting
    matrix will only contain two distinct types of rows.

    1. Row Type 1 (All Red): A row that passes through the main red field or the
       horizontal bar of the red cross. It consists entirely of the value 'a'.
       Example: [a, a, a, a, ...]

    2. Row Type 2 (Mixed): A row that passes through the white background of the
       canton. It will contain 'b's for the white parts and 'a's for the red
       parts (the vertical bar of the cross and the main field).
       Example: [b, b, a, a, b, b, a, a, ...]

    The rank of the entire matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by these two
    row vectors. The rank is maximized when these two vectors are linearly independent.
    We can choose values for 'a' and 'b' to ensure this. For example, setting
    a=1 and b=2 makes them independent.
