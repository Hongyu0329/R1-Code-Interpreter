    "To answer this question, I will look up the specific anatomical details of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* from paleontological research papers. The key source for this dinosaur's cranial anatomy is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott.\n\nBased on their detailed description of the holotype skull (SMNS 58022), the lacrimal recess is a depression that is itself subdivided by a ridge. This subdivision creates a smaller dorsal fossa and a larger ventral fossa. Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two distinct depressions.\n\nI will write a Python script to present this finding. The script will assign the number of dorsal and ventral fossae to variables and then add them to find the total number of depressions.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n# According to the scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), the lacrimal recess\n# is subdivided by a ridge into two smaller fossae (depressions).\n\n# Number of depressions in the dorsal (upper) part of the recess.\ndorsal_fossa = 1\n\n# Number of depressions in the ventral (lower) part of the recess.\nventral_fossa = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = dorsal_fossa + ventral_fossa\n\nprint(\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains a dorsal fossa and a ventral fossa.\")\nprint(f\"This results in a total number of depressions calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{dorsal_fossa} + {ventral_fossa} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
