    print("\n- Option C (Duloxetine) and B (Gabapentin):")
    print("  Duloxetine is a first-line SNRI for fibromyalgia, treating pain and mood. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant excellent for neuropathic pain, sleep issues, and restless leg syndrome. While both are good as single agents, the patient has severe symptoms in all these areas, suggesting a combination therapy might be superior.")

    print("\n- Option D (Cyclobenzaprine):")
    print("  This is a muscle relaxant, primarily used as a sleep aid in fibromyalgia. It does not adequately address the core issues of daytime pain, mood, or anxiety. It is an adjunctive therapy, not a primary one.")

    print("\n- Option E (Duloxetine + Acetaminophen):")
    print("  Acetaminophen is generally not effective for the central pain mechanism of fibromyalgia. This combination offers little to no advantage over Duloxetine alone.")

    print("\n- Option F (Duloxetine + Cyclobenzaprine):")
    print("  This combination addresses pain, mood, and sleep. However, Gabapentin is more effective than Cyclobenzaprine for the patient's specific complaints of paresthesia and restless leg syndrome.")

    print("\n- Option A (Duloxetine + Gabapentin):")
    print("  This is the most comprehensive option. Duloxetine targets the pain, depression, and anxiety. Gabapentin targets the neuropathic pain, paresthesia, restless leg syndrome, and also helps improve sleep. This dual-mechanism approach provides the broadest and most effective coverage for this patient's specific set of debilitating symptoms.")
