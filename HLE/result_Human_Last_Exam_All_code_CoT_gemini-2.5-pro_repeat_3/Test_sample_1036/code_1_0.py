    This function explains the reasoning behind the solution.
    The problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
    such that n gives different remainders when divided by each of k = 2, 3, ..., 100.

    Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100).
    Let r_k = n mod k.
    The condition is that r_2, r_3, ..., r_{100} are all distinct.

    If d divides k, then n = qk + r_k for some integer q.
    So, n mod d = (qk + r_k) mod d = r_k mod d.
    But n mod d is also r_d.
    So, r_d = r_k mod d for any d that divides k.

    Since all remainders are distinct, if d is a proper divisor of k (d < k), then r_d != r_k.
    From r_d = r_k mod d and r_d != r_k, it must be that r_k = qd + r_d with q >= 1.
    This implies r_k >= d.

    Let's consider two cases based on the parity of the remainders for even moduli.
    For any even number k > 2, 2 is a proper divisor.
    So, r_k must be congruent to r_2 modulo 2.
    This means all r_k for k in {2, 4, 6, ..., 100} have the same parity.

    Case 1: r_2, r_4, ... are all even.
    r_2 < 2 and is even => r_2 = 0.
    r_4 < 4, is even, and != r_2 => r_4 = 2.
    r_6 < 6, is even, and != r_2, r_4 => r_6 = 4.
    By induction, r_{2m} = 2m - 2 for m = 1, ..., 50.
    For an odd k, r_k must be odd.
    For any odd prime p, r_p = r_{2p} mod p = (2p - 2) mod p = p - 2.
    This can be generalized to show r_k = k - 2 for all k from 2 to 100.
    This corresponds to n = -2 (mod k) for all k.
    So n+2 is a multiple of lcm(2, ..., 100) = L.
    n + 2 = c * L. For positive n <= L, c=1, so n = L - 2.

    Case 2: r_2, r_4, ... are all odd.
    r_2 < 2 and is odd => r_2 = 1.
    r_4 < 4, is odd, and != r_2 => r_4 = 3.
    By induction, r_{2m} = 2m - 1 for m = 1, ..., 50.
    For an odd k, r_k must be even.
    For any odd prime p, r_p = r_{2p} mod p = (2p - 1) mod p = p - 1.
    This can be generalized to show r_k = k - 1 for all k from 2 to 100.
    This corresponds to n = -1 (mod k) for all k.
    So n+1 is a multiple of L.
    n + 1 = c * L. For positive n <= L, c=1, so n = L - 1.

    There are two such integers: L-2 and L-1.
    The number of such integers is 2.
