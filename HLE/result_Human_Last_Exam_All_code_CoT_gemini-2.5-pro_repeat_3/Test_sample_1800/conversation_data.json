    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis is not something that can be calculated from first principles with a simple script. It is determined through extensive experimental research reported in scientific literature. My plan is to:\n1.  Access my knowledge base of scientific studies on Ni-Ceria catalysts for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions.\n2.  Identify the consensus on the optimal atomic or molar ratio that maximizes catalytic activity. This typically involves balancing the number of active Ni sites with the promotional effect of the Ceria support (e.g., creating oxygen vacancies) and preventing the deactivation of the catalyst through Ni particle growth (sintering).\n3.  Write a Python script that presents this experimentally-determined ideal ratio. The script will define the parts of the ratio as variables and then use `print` statements to explain and display the result, fulfilling your request to show each number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic applications\n    based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to extensive research, a relatively low Ni content is optimal.\n    # This maximizes the active interface between Ni and Ceria (the Ni-O-Ce sites)\n    # and prevents the sintering (agglomeration) of Ni particles at high temperatures,\n    # which would deactivate the catalyst.\n    # The ideal ratio is often expressed as a molar ratio.\n\n    ni_molar_part = 1\n    ce_molar_part = 9\n\n    # The task requires printing each number in the final \"equation\" or result.\n    print(\"--- Determining Optimal Ni/Ce Molar Ratio ---\")\n    print(f\"Component 1: Nickel (Ni) molar part = {ni_molar_part}\")\n    print(f\"Component 2: Cerium (Ce) molar part = {ce_molar_part}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n    # Print the final conclusion based on these values.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The ideal molar ratio of Ni to Ce to maximize catalytic performance for\")\n    print(f\"the Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting reactions is approximately {ni_molar_part}:{ce_molar_part}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis ratio (corresponding to ~10 at% Ni) creates a high population of active sites at the Ni-Ceria interface while maintaining excellent thermal stability.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the ratio.\nfind_ideal_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<A Ni:Ce molar ratio of approximately 1:9 is considered ideal for maximizing catalytic performance.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Ni-Ceria nanoparticles have shown promising catalytic properties for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS).
