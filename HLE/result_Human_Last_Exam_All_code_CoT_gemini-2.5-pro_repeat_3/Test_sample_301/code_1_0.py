    # 2. Malonyl-CoA -k3-> Acetyl-CoA
    # 3. Acetyl-CoA -k4-> Pyruvate

    # The relationship is built by chaining the proportionalities.
    # [F] is proportional to [Pyruvate] and k5.

    # [Acetyl-CoA] is proportional to [Malonyl-CoA] and k3.
    # [Malonyl-CoA] is proportional to [B] and k2.
