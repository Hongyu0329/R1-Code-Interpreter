def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function explains and calculates the smallest cardinality of a family of
    topological spaces, F, such that every infinite topological space has a
    subspace homeomorphic to some element of F.

    The cardinality of the natural numbers is aleph_0.
    The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^aleph_0.

    The argument proceeds in two parts:
    1. Upper Bound: The family of all homeomorphism types of spaces on a
       countable set works. Any infinite space contains a countably infinite
       subspace. The number of such types is 2^c.
    2. Lower Bound: There exists a family of 2^c spaces such that no subspace
       of one is homeomorphic to a subspace of another. This forces F to have
       at least 2^c elements.

    Therefore, the smallest cardinality is 2^c.
