    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Data Collection:** I will first compile a list of rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n2.  **Length Association:** I will then find the approximate modern length of each of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  **Sorting and Selection:** Using a Python script, I will store this data, sort the rivers by length in descending order, and select the top three.\n4.  **Output:** The script will then print the names and lengths of these three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples: (Name in Aeneid, Modern Name, Length in km)\n    # Sources for mentions include various translations and analyses of the Aeneid.\n    # Lengths are approximate and from encyclopedic sources.\n    rivers = [\n        (\"Nilus\", \"Nile\", 6650),\n        (\"Danuvius/Ister\", \"Danube\", 2850),\n        (\"Euphrates\", \"Euphrates\", 2800),\n        (\"Ganges\", \"Ganges\", 2525),\n        (\"Tigris\", \"Tigris\", 1900),\n        (\"Tanais\", \"Don\", 1870),\n        (\"Rhenus\", \"Rhine\", 1233),\n        (\"Eridanus\", \"Po\", 652),\n        (\"Hebrus\", \"Maritsa\", 480),\n        (\"Tiberis\", \"Tiber\", 406),\n        (\"Xanthus\", \"Scamander\", 100), # Very approximate, small river near Troy\n        (\"Simois\", \"Simois\", 5.5)      # Very short tributary of Xanthus\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The key for sorting is the third element of each tuple (length).\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers, key=lambda river: river[2], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, river in enumerate(top_three):\n        name_aeneid, name_modern, length = river\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {name_modern} (mentioned as '{name_aeneid}')\")\n        print(f\"   Length: {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
