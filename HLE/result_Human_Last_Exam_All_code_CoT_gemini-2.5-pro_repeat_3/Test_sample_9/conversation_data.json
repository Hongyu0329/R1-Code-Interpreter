    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**1. Identify the Space X**\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n*   A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be defined by a basis of two linearly independent vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which can be taken as the columns of an invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area restricts $M$ to the set $\\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(M)|=1\\}$.\n*   Two matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis, which must be an integer matrix with determinant $\\pm 1$. That is, $M_2 = M_1 G$ for some $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Therefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space $X = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(M)|=1 \\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This space is homeomorphic to $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. To see this, note that for any matrix $M$ with $\\det(M)=-1$, we can choose $G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Then $M' = MG$ has $\\det(M') = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $M'$ is in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This means every equivalence class in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The equivalence relation on these representatives is then given by matrices in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**2. Use the Serre Spectral Sequence**\n\nWe need to compute the homology of the quotient space $X = Y/\\Gamma$, where $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the action of $\\Gamma$ on $Y$ is proper, the homology of the quotient can be computed using the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $Y \\to Y_{h\\Gamma} \\to B\\Gamma$, where $Y_{h\\Gamma}$ is the homotopy quotient, which is homotopy equivalent to $X$. The $E^2$ page of this spectral sequence is given by:\n$E^2_{p,q} = H_p(\\Gamma, H_q(Y, \\mathbb{Z})) \\implies H_{p+q}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**3. Compute the Ingredients**\n\n*   **Homology of Y = SL(2, R):** The special linear group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to the circle $S^1$. Therefore, its homology groups are $H_0(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_q(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $q > 1$.\n*   **Action of Γ on H_q(Y, Z):** The group $\\Gamma=SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts on $Y=SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ by right multiplication. For any $g \\in \\Gamma$, the map $R_g: y \\mapsto yg$ is homotopic to the identity map because $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is path-connected. Consequently, the induced action on all homology groups $H_q(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial.\n*   **Homology of Γ = SL(2, Z):** We need the first and second homology groups of $\\Gamma$ with trivial integer coefficients. These are well-known results:\n    *   $H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\Gamma_{ab}$, the abelianization of $\\Gamma$. This group is the cyclic group of order 12, i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   $H_2(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the cyclic group of order 2, i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Spectral Sequence**\n\nWith the trivial action, the $E^2$ page is $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H_q(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nSince $H_q(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is zero for $q > 1$, the spectral sequence has only two non-zero rows ($q=0$ and $q=1$).\n*   $E^2_{p,0} = H_p(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$\n*   $E^2_{p,1} = H_p(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is determined by a filtration $0 \\subset F_1 \\subset H_1(X)$, where:\n*   $F_1 \\cong E^{\\infty}_{1,0}$\n*   $H_1(X)/F_1 \\cong E^{\\infty}_{0,1}$\n\nLet's compute these $E^\\infty$ terms:\n*   $E^{\\infty}_{1,0}$: The term $E^2_{1,0} = H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The differentials mapping to or from this term are zero for dimensional reasons. Thus, $E^{\\infty}_{1,0} = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n*   $E^{\\infty}_{0,1}$: This term is affected by the differential $d_2: E^2_{2,0} \\to E^2_{0,1}$.\n    *   $E^2_{2,0} = H_2(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   $E^2_{0,1} = H_0(\\Gamma, H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})) = H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $d_2: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ must be the zero map, as there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from a finite group to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Therefore, $E^3_{0,1} = E^2_{0,1} / \\text{Im}(d_2) = \\mathbb{Z}/0 = \\mathbb{Z}$. Since there are no further differentials, $E^{\\infty}_{0,1} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**5. Conclude the Calculation**\n\nThe filtration gives rise to the following short exact sequence of abelian groups:\n$0 \\to E^{\\infty}_{1,0} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to E^{\\infty}_{0,1} \\to 0$\nSubstituting the computed terms:\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\n\nThis sequence describes $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ as an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. In the category of abelian groups, an extension of $A$ by a free (or projective) group $B$ always splits. Since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group, the sequence splits.\n\nThis means that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the other two groups in the sequence.\n\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$\n\nThis group has a free part of rank 1 and a torsion part of order 12.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the computation of H_1(X, Z), where X is the\n    moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The homology group H_1(X, Z) is a finitely generated abelian group,\n    # which can be decomposed into a direct sum of a free part and a torsion part.\n    # H_1(X, Z) = Z^r \\oplus T\n    # From the mathematical derivation, we found the rank r and the torsion group T.\n    \n    # Free part: Z^r\n    rank = 1\n    \n    # Torsion part: A direct sum of cyclic groups.\n    # In this case, it's a single cyclic group Z_n.\n    torsion_order = 12\n    \n    # The final equation for the group is H_1(X, Z) = Z \\oplus Z_12.\n    # We print the numbers involved in this equation.\n    \n    print(\"The first homology group H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to the direct sum Z \\u2295 Z_12.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of the free part is: {rank}\")\n    print(f\"The order of the torsion part (a cyclic group) is: {torsion_order}\")\n    print(\"\\nSo the final equation can be written as:\")\n    print(f\"H_1(X, Z) \\u2245 Z^{rank} \\u2295 Z_{torsion_order}\".format(rank=rank, torsion_order=torsion_order))\n\n\nsolve_homology()\n```\n<<<H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}>>>"
