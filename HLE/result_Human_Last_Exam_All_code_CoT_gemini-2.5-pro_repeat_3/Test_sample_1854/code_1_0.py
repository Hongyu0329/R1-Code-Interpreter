def solve_for_c():
    """
    Solves for the exponent c using symbolic mathematics.

    The problem is to find the smallest c for the inequality:
    ||fourier_transform(f d_sigma_X)||_L2(d_sigma_Y) <= C * R^c * ||f||_L2(d_sigma_X).

    By the T*T method, the square of the operator norm is bounded by the norm of an
    integral operator with kernel K(x, z) = fourier_transform(d_sigma_Y)(x-z).
    A key tool is Schur's test, which bounds the norm by sup_x integral |K(x, z)| dz.

    The decay of the Fourier transform of a measure on a curve with curvature kappa
    is |fourier_transform(d_sigma_Y)(xi)| ~ (kappa * |xi|)^(-1/2).

    We model the worst-case curves X and Y as long (length L ~ R), flat parabolas
    with the smallest possible curvature (kappa ~ 1/R^2).

    This leads to estimating an integral of the form:
    Integral( (kappa * |x-z|)^(-1/2) ) dz over a domain of length R.
