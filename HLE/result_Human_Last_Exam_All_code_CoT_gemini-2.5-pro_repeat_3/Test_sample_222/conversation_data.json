    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for an 8-point sequence `y(n) = {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`. The inputs are the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n2.  **Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\":** Taking an N-point DFT of an M-point sequence (where N < M) usually implies time-domain aliasing. The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is folded and summed into a 4-point sequence `y_alias(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`. We then compute the 4-point DFT of `y_alias(n)`.\n3.  **Use DFT Properties:** A key property of the DFT states that the DFT of the time-aliased sequence `y_alias(n)` is equivalent to sampling the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. Let `Y_8(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The desired 4-point DFT, let's call it `Y_4(k)`, is given by `Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)`.\n4.  **Relate `Y_8(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`:** The 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed using the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. This is a fundamental concept in FFT algorithms (specifically, the decimation-in-time radix-2 FFT in reverse). The formula is:\n    `Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_8 = exp(-j*2*pi/8)` is the twiddle factor.\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will combine the formulas from steps 3 and 4 to calculate `Y_4(k)` for k=0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `Y_4(0) = Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    *   `Y_4(1) = Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Y_4(2) = Y_8(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0)`\n    *   `Y_4(3) = Y_8(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2)`\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to perform these calculations and print out each step as requested, showing the values used in the final equations.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Suppose that X(k), H(k) are 4-point DFT for 4-point sequences x(n), h(n), respectively.\n# X(k)= [1, j, -1, -j].\n# H(k)=[0,1+j,1,1-j].\n# Find 4-point DFT for sequence {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}\n\n# --- Input Data ---\n# Given 4-point DFTs\nX = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\nH = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n# --- Theory ---\n# The new 8-point sequence is y(n) = {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}.\n# The 4-point DFT of y(n), let's call it Y_4(k), is found by sampling the 8-point DFT of y(n), Y_8(k).\n# The relation is: Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n# The 8-point DFT Y_8(k) can be expressed in terms of X(k) and H(k) as:\n# Y_8(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4), where W_8 = exp(-2j*pi/8).\n\n# We need to compute:\n# Y_4(0) = Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)\n# Y_4(1) = Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)\n# Y_4(2) = Y_8(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0)\n# Y_4(3) = Y_8(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2)\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# Calculate the required twiddle factors W_8^n\nW_8_0 = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * 0 / 8)  # Equals 1\nW_8_2 = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * 2 / 8)  # Equals -j\nW_8_4 = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * 4 / 8)  # Equals -1\nW_8_6 = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * 6 / 8)  # Equals j\n\n# Calculate the 4 points of the resulting DFT, Y_4(k)\nY4_0 = X[0] + W_8_0 * H[0]\nY4_1 = X[2] + W_8_2 * H[2]\nY4_2 = X[0] + W_8_4 * H[0]\nY4_3 = X[2] + W_8_6 * H[2]\n\nY4 = np.array([Y4_0, Y4_1, Y4_2, Y4_3])\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(\"Calculating the 4-point DFT, Y_4(k):\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Y_4(0) = X(0) + (W_8^0) * H(0)\")\nprint(f\"       = {X[0]} + ({np.round(W_8_0, 4)}) * ({H[0]})\")\nprint(f\"       = {np.round(Y4_0, 4)}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Y_4(1) = X(2) + (W_8^2) * H(2)\")\nprint(f\"       = ({X[2]}) + ({np.round(W_8_2, 4)}) * ({H[2]})\")\nprint(f\"       = {np.round(Y4_1, 4)}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Y_4(2) = X(0) + (W_8^4) * H(0)\")\nprint(f\"       = {X[0]} + ({np.round(W_8_4, 4)}) * ({H[0]})\")\nprint(f\"       = {np.round(Y4_2, 4)}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Y_4(3) = X(2) + (W_8^6) * H(2)\")\nprint(f\"       = ({X[2]}) + ({np.round(W_8_6, 4)}) * ({H[2]})\")\nprint(f\"       = {np.round(Y4_3, 4)}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"The final 4-point DFT is:\")\n# Use a custom formatting to avoid parentheses for simple numbers\nformatted_result = [f\"{v.real if v.imag == 0 else v}\" for v in np.round(Y4, 4)]\nprint(f\"[{', '.join(formatted_result)}]\")\n\n```\n<<<[1.0, (-1-1j), 1.0, (-1+1j)]>>>"
