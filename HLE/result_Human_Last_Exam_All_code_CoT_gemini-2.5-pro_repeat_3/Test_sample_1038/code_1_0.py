    # --- Define the Core Design Problem ---
    # The problem is a classic trade-off in low-voltage analog design.
    # We need to balance competing specifications under a tight power supply constraint.
    # The parameters are: Supply=1.2V, V_threshold=0.45V, Offset=+/-100mV,
    # Reset_time<5us, Leakage<1%/sec.

                ("Pro", "Increasing Vt via reverse body-bias is a standard low-voltage technique. A higher Vt pushes the transistor deeper into subthreshold for a given gate-source voltage, which drastically reduces leakage current and allows for a higher, more stable resistance."),
                ("Pro", "A higher Vt creates more room between the operating Vgs and Vt, making the bias point more robust against the +/- 100 millivolt sensor offset. This directly addresses the headroom challenge."),
                ("Con", "This technique adds the complexity of a body-bias generator and can slightly reduce the maximum signal swing, but this trade-off is often acceptable and manageable."),

                ("Con", "It severely limits offset tolerance, as a small DC offset in the input creates a large, permanent change in Vgs, which exponentially alters the current and thus the high-pass corner of the amplifier."),
