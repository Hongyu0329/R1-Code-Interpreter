    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the provided text to identify the key elements:\n    *   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This is the most specific clue. I need to identify who Veronika Campan is and whose work she interprets.\n    *   **\"prohibition against representation\"**: This strongly suggests a religious or philosophical context, specifically the Second Commandment in Judeo-Christian traditions which forbids making graven images.\n    *   **\"another's material possessions\"**: This points to the Tenth Commandment, which forbids coveting a neighbor's goods.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The commandments about coveting appear at the end of the Decalogue.\n    *   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This implies a unique interpretation where the subject of the final commandments (desiring goods) is linked back to the fundamental prohibition on representing something (like God, or in a psychoanalytic sense, a core concept of desire).\n\n2.  **Connect the Clues:** A search for \"Veronika Campan\" reveals she is a scholar of psychoanalysis, particularly the work of Jacques Lacan. Her writings often analyze Lacan's seminars. Jacques Lacan famously delivered a seminar (Seminar VII, *The Ethics of Psychoanalysis*) where he provided a unique interpretation of the Ten Commandments.\n\n3.  **Verify the Interpretation:** In his analysis, Lacan links the final commandments on coveting not just to simple greed, but to the fundamental structure of desire. He connects this desire for the \"neighbor's goods\" to the prohibition against representation (the Second Commandment), interpreting it as a prohibition on representing *das Ding* (the Thing)â€”the ultimate, unattainable object of desire. Therefore, by addressing the desire for material possessions, Lacan is indeed re-engaging with the logic of the prohibition against representation.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** Based on this, the person \"HE\" is the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. I will write a Python script to print his full name.\n\n```python\n# The person described is the French psychoanalyst who, in his Seminar VII (\"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis\"),\n# provided a detailed re-interpretation of the Ten Commandments.\n# According to scholars like Veronika Campan, he connected the final commandments on coveting material\n# possessions back to the second commandment's \"prohibition against representation\" through\n# his concepts of desire and \"das Ding\" (the Thing).\n\nfull_name = \"Jacques Lacan\"\nprint(full_name)\n```\n<<<Jacques Lacan>>>"
