    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. When the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\nThis transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n4.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$ (The normalization condition)\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of $p_0, p_1, p_2,$ and $p_3$. The goal is to find the sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  From the first three equations, we will express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ as functions of $p_1$.\n2.  We will substitute these expressions into the normalization equation ($p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$) to solve for $p_1$.\n3.  Once we have the numerical value for $p_1$, we will calculate the value of $p_0$.\n4.  Finally, we will compute the desired sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state, the derivatives are zero.
