# The problem describes a situation in advanced representation theory.
# Based on the interpretation of the given terms, the properties of the functor F
# point to it being a regular module over a tame algebra of finite global dimension.
# The conditions are highly restrictive, suggesting a canonical structure.
# In the theory of tame algebras, the first non-trivial class beyond hereditary algebras
# (where n would be 1) are algebras of global dimension 2. For these algebras,
# the projective dimension of a typical regular ("tame") module is 2.
# Therefore, the most reasonable answer is n = 2.

n = 2
print(f"The value of n is derived from the properties of tame representations in non-hereditary contexts.")
print(f"Based on this reasoning, the equation is n = {n}.")
