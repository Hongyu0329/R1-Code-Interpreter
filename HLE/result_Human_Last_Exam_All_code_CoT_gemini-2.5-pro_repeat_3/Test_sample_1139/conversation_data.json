    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic manifold corresponding to the supersymmetric sigma-model for symmetry class D with two replicas.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the bosonic part of the sigma-model manifold is the symmetric space `G/H = O(2N) / (O(N) x O(N))`, where `N` is the number of replicas.\n2.  **Set the number of replicas:** The problem states we have two replicas, so `N = 2`.\n3.  **Determine the specific groups:** With `N=2`, the space is `O(4) / (O(2) x O(2))`.\n4.  **Calculate the dimension of the manifold:** The dimension of a coset space `G/H` is given by the formula `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n5.  **Use the dimension formula for the orthogonal group `O(n)`:** The dimension of `O(n)` is `n * (n-1) / 2`.\n6.  **Calculate the dimensions:**\n    *   `dim(O(4)) = 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   `dim(O(2)) = 2 * (2-1) / 2 = 1`.\n    *   `dim(O(2) x O(2)) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n7.  **Compute the final result:** `dim(O(4)) - dim(O(2) x O(2)) = 6 - 2 = 4`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    num_replicas = 2\n\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for symmetry class D is\")\n    print(\"given by the dimension of the symmetric space O(2N) / (O(N) x O(N)),\")\n    print(\"where N is the number of replicas.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Set N\n    N = num_replicas\n    print(f\"For this problem, the number of replicas N = {N}.\")\n\n    # Define the formula for the dimension of the orthogonal group O(n)\n    def dim_O(n):\n        return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # Calculate the dimension of the total group G = O(2N)\n    n_G = 2 * N\n    dim_G = dim_O(n_G)\n    print(f\"\\nThe dimension of the total group G = O(2*N) = O({n_G}) is:\")\n    print(f\"dim(G) = {n_G} * ({n_G} - 1) / 2 = {dim_G}\")\n\n    # Calculate the dimension of the subgroup H = O(N) x O(N)\n    n_H = N\n    dim_H_single = dim_O(n_H)\n    dim_H = dim_H_single + dim_H_single\n    print(f\"\\nThe dimension of the subgroup H = O(N) x O(N) = O({n_H}) x O({n_H}) is:\")\n    print(f\"dim(H) = dim(O({n_H})) + dim(O({n_H})) = {dim_H_single} + {dim_H_single} = {dim_H}\")\n\n    # Calculate the final dimension of the manifold\n    num_variables = dim_G - dim_H\n    print(\"\\nThe number of variables is dim(G) - dim(H).\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {dim_G} - {dim_H} = {num_variables}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, {num_variables} non-Grassmann variables are needed.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
