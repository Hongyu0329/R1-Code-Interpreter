    "My plan is to first identify the two Nobel laureates requested in the user's question. I will access my knowledge base to find the specific individuals featured in the 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\". Once I have identified them, I will write a simple Python script to print their names as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enron_commercial_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on historical information, the two individuals were economists.\n    # One had already won the Nobel prize, and the other would win it later.\n    laureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"  # Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008\n    laureate2 = \"Myron Scholes\" # Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997\n\n    print(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate2}\")\n\nsolve_enron_commercial_question()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
