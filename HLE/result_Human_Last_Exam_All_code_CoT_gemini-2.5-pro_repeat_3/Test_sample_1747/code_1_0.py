# Plan:
# 1. Identify the algebra as the canonical algebra of type (2,3).
# 2. Recognize that regular rigid indecomposable modules are the quasi-simple modules.
# 3. Use the convention of counting only the quasi-simples in the exceptional tubes.
# 4. The ranks of the exceptional tubes are given by the type (2,3).
# 5. Sum the ranks to get the total number.

# The ranks of the exceptional tubes for a canonical algebra of type (2,3)
rank_tube_1 = 2
rank_tube_2 = 3

# The number of regular rigid indecomposable modules in an exceptional tube
# is equal to its rank.
num_modules_tube_1 = rank_tube_1
num_modules_tube_2 = rank_tube_2

# The total number is the sum of modules from all exceptional tubes.
total_modules = num_modules_tube_1 + num_modules_tube_2
