        ("2. The Potential Problem", "A high concentration of GalNAc (500 mM) is used. This could have unintended 'off-target' effects on the cells, such as causing stress that leads to a reduction of MUC1 protein on the cell surface."),
        
        ("3. The Consequence of the Problem", "If MUC1 surface expression decreases, the antibody signal will drop. This would be an artifact, wrongly interpreted as binding inhibition."),
        
        ("4. The Solution: Anti-FLAG Antibody", "The anti-FLAG antibody binds to the MUC1 protein itself, independent of the sugar. It acts as a control to measure the total amount of MUC1 on the surface."),
        
        ("5. How the Control Works", "If the anti-FLAG signal is the same in both the control (PBS) and the 500 mM GalNAc conditions, it confirms that the MUC1 surface level is unchanged. This validates the conclusion that any signal loss from the main antibody is due to true binding inhibition."),
        
        ("6. Correct Timing", "Since the anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the target protein, it functions as a primary antibody and must be added with the other primary antibodies."),
        
        ("7. Conclusion", "The anti-FLAG antibody is essential to verify that GalNAc has not altered the surface expression of MUC1, and it should be added with the primary antibodies.")
