# Step 1: Determine the number of stable equilibrium points, m.
# From the analysis, there is one stable equilibrium point, x=0.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the other term in the expression.
exponent = 4048
base = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the value of 2^4048.
# Python's integers can handle arbitrarily large numbers.
power_of_two = base**exponent

# Step 4: Calculate the final result m - 2^4048.
result = m - power_of_two

# Step 5: Print the final equation with all numbers.
print(f"{m} - {power_of_two} = {result}")
