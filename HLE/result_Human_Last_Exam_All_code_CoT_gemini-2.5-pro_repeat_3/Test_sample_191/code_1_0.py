    This protein is known as a "don't eat me" signal. It is found on the surface
    of various cells and, in the context of Alzheimer's disease, can coat amyloid
    plaques, protecting them from being cleared by microglia (the brain's macrophages).
    Blocking the interaction between this protein and its receptor on macrophages
    restores their ability to phagocytose (engulf) the plaques.
