    This script explains the reasoning to find the smallest possible number of fixed points
    for a continuous function f: R -> R that satisfies |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y|
    for some constant a <= 1 and for all distinct x, y.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the given condition.
    # The condition is |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some a <= 1.
    # Since a <= 1, this implies a stricter condition: |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 * |x - y|.
    # So, for any two distinct points x and y, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y|.
    # This can be rewritten as the slope of any secant line being strictly between -1 and 1:
    # -1 < (f(x) - f(y)) / (x - y) < 1.

    # Step 2: Prove that there can be at most one fixed point.
    # A fixed point 'c' is a point where f(c) = c.
    # Let's assume there are two distinct fixed points, c1 and c2 (where c1 != c2).
    # By definition of a fixed point: f(c1) = c1 and f(c2) = c2.
    # Let's apply the condition from Step 1 to these two points:
    # |f(c1) - f(c2)| < |c1 - c2|
    # Substituting f(c1) = c1 and f(c2) = c2 into the inequality:
    # |c1 - c2| < |c1 - c2|
    # This statement is a contradiction.
    # Therefore, our assumption of two distinct fixed points must be false.
    # This proves that there is at most one fixed point.

    # Step 3: Prove that there must be at least one fixed point.
    # Let's define an auxiliary function g(x) = f(x) - x.
    # A fixed point of f is a root of g(x), i.e., a value 'c' where g(c) = 0.
    # The function f(x) is continuous, so g(x) is also continuous.
    # Let's analyze the slope of g(x) for any two distinct points x and y:
    # slope_g = (g(x) - g(y)) / (x - y) = (f(x) - x - (f(y) - y)) / (x - y)
    #         = (f(x) - f(y)) / (x - y) - 1
    # From Step 1, we know -1 < (f(x) - f(y)) / (x - y) < 1.
    # Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality gives:
    # -2 < slope_g < 0.
    # Since the slope of any secant line of g(x) is strictly negative, g(x) is a strictly decreasing function.

    # Now, let's examine the limits of g(x) at infinity.
    # Take a point y=0. For any x > 0, we have -2 < (g(x) - g(0))/x < 0.
    # This implies g(0) - 2x < g(x) < g(0). As x -> +inf, g(x) -> -inf.
    # For any x < 0, we have -2 < (g(x) - g(0))/x < 0. Multiplying by x<0 reverses inequalities.
    # This implies g(0) < g(x) < g(0) - 2x. As x -> -inf, g(x) -> +inf.
    
    # So, g(x) is a continuous function where lim_{x->-inf} g(x) = +inf and lim_{x->+inf} g(x) = -inf.
    # By the Intermediate Value Theorem, g(x) must cross the x-axis at least once.
    # This means there is at least one root for g(x), and thus at least one fixed point for f(x).

    # Step 4: Conclusion.
    # From Step 2, we know there is at most one fixed point.
    # From Step 3, we know there is at least one fixed point.
    # The only way for both to be true is if there is exactly one fixed point.
    
    # The number of fixed points for any such function f is always 1.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of fixed points is 1.

    # The final equation can be stated as: Smallest_Number_of_Fixed_Points = 1
    # Printing the number from this equation.
    smallest_possible_number_of_fixed_points = 1
    print("The smallest possible number of fixed points is:")
