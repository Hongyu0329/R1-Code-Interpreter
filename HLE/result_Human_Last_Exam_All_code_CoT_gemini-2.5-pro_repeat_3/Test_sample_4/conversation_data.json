    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**: We identify $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a semidirect product of a simpler Lie algebra and an ideal.\n2.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**: This tool relates the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ to the cohomology of its subalgebra and ideal. For this specific structure, it provides a direct formula for the Poincaré polynomial.\n3.  **Decompose the problem**: The derivation action on the ideal's exterior algebra can be broken down into smaller, independent parts. We will compute the Poincaré polynomials for these parts.\n4.  **Combine the results**: We will multiply the polynomials for the individual parts and then use the formula from step 2 to get the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n5.  **Construct the polynomial string**: Finally, we will write a Python script to perform the polynomial arithmetic and format the result as a string.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Lie Algebra Structure**: The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the commutation relations:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4, [e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n    Let $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$ and $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. We can verify that $\\mathfrak{a}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal and $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a 1-dimensional subalgebra. The entire algebra is a semidirect product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$. The action of $e_1 \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $\\text{ad}_{e_1}|_{\\mathfrak{a}}$.\n\n2.  **Cohomology and Poincaré Polynomial**: The Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ is the generating function for the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$. For a semidirect product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$, where $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an abelian ideal, the Poincaré polynomial is given by:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta}(x) + x P_{\\text{coker}\\delta}(x)$\n    Here, $\\delta$ is the derivation on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{a}^*)$ induced by the action of $e_1$. The polynomials $P_{\\ker\\delta}(x)$ and $P_{\\text{coker}\\delta}(x)$ are the generating functions for the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel of $\\delta$ acting on each degree of $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{a}^*)$.\n\n3.  **Decomposition**: The action of $\\text{ad}_{e_1}$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ decomposes into two Jordan blocks. This action induces an action $\\delta$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{a}^* = \\text{span}\\{\\theta^2, \\ldots, \\theta^6\\}$. The exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{a}^*)$ and the derivation $\\delta$ decompose accordingly:\n    *   Let $A_1 = \\Lambda(\\theta^2, \\theta^3, \\theta^4)$ with derivation $\\delta_1$ defined by $\\delta_1(\\theta^2) = -\\theta^3, \\delta_1(\\theta^3) = -\\theta^4, \\delta_1(\\theta^4) = 0$.\n    *   Let $A_2 = \\Lambda(\\theta^5, \\theta^6)$ with derivation $\\delta_2$ defined by $\\delta_2(\\theta^5) = -\\theta^6, \\delta_2(\\theta^6) = 0$.\n    The total algebra is $A = A_1 \\otimes A_2$ with $\\delta = \\delta_1 \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes \\delta_2$.\n\n4.  **Component Polynomials**: We compute the Poincaré polynomials for the kernel and cokernel of $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$.\n    *   For $\\delta_1$ on $A_1$, we find $\\dim(\\ker(\\delta_1)_k) = 1$ for $k=0,1,2,3$. So, $P_{\\ker\\delta_1}(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$.\n    *   For $\\delta_2$ on $A_2$, we find $\\dim(\\ker(\\delta_2)_k) = 1$ for $k=0,1,2$. So, $P_{\\ker\\delta_2}(x) = 1 + x + x^2$.\n    For a degree-preserving operator on a finite-dimensional space, the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are equal. Thus, $P_{\\text{coker}\\delta_1}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta_1}(x)$ and $P_{\\text{coker}\\delta_2}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta_2}(x)$.\n\n5.  **Combining Results**: The kernel and cokernel of the total derivation $\\delta$ have dimensions determined by the products of the component polynomials:\n    $P_{\\ker\\delta}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta_1}(x) \\cdot P_{\\ker\\delta_2}(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)(1 + x + x^2) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n    Similarly, $P_{\\text{coker}\\delta}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta}(x)$.\n    Now, we use the main formula:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\ker\\delta}(x) + x \\cdot P_{\\text{coker}\\delta}(x)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + x(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this polynomial calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n\n    The calculation is based on the structural decomposition of the Lie algebra\n    and properties of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Coefficients of P_ker_d1(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3, from lowest degree to highest.\n    p_ker_d1 = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    # Coefficients of P_ker_d2(x) = 1 + x + x^2\n    p_ker_d2 = [1, 1, 1]\n\n    # Compute the product P_ker_d(x) = P_ker_d1(x) * P_ker_d2(x)\n    # The result is the coefficients of the kernel's Poincaré polynomial.\n    # numpy's polymul expects coefficients from highest degree to lowest, so we reverse.\n    p_ker = np.polymul(p_ker_d1[::-1], p_ker_d2[::-1])[::-1]\n    \n    # For a degree-preserving derivation on a finite-dimensional graded vector space,\n    # the Poincaré polynomials of the kernel and cokernel are identical.\n    p_coker = p_ker\n\n    # The Poincaré polynomial of g is P_g(x) = P_ker(x) + x * P_coker(x).\n    # The coefficients of x * P_coker(x) are those of P_coker(x) shifted by one.\n    p_coker_x = [0] + p_coker.tolist()\n\n    # To add the polynomials, we make them the same length by padding with zeros.\n    max_len = max(len(p_ker), len(p_coker_x))\n    p_ker_padded = np.pad(p_ker, (0, max_len - len(p_ker)), 'constant')\n    p_coker_x_padded = np.pad(p_coker_x, (0, max_len - len(p_coker_x)), 'constant')\n    \n    final_coeffs = p_ker_padded + p_coker_x_padded\n\n    # Format the polynomial into a human-readable string.\n    poly_str = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(final_coeffs):\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Handle the coefficient part\n        if coeff == 1 and i > 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(int(coeff))\n\n        # Handle the variable part\n        if i == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif i == 1:\n            var_str = \"x\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"x^{i}\"\n        \n        # Add '*' for multiplication if needed\n        if coeff_str and var_str:\n            term = f\"{coeff_str}*{var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n\n        poly_str.append(term)\n        \n    print(\" + \".join(poly_str))\n\ncompute_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
