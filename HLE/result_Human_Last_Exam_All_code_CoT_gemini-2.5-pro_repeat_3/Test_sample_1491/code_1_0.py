    """
    Determines the necessary AI capabilities for replicating the Visual Cliff and Swinging Room experiments.

    The analysis for each capability is as follows:
    I. Goal-driven locomotion: Necessary for the cliff (locomote to a goal) but not the room (maintain static posture). Answer: cliff.
    II. MST analogue (optic flow): Necessary for the room (core mechanism) and for the cliff (to process motion parallax). Answer: both.
    III. Relative size evaluation: A key depth cue for the cliff (texture gradient) but not relevant for the room. Answer: cliff.
    IV. Binocular disparity: A key depth cue for the cliff (stereopsis) but not relevant for the room (monocular effect). Answer: cliff.
    V. Postural control: The system being measured in the room and a necessary prerequisite for locomotion in the cliff. Answer: both.
