# The question asks for the integer n for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.
# Based on advanced results in the representation theory of posets and algebras,
# while tame categories can have representations with infinite projective dimension,
# the constraints imposed by the upper semilattice structure, combined with results for
# well-behaved classes of tame algebras (like domestic or tilted algebras),
# point to a uniform bound on the projective dimension.
# The most established bound in related contexts is 2.

n = 2

# The problem asks for the value of n.
