    "Answering this question requires delving into the homological aspects of the representation theory of posets, a sophisticated area of modern algebra. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** We are given an upper semilattice `J` (a poset where any two elements have a least upper bound) and a \"tame functor\" `f` from `J` to the category of vector spaces. We need to find an integer `n` for which any such functor `f` is `n`-resolvable.\n\n2.  **Interpret the terms:**\n    *   An `n`-resolvable functor is one that has a projective resolution of length `n`. This means its projective dimension, `pd(f)`, is at most `n`. The question asks for a uniform bound `n` that works for all such functors.\n    *   A \"tame functor\" typically refers to an indecomposable representation `f` of the poset `J`, where the category of all such representations, `Rep(J)`, is of \"tame representation type\". Tame type lies between the simpler \"finite\" type (only finitely many indecomposable representations) and the more complex \"wild\" type (classification is a hopeless problem).\n\n3.  **Consult homological theory of representations:** A fundamental result in the representation theory of tame posets (due to Loupias and others) states that the projective dimension of any indecomposable representation is either 0, 1, or infinite.\n\n4.  **Address the apparent contradiction:** This result seems to imply that no finite bound `n` exists, as the projective dimension could be infinite. However, the question implies that such a finite `n` does exist. This suggests that the special condition that `J` is an upper semilattice must somehow prevent the case of infinite projective dimension.\n\n5.  **Incorporate the \"upper semilattice\" property:** The infinite projective dimension case is associated with a class of representations called \"regular\" (specifically, those in \"homogeneous tubes\"). The structural properties imposed by `J` being an upper semilattice are very strong. While the full argument is highly technical, it points towards a more controlled homological behavior.\n\n6.  **Synthesize with known results for well-behaved tame categories:**\n    *   For categories of \"finite\" representation type, there are results by Auslander that connect them to homological dimensions around 2.\n    *   There are important classes of tame algebras, such as \"tame tilted algebras\" or \"domestic string algebras\", for which it is known that the projective dimension of any indecomposable module is at most 2.\n    *   Furthermore, a result by SkowroÅ„ski indicates that tame poset algebras are of a well-behaved type called \"domestic\".\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Piecing these theoretical clues together, while the general result for tame categories allows for infinite projective dimension, the extra structure of an upper semilattice is expected to constrain this. The most recurrent bound in related, well-understood theories is 2. The case `n=1` corresponds to hereditary categories, which is too restrictive for a general upper semilattice. Therefore, the most plausible answer is `n=2`.\n\nThe Python code will simply print this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The question asks for the integer n for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n# Based on advanced results in the representation theory of posets and algebras,\n# while tame categories can have representations with infinite projective dimension,\n# the constraints imposed by the upper semilattice structure, combined with results for\n# well-behaved classes of tame algebras (like domestic or tilted algebras),\n# point to a uniform bound on the projective dimension.\n# The most established bound in related contexts is 2.\n\nn = 2\n\n# The problem asks for the value of n.\nprint(f\"The value of n is {n}.\")\nprint(f\"A tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable for n = {n}.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
