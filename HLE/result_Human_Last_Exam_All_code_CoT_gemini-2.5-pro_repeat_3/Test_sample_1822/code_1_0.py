# Define the given parameters for the knowledge graph fairness audit
c = 0.85  # Confidence of the discriminatory pattern P in subgraph G

# The formula to calculate the evidence ratio (E_r) is derived by comparing
# the effective evidence for the violation against the evidence suggesting it's an artifact.
#
# 1. The initial evidence for the violation is its confidence weighted by its support (c * s).
# 2. The bottleneck coefficient (beta) discounts this local evidence, as a strong bottleneck
#    (low beta) makes local patterns less representative. So, effective evidence for is (c * s * beta).
# 3. The evidence against the violation is the confidence of the counter-pattern (c_prime).
# 4. The ratio E_r is therefore (c * s * beta) / c_prime.

# Calculate the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)
e_r = (c * s * beta) / c_prime
