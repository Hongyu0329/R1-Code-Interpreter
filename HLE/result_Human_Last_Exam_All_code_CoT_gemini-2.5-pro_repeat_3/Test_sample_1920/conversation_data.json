    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**: A character is built from components corresponding to the prime factors of its conductor. So, the first step is to find the prime factorization of $d=53599$.\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a *primitive* character modulo the prime $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character is primitive if it is not the principal character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n3.  **Use the Order Property**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n4.  **Count the Combinations**: We need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_k)$ such that each $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$ and $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k)) = 6$. This can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nLet's execute this plan.\n\n*   **Factorization**: $d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. The conductor is square-free with 4 distinct prime factors.\n*   **Order Condition**: We need $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$. This implies that for each component character $\\chi_p$:\n    *   The order must be a divisor of 6.\n    *   At least one character's order must be a multiple of 2.\n    *   At least one character's order must be a multiple of 3.\n*   **Inclusion-Exclusion**:\n    1.  Let $A$ be the set of character tuples where all component orders divide 6. The primitive orders dividing 6 are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. For each of our primes, $p-1$ is divisible by 6. So, the number of choices for each component is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. For 4 primes, this is $5^4$.\n    2.  Let $B$ be the set of tuples from $A$ where the lcm has no factor of 3 (i.e., all orders divide 2). The only primitive order dividing 2 is 2. The number of choices for each component is $\\phi(2)=1$. For 4 primes, this is $1^4$.\n    3.  Let $C$ be the set of tuples from $A$ where the lcm has no factor of 2 (i.e., all orders divide 3). The only primitive order dividing 3 is 3. The number of choices for each component is $\\phi(3)=2$. For 4 primes, this is $2^4$.\n\nThe total number of characters is $|A| - |B| - |C| = 5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\n# Conductor and order\nd = 53599\ntarget_order = 6\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the conductor d.\n# d = 53599 = 7 * 13 * 19 * 31.
