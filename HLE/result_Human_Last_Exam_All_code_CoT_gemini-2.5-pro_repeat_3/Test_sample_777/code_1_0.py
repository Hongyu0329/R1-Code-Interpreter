# This is a theoretical question about computational complexity.
# No code is required to solve it, as the solution is a proof-of-concept
# analysis rather than a computation. The analysis involves concepts from
# parameterized complexity like FPT, W[1]-hardness, treewidth, and the
# grid-minor theorem.
#
# The reasoning is as follows:
# 1. The problem asks for k disjoint cycles, each of length at least k.
# 2. A general approach for such parameterized problems is to use treewidth.
#    - If treewidth is very large, a large grid minor exists. A large enough
#      grid minor contains k disjoint cycles of length >= k. So, Yes.
#    - If treewidth is small (bounded by f(k)), one would try Dynamic Programming.
# 3. The DP approach fails. To verify the length constraint, the DP state
#    must store path lengths. These lengths can grow arbitrarily, so the state
#    space is not bounded by a function of k, and the algorithm is not FPT.
# 4. In fact, the problem is known to be W[1]-hard on general graphs, which
#    confirms that the FPT algorithm approach fails. This rules out choice A.
# 5. The problem is in NP, so coNP-hardness (Choice D) is highly unlikely.
#    It does not have the structure of typical W[2]-complete problems (Choice C).
# 6. We are left with choices B and E, which claim W[1]-hardness for general
#    graphs but FPT for a restricted class.
# 7. Between planar graphs (B) and bounded-degree graphs (E), planarity
#    is a much stronger structural property. It is known to make many
#    W[1]-hard problems FPT. The hardness reduction for this type of problem
#    can likely be made to work for bounded-degree graphs, but not for
#    planar graphs.
# 8. Therefore, the most plausible statement is B.
