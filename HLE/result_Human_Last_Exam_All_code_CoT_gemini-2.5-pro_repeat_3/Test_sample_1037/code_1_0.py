# The final answer is derived from the mathematical reasoning outlined above.
# This code simply prints the result in the requested format.
# The three values correspond to the cardinalities of S/A, B/S, and H_1(B/A, Q).

# The cardinality of S/A is Beth_1
val1 = "Beth_1"

# The cardinality of B/S is 1
val2 = "1"

# The cardinality of H_1(B/A, Q) is 1
val3 = "1"

print(f"{val1} {val2} {val3}")
