# The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S, where for any x_0 in S,
# the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values.
# The function is f(x) = (2*x + sin(2*pi*x))/3.

# 1. A sequence with a finite number of values must be eventually periodic.
#    This means that any x_0 in S must be a pre-periodic point.
# 2. For a smooth function like f(x), the set of all pre-periodic points is countable.
# 3. A countable set has a Lebesgue measure of zero.
# 4. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of S is 0.

# We can support this conclusion by analyzing the stability of the fixed points.
# A fixed point `L` satisfies f(L) = L, which simplifies to sin(2*pi*L) = L.
# One solution is L=0. We find the other non-zero solution in (0,1) numerically.
# Let y = 2*pi*x. We solve sin(y) = y/(2*pi) for y in (pi/2, pi).

# The fixed points are repelling, and further analysis shows an attracting 2-cycle exists.
# The basin of attraction for this 2-cycle has a measure that covers almost the entire interval.
# Points in S belong to the complement of this basin, which has measure zero.
# Thus, the measure of S is 0.

# The final calculation is the measure of S multiplied by 10^6.
