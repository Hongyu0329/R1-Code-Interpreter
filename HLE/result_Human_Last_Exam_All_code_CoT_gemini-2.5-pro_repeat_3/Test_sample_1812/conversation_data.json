    "My plan to solve this problem is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A. The information about the \"Markov quiver\" is context, but the essential task is the determinant calculation. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will use the `numpy` library in Python to represent the matrix.\n2.  I will explicitly use the cofactor expansion formula for a 3x3 determinant to show the calculation process, as requested. The formula is: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  The script will print the formula with the numbers from the matrix substituted in, showing the full equation.\n4.  The script will then print the result of each intermediate step.\n5.  Finally, the script will output the final value of the determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The matrix provided in the problem\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extracting elements of the matrix for the formula\n# a b c\n# d e f\n# g h i\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix\ndeterminant_value = a * (e * i - f * h) - b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)\n\n# Print the calculation steps with all numbers shown in the equation\nprint(\"To compute the determinant of the matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nWe use the formula for a 3x3 matrix: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"       = ({a}) * ({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h} - {e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = ({a}) * ({e*i - f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i - f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a * (e*i - f*h)} - {b * (d*i - f*g)} + {c * (d*h - e*g)}\")\nprint(f\"       = {determinant_value}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final determinant of the matrix is: {determinant_value}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
