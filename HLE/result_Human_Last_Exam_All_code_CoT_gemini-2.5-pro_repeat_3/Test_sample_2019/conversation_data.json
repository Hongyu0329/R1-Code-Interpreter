    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This requires a systematic search of all possible valid placements. I will use a backtracking algorithm, which is well-suited for this kind of combinatorial problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: The 5x5 board will be represented by coordinates `(row, col)`, where `0 <= row, col < 5`. A placement of queens is a list of these coordinates.\n\n2.  **Toroidal Attack Rules**: On a toroidal board, the attack rules are different from a standard board because the edges wrap around. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if they are in the same row, column, or one of the \"wrapped\" diagonals.\n    *   **Row/Column Attack**: `r1 == r2` or `c1 == c2`.\n    *   **Diagonal Attack**: The diagonals also wrap. This can be checked using modular arithmetic. Two queens are on the same diagonal if `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5` or on the same anti-diagonal if `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`.\n\n3.  **Backtracking Algorithm**: The algorithm will place queens one by one, ensuring that each new queen does not attack any previously placed queens.\n    *   The main function, `solve(start_index, queens)`, will try to place the next queen.\n    *   `start_index` ensures that we check each combination of cells only once, preventing duplicates (e.g., placing queens at `(0,0)` then `(1,2)` is the same as placing at `(1,2)` then `(0,0)`).\n    *   When 4 queens have been successfully placed, we have found one valid arrangement and we count it.\n    *   If a placement leads to a state where no more queens can be added, the algorithm \"backtracks\" to try a different placement.\n\n4.  **Execution**: The Python script will define the board size (`N=5`) and the number of queens (`M=4`), implement the logic described above, run the backtracking solver, and print the total number of ways found.\n\n```python\ndef solve_4_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # Board size\n    M = 4  # Number of queens\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe from the existing queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in queens:\n            # Check row and column attacks (although row check is redundant in some implementations)\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            # Check toroidal diagonal attacks\n            # Main diagonals: (r - c) mod N is constant\n            if (r - c) % N == (qr - qc) % N:\n                return False\n            # Anti-diagonals: (r + c) mod N is constant\n            if (r + c) % N == (qr + qc) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_placements(start_index, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid queen placements using backtracking.\n        - start_index is used to generate combinations instead of permutations, avoiding overcounting.\n        - queens is the list of (row, col) coordinates of already placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If M queens are placed, we found a valid arrangement.\n        if len(queens) == M:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Iterate through all cells on the board, starting from start_index.\n        for k in range(start_index, N * N):\n            r = k // N\n            c = k % N\n            \n            # Check if it's safe to place a queen here\n            if is_safe(r, c, queens):\n                # Place the queen\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recurse to place the next queen, starting from the next cell\n                count += count_placements(k + 1, queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                queens.pop()\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Start the backtracking search from the first cell (index 0) with no queens placed.\n    total_ways = count_placements(0, [])\n    print(f\"The number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is: {total_ways}\")\n\nsolve_4_queens_toroidal()\n<<<250>>>\n```"
