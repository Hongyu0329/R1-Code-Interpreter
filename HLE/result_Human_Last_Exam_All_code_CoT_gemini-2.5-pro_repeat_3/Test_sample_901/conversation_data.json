    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the product of the reaction, followed by a Python script that formalizes the analysis and provides the final answer.\n\n### Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Conditions**: A strong base with a secondary alkyl halide strongly suggests an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n\n2.  **Recall E2 Stereochemistry Requirements**:\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific orientation of the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed. They must be *anti-periplanar*.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement means the leaving group and the proton must both be in *axial* positions on adjacent carbons (a trans-diaxial arrangement).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chair Conformation of the Substrate**:\n    *   We need to draw the most stable chair conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. Cyclohexane rings exist in an equilibrium between two chair conformers. The conformer that places the largest substituent in the equatorial position is more stable.\n    *   The methyl group is bulkier than the bromine atom. Therefore, the most stable conformer will have the **methyl group in the equatorial position**.\n    *   For the (1S,2R) stereoisomer, placing the methyl group at C2 in an equatorial position forces the bromine at C1 into an **axial position**.\n    *   So, the reactive conformation is the one with an **axial Br** and an **equatorial CHâ‚ƒ**.\n\n4.  **Identify Available Protons for Elimination**:\n    *   Since the leaving group (Br) is axial, we need to find axial protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: There is a proton. Since the methyl group is equatorial, the proton on C2 must be **axial**. This proton is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination is possible here. This would lead to the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial proton** is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination is also possible here. This would lead to the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Apply Regioselectivity Rules (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**:\n    *   The choice between removing the proton from C2 or C6 depends on the base.\n    *   **Zaitsev's Rule**: Small, strong bases (like ethoxide) favor the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene. This would be the product from removing the C2 proton, forming **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule**: Large, bulky bases (like potassium tert-butoxide) are sensitive to steric hindrance. They preferentially attack the least sterically hindered proton.\n    *   Comparing the two available axial protons:\n        *   The axial proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group.\n        *   The axial proton on C6 is much more sterically accessible.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the proton from C6.\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Product**:\n    *   Elimination of the axial proton from C6 and the axial bromine from C1 results in a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) alkene, consistent with the Hofmann rule.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide to identify the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the reaction components\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 Elimination\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Substrate: {substrate}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent: {reagent}\")\n    print(f\"This is an {reaction_type} reaction.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Stereochemical Requirement ---\")\n    print(\"E2 reactions require an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be removed.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Substrate Conformation ---\")\n    print(\"The most stable chair conformer of the substrate places the bulky methyl group in the equatorial position.\")\n    print(\"This forces the Bromine atom into the required axial position.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Possible Elimination Pathways ---\")\n    print(\"1.
