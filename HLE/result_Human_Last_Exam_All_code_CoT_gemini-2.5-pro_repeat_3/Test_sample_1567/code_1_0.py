def solve_controlled_random_walk():
    """
    This function calculates the maximal k for the controlled random walk problem.

    The problem asks for the maximal integer k such that for any choice of k
    d-dimensional probability measures (with d >= 3), one cannot guarantee a
    return to the origin. This means that for any such set of k measures,
    there always exists a control strategy that makes the walk transient.

    From the theory of controlled random walks, a transient strategy can always
    be found if the set of available covariance matrices is not "rich" enough.
    The precise condition for being unable to guarantee recurrence is that the
    origin is not in the interior of the convex hull of the traceless parts
    of the covariance matrices.

    The traceless parts of the d x d covariance matrices live in a vector space
    of dimension M = d*(d+1)/2 - 1.

    For the convex hull of k points to have a non-empty interior in an M-dimensional
    space, we need at least k = M+1 points. If k <= M, the convex hull will
    always have an empty interior. This means that for any choice of k <= M measures,
    a transient strategy will exist.

    Therefore, the maximal value of k is M.
    k_max = d*(d+1)/2 - 1.

    The question asks for a single numerical answer, but the formula depends on d.
    This implies we should evaluate it for the base case of the given constraint d >= 3,
    which is d=3.

    k = (d * (d + 1) // 2) - 1
