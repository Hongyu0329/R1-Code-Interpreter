    # --- Analysis of each statement ---

    # Statement 1: There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.
    # The problem explicitly states: "...phenotype of interest...with no bearing on fitness."
    # It also states: "Further, all genotypes have equal fitness..."
    # These two phrases directly confirm that there is no selection.
    # Conclusion for Statement 1: Must be true.
    statement_1_is_true = True

    # Statement 2: Parents will not raise their offspring.
    # The problem states the population has "discrete and non-overlapping generations."
    # This is a common modeling assumption meaning that one generation dies before the next reproduces.
    # However, this does not preclude parents from caring for their young before they die.
    # For example, in some species of salmon, parents spawn and then die, but the act of creating a nest and spawning could be considered a form of parental investment, if not "raising".
    # More importantly, the model doesn't give enough information to make a definitive conclusion about parental behavior.
    # Conclusion for Statement 2: Not necessarily true.
    statement_2_is_true = False

    # Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations.
    # The current conditions (no selection, no mutation, no drift, no gene flow, random mating) mean the population is not evolving now.
    # However, the problem describes these conditions as "currently true". It does not state these conditions are permanent.
    # Future events like geographic isolation (e.g., a mountain range rising), new mutations, or a change in the environment could introduce selection pressures and lead to speciation.
    # The word "never" makes this a very strong claim that cannot be supported.
    # Conclusion for Statement 3: Not necessarily true.
    statement_3_is_true = False

    # Statement 4: The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.
    # The phenotype (P) is a result of genotype (G) and environment (E). P = G + E.
    # The broad-sense heritability (H^2) is 0.7, meaning 70% of the phenotypic variance is due to genetic variance, but 30% is due to environmental variance.
    # Random mating across the entire region ensures that the genetic makeup (G) will be, on average, the same between the west and east.
    # However, the problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the region.
    # It is possible for a systematic environmental difference to exist between the western and eastern halves (e.g., different average temperature, rainfall, or soil nutrients).
    # Such a difference in environment (E) could lead to a substantial difference in the average phenotype (P), even if the underlying genetics are the same.
    # Conclusion for Statement 4: Not necessarily true.
    statement_4_is_true = False

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    # Only Statement 1 is a necessary consequence of the information given.
    # This corresponds to answer choice A.
