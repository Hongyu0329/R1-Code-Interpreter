    """
    This function calculates the exponent alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha.

    The problem asks for the asymptotic behavior of n(N), which is the number of products
    needed for a set X of measure 1/N to cover the group G = SO_3(R).
    """

    # Step 1: Identify the properties of the group G = SO_3(R).
    # G is the group of rotations in 3D space. It is a compact, connected, simple Lie group.
    # A key property of a Lie group is its dimension, d.
    # For SO(n), the dimension is d = n(n-1)/2. For SO(3), n=3.
    # d = 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 3.
    # Alternatively, a rotation can be specified by an axis (a unit vector in R^3, 2 parameters)
    # and an angle (1 parameter). So, the dimension of SO(3) is d = 3.
    group_dimension = 3
    print(f"The dimension of the group G = SO_3(R) is d = {group_dimension}.")

    # Step 2: Determine the "worst-case" set X.
    # We are looking for an n that works for *all* sets X of a given measure. This means n is
    # determined by the set X that is the "slowest" to spread and cover the group.
    # This worst-case set is a small ball centered at the identity element of the group.
    # Let's denote this set by X.

    # Step 3: Relate the measure of X to its size.
    # The Haar measure of a small ball of radius r in the Lie algebra is proportional to r^d.
    # We are given mu(X) = 1/N.
    # So, 1/N is proportional to r^d, which means the radius r is proportional to (1/N)^(1/d).
    # r ~ (1/N)^(1/d)

    # Step 4: Analyze the growth of the product set X^n.
    # X^n is the set of all products of n elements from X.
    # If X corresponds to a ball of radius r in the Lie algebra, then the support of X^n
    # contains a ball of radius n*r. This is because the n-fold sum of vectors
    # from a ball of radius r is a ball of radius n*r.

    # Step 5: Establish the covering condition.
    # For X^n to cover the entire group G, its effective radius (n*r) in the Lie algebra
    # must be large enough. For SO(3), the exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group
    # covers the entire group if the image is a ball of radius pi.
    # So we need the condition: n * r >= pi.

    # Step 6: Combine the relations to find n(N).
    # From Step 3, we have r ~ (1/N)^(1/d).
    # Substituting this into the inequality from Step 5:
    # n * (C * (1/N)^(1/d)) >= pi  (where C is a constant of proportionality)
    # n >= (pi/C) * N^(1/d)
    # This shows that n(N) grows proportionally to N^(1/d).

    # Step 7: Calculate alpha for SO(3).
    # The problem states that n(N) is closest to N^alpha. From our derivation, the exponent
    # is 1/d.
