# The problem asks for the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.
# The ring is Z/m where m = 27.
# We can write m as p^k, where p is a prime number and k is an integer.
p = 3
k = 3

# The order of the K-group K_{2n}(Z/p^k) for an odd prime p and k > 1 is given by the formula:
# |K_{2n}(Z/p^k)| = p^e, where the exponent e = min(k, 1 + v_p(n)).
# Here, v_p(n) is the p-adic valuation of n.

# The group is nonzero if its order is > 1, which means the exponent e > 0.
# For any natural number n >= 1, v_p(n) >= 0.
# So, 1 + v_p(n) >= 1.
# Therefore, e = min(k, 1 + v_p(n)) is always >= 1.
# This implies that the group is nonzero for all natural numbers n.

# Since the question asks for the "largest" n, which doesn't exist in a literal sense,
# we interpret this as asking for the threshold n where the group's order reaches its maximum possible value.
# The maximum value of the exponent e is k.
# This occurs when 1 + v_p(n) >= k, which means v_p(n) >= k - 1.
# This condition means n must be a multiple of p^(k-1).
# The smallest natural number n that satisfies this condition is n = p^(k-1).
# This is the value where the K-group first reaches its maximal size.

n = p**(k - 1)
exponent_in_n = k - 1
