    "The user's question contains a contradiction based on the fundamental principles of crystal optics. Here is a step-by-step explanation and a Python script to clarify the concepts and arrive at the most plausible answer.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:** First, I will explain the core concepts. A crystal class can exhibit optical activity (rotating the plane of polarized light) if and only if it is **chiral**. A chiral structure is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image, which means it must lack a center of inversion and any mirror planes. An **achiral** crystal possesses these symmetry elements and therefore **cannot** be optically active.\n2.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The question asks for classes that are simultaneously **achiral** and **optically active**. This is a direct contradiction. No such crystal classes exist.\n3.  **Propose a Correction:** Since the question as stated is impossible, I will assume there is a typo, a common occurrence in such questions. A likely typo is that \"non-polar\" should have been \"polar\". Certain **achiral and polar** classes can exhibit a related phenomenon called directional optical activity (i.e., optical activity only when light travels in specific directions within the crystal). This provides a logical path to a valid answer.\n4.  **Write the Script:** The Python code will first define the properties (chiral, polar) of the relevant crystal classes. It will then programmatically demonstrate the contradiction in the original question. Finally, it will apply the corrected premise (\"achiral and polar\") and analyze the given answer choices to find a match.\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The script will output the logical steps, showing why the original question is flawed and how a corrected version points directly to one of the answer choices.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes based on optical properties to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for crystal classes.
