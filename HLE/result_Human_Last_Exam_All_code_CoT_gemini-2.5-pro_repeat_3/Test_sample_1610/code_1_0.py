    # The problem asks for the largest real number r such that for a specific
    # decomposition of a 4x4 square into 16 unit-area polygons, any unit square S
    # within the 4x4 square intersects at least one polygon in an area of at least r.

    # We consider a simple decomposition: a regular 4x4 grid of 16 unit squares.
    # Each unit square is a polygon P_ij = [i, i+1] x [j, j+1] of area 1.
    
    # An arbitrary unit square S is defined by its bottom-left corner (x, y).
    # S = [x, x+1] x [y, y+1].
    
    # By symmetry, we can find the minimum of the maximum overlap (the 'r' for this
    # decomposition) by analyzing the case where (x,y) is in [0,1]x[0,1].
    # In this case, S overlaps with four polygons, P_00, P_10, P_01, P_11.
    
    # The areas of intersection are functions of x and y:
    # Area_00 = (1-x) * (1-y)
    # Area_10 = x * (1-y)
    # Area_01 = (1-x) * y
    # Area_11 = x * y
