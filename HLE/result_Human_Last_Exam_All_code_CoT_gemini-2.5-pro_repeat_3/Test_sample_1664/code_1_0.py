    # Step-by-step analysis of the poem
    print("--- Poem Analysis ---")
    print("1. 'Each oval frame contains an inventory of eyes and dust.'")
    print("   - This implies a collection of dead insects in a display case, subject to decay ('dust').")

    print("\n2. 'caught behind silvered dislocation...'")
    print("   - The moths are trapped behind glass or a mirror ('silvered'). They are 'dislocated' from their natural environment.")

    print("\n3. 'â€“ that strange tarnished logic of their discipline.'")
    print("   - 'their discipline': Refers to the moth's instinctual, predictable behavior (e.g., flying to light).")
    print("   - 'logic': The moth's instinct is its guiding principle.")
    print("   - 'tarnished': This connects to 'dust' and physical decay. The outcome of the moth's logic is a degraded state.")
    print("   - 'strange': It is paradoxical that their guiding instinct leads to their death and decay as a specimen.")

    print("A. Incorrect. The poem uses 'discipline', suggesting predictable, not erratic, behavior.")
    print("D. Incomplete. This explains the moth's instinct but misses the key idea of decay conveyed by 'tarnished'.")
    print("B. Correct. This option ties everything together: the context of 'specimen preservation' (frames, inventory), the process of decay ('degradation' = 'tarnished'), and the overall theme.")
    print("The phrase describes the full journey: the moth's instinct leads it to become a scientific specimen, which is an imperfect form of preservation that itself leads to decay.")
