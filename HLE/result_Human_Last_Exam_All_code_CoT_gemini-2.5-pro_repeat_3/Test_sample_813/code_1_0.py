    print("Step 1: Analyzing the patient's initial symptoms and history.")
    print("The patient's initial symptoms (agitation, difficulty falling asleep, an increase in sexual activities, careless spending) are classic signs of a manic episode.")
    print("The family history of mood disorders strengthens the likelihood of a diagnosis like bipolar disorder.\n")

    print("Step 2: Identifying the likely prescribed medication.")
    print("A medication prescribed to treat such behavioral disturbances is very likely a mood stabilizer. Lithium is a primary, first-line treatment for mania.\n")

    print("Step 3: Connecting the medication to the new symptom.")
    print("The patient developed sexual dysfunction (decreased interest in sex) *after* starting the new medication.")
    print("This timing strongly indicates that the sexual dysfunction is a side effect of the treatment.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluating the provided answer choices.")
    print("A. Lithium induced hypothyroidism: Lithium is known to cause hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a well-documented cause of sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido. This provides a direct and logical link between the treatment and the new symptom.")
    print("B, C, D, E: These options focus on heavy metal toxicity from the patient's occupation. While a possible long-term health issue, the *timing* of the sexual dysfunction points directly to the new medication as the trigger, not a chronic exposure.\n")

    print("Step 5: Reaching a conclusion.")
    print("The most coherent explanation is that the treatment for the manic episode (Lithium) caused a secondary condition (hypothyroidism), which in turn caused the final symptom (sexual dysfunction).")
    print("Therefore, the underlying root cause that connects this entire series of events is Lithium-induced hypothyroidism.")
