    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem in algebraic geometry, followed by the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group, denoted as $\\rho(X)$, for the variety $X = C^{(15)}$, which is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n2.  **Relate $\\rho(X)$ to the Jacobian of C:** There is a fundamental formula by Macdonald that relates the Picard number (rank of the Néron-Severi group) of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, $\\rho(J(C))$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n    This formula is valid for any degree $d \\geq 1$. In our case, $C$ is a genus $g=3$ curve and $X = C^{(15)}$, so the formula applies. This simplifies our problem to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Possible Rank:**\n    *   The Néron-Severi group of any principally polarized abelian variety, like a Jacobian $J(C)$, always contains the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, its rank is always at least 1, i.e., $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n    *   This minimum value is achieved for a *generic* curve $C$. A generic curve has no special properties; its Jacobian has no endomorphisms other than multiplication by integers. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the principal polarization, so $NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its rank is $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n    *   Using the formula from step 2, the smallest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n        $\\min \\rho(X) = \\min \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Find the Largest Possible Rank:**\n    *   The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a complex abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A)$. The formula for this Hodge number is $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n    *   For our Jacobian $J(C)$, the dimension is $g=3$. Thus, we have the upper bound:\n        $\\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\n    *   This maximum rank is achieved for very special curves, specifically those whose Jacobians have Complex Multiplication (CM). For an abelian variety of CM-type, the space of algebraic cycles of codimension 1 has the maximum possible dimension, meaning $\\rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C))$.\n    *   An example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has CM is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$. Its Jacobian has $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n    *   Therefore, the largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\n    *   Using the formula from step 2, the largest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n        $\\max \\rho(X) = \\max \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Code:** The final step is to perform these simple additions. I will write a Python script to present these calculations clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The genus of the curve C\n    g = 3\n\n    # The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n    d = 15\n\n    # The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is given by the formula:\n    # rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1\n    # where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\n    # We need to find the min and max possible values for rho(J(C)).\n\n    # Smallest Rank Calculation:\n    # For a generic curve C, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian\n    # is minimal.\n    # min rho(J(C)) = 1\n    rho_J_min = 1\n    rho_X_min = rho_J_min + 1\n    print(\"Finding the smallest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The minimum rank for the Jacobian's Neron-Severi group is rho(J(C)) = {rho_J_min}.\")\n    print(f\"The smallest rank for X = C^(15) is rho(J(C)) + 1 = {rho_J_min} + 1 = {rho_X_min}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Largest Rank Calculation:\n    # The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety is\n    # bounded by the Hodge number h^{1,1} = g*g.
