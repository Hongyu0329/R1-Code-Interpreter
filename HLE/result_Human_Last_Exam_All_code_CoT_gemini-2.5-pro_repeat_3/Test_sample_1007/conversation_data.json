    "My plan is to analyze each of the classical ballet steps provided in the multiple-choice options. For each step, I will determine its starting and ending leg positions. The goal is to find the step where the ending position is identical to the starting position, including which foot is in front. I will provide a step-by-step analysis of each option's movement.\n\n1.  **Analyze Entrechat six:** An \"entrechat\" is a jump where the feet are crossed multiple times. An even-numbered entrechat (like two, four, or six) always lands in the same position it started from. An \"entrechat six\" starts in fifth position, beats three times in the air, and lands in the exact same fifth position with the same foot in front.\n2.  **Analyze Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a jump from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed one. The word \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places upon closing. So, if you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n3.  **Analyze Assemblé:** An \"assemblé\" means \"assembled.\" It's a jump where the legs are brought together in the air. However, variations like \"assemblé dessus\" (over) or \"dessous\" (under) cause the working leg to land in front of or behind the supporting leg, thus changing the starting position.\n4.  **Analyze Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a glide. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" Starting from fifth, the back foot glides out, and the front foot closes *behind* it. This action inherently changes which foot is in front.\n5.  **Analyze Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump, like a pas de chat with a circular motion (rond de jambe) from each leg. It typically results in the feet changing position upon landing.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Entrechat six is the only step that, by definition, ends in the exact same position from which it started. I will now generate the Python code to present this analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'analysis': 'This is a jump starting from fifth position.
