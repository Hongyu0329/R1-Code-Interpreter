    1. Cleft palate
    2. Characteristic facial features (prominent eyes, midface hypoplasia, micrognathia)
    3. Developmental delay and intellectual disability
    4. Speech difficulties (incomprehensible speech)

    ...strongly points towards 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome or Velocardiofacial syndrome. This condition is caused by a microdeletion on the long arm of chromosome 22.

    Comparing with other options:
    - Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) has a different set of characteristic facial features.
    - Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome) is typically much more severe, and survival to age 15 is exceedingly rare.
    - Syndromes related to chromosomes 2 and 3 do not classically present with this specific combination of findings.
