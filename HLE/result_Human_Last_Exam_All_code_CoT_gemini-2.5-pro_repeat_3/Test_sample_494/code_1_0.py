Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic spin-0 hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Nature of Ammonia Tunneling:** In any ammonia molecule (NH3), the nitrogen atom can be on one side of the plane formed by the three hydrogens or the other. Classically, there is an energy barrier preventing it from moving between these two positions. Quantum mechanically, the nitrogen atom can "tunnel" through this barrier. This tunneling effect splits the ground vibrational state into two distinct energy levels: a symmetric state and an antisymmetric state. The energy difference between these two states is the signature of tunneling.

2.  **The Role of Identical Particle Statistics:** The Pauli exclusion principle (or more generally, the spin-statistics theorem) dictates the symmetry of the total wavefunction when two identical particles are exchanged.
    *   **Fermions (like ordinary H, spin 1/2):** The total wavefunction must be ANTI-SYMMETRIC.
    *   **Bosons (like exotic H, spin 0):** The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.

3.  **Analyzing Exotic Ammonia (Bosons):**
    *   The three exotic hydrogen nuclei are identical bosons (spin 0). Therefore, the total wavefunction of the molecule (Ψ_total) must be symmetric upon their exchange.
    *   The total wavefunction can be approximated as a product: Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial × Ψ_nuclear_spin.
    *   For three spin-0 nuclei, there is only one possible nuclear spin state, and it is inherently SYMMETRIC under the exchange of any two nuclei.
    *   Since Ψ_total must be symmetric and Ψ_nuclear_spin is symmetric, the spatial part of the wavefunction, Ψ_spatial, must also be SYMMETRIC with respect to the exchange of the hydrogen nuclei.

4.  **Conclusion on Tunneling:**
    *   The spatial wavefunction (Ψ_spatial) is a combination of the rotational and vibrational wavefunctions. The tunneling itself is a vibrational phenomenon, represented by the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states.
    *   The requirement that Ψ_spatial be symmetric does NOT forbid the existence of either the symmetric or the antisymmetric vibrational (tunneling) state. It simply places a constraint on which rotational states can be combined with each vibrational state to produce an overall symmetric spatial wavefunction.
    *   Since both vibrational states that constitute the tunneling doublet are still allowed quantum states for the molecule, the energy splitting between them will still exist.

Therefore, the fundamental mechanism of tunneling is unaffected by the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms. The exotic ammonia molecule would exhibit tunneling, although the details of its rotational-vibrational spectrum would differ from that of ordinary ammonia.
