# The plan is to identify the single numerical value from the provided weather data
# that most significantly hinders the development of tornadoes.

# 1. Analyze the environment for tornadic potential.
#    - Instability (CAPE): 1567-2136 J/kg. Favorable.
#    - Low-level Moisture (LowRH, PW): 89%, 1.4in. Favorable.
#    - Lifting Condensation Level (LCL): 726 m. Very favorable (low).
#    - Convective Inhibition (CINH): -11. Favorable (no cap).
#    - Wind Shear (SRH, 0-6km Shear): 361 m^2/s^2, 66 kts. Extremely favorable.
#    - Composite Parameters (STP): 4.7. Extremely favorable.
# The environment is overwhelmingly supportive of tornadic supercells.

# 2. Look for the most significant negative factor or "weakest link".
#    - Sfc-3km AGL LR = 5.7 C/km. This lapse rate is not particularly steep, which is a minor weakness.
#    - K = 20. The K-Index is a measure of thunderstorm potential. A value of 20 is on the threshold of "low" potential, suggesting only isolated or widely scattered storms are likely.

# 3. Compare the negative factors.
#    While a weak low-level lapse rate (5.7) can be a negative factor, the K-Index of 20 represents a more fundamental problem.
#    It suggests that despite the high potential for any storm that forms to become a tornadic supercell, the atmosphere
#    itself may struggle to produce widespread convection. An environment that cannot easily initiate or sustain
#    numerous storms has a significantly reduced overall tornado threat, regardless of how "perfect" the other
#    parameters are. Therefore, the K-Index value is the most significant negative factor.

# The number representing the K-Index is 20.
greatest_negative_impact_value = 20

# Final Answer: Print the specific number that has the greatest negative impact.
print("The number that has the greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis in the dataset is from the K-Index parameter.")
print(f"The equation is K = {greatest_negative_impact_value}")
print(f"This value suggests a low potential for widespread thunderstorm development, which is a significant limiting factor even in a high-shear, high-instability environment.")
print("The specific number requested is:")
print(greatest_negative_impact_value)
