    Analyzes four sets of natural numbers to determine if they can be the support
    of a power series that converges on the closed unit disk but not absolutely on the boundary.

    The problem is equivalent to identifying which of the sets are NOT Sidon sets.
    A set S is a Sidon set if for any continuous function on the unit circle whose Fourier
    coefficients are supported on S, the Fourier series must converge absolutely.
    A power series converging everywhere on the closed unit disk has a continuous sum function.
    If S were a Sidon set, this would imply the coefficients sum absolutely, which is
    contradictory to the problem's requirement.
