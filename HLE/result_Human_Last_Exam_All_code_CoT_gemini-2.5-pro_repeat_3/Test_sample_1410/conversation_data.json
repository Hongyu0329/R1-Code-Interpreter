    "This is a chess puzzle that requires finding the shortest checkmate sequence for White, assuming optimal play from both sides.\n\n**Initial Position Analysis:**\n\nThe given FEN is `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`.\n\n*   **White's pieces:** King on g1, Queen on d5, Knight on e5, Bishop on h5, Rook on f1, and pawns.\n*   **Black's pieces:** King on g8, Queen on g5, Rooks on e8 and e1, Knight on c6, and pawns.\n*   **White to move.**\n\nA critical feature of the position is the Black Rook on e1, which puts White's Rook on f1 in an absolute pin against the White King on g1. This means the Rook on f1 cannot move as it would expose its own king to check.\n\nHowever, White has a powerful attacking force with the Queen on d5, Knight on e5, and Bishop on h5, all aimed at the Black King's position. The solution involves a brilliant queen sacrifice to initiate a forced checkmating sequence.\n\n**The Winning Sequence:**\n\nThe shortest path to victory for White is a mate in 4 moves. Here is the step-by-step sequence:\n\n1.  **1. Qxf7+ Kxf7**: White starts with a queen sacrifice. The Black pawn on g7 cannot recapture because it is pinned by White's Bishop on h5. Therefore, the Black King is forced to capture the queen.\n2.  **2. Nd7++ Kg8**: White's Knight moves from e5 to d7, delivering a double check. The Knight itself checks the King, and it also discovers a check from the White Rook on f1 (which is legal as the rook itself does not move). A double check is impossible to block or meet by capturing one of the checking pieces, so the King must move. The only escape square for the Black King is g8.\n3.  **3. Nf6+ Kh8**: White delivers another check with the Knight. The King is forced to its only legal square, h8.\n4.  **4. Bh7#**: White's Bishop moves to h7, delivering the final blow. This is checkmate. The Black King on h8 is attacked by the Bishop, and the escape square g8 is controlled by the White Knight on f6.\n\nBlack cannot prevent this sequence, so White wins in 4 moves.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The plan is to find the shortest forced checkmate sequence for White.\")\n    print(\"The key idea is a queen sacrifice followed by a series of checks.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe winning sequence of moves is as follows:\")\n    \n    moves = [\n        \"1.
