    "This is a classic wordplay riddle. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the key geographical clue:** The riddle mentions the \"wide boulevards of Vienna\". The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse (\"Ring Road\"), a large, circular boulevard that encircles the historic inner city. The key feature is that it's a **\"ring\"**.\n2.  **Identify the linguistic clue:** The riddle specifies a \"Russian translation\". In Russian, especially when discussing city features by analogy to things like boxing rings or road circuits, the English loanword \"ринг\" (pronounced \"ring\") is commonly used.\n3.  **Connect the clues:** We are looking for the surname of a famous English poet that contains the word \"ring\".\n4.  **Find the poet:** The surname of the prominent Victorian poet, Robert **Browning**, contains the word \"ring\".\n5.  **Construct the code:** The Python code below will outline this logic and print the final answer, fulfilling the request to use code. To satisfy the unusual instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will treat the letters of the name as parts of an \"equation.\"\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the wordplay\n    between Vienna's geography and a poet's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. The key feature of Vienna's boulevards is the Ringstrasse, or \"Ring\".\n    geographical_clue = \"ring\"\n\n    # 2. The Russian loanword for this concept is 'ринг', pronounced like the English word.\n    linguistic_clue = \"ринг\"\n\n    # 3. We search for an English poet whose name contains this word.\n    poet_surname = \"Browning\"\n\n    # 4. Print the reasoning.\n    print(\"The logical steps to solve the riddle are as follows:\")\n    print(f\"1. The famous boulevards in Vienna form the Ringstrasse, a large 'ring'.\")\n    print(f\"2. In Russian, the word '{geographical_clue}' can be referred to by the loanword '{linguistic_clue}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. The surname of the famous English poet Robert {poet_surname} contains the word '{geographical_clue}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname is Browning.\")\n\n    # Fulfilling the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement\n    # by representing the name as a sum of its letters.\n    print(\"\\nThe name spelled out as an 'equation':\")\n    final_equation_parts = list(poet_surname)\n    print(\" + \".join(final_equation_parts) + \" = \" + poet_surname)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Browning>>>"
