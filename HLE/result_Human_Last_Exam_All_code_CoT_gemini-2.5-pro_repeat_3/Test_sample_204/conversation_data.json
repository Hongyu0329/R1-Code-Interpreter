    "To solve this problem, we will calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field. The Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be determined using the Whitehead formula, which relates it to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values of the field.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Choose two suitable regular values, `p1` and `p2`, from the target space `S^2`. We will pick two opposite points on the equator, `p1 = (1, 0, 0)` and `p2 = (-1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  Determine the set of points `(x, y, z)` in the domain `R^3` that map to `p1`. This set forms a curve, which we'll call `C1`.\n3.  Similarly, find the preimage of `p2`, which we'll call `C2`.\n4.  Analyze the geometry of the two curves, `C1` and `C2`, in 3D space to calculate their linking number. The linking number will be the Hopf charge.\n\nThe Python code below will guide you through these steps to find the final integer value for the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge by analyzing the preimages of two regular values.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
