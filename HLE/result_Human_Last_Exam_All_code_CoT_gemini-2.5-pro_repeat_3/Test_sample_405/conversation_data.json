    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Allotropes**: I will list the main, stable allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine Colors**: For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color.\n3.  **Count Unique Colors**: I will count the number of distinct colors from the list.\n4.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script that defines these allotropes and their colors, counts the unique colors, and prints the result as a descriptive equation.\n\nThe primary allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus**: White (can appear yellowish)\n*   **Red Phosphorus**: Red\n*   **Violet Phosphorus**: Violet\n*   **Black Phosphorus**: Black\n\nThis gives us four distinct colors to count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and counts them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping major phosphorus allotropes to their colors.\n    phosphorus_allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"White\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's)\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The primary colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    # Using a set to get unique color values from the dictionary\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(phosphorus_allotropes.values())))\n\n    # Create a list of strings for the \"equation\" part\n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n\n    # The final count is the number of unique colors\n    total_count = len(unique_colors)\n\n    # Join the parts to form a descriptive equation string\n    final_equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of distinct colors, we can form the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{final_equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
