# The analysis identifies several lines with errors based on the difference
# between standard Python syntax (used in .py files) and the Sage preparser syntax.
#
# 1. The use of the `^` operator for exponentiation. In a .py file, `^` is the
#    bitwise XOR operator. The correct operator for exponentiation is `**`. This
#    error occurs on lines 11, 29, 30, and 31.
#
# 2. The use of the `/` operator for division. The specification requires precise,
#    non-floating point results (e.g., exact fractions like 1/3). When dividing a
#    Python integer by a Python integer in Python 3, the `/` operator performs
#    floating-point division. This will produce a float (e.g., 0.333...) instead
#    of an exact rational number, which violates the specification and does not
#    match the sample output. This error occurs on lines 22 and 23.

error_lines = [11, 22, 23, 29, 30, 31]
error_lines.sort()

# The final output should be an ordered list of these line numbers with no whitespaces.
# The json.dumps function with separators=(',', ':') is a reliable way to format it.
# However, a simple print of the list also produces the required format.
