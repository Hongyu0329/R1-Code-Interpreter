    # The core problem: With only a phylogeny of extant species, different time-varying
    # speciation (lambda) and extinction (mu) rates can produce the same likelihood.
    # This makes lambda(t) and mu(t) unidentifiable.

    # Analysis of the options:
    # A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:
    #    This is a form of regularization. Simplifying the model by constraining its
    #    flexibility is a common strategy to make inference more stable. This HELPS.
    #
    # B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:
    #    Priors add information where the likelihood is flat, which is the definition
    #    of an identifiability problem. This is a standard statistical solution. This HELPS.
    #
    # C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:
    #    This dramatically increases model complexity and flexibility (60 parameters for
    #    speciation, 60 for extinction). An over-parameterized model exacerbates
    #    identifiability issues, as it creates more ways to fit the data equally well.
    #    This does NOT HELP.
    #
    # D. & F. Incorporating fossils:
    #    Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages, which is the key information
    #    missing from extant-only phylogenies. This directly constrains the extinction
    #    rate and breaks the identifiability problem. This HELPS.
    #
    # E. & G. Reparametrizing the model to infer pulled rates:
    #    Research shows that while lambda(t) and mu(t) are not identifiable, certain
    #    combinations ("pulled" rates) are. Focusing inference on these identifiable
    #    quantities is a direct solution to the problem. This HELPS.

    # Conclusion: Increasing model complexity is counterproductive for solving
    # an identifiability problem.

    print("The strategy that does NOT help mitigate the identifiability issue is C.")
    print("Reasoning: Fitting a highly complex and flexible model, such as one defined by high-degree polynomials, exacerbates the identifiability problem. It increases the number of parameters and allows for a wider range of different rate histories to explain the data equally well, making the inference less reliable. All other options either add new information (fossils, priors), simplify the model (piecewise constant), or focus on the identifiable parts of the model (reparametrization).")
