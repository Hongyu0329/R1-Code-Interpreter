# The user wants me to select the best answer from the provided choices.
# Based on the legal analysis of the four points in the prompt:
# 1. Bryan's covenants (non-compete/non-solicit) are enforceable due to his executive status (CEO) and the sale-of-business context, which are exceptions to the general ban on non-competes in Ontario.
# 2. Ryan's covenants are likely unenforceable. Although it's part of a business sale, his role as a "Shift Manager" is non-executive. A court would likely find a province-wide non-compete unreasonable for such a position.
# 3. The new employees' non-compete clauses are unenforceable under Ontario's Working for Workers Act, as they are not executives and not part of a business sale. However, this does not invalidate their entire employment agreements; the clause is just severed.
# 4. Bryan's promise to give Stan the truck is a gratuitous promise (a promise to make a gift) without consideration from Stan. Therefore, it is not a legally enforceable contract.

# Let's review the options:
# A: Bryan's enforceable, Ryan's not. New employee agreements valid but non-compete unenforceable. Truck not required. This aligns perfectly with the analysis.
# B: Claims Ryan's clauses are enforceable. This is less likely due to his non-executive role.
# C: Claims the new employees' agreements are entirely invalid. This is incorrect due to the principle of severability.
# D: Claims Bryan is required to transfer the truck. This is incorrect due to a lack of consideration.
# E: Claims Bryan's clauses are invalid and he is required to transfer the truck. Both points are incorrect.

# The best answer is A.
