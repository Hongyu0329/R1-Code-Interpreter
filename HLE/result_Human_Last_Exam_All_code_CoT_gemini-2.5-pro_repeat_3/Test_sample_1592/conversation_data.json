    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, excluding Quebec itself, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the geographic coordinates** (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish.\n2.  **Gather the coordinates of a representative point for each of the other Canadian provinces and territories.** Since Waskaganish is located on the southern coast of James Bay, the most relevant point for Ontario is a nearby town on the same bay, like Moosonee, rather than its distant capital, Toronto. For other provinces and territories, their capital cities will serve as suitable representative points.\n3.  **Calculate the distance** between Waskaganish and each of these representative points using the Haversine formula, which accurately calculates the distance between two points on a sphere (the Earth).\n4.  **Compare the calculated distances** to find the minimum one, thereby identifying the closest province or territory.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan. It will define the locations and their coordinates, calculate the distances, and print the name of the closest province.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))\n    # Radius of earth in kilometers. Use 6371 for kilometers\n    r = 6371\n    return c * r\n\ndef find_closest_province():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC (excluding Quebec).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish_lat = 51.48\n    waskaganish_lon = -78.76\n\n    # Coordinates for representative cities in other provinces and territories\n    # Note: Using Moosonee for Ontario as it is geographically much closer than Toronto.\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": (51.27, -80.64), # Moosonee\n        \"New Brunswick\": (45.96, -66.64), # Fredericton\n        \"Nova Scotia\": (44.64, -63.57), # Halifax\n        \"Manitoba\": (49.89, -97.13), # Winnipeg\n        \"British Columbia\": (48.42, -123.36), # Victoria\n        \"Prince Edward Island\": (46.23, -63.12), # Charlottetown\n        \"Saskatchewan\": (50.44, -104.61), # Regina\n        \"Alberta\": (53.54, -113.49), # Edmonton\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (47.56, -52.71), # St. John's\n        \"Northwest Territories\": (62.45, -114.37), # Yellowknife\n        \"Yukon\": (60.72, -135.05), # Whitehorse\n        \"Nunavut\": (63.75, -68.52) # Iqaluit\n    }\n\n    closest_province = None\n    min_distance = float('inf')\n\n    for province, (lat, lon) in locations.items():\n        distance = haversine(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, lat, lon)\n        if distance < min_distance:\n            min_distance = distance\n            closest_province = province\n\n    print(f\"The Waskaganish gathering place is located at latitude {waskaganish_lat} and longitude {waskaganish_lon}.\")\n    print(\"Calculating distances to other provinces and territories...\")\n    print(f\"The closest province/territory to Waskaganish (outside of Quebec) is {closest_province}.\")\n    print(f\"The approximate distance to the nearest point in {closest_province} (Moosonee) is {min_distance:.2f} km.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closest_province()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
