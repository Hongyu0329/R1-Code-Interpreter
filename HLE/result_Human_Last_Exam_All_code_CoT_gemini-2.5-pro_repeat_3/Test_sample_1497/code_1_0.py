    This function determines the parameter groups associated with variations in violin playing technique and environment.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  'sul ponticello' (variation 1) enhances high harmonics from the string, which is controlled by nu (group ii).
    2.  A bridge mute (variation 2) adds mass to the bridge, lowering the main wood resonance frequency f_1 (group iii). The direction of change for f_1 is 'down'.
    3.  A helium environment (variation 3) increases the speed of sound, raising the frequency of the internal air resonance f_2 (group iv).
    4.  Changing to the E string (variation 4) alters the fundamental open-string frequency F (group i).
