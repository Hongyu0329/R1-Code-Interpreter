    # Step 1: Define the point 'a' and understand its location in the space X.
    # The space X is a specific subset of R^3.
    # The point a is (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0).
    # The space X contains the set {0} x P, where P is a shape in the y-z plane.
    # The shape P contains the line segment [0,1] x {0} (in y,z coordinates).
    # The point (y, z) = (1, 0) is on this segment.
    # Therefore, a = (0, 1, 0) is a point in X.
    # Geometrically, 'a' is a "dead-end" point; it lies at the end of a line
    # segment and is not a branching point of the space X.

    # Step 2: Identify the set whose components we need to count.
    # The set, let's call it K, is the intersection of ALL compact, connected
    # neighborhoods of the point 'a' within the space X.
    # Let N be such a neighborhood. N must be:
    #  - A subset of X
    #  - Compact (i.e., closed and bounded in R^3)
    #  - Connected
    #  - A neighborhood of 'a' (i.e., it must contain an open set around 'a')

    # Step 3: Determine which points belong to the set K.
    # A point 'b' is in K if and only if it belongs to EVERY set N that
    # satisfies the conditions above.
    # We can prove that K contains only the point 'a' by showing that for any
    # other point b in X (where b is not a), we can construct a valid
    # neighborhood N of 'a' that does not contain 'b'.

    # Step 4: Construct a neighborhood to exclude any other point 'b'.
    # Let 'b' be any point in X such that b is not equal to 'a'.
    # Let d be the Euclidean distance between a and b. Since b is not a, d > 0.
    #
    # Now, let's define a set N_b = {p in X such that distance(p, a) <= d / 2}.
    #
    # Let's check if N_b is a valid neighborhood for our intersection:
    # 1. Is it a neighborhood of 'a'? Yes, it contains the open set
    #    {p in X | distance(p, a) < d/2}, which contains 'a'.
    # 2. Is it compact? Yes. X is a closed and bounded set, so it's compact.
    #    N_b is the intersection of X and a closed ball, so N_b is also closed
    #    and bounded, hence compact.
    # 3. Is it connected? Yes. The point 'a' lies on a simple line segment.
    #    The intersection of a small enough ball with this part of X is just a
    #    smaller piece of that line segment. A line segment is connected.
    #
    # Does N_b contain the point 'b'?
    # No, because the distance from 'a' to any point in N_b is at most d/2,
    # but the distance from 'a' to 'b' is d.
    #
    # This means for any point 'b' other than 'a', we found a compact connected
    # neighborhood of 'a' that excludes 'b'.

    # Step 5: Conclude what the set K is.
    # Since any point b != a can be excluded from the intersection, the only
    # point that must be in the intersection is 'a' itself.
    # Therefore, the set K is the singleton set {a}.
    # K = {(0, 1, 0)}

    # Step 6: Count the number of components of K.
    # The set K contains a single point. A set consisting of a single point is
    # connected.
    # Therefore, the set has exactly one connected component.
