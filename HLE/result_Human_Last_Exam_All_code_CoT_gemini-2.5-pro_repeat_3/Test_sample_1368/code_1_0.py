def solve_inscribed_square():
    """
    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square
    inscribed in a circle, given the circle's center and a point on its circumference.

    The construction steps are as follows:
    1.  (L)ine: Draw a line through the center and the given point on the circumference
        to define the first diameter. This gives two vertices of the square (A and C).
    2.  (C)ircle: Draw a circle centered at vertex A, with a radius defined by the
        distance to the opposite vertex C.
    3.  (C)ircle: Draw a second circle centered at vertex C, with a radius defined by
        the distance to vertex A.
    4.  (L)ine: The two circles from the previous steps intersect at two new points.
        Draw a line through these two points. This line is the perpendicular
        bisector of the first diameter and serves as the second diameter.

    The intersections of these two diameters with the original circle form the
    four vertices of the inscribed square. The command sequence is LCCL.
