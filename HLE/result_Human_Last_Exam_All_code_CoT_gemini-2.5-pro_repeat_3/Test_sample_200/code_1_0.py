def solve_dice_problem():
    """
    Calculates the expected number of rolls for a specific sequence pattern.

    The problem defines a target sequence of dice rolls based on a sequence of
    integers a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] where n is odd, a_1 = 1, and the
    sequence is strictly increasing. The pattern is a_1 rolls of face 2,
    a_2 rolls of face 3, a_3 rolls of face 2, and so on.

    The expected number of rolls E is calculated based on the "overlap" method.
    The general formula is E = sum(N^k) for all k where the prefix of length k
    matches the suffix of length k.

    For this specific pattern, we've deduced that overlaps only occur for:
    1. k = L (the full sequence), contributing N^L to the sum.
    2. k = 1 (the first roll matches the last), contributing N^1 to the sum.

    If n=1, then L=1, and these two cases are the same.
    If n>1, then L>1, and they are distinct cases.
