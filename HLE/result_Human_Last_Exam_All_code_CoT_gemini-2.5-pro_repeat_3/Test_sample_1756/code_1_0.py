    # A list of letters corresponding to the correct statements, sorted lexicographically.
    # A: Correct. The effective sampling pool is the intersection of top-k and nucleus sets, which is the more restrictive result.
    # C: Correct. Temperature scaling (Ï„ > 1) alters the probability distribution, so the nucleus set calculated on this new distribution can contain different tokens.
    # E: Correct. When re-normalizing a subset of probabilities, the common normalization factor cancels out in ratios, preserving relative probabilities.
    # G: Correct. Standard implementations find the intersection of candidate sets from top-k and nucleus sampling, and intersection is a commutative operation.
    # M: Correct. Determinism "can be" achieved, even with MoE, by using framework-specific functions that enforce deterministic algorithms for all operations.
    # O: Correct. Different GPU hardware can produce different floating-point results, leading to non-reproducibility.
    # P: Correct. If expert pruning is non-deterministic (e.g., based on runtime values), it will lead to different output distributions across runs.
    # R: Correct. Variable padding can affect GPU kernel scheduling, changing the order of floating-point operations and causing non-deterministic outputs.
    # X: Correct. The order of summation in attention's softmax can vary due to parallel scheduling, leading to numerical differences that can alter beam search paths.
    # Y: Correct. Recomputing activations is not guaranteed to be bit-perfect, which can alter the final sampling distribution.
