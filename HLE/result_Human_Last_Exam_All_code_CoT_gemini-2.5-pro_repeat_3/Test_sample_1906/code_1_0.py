    print("    - It has a 'zero object', 0, which is both initial and terminal.")
    print("    - All Hom-sets, Hom(A, B), are abelian groups.")
    print("  - C is a cartesian closed category (CCC):")
    print("    - It has all finite products, including a terminal object (which must be 0).")
    print("    - For any objects Y and Z, an 'exponential object' Z^Y exists.")
    print("    - This implies a natural isomorphism: Hom(X x Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y) for all X, Y, Z.")

    print("Step 2: Combine the properties to derive a consequence.")
    print("  - Start with the CCC isomorphism: Hom(X x Y, Z) ≅ Hom(X, Z^Y).")
    print("  - Let the object X be the zero object 0.")
    print("  - The isomorphism becomes: Hom(0 x Y, Z) ≅ Hom(0, Z^Y).")

    print("Step 3: Simplify the left side of the isomorphism.")
    print("  - In a category with a terminal object (here, 0), the product of any object Y with the terminal object is isomorphic to Y itself.")
    print("  - So, 0 x Y ≅ Y.")
    print("  - Substituting this back, we get: Hom(Y, Z) ≅ Hom(0, Z^Y).")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Analyze the right side of the isomorphism.")
    print("  - Hom(0, Z^Y) is the set of morphisms from the initial object 0 to the object Z^Y.")
    print("  - Because C is abelian, this Hom-set is an abelian group.")
    print("  - By definition of an initial object, there is exactly one morphism from 0 to any other object.")
    print("  - A group with only one element is the trivial group, {0}.")
    print("  - Therefore, Hom(0, Z^Y) is the trivial group.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 5: State the main conclusion.")
    print("  - Since Hom(Y, Z) is isomorphic to the trivial group, Hom(Y, Z) must also be the trivial group.")
    print("  - This holds for ALL objects Y and Z in the category C.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 6: Explore the implications of the conclusion.")
    print("  - If Hom(Y, Z) is always the trivial group, it means there is only one morphism between any two objects.")
    print("  - Let's consider the endomorphisms of an object Y, which is the group Hom(Y, Y).")
    print("  - This group must be trivial. It contains the identity morphism, id_Y, and the zero morphism, 0_{Y,Y}.")
    print("  - For the group to be trivial, these must be the same element: id_Y = 0_{Y,Y}.")
    print("  - In an abelian category, if the identity morphism of an object Y is equal to the zero morphism, then Y itself must be a zero object.")
    print("  - Since this is true for any object Y, every object in C is a zero object.")

    print("Step 7: Final Characterization.")

    print("  G. It has rich structural properties. (False, it is structurally the simplest possible category).")
    print("  H. It is initial in the 2-category of categories. (False, it is the terminal category).")
