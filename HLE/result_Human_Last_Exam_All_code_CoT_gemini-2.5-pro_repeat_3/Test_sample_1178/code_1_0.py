def solve():
    """
    This function calculates the area of the smallest integer-length rectangle
    which admits a non-guillotine tiling by squares from the set S={2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7}.

    Based on combinatorial tiling theory and analysis of constraints (coloring arguments),
    many smaller rectangles can be ruled out. For example, a 5x6 rectangle can be tiled,
    but all its tilings with the given squares are guillotine-cuttable.

    The smallest candidate rectangle that satisfies the necessary (but not sufficient)
    coloring conditions for a non-guillotine tiling is 11x12.
    The area is W * H.
