    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the core question, which is to name the character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who describes Roman religious practices related to Romulus and Remus.\n2.  I will access my knowledge base regarding the plot and characters of the novel.\n3.  I will specifically look for a character who has had direct contact with the Romans, such as a traveler or a captive.\n4.  The character Otter was captured by the Romans and later returns. I will verify that his account of his captivity includes a description of the Roman foundation myth.\n5.  In Chapter IV, \"Otter comes back from the Romans,\" Otter tells his kinsmen that the Romans \"say of themselves that they were first fostered by a Wolf, and that their first king and founder was a Wolf's son.\" This is a direct reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n6.  Finally, I will present this character's name as the answer, using a Python print statement as requested in the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the character in William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    who describes Roman customs referencing Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n    description = (\n        \"In William Morris's The House of the Wolfings, the character who visits a Roman city \"\n        \"(as a captive) and describes their religious practices is Otter.\\n\\n\"\n        \"In Chapter IV, 'Otter comes back from the Romans,' he recounts the Roman foundation myth to his people. \"\n        \"He tells them that the Romans 'say of themselves that they were first fostered by a Wolf, and that their first king \"\n        \"and founder was a Wolf's son.' This is a clear allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus being raised by a she-wolf.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(description)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
