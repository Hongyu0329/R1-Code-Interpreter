    "This sequence is quite tricky as it does not follow a simple mathematical rule for all its terms. However, a common pattern in such puzzles is that the next term is generated by adding a value derived from the current term's digits.\n\nLet's explore the hypothesis that the next number in the sequence is the current number plus the sum of its own digits.\nLet `n_k` be the k-th number in the sequence, and `S(n)` be the sum of the digits of `n`. The hypothesis is `n_{k+1} = n_k + S(n_k)`.\n\nWhile this rule does not hold for every step in the provided sequence, it is a straightforward and common type of rule for such puzzles. Let's apply it to the last number in the sequence to predict the next one.\n\nThe last number is 2352.\n1.  First, we calculate the sum of its digits: 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n2.  Then, we add this sum to the number itself: 2352 + 12 = 2364.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the resulting equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the sum of the digits\n    of the last number to itself.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_number = 2352\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the digits of the last number\n    sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(last_number))\n    \n    # Calculate the next number\n    next_number = last_number + sum_of_digits\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested\n    print(f\"{last_number} + {sum_of_digits} = {next_number}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<2364>>>"
