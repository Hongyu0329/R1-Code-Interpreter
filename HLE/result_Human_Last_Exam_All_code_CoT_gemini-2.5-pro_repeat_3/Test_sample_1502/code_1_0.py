    # --- Question (a) Analysis ---
    # The question is: True or false: The energy J_t becomes unbounded from below as t -> +infinity
    # if p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s).
    #
    # We test this by applying the scaling u_t(x, y) = t^((1+s)/2) * u(t^s * x, t * y) to J_t.
    # We can choose a specific function u(x, y) that is non-zero and has a zero partial derivative
    # with respect to y, i.e., u(x, y) = f(x). For this function:
    # The H^{1,s} norm squared ||u_t||^2_{H^{1,s}} scales with t as:
    # ||u_t||^2_{H^{1,s}} = t^{2s} * integral(|d/dx u|^2) + integral(|u|^2) which behaves like C1 * t^{2s} for large t.
    #
    # The L^p norm to the power p, ||u_t||^p_{L^p}, scales with t as:
    # ||u_t||^p_{L^p} = t^((s+1)(p/2 - 1)) * ||u||^p_{L^p} which behaves like C2 * t^((s+1)(p/2 - 1)).
    #
    # The functional J(u_t, 0) behaves like: A*t^{2s} - B*t^((s+1)(p/2 - 1)).
    # For J to go to -infinity, the exponent of the negative term must be larger:
    # (s+1)(p/2 - 1) > 2s  --->  p/2 > 2s/(s+1) + 1  --->  p > 2 * ( (3s+1)/(s+1) )
    # This matches the condition. So, we can find a path to negative infinity.
    answer_a = "True"

    # --- Question (b) Analysis ---
    # The question is: Given J_t(u, v) has a mountain pass geometry, does the existence
    # of a critical point imply the existence of a positive ground state solution?
    #
    # 1. The Mountain Pass Theorem provides a critical point, but not necessarily the one with the lowest energy.
    # 2. A "ground state" is a solution with the minimum energy among all non-trivial solutions.
    # 3. The existence of a critical point from MPT does not guarantee a ground state exists, especially on
    #    unbounded domains like R^2 where lack of compactness is a major issue.
    # 4. Even if a ground state exists, it is not automatically positive (u>=0, v>=0).
    answer_b = "No"

    # --- Question (c) Analysis ---
    # The question is: If r_1 + r_2 lies in the range (2, 2s), does the minimisation of J_t over
    # P(a,b) yield a unique solution?
    #
    # 1. P(a,b) is the set of functions with fixed L^2 norms, a common constraint for finding stable solutions.
    # 2. The condition r_1 + r_2 in (2, 2s) is a sub-critical growth condition, which is typically
    #    used to prove the *existence* of a minimizer, not its uniqueness.
    # 3. The functional J_t is not convex due to the potential energy terms. Non-convex problems can
    #    have multiple minimizers.
    # 4. For systems of equations, multiple distinct solutions often exist and can be minimizers.
    #    Therefore, uniqueness is not expected without much stronger assumptions.
    answer_c = "No"
