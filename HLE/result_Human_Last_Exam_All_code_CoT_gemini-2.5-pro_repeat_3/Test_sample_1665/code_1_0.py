    print("A stronger field at the far end is achieved by guiding the magnetic flux. The following scenarios provide this effect:\n")

    print("Scenario 1: Ferromagnetic cylinder")
    print("Analysis: Ferromagnetic materials have high permeability and concentrate magnetic field lines.")
    print("Result: The cylinder acts as a 'flux guide', channeling the field. This makes the field at the far end STRONGER than in air.\n")

    print("Scenario 2: Hollow ideal superconducting tube")
    print("Analysis: Superconductors expel magnetic fields (Meissner effect). The walls of the tube confine the field to the hollow core.")
    print("Result: This confinement guides the flux. This makes the field at the far end STRONGER than in air.\n")

    print("Scenario 3: Ferromagnetic core, superconducting shell")
    print("Analysis: The ferromagnetic core gathers flux, and the superconducting shell prevents any flux from leaking out.")
    print("Result: This is the most effective flux guide, resulting in the STRONGEST field of all scenarios.\n")

    print("Scenario 4: Superconducting core, ferromagnetic shell")
    print("Analysis: The ferromagnetic shell guides the flux, but the superconducting core expels the field from the center.")
    print("Result: Flux is guided in an annular region. While less efficient than other guides, it is still STRONGER than in air.\n")
