    This function calculates the value of foo(7) based on mathematical analysis.
    The original foo(n) function counts the number of group structures on a set of n elements.
    For n=7 (a prime number), there is only one group structure up to isomorphism, the cyclic group Z_7.
    The number of distinct multiplication tables for a group G on n labeled elements is n! / |Aut(G)|.
    For G = Z_7, |Aut(Z_7)| is given by Euler's totient function phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6.
