    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule from its SMILES string, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Parse SMILES and Generate 3D Structure**: The SMILES string represents the 2D connectivity of the molecule. I will use the `rdkit` library to convert this into a 3D molecular structure. This involves adding hydrogen atoms, generating an initial 3D conformation, and then optimizing its geometry using the MMFF94 force field to find a stable, low-energy shape. A realistic 3D structure is essential for correct symmetry determination.\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis**: Once I have the 3D coordinates of all atoms, I will use the `pymatgen` library, which has powerful tools for symmetry analysis. The molecule appears to be a highly symmetric, planar aromatic system with three identical ethynyl substituents, which suggests a high-symmetry point group.\n3.  **Determine Point Group**: I'll create a `pymatgen` Molecule object from the atom types and their 3D coordinates obtained from `rdkit`. Then, the `PointGroupAnalyzer` from `pymatgen` will analyze the molecular geometry and determine its Schoenflies point group symbol (e.g., C2v, D3h, Td).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. You will need to have `rdkit` and `pymatgen` installed (`pip install rdkit pymatgen`) to run it.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from pymatgen.core import Molecule\n    from pymatgen.symmetry.analyzer import PointGroupAnalyzer\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the required libraries: pip install rdkit pymatgen\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef get_molecule_point_group(smiles_string: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the point group of a molecule from its SMILES string.\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string: The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n\n    Returns:\n        The Schoenflies symbol of the point group as a string, or an error message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a molecule object from the SMILES string\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if mol is None:\n        return \"Error: Could not parse the SMILES string.\"\n\n    # Add hydrogens to the molecule\n    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Generate a 3D conformation.
