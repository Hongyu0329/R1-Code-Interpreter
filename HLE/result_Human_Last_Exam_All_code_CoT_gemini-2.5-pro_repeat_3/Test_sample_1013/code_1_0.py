    print("--- Step 1: Finding an Upper Bound ---")
    print("Any ultrafilter U below V must be of the form U = f(V) for some function f.")

    print("1. Take an 'almost disjoint family' of infinite subsets of N, {A_i | i in I}, with |I| = c. 'Almost disjoint' means that for any i != j, the intersection of A_i and A_j is finite.")

    print("3. For each set A_i from our family, we define a function f_i. The function f_i's behavior on an interval I_n depends on whether n belongs to A_i:")

    print("Suppose U_i <= U_j for i != j. This implies f_i = h(f_j) on a set S in V for some function h.")
    print("Since A_i and A_j are different, there are infinitely many indices n where they differ.")
    print("The ultrafilter V forces the condition f_i = h(f_j) to hold on intervals I_n where A_i and A_j differ.")
    print("- If n is in A_i but not A_j, f_i is quadratic and f_j is cubic. The function h would need to behave like h(x) ~ x^(2/3).")

    print("We have constructed an antichain of size c, establishing a lower bound of c.")
