    Calculates the smallest possible value for the size of the union of the sets.
    
    Let n be the number of sets, and k be the size of each set.
    The problem states n = 2024 and k = 45.
    The condition |A_i ∩ A_j| = 1 for i ≠ j, as explained in the text,
    forces a structure where one element is common to all sets, and all other
    elements are unique to their respective sets.
    
    The size of the union is therefore 1 (for the common element) plus the sum
    of the sizes of the unique parts of each set. Each set has k-1 unique elements.
    So, the total size is 1 + n * (k - 1).
