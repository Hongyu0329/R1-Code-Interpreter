# Problem parameters
L = 24  # Minimum number of points per cluster

# Based on the analysis, the minimum size of S is N, where the local-max property occurs at k=2.
k = 2
N = (k + 1) * L

print(f"The minimum size of the set S is N = (k+1) * L = ({k}+1) * {L} = {N}.")

# For any instance C in Q, |S|=N=72, and the local-max is at k=2.
# We need to find w_C, the max overlap between clusters from an optimal (k-1)-clustering and a (k+1)-clustering.

# The (k-1) = 1-clustering has one cluster, K_1, which must be the entire set S.
# |K_1| = N = 72

# The (k+1) = 3-clustering partitions S into three clusters: K'_1, K'_2, K'_3.
# The sizes of these clusters (s1, s2, s3) must satisfy:
# 1. s1 + s2 + s3 = N
# 2. s_j >= L for j=1, 2, 3

# As derived in the explanation, the only integer solution is s1=s2=s3=L.
s1 = L
s2 = L
s3 = L

print(f"The sizes of the three clusters in the optimal 3-clustering must be {s1}, {s2}, and {s3}.")

# w_C is the maximum size of any of these three clusters.
w_C = max(s1, s2, s3)

print(f"For any instance C in Q, w_C is given by the maximum of these sizes.")
print(f"w_C = max({s1}, {s2}, {s3}) = {w_C}")

# The question asks for the minimum of w_C over all possible instances C in Q.
# Since w_C is a constant value of 24 for any valid instance, the minimum is also 24.
min_w_C = w_C

print(f"\nSince w_C is always {w_C}, the minimum value is also {min_w_C}.")
