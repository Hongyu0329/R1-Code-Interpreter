    "Here is a plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Convert Roman Numerals to Modern Numbers**: First, I will translate each Roman numeral in the equation (`CL`, `CCC`, `CXXXI`) into its corresponding modern (Arabic) number.\n2.  **Perform the Calculation**: Next, I will substitute these numbers back into the equation and solve it, following the standard order of operations (division before subtraction).\n3.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will create a Python script that performs the calculation and prints the complete equation with the solution.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the numbers based on the Roman numerals\n# CL = 100 + 50 = 150\n# CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n# CXXXI = 100 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 131\nnum1 = 150\nnum2 = 300\nnum3 = 131\n\n# 2. Perform the calculation following the order of operations (division first)\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# 3. Print the final equation with the answer\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-130.5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
