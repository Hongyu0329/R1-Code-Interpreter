    "An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the fewest possible turns. Since it is O's turn, we first look for any move that results in an immediate win (a \"win in 1\"). If no such move exists, we then search for moves that set up a \"forced win\" on O's next turn (a \"win in 3\" total moves for O, X, O). A forced win occurs when O makes a move that creates threats the opponent (X) cannot fully block, guaranteeing a win for O on their subsequent turn.\n\nHere is the plan to find the optimal moves:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: Create a 2D list (6 rows by 7 columns) to represent the current state of the Connect 4 board.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins**: Iterate through all legal moves for player 'O'. For each move, simulate placing an 'O' piece and check if this creates a line of four. If it does, that move is a \"win in 1\".\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins**: If no immediate wins are found, iterate through each of O's legal moves again. For each potential move by 'O':\n    a. Simulate O's move on a temporary board.\n    b. Then, for that board state, consider **every** possible legal response from player 'X'.\n    c. For each of X's responses, check if 'O' now has at least one winning move.\n    d. If 'O' has a winning move available regardless of what 'X' does, the initial move by 'O' is a \"forced win\" and is therefore an optimal move.\n4.  **Output the Results**: Collect all optimal moves found and print them in the specified format.\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic to analyze the board and find all optimal moves for 'O'.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef find_optimal_connect4_moves():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a specific Connect 4 board to find the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n    An optimal move is one that secures a win in the minimum number of turns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board representation: rows 0-5 (top to bottom), cols 0-6 (left to right)\n    # The image's Row 1 is index 0, Row 6 is index 5.\n    # Column 'a' is index 0, 'g' is index 6.\n    initial_board = [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    ]\n    player_o = 'O'\n    player_x = 'X'\n    rows, cols = 6, 7\n\n    def get_next_available_row(board, col):\n        for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            if board[r][col] == '.':\n                return r\n        return -1\n\n    def make_move(board, col, player):\n        temp_board = copy.deepcopy(board)\n        row = get_next_available_row(temp_board, col)\n        if row != -1:\n            temp_board[row][col] = player\n        return temp_board\n\n    def check_win(board, player):\n        # Check horizontal\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check vertical\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for r in range(rows - 3):\n                if all(board[r+i][c] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal / (bottom-left to top-right)\n        for r in range(3, rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r-i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal \\ (top-left to bottom-right)\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r+i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def get_legal_moves(board):\n        return [c for c in range(cols) if get_next_available_row(board, c) != -1]\n\n    def col_to_letter(col):\n        return chr(ord('a') + col)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for immediate wins (win in 1 move).\n    # Based on analysis, none exist, but we check to be thorough.\n    winning_moves_in_1 = []\n    for move_col in get_legal_moves(initial_board):\n        board_after_move = make_move(initial_board, move_col, player_o)\n        if check_win(board_after_move, player_o):\n            winning_moves_in_1.append(col_to_letter(move_col))\n    \n    if winning_moves_in_1:\n        print(\", \".join(sorted(winning_moves_in_1)))\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Check for forced wins in 3 moves (O -> X -> O win).\n    winning_moves_in_3 = []\n    for move_o1_col in get_legal_moves(initial_board):\n        board_after_o1 = make_move(initial_board, move_o1_col, player_o)\n        \n        is_forcing_move = True\n        opponent_legal_moves = get_legal_moves(board_after_o1)\n\n        if not opponent_legal_moves:\n            continue\n\n        for move_x_col in opponent_legal_moves:\n            board_after_x = make_move(board_after_o1, move_x_col, player_x)\n            \n            o_can_win = False\n            for move_o2_col in get_legal_moves(board_after_x):\n                board_after_o2 = make_move(board_after_x, move_o2_col, player_o)\n                if check_win(board_after_o2, player_o):\n                    o_can_win = True\n                    break\n            \n            if not o_can_win:\n                is_forcing_move = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_forcing_move:\n            winning_moves_in_3.append(col_to_letter(move_o1_col))\n\n    print(\", \".join(sorted(winning_moves_in_3)))\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the optimal moves.\nfind_optimal_connect4_moves()\n```\n<<<c, f>>>"
