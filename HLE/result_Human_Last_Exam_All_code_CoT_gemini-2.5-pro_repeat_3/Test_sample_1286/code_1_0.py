    The fundamental difference between how children and LLMs learn language is the source of their data. Children learn through multi-modal, embodied experiences (sight, sound, touch), grounding words in the real world. LLMs learn exclusively from uni-modal text data, detecting statistical patterns between words.

    Concrete words (e.g., 'cup', 'ball', 'dog') refer to tangible objects that a child can see, touch, and interact with.

    LLMs cannot see or touch a 'cup'. They learn its meaning from text alone. The meaning of an abstract word (e.g., 'idea', 'justice') is defined by its complex relationships with other words in the text, providing rich linguistic context for the LLM to learn from. Conversely, the contexts for concrete words are often simpler, and their full meaning is dependent on the real-world referent that the LLM cannot access. This lack of rich, self-contained textual context makes concrete words statistically harder for a text-only model to learn, resulting in a negative effect during pre-training.
