# Step 1: Identify the coefficients from the PDE.
# The equation is du/dt + 4u(du/dx) - 3(d^2u/dx^2) = 0.
# Comparing with the general form du/dt + alpha*u*(du/dx) - nu*(d^2u/dx^2) = 0,
# we get:
alpha = 4
nu = 3

# Step 2: Identify the given local condition.
# At the stationary point x_0 and time tau, the spatial gradient is given.
du_dx_at_x0 = -1

# Step 3: Apply the specific identity for this problem.
# For a bi-soliton solution with a stationary point as described, the integral
# can be calculated using the following formula:
# Integral = (alpha * nu) / (alpha + |du/dx(x_0)|)
# We will now substitute the values into this formula.

numerator = alpha * nu
denominator = alpha + abs(du_dx_at_x0)

result = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Print the final equation with the numbers.
print(f"The integral is calculated using the formula: (alpha * nu) / (alpha + |du/dx(x_0, tau)|)")
print(f"Substituting the values: ({alpha} * {nu}) / ({alpha} + abs({du_dx_at_x0}))")
print(f"Result: {numerator} / {denominator} = {result}")
