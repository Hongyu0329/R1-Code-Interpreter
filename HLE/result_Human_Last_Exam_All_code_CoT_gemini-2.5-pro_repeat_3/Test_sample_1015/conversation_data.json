    "To determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, I will write a Python script that analyzes the core principles of each technique for this specific movement.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Store Knowledge:** I will create a data structure (a dictionary) in Python to hold the key characteristics of a cambré derrière in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n2.  **Define Answer Choices:** I will list the provided multiple-choice options in the script for clarity.\n3.  **Analyze and Compare:** The script will print the descriptions for each method, highlighting the main points of divergence.\n4.  **Identify the Best Answer:** By comparing the key differences with the given options, the script will identify and explain why one option is the most accurate and fundamental distinction.\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will conclude by printing the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    and selects the best answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the characteristics of each method for cambré derrière.\n    techniques = {\n        \"Vaganova\": {\n            \"description\": \"Emphasizes a strict, formal line.
