def compute_clique_number():
    """
    This function provides the result of the mathematical derivation for the clique number.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A 2-clique can be constructed. Consider the real numbers 1, 2, and 3.
       The directed graph G contains the edges e1 = (1, 2) and e2 = (2, 3).
       These edges are vertices in the line graph X.
       The head of e1 is 2, and the tail of e2 is 2. Because they match,
       the vertices e1 and e2 are adjacent in X.
       Therefore, {e1, e2} is a 2-clique, and the clique number is at least 2.

    2. A 3-clique is impossible. Let {e1, e2, e3} be a 3-clique, where
       e_i = (u_i, v_i) and u_i < v_i.
       The adjacency condition (for any i!=j, v_i=u_j or v_j=u_i) requires
       the connections to form a tournament on {1,2,3}.
       - If the tournament is a cycle (e.g., v1=u2, v2=u3, v3=u1), the
         order conditions u1<v1, v1<v2, v2<u1 lead to a contradiction: u1 < u1.
       - If the tournament is transitive (e.g., v1=u2, v1=u3, v2=u3), this implies
         v1=v2. The edge e2 would be (u2, v2) = (v1, v1), which violates the
         condition u2 < v2.

    Since a 3-clique cannot exist, the maximum clique size is 2.
