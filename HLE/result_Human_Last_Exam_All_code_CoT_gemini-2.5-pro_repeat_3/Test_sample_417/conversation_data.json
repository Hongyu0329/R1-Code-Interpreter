    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule**: The molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core and three identical, chiral substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 via methylene (-CH2-) linkers.\n2.  **Analyze Symmetry**: The molecule has a C3 axis of rotation through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large substituent arms (and their corresponding linker groups) chemically equivalent. It also makes the three methyl groups on the central ring equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals in the central core/linker and in *one* of the substituent arms.\n3.  **Count Signals from the Core and Linker**:\n    *   **Mesitylene Methyls**: The three methyl groups on the benzene ring are equivalent due to C3 symmetry. This will produce one signal.\n    *   **Methylene Linkers (-CH2-)**: The three linker groups are equivalent. However, each linker is attached to a chiral substituent. This makes the two protons on a single -CH2- group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. This will produce two signals.\n    *   Total from core/linker = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n4.  **Count Signals from one Substituent Arm**:\n    *   The arm, `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`, is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system with no internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Pyrazole Proton**: There is one proton on the pyrazole ring, giving one signal.\n    *   **Methyl Groups**: There are three methyl groups in different environments: one on the C7 bridgehead and two diastereotopic geminal methyls on the C8 bridge. This results in three distinct signals.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton**: There is one proton on the C4 bridgehead, giving one signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons**: There are two CH2 groups in the bicyclic ring (at C5 and C6). Due to the lack of symmetry, all four of these protons are chemically distinct (two pairs of diastereotopic protons in different locations). This gives four signals.\n    *   Total from one arm = 1 (pyrazole H) + 3 (methyls) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (aliphatic CH2s) = 9 signals.\n5.  **Calculate Total Signals**: The total number of expected peaks is the sum of the signals from the core/linker and one arm.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this analysis and calculate the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-\n    4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    to determine the number of expected 1H NMR signals.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the number of 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central core and linkers\n    print(\"1.
