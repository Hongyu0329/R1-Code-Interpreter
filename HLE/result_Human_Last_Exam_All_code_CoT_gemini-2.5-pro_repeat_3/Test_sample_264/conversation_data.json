    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes**: We'll define the two cubes in a 3D coordinate system. For simplicity, let's place the first cube (Cube 1) with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and its sides aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Since its side length is 1, it will occupy the space where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n2.  **Model the Shift**: The second cube (Cube 2) is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first. The main diagonal of Cube 1 runs from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Applying this shift to Cube 1 gives us the position of Cube 2: `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`, `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`, and `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`.\n3.  **Find the Intersection**: The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that is part of both cubes. We can find this by determining the overlap in the coordinate ranges for x, y, and z.\n    *   The overlapping x-range is from `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 <= x <= 1`.\n    *   The overlapping y-range is from `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 <= y <= 1`.\n    *   The overlapping z-range is from `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 <= z <= 1`.\n4.  **Calculate the Volume**: The intersection is a smaller cube. The length of each side is the size of the overlapping range, which is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`. The volume is the product of these side lengths.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the volume.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the cubes and the shift.\n# We place the first cube (C1) with one corner at the origin.\nc1_min = 0.0\nc1_max = 1.0\n\n# The shift is 1/2 along the main diagonal, which we interpret as a vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).\nshift = 0.5\n\n# Step 2: Define the boundaries of the second cube (C2) after the shift.\nc2_min = c1_min + shift\nc2_max = c1_max + shift\n\n# Step 3: Find the boundaries of the intersection volume.\n# The intersection is a cube itself. We calculate the start and end of its sides.\ninter_min = max(c1_min, c2_min)\ninter_max = min(c1_max, c2_max)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the side length of the intersection cube.\nside_length = inter_max - inter_min\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.\nvolume = side_length ** 3\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes.\")\nprint(\"Each cube has a side length of 1.\")\nprint(\"One cube is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the other.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe intersection forms a smaller cube.\")\nprint(f\"The side length of this intersection cube is: {inter_max} - {inter_min} = {side_length}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe volume is the cube of its side length.\")\n# The final equation is printed with each number, as requested.\nprint(f\"Volume = {side_length} * {side_length} * {side_length} = {volume}\")\nprint(\"\\nIn fraction form:\")\nprint(\"Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\")\n\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
