    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for a $1s$ Slater orbital.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital**: The normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO) is given by the function $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent and $r$ is the radial distance from the nucleus.\n2.  **Set Up the Integral**: The problem asks to evaluate $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$. This is the expectation value of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$. In integral form, using spherical coordinates, this is:\n    \\[\n    \\int \\phi_{1s}^*(r) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(r) \\, d\\tau\n    \\]\n    where $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. Since $\\phi_{1s}$ is a real function, $\\phi_{1s}^* = \\phi_{1s}$.\n3.  **Solve the Integral**: The integral can be separated into a radial part and an angular part.\n    \\[\n    \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r} \\, r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta \\, dr\n    \\]\n    The angular part $\\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\phi \\, d\\theta$ evaluates to $4\\pi$. The radial part needs to be solved.\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation with Python**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic integration. The code will define all the necessary symbols and functions, carry out the integration, and print the steps and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the necessary mathematical symbols.\n    # r is the radial distance, zeta is the orbital exponent.\n    # Both are positive real numbers.\n    r, zeta = sp.symbols('r zeta', positive=True)\n\n    # The 1s Slater orbital has the form N * exp(-zeta*r), where N is a normalization constant.\n    # The square of the normalized orbital is (zeta**3/pi) * exp(-2*zeta*r).\n    phi_1s_squared = (zeta**3 / sp.pi) * sp.exp(-2 * zeta * r)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the operator.\n    operator = 1/r\n\n    # Step 3: Define the volume element in spherical coordinates.\n    # dV = r**2 * sin(theta) * dr * dtheta * dphi.\n    # The integral over the angular parts (dtheta, dphi) is 4*pi.\n    angular_integral = 4 * sp.pi\n\n    # Step 4: Set up the radial part of the integrand.\n    # The full integrand is phi_1s_squared * operator * r**2.\n    # We will integrate this with respect to r.\n    radial_integrand = phi_1s_squared * operator * r**2\n\n    # Step 5: Perform the definite integral for the radial part from 0 to infinity.\n    radial_integral_result = sp.integrate(radial_integrand, (r, 0, sp.oo))\n\n    # Step 6: The final result is the product of the radial integral and the angular integral.\n    final_result = radial_integral_result * angular_integral\n\n    # Step 7: Print the results in a step-by-step fashion.\n    print(\"Evaluation of the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>\")\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n    \n    print(f\"The squared normalized 1s Slater orbital is:\\nphi_1s(r)^2 = {phi_1s_squared}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The operator is: O = {operator}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The integral is: Integral( phi_1s(r)^2 * O * dV ) over all space.\")\n    print(\"In spherical coordinates, dV = r^2 * sin(theta) * dr * dtheta * dphi.\")\n    print(\"The integral over the angular part is 4*pi.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The radial part of the integral is:\")\n    print(f\"Integral from 0 to oo of ( {radial_integrand.simplify()} ) dr\")\n    \n    # We calculate the result of the radial integral separately to show the steps.\n    # The radial_integral_result is actually the integral of the radial_integrand / (4*pi)\n    # The true radial integral is radial_integral_result * (4*pi) / (zeta**3/pi)\n    # Let's show the integral of (r * exp(-2*zeta*r))\n    radial_part = sp.integrate(r * sp.exp(-2*zeta*r), (r, 0, sp.oo))\n    print(f\"The core radial integral part evaluates to: 1 / (4 * zeta^2)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\n    # The full expression is (zeta**3/pi) * (integral of r*exp(-2*zeta*r)) * (4*pi)\n    # Which is (zeta**3/pi) * (1/(4*zeta**2)) * (4*pi)\n    \n    print(\"Final result = (Normalization_factor_squared) * (Radial_Integral) * (Angular_Integral)\")\n    print(f\"Final result = ({zeta**3 / sp.pi}) * ({radial_part}) * ({angular_integral})\")\n\n    # Displaying the final equation with all its components\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"⟨phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s⟩ = ({sp.pretty(zeta**3 / sp.pi, use_unicode=False)}) * ({sp.pretty(radial_part, use_unicode=False)}) * (4*pi)\")\n    print(f\"⟨phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s⟩ = {final_result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_integral()\n\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
