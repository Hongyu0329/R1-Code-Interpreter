    "Here is a plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Establish the start date:** The Second Great War begins with the events of the *Brood War* expansion, which starts in the year 2500.\n2.  **Establish the end date:** The war concludes at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void\", which takes place in the year 2506.\n3.  **Calculate the duration:** Subtract the start year from the end year.\n4.  **Round up:** Apply a ceiling function to the result to round it up to the nearest whole number as requested.\n5.  **Format the output:** Display the calculation in a clear equation format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_war_duration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n    The war starts with the Brood War (2500) and ends with the End War (2506).\n    \"\"\"\n    start_year = 2500\n    end_year = 2506\n\n    # Calculate the raw duration\n    duration = end_year - start_year\n\n    # Round up the duration to the nearest whole year\n    rounded_up_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n    # Print the equation with the final rounded-up answer\n    print(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore spans from {start_year} to {end_year}.\")\n    print(\"The duration in years, rounded up, is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {rounded_up_duration}\")\n\ncalculate_war_duration()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
