    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    consisting of a single chain of k items to a single chain of k+1 items.

    The plan involves 3 phases:
    1. Create a helper tree of degree 1. This requires 3 Inserts and 1 Delete-min. (4 ops)
    2. Merge the helper tree with the original chain. This requires 1 Insert and 1 Delete-min. (2 ops)
    3. Remove the temporary node from the resulting structure. This requires 1 Decrease-key and 1 Delete-min. (2 ops)

    Total operations = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8.
