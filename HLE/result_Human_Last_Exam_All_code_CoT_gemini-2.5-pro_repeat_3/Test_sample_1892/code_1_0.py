# Based on the analytic number theory derivation, we determine the exponents
# in the asymptotic formula for |A(X)|.

# The asymptotic formula is of the form: c * X^alpha * log(X)^beta
# Our analysis shows that the leading term in the sum of coefficients is X.
# This corresponds to a pole of the Dirichlet series at s=1.
alpha = 1

# The power of the logarithmic term, beta, is derived from the order of the pole
# of the Dirichlet series at s=1. The order of the pole was determined to be 5.
# The exponent beta is the order of the pole minus 1.
pole_order = 5
beta = pole_order - 1

# The problem asks for the sum of alpha and beta.
sum_of_exponents = alpha + beta
