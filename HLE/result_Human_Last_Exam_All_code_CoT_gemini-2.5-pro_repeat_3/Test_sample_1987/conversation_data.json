    "Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Recursive Function `f`**: The function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is defined by a recurrence relation with specific boundary conditions.\n    *   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is not true.\n    *   `f(0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n    *   `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{i=1 to n} f(a_1, ..., a_i-1, ..., a_n)`.\n    A direct recursive implementation would be too slow for the large numbers involved, such as `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`.\n\n2.  **Find a Combinatorial Interpretation**: This recurrence relation is a classic signature of a path-counting problem on a multi-dimensional grid. The function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths from the origin `(0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` using unit steps in the positive direction of each axis, with the constraint that the path must always stay within the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n3.  **Use a Closed-Form Formula**: The number of such paths is a well-known result in algebraic combinatorics. It is equal to the number of semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) of a certain shape. This can be calculated using the **hook-content formula**:\n    `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = s_lambda(1^n) = product over all cells u=(r,c) of lambda of (n + content(u)) / hook_length(u)`\n    where:\n    *   `lambda` is the integer partition `(a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)`.\n    *   `u=(r,c)` represents a cell in the Young diagram of `lambda` at row `r` and column `c`.\n    *   `content(u) = c - r`.\n    *   `hook_length(u)` is the number of cells in the \"hook\" of `u`.\n    This formula allows for direct calculation without recursion.\n\n4.  **Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`**:\n    *   Here, `n=3` and the arguments are `a = (2, 4, 5)`.\n    *   The corresponding partition is `lambda = (5, 4, 2)`.\n    *   I will apply the hook-content formula to this partition to find the exact value.\n\n5.  **Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`**:\n    *   This is a special case where all arguments are equal: `f(A, A, A)` with `A=9000` and `n=3`.\n    *   The partition `lambda` is a rectangle: `(A, A, A)`.\n    *   I will show that for any rectangular partition `(A, ..., A)` of length `n`, the formula simplifies, and `f(A, ..., A) = 1`. This means `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 1`.\n\n6.  **Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`**:\n    *   Here, `n=4` and the argument `A` is the prime number `p = 10^9 + 7`.\n    *   Based on the finding from the previous step, `f(A, A, A, A) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 1 mod p = 1`.\n\n7.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n    *   The core will be a function implementing the hook-content formula. It will use the `fractions` module to handle rational numbers precisely.\n    *   A special check for the case `f(A, ..., A)` will return `1` directly for efficiency.\n    *   The script will compute the three required values and print them in a comma-separated format.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_f(args):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of f(a_1, ..., a_n) using the hook-content formula.\n    The arguments are expected to be sorted: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for the special case where all arguments are equal.\n    # In this case, the Young diagram is a rectangle, and the formula simplifies to 1.\n    if len(set(args)) == 1:\n        return 1\n        \n    n = len(args)\n    # The partition lambda is the reverse of the sorted arguments.\n    # The input 'args' is already sorted.\n    lambda_part = list(reversed(args))\n    \n    # Calculate the transpose of the partition (lambda'), which gives the column lengths.\n    if not lambda_part:\n        return 1 # f() = 1 based on f(0...0)=1 for n=0\n    max_col = lambda_part[0]\n    lambda_prime = [0] * max_col\n    for part_size in lambda_part:\n        for i in range(part_size):\n            lambda_prime[i] += 1\n            \n    total_value = Fraction(1)\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell (r, c) of the Young diagram for lambda.\n    # r and c are 1-indexed.\n    for r in range(1, len(lambda_part) + 1):\n        for c in range(1, lambda_part[r-1] + 1):\n            # content(u) = c - r\n            content = c - r\n            \n            # hook_length(u) = (lambda_r - c) + (lambda'_c - r) + 1\n            hook_length = (lambda_part[r-1] - c) + (lambda_prime[c-1] - r) + 1\n            \n            # Term in the product is (n + content) / hook_length\n            term = Fraction(n + content, hook_length)\n            total_value *= term\n            \n    # The result must be an integer.\n    if total_value.denominator != 1:\n        # This should not happen for valid inputs.\n        raise ValueError(\"Calculation resulted in a non-integer value.\")\n        \n    return total_value.numerator\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the user's request by calculating the three specified values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
