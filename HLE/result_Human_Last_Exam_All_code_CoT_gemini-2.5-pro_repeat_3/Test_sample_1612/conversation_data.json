    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the number of unique players who have achieved this feat for both batting and pitching.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Batting Triple Crown (leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs) and the Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n2.  Count the number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown. Based on MLB history, there are 16 unique batting Triple Crown winners.\n3.  Count the number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown. Based on MLB history, there are 25 unique pitching Triple Crown winners.\n4.  Since no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, we can simply add these two numbers together to get the total number of unique winners.\n5.  The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown\nnum_batting_winners = 16\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown\nnum_pitching_winners = 25\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique Triple Crown winners\ntotal_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation\nprint(f\"There are {num_batting_winners} unique batting Triple Crown winners.\")\nprint(f\"There are {num_pitching_winners} unique pitching Triple Crown winners.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of Triple Crown winners is the sum of these two groups.\")\nprint(f\"{num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n```\n<<<41>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
