print("Step 1: Interpreting the Theoretical Framework")
print("The 'G₄-theoretical framework in a d-dimensional spatial context' is identified as the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson φ⁴ (phi-four) field theory. This is a cornerstone model for studying critical phenomena.\n")

print("Step 2: The Role of the Upper Critical Dimension")
print("Critical exponents depend on the spatial dimension 'd'. For the φ⁴ theory, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.")
print("For any dimension d >= 4, the critical exponents are accurately described by mean-field theory.\n")

print("Step 3: Deriving the Exponent from Mean-Field Theory")
print("Mean-field theory provides a precise, analytical result for the correlation length exponent ν.")
print("This result is considered exact at and above the upper critical dimension.\n")

# --- Final Calculation and Result ---

print("The final equation for the critical exponent ν from mean-field theory is given by:")

# Define the components of the fraction for nu
numerator = 1
denominator = 2

# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# Here, we print the equation ν = 1 / 2.
print(f"ν = {numerator} / {denominator}")

# Calculate the decimal value
nu_value = numerator / denominator
