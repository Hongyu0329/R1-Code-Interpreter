    print("The algorithm iterates through each row `i` and calculates the maximum distance for that row. The overall maximum of these row-specific bandwidths is the final answer.")
    print("For each row `i`, it correctly finds the leftmost non-zero element (in columns <= i) and the rightmost non-zero element (in columns >= i) using binary searches. The maximum of `i - leftmost_column` and `rightmost_column - i` gives the maximum distance for that row.")

    print("\n2. Time Complexity Analysis:")
    print("The algorithm has a primary loop that runs `n` times, once for each row of the n x n matrix.")
    print("Inside the loop, the main work consists of two binary searches on sub-sections of the current row. One search is on a range of size `i` and the other on a range of size `n-i+1`.")
    print("The cost of each binary search is logarithmic with respect to the size of its search range. Therefore, the work done for each row `i` is O(log i + log(n-i+1)), which is bounded by O(log n).")
    print("Since this O(log n) work is performed for each of the `n` rows, the total time complexity is n multiplied by O(log n), which equals O(n*log(n)).")

    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("Based on the analysis, the algorithm is correct and has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)).")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice A.")
