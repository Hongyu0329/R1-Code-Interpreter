# Define the initial conditions and the target time
t0 = 0
y0 = 0
t_target = math.pi / 6

# Step 1: Calculate the rate of change (dy/dt) at the initial point t=0
# The differential equation is dy/dt = sin(y(t) - t) - 4
dydt_at_t0 = math.sin(y0 - t0) - 4

# Step 2: Approximate y(π/6) using Euler's method from t=0
# The step size 'h' is the difference between the target time and the initial time
h = t_target - t0
y_at_t_target_approx = y0 + h * dydt_at_t0

# Step 3: Calculate the rate of change at t=π/6 using the approximated y(π/6)
dydt_at_t_target = math.sin(y_at_t_target_approx - t_target) - 4

print("The instantaneous rate of change dy/dt at t=π/6 is calculated as:")

print(f"Using Euler's method, we approximate y(π/6) ≈ {y_at_t_target_approx:.4f}")

# The exact symbolic calculation is sin(-2*pi/3 - pi/6) - 4 = sin(-5*pi/6) - 4 = -0.5 - 4 = -4.5
# We will print this more precise result for clarity.
