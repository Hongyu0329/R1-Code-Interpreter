        "Step 1: Analyze the poem's core contrast.",
        "The poem sets up a contrast between the woman's past and her present. Her past was vibrant and risky, filled with 'cheap theatricals', 'a winning streak', and 'fixing cards'. Her present is old age ('bedbound years'), where these memories return as 'nightly fears'.",
        
        "\nStep 2: Consider the properties of opals.",
        "Opals are gemstones known for their unique 'play-of-color'. They show a multitude of shifting, iridescent colors and patterns when viewed from different angles. This gives them a sense of depth, complexity, and changeability.",
        
        "\nStep 3: Connect the opals to the woman's story.",
        "The poem uses a metaphor: 'Her keepsake eyes are opals'. The term 'keepsake' directly links her eyes (and by extension, the opals) to her memories of the past, which she 'kept'.",
        
        "\nStep 4: Evaluate the significance of the metaphor.",
        "Just as an opal's appearance shifts depending on the light and angle, the woman's perception of her memories has shifted over time. What was once exciting ('a winning streak') is now a source of 'nightly fears'. The opals' depth and shifting colors perfectly represent the complex, multi-faceted nature of these memories and how their meaning has changed. The metaphor captures not just the memory itself, but the act of remembering and re-interpreting the past.",
        
        "\nStep 5: Evaluate the answer choices.",
        "A. Decay: Incorrect. Opals are vibrant, not symbols of decay.",
        "B. Transformation: Plausible, but too general. The focus is more specific.",
        "C. Complexity: Plausible, but doesn't capture the element of change over time.",
        "D. Complex emotions: Getting closer, but 'memories' is more central to the poem than just 'emotions'.",
        "E. The shifting depth of memories: This is the strongest choice. It perfectly combines the idea of memory ('keepsake'), depth (a quality of opals), and change ('shifting' color, shifting perception).",
        "F. Bad luck: Not supported by the text. Her fears stem from her actions, not a curse.",
        "G. Secrecy and depth of character: A strong contender, but 'shifting depth of memories' is more precise about *how* that depth is experienced in the poem's narrative.",

        "\nConclusion:",
        "The most accurate significance of 'opals' is their ability to represent the dynamic and changing nature of memory. The shifting colors within the stone mirror the way memories are re-evaluated and their emotional weight changes over a lifetime."
