# Define the parameters for the two metric spaces.
# L is the length of the interval [0, 1].
L = 1.0

# C is the circumference of the circle. We choose C=2, which is the
# critical value where the ratio of circumference to diameter (C/1) is 2.
# This makes it comparable to the interval's length-to-half-length ratio (1/0.5)=2.
C = 2.0

# The Gromov-Hausdorff distance 'd' between an interval of length L and a
# circle of circumference C, for the case where L >= C/pi, is given by
# the formula: d = (L + C/2) / 2.
# Let's verify the condition for our parameters.
# L = 1, C = 2.
# Is 1 >= 2/pi?
# 2/pi is approximately 0.637, so 1 is indeed greater than 2/pi.
# The condition holds.

# Now we apply the formula to calculate the distance.
d = (L + C / 2.0) / 2.0

# The problem asks to output the final equation with each number.
# We will print the formula with the values substituted in.
print("The Gromov-Hausdorff distance 'd' is calculated using the formula:")

# We show the calculation step by step.
term1 = L
term2 = C / 2.0
numerator = term1 + term2

# Final Answer
