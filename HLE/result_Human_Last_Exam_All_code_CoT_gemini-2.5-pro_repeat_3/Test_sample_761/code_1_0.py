    Explains why polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.

    explanation = """
No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. This holds true even for homopolynucleotides.

While both are large biological polymers (macromolecules), their fundamental chemical structures, building blocks (monomers), and the bonds connecting them are distinctly different.

Here is a breakdown of the key structural differences:

1. Monomers (Building Blocks):
   - Polysaccharides: The monomers are simple sugars called 'monosaccharides' (e.g., glucose, fructose). These are relatively simple molecules, typically with the chemical formula C_n(H2O)_n.
   - Polynucleotides: The monomers are 'nucleotides'. Each nucleotide is a much more complex molecule composed of three distinct parts:
     a) A Pentose Sugar (a 5-carbon sugar, either deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA).
     b) A Phosphate Group.
     c) A Nitrogenous Base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil).

   The monomer of a polysaccharide is just a sugar, whereas the monomer of a polynucleotide contains a sugar plus two other major components (phosphate and a nitrogenous base).

2. Polymer Backbone:
   - Polysaccharides: The backbone is formed by linking monosaccharide units directly to each other via 'glycosidic bonds'. The resulting chain is essentially a sugar-sugar-sugar... chain.
   - Polynucleotides: The backbone is a 'sugar-phosphate backbone'. It is formed by alternating sugar and phosphate groups, linked by 'phosphodiester bonds'. The nitrogenous bases are attached to the sugars but are not part of the backbone itself.

3. Chemical Bonds:
   - Polysaccharides: Monomers are linked by 'glycosidic bonds'.
   - Polynucleotides: Monomers are linked by 'phosphodiester bonds'.

4. Elemental Composition:
   - Polysaccharides: Composed primarily of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).
   - Polynucleotides: In addition to C, H, and O (from the sugar), they always contain Nitrogen (N) in their bases and Phosphorus (P) in their phosphate backbone. The presence of phosphorus is a key giveaway.

Conclusion:
Although both structures contain sugar units, the overall architecture is fundamentally different. A polynucleotide is not a type of polysaccharide; they are two distinct classes of biological macromolecules.
