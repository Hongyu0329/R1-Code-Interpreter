    # Part (a): Minimum number of vertices for a non-empty M_trop(g,A).
    # The condition for the moduli space to be non-empty is 2g - 2 + |A| > 0.
    # This implies 2g + |A| >= 3.
    # A graph with one vertex, g loops, and |A| legs has valency 2g + |A|.
    # Since this valency is >= 3, a stable graph with one vertex exists if the space is non-empty.
    # Therefore, the minimum number of vertices is 1.
    answer_a = "1"

    # Part (b): Is M_trop(0,A) always a simplicial fan?
    # Yes. For g=0, stable graphs are trees. M_trop(0,A) is the space of |A|-marked trees,
    # which is known to be a simplicial fan.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # Part (c): For g > 0, is M_trop(g,A) a tropical variety, and what is its dimension?
    # Yes, it is the tropicalization of the algebraic moduli space M_g,A, making it a tropical variety.
    answer_c_is_variety = "yes"

    # The dimension of the tropical space equals the complex dimension of the algebraic space M_g,n,
    # which is 3g - 3 + n (where n = |A|).
