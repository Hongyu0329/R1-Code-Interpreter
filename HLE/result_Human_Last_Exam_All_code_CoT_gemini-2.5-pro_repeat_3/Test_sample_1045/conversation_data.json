    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-31G):**\n    *   This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set.\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** Are described by a single contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals:** Are \"split\" into two parts:\n        *   An \"inner\" part described by a single contracted function made from **3** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An \"outer\" part described by a single contracted function made from **1** primitive Gaussian.\n\n2.  **Count Functions per Atom:**\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** A second-row element.\n        *   It has one core orbital (1s). This gets **1** contracted function.\n        *   It has four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz). Each is split into two functions (inner and outer). So, 4 orbitals * 2 = **8** contracted functions for the valence shell.\n        *   Total per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** A first-row element.\n        *   It has no core orbitals.\n        *   It has one valence orbital (1s). This is split into two functions (inner and outer).\n        *   Total per Hydrogen atom = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   Grand Total = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_contracted_functions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8)\n    with a 6-31G basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\n    num_c_atoms = 7\n    num_h_atoms = 8\n\n    # Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set.\n    # For Carbon (1s core, 2s/2p valence): 1 (core) + 4*2 (valence) = 9\n    funcs_per_c = 9\n    # For Hydrogen (1s valence): 1*2 (valence) = 2\n    funcs_per_h = 2\n\n    # Calculate the total number of functions from each element\n    total_funcs_c = num_c_atoms * funcs_per_c\n    total_funcs_h = num_h_atoms * funcs_per_h\n\n    # Calculate the grand total\n    total_funcs = total_funcs_c + total_funcs_h\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"To find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\n    print(f\"1.
