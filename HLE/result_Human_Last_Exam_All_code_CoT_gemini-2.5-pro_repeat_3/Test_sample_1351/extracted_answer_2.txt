The proportion is calculated as:
p = ( (1 - 1/4)(1 - 1/16) ) - ( 2/4^6 - 1/(C(5,3,4) * 4^6) )
p = (45/64) - ( 2/4096 - 1/(5797 * 4096) )
p = 2880/4096 - ( (2*5797 - 1) / (5797*4096) )
p = 2880/4096 - 11593/23744768
p = (2880 * 5797 - 11593) / 23744768
p = (16705360 - 11593) / 23744768
p = 16693767 / 23744768
