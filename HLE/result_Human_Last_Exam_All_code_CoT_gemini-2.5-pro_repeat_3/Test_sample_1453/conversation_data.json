    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze the residues that form the hydrophobic core. In a canonical coiled-coil, this core is made up of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of a repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The size and chemical nature of the amino acids at these 'a' and 'd' positions dictate how the helices pack together, which in turn determines the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** I will analyze the provided sequence in all seven possible reading frames to find the one that maximizes the number of hydrophobic residues (like A, L, I, V, W) at the 'a' and 'd' positions. This is the most likely correct alignment.\n2.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the 'a' and 'd' positions are identified, I will analyze their composition. There are well-established rules based on steric hindrance and packing efficiency (\"knobs-into-holes\" model):\n    *   **Dimers** often have medium-to-large residues like Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position (`a=I, d=L`).\n    *   **Trimers** typically have small residues like Alanine (A) at the deeply buried 'a' position and larger residues like Leucine (L) at the more exposed 'd' position (`a=A, d=L`).\n    *   **Tetramers** often show the reverse pattern of dimers, with Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position (`a=L, d=I`).\n3.  **Predict the Oligomeric State:** Based on the analysis in step 2, I will predict the most stable oligomeric state for the sequence.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis systematically.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define canonical hydrophobic residues for the core\n    hydrophobic_residues = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'W'}\n\n    best_frame = -1\n    max_hydrophobic_count = -1\n    best_a_residues = []\n    best_d_residues = []\n\n    # 1.
