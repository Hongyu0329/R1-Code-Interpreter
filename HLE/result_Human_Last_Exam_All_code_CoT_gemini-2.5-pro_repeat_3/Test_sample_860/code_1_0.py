# The patient is in severe hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock.
# The primary goal is to restore circulating blood volume to maintain organ perfusion.
# Let's analyze the options:
# A. CPR is not indicated as the patient has a pulse (HR 160).
# B. Anticoagulants are contraindicated in a patient with active, profuse bleeding.
# C. Rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids like Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate is the standard of care for initial resuscitation in hypovolemic shock. This directly addresses the low blood pressure and poor perfusion.
# D. This is a correct but less complete answer than C.
# E. Fluids with fructose/dextrose are not ideal for initial massive volume resuscitation.

# Therefore, the best first-line treatment is intravenous resuscitation with an isotonic crystalloid solution.
# While stopping the source of bleeding is also a top priority, among the given choices, fluid resuscitation is the correct medical intervention.

# The correct choice is C.
