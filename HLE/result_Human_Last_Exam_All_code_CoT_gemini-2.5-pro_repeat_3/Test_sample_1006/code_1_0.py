    This function calculates the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for the space X.

    The problem describes a space X with two properties:
    1. X is a compact space containing a dense copy of the long ray R.
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to a continuous function on X.

    These two properties uniquely define X (up to homeomorphism) as the
    Stone-Cech compactification of the long ray R.

    Since the Stone-Cech compactification is unique up to homeomorphism, any two spaces
    X1 and X2 satisfying these conditions must be homeomorphic to each other.
    Therefore, they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.
