    # The problem is to find the minimum hidden layer width H for a shallow network
    # with GeLU activation to approximate f(x) = ||x||^2 for an N-dimensional input x.

    # 1. Lower Bound Derivation (H >= N)
    # A shallow network's output (before the final activation) can be written as:
    # y(x) = c + sum_{j=1 to H} v_j * GeLU(w_j . x + b_j)
    #
    # To approximate ||x||^2, the Hessian matrix (second derivatives) of y(x) at x=0
    # must match the Hessian of ||x||^2, which is 2*I (the identity matrix).
    #
    # The Hessian of y(x) at x=0 is:
    # H_y = sum_{j=1 to H} v_j * GeLU''(b_j) * (w_j * w_j^T)
    # where w_j * w_j^T is the outer product of the weight vector w_j.
    #
    # We need H_y = 2*I. The rank of the identity matrix I is N.
    # The rank of H_y is at most H, since it's a sum of H rank-1 matrices.
    # Therefore, rank(H_y) <= H.
    # This implies N <= H. The hidden layer width must be at least N.

    # 2. Sufficiency Construction (H = N)
    # We now show that H=N is sufficient. This requires a specific construction
    # that leverages a property of the GeLU activation function.
    #
    # The linear term of the Taylor expansion of y(x) at x=0 must be zero.
    # This term is proportional to: sum_{j=1 to H} v_j * GeLU'(b_j) * w_j = 0.
    #
    # A key property of GeLU is that its derivative, GeLU'(x), has a unique root,
    # which we call b*. (GeLU'(b*) = 0 for b* approx -0.75).
    #
    # Our construction for H=N is as follows:
    # a. For all H=N neurons, set the bias b_j = b*.
    #    This makes GeLU'(b_j) = 0 for all j, which automatically makes the linear term zero.
    # b. For neuron j, set its weight vector w_j to be e_j, the j-th standard basis vector.
    #    This means neuron j only receives input from x_j.
    # c. Now the Hessian equation becomes a diagonal matrix. We can solve for the
    #    output weights v_j to make the Hessian equal to 2*I.
    # d. The final output bias 'c' is chosen to cancel the constant term.
    #
    # This construction shows it is possible to configure a network with H=N neurons
    # to approximate ||x||^2. The approximation has an error, but the problem statement
    # allows for this ("not necessary that the network be able to compute the result
    # with zero error").

    # 3. Conclusion
    # Since the width H must be at least N, and we have a valid construction for H = N,
    # the minimum required hidden-layer width is N.
    
    # The final equation is H = N.
    # The question asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # In H = 1 * N + 0, the numbers are 1 and 0. 
    # However, the answer is best expressed in terms of N.
