# The problem asks for the real number alpha such that the best upper bound
# of |X| is closest to N^alpha.
#
# Let the upper bound be |X| <= C * N^alpha.
#
# Our analysis established that the tightest possible bound is of the form C * N^(-3/4).
# This means the exponent alpha is -3/4.

# Define the numerator and denominator of the exponent
numerator = -3
denominator = 4

# Calculate the real number alpha
alpha = numerator / denominator

# The final equation is |X| <= C * N^alpha. We can print the components.
# Let's use some example values for N and C to illustrate.
N = 1000.0
C = 1.0 # The constant C comes from the analysis.

print(f"The equation for the upper bound is of the form: |X| <= C * N^alpha")
print(f"Based on the analysis, the value of alpha is {numerator}/{denominator}.")
print(f"As a real number, alpha = {alpha}")
