    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication involving Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, we first need to understand how many submatrices define a single HSS matrix.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the HSS Structure**: An HSS matrix is defined by a hierarchical partitioning of its indices, typically represented by a full binary tree. The matrix is stored as a collection of smaller submatrices associated with the nodes of this tree.\n2.  **Count Submatrices for one HSS Matrix**: For a tree of a given depth `d`, we will count the number of defining submatrices:\n    *   **`D` blocks**: Dense diagonal blocks stored at the leaf nodes of the tree.\n    *   **`U` and `V` blocks**: Low-rank generator matrices. These are associated with every node in the tree except for the root.\n    *   **`B` blocks**: Small coupling matrices that link sibling blocks. These are associated with every non-leaf node of the tree.\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation**: We will derive a formula for the number of each type of submatrix based on the tree depth `d`.\n4.  **Calculate for Depth 4**: Apply the formulas for the given depth `d=4`.\n5.  **Calculate for Matrix Multiplication**: The multiplication `C = A * B` requires accessing the defining submatrices of both input matrices, `A` and `B`. Therefore, the total number of accessed submatrices is twice the number for a single matrix.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: Create a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the breakdown of the final equation, showing each number involved.\n\nThis plan will allow us to systematically arrive at the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices represented by a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # 1.
