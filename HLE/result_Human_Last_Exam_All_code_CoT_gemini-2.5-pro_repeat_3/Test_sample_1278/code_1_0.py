# A "Mexican standoff" corresponds to a finite face in the graph's planar embedding.
# We can find the total number of faces (F) using Euler's formula for planar graphs: V - E + F = 2.

# First, let's rearrange the formula to solve for F: F = E - V + 2
F = E - V + 2

# The number of standoffs is the number of finite faces, which is F - 1.
num_standoffs = F - 1

# Now, we print the step-by-step calculation.
