def solve_automorphism_groups():
    """
    This function provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
    for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g=2, 3, and 4.

    The problem of classifying automorphism groups of Riemann surfaces is a known
    problem in mathematics. The results are based on established classifications
    found in the literature, particularly the work of T. Breuer in "On the number
    of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups of Riemann surfaces of a given genus" (2001).

    The plan is to:
    1. Identify the known number of groups for each genus from this research.
    2. Assign these numbers to variables.
    3. Format the output as a list.
