    "My plan is to first identify the specific numerical imprints for each of the requested medications by consulting a reliable drug identification database. I will then create a Python script to display the results clearly.\n\n1.  **Identify the imprint for Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsules:** The numerical imprint is \"3105\".\n2.  **Identify the imprint for Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsules:** The numerical imprint is \"3106\".\n3.  **Create the script:** The Python code will store these two numbers in variables and then use `print()` statements to present the information to the user, highlighting the two different numerical codes as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and displays the different numerical imprints on Teva brand\n    fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerical imprints for the specified capsules\n    imprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n    # Display the findings\n    print(\"Based on drug identification databases:\")\n    print(f\"The numerical imprint on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is: {imprint_10mg}\")\n    print(f\"The numerical imprint on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is: {imprint_20mg}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the different numbers imprinted on the capsules are:\")\n    # The final line below outputs the numbers as requested.\n    print(f\"{imprint_10mg} and {imprint_20mg}\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
