    # For an even number of friends n, the parity of the distance between the gifts is conserved.
    # The initial distance is 1 (odd). The game ends when the distance is 2 or n-2 (even).
    # Since an odd distance can never become an even distance, the game never ends.

    # Question 4: For odd n>30 what is the expected number of times that between the two gifts
    # there are exactly 10 and n-12 friends.
    # This corresponds to the distance between the gift-holders being 11.
    # The expected number of visits to a state k (distance k) starting from state i (initial distance)
    # before being absorbed in the end-game states {2, n-2} is given by G_A(i,k).
    # Solving the system of equations for the expected number of visits gives n-11.

    # Question 5: Is it true that by probability of one the game ends in finite amount of time
    # for every odd n>1 value?
    # For odd n, the random walk of the distance can reach any state, including the
    # absorbing states {2, n-2}. In a finite state Markov chain, if an absorbing state
    # is reachable, it will be reached with probability 1.
