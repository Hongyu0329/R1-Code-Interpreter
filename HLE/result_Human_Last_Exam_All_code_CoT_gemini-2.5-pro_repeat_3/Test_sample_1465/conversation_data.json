    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The goal is to determine the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) for five given protein sequences known to form coiled-coils.\n2.  **Identify the Scientific Principle:** The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is largely determined by the identity of the amino acids in the hydrophobic core. Coiled-coils have a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` form the core. The combination of amino acids at these positions dictates the geometry and, therefore, the number of helices that can pack together.\n3.  **Formulate Prediction Rules:** Based on established bioinformatics principles:\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Often formed by patterns like Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`, or Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Alanine (A) at `d`.\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Favored by patterns that introduce some steric hindrance that is better accommodated in a trimeric interface, such as Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Threonine (T) at `d`.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Strongly indicated by a pattern of Isoleucine (I) at both the `a` and `d` positions.\n4.  **Develop a Python Script:**\n    *   The script will store the five sequences in a list.\n    *   It will loop through each sequence.\n    *   For each sequence, it will identify the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions, assuming a standard register where the first residue is `g` (so `a` is at index 1, `d` at index 4, etc.).\n    *   It will apply the prediction rules to determine the most likely oligomeric state. For sequences with minor variations, the prediction will be based on the most common `a` and `d` residues.\n    *   The script will print the analysis for each sequence, including the core residues found and the reasoning for the prediction.\n    *   Finally, it will print a summary of the predicted states for all five sequences as requested.\n\nThis approach automates the analysis based on fundamental principles of coiled-coil structure.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on\n    residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming a 'gabcdefg' register for the heptad repeat.\n    # 'a' positions are at indices 1, 8, 15, 22, ...
