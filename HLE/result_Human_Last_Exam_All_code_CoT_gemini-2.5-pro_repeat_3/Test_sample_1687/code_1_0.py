    # Choice A: Colonic Perforation
    print("   - A. Colonic Perforation: Possible, but less likely. While it causes pain and peritoneal signs, the bleeding is not typically this massive, and the specific left-shoulder pain is less common.\n")

    # Choice B: Lower GI Bleeding
    print("   - B. Lower GI Bleeding: Unlikely. This diagnosis doesn't explain the LUQ/shoulder pain. Also, the primary sign of lower GI bleeding (hematochezia) is not mentioned.\n")

    # Choice D: Postpolypectomy Syndrome
