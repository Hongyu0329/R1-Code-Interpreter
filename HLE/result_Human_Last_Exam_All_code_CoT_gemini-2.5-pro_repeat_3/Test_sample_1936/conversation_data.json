    "To find the smallest number `n` for which a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `.` is not a group, we need to understand the definition of a group and check sets of increasing size.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Recall the Group Axioms**: A group `(G, .)` is a set `G` with a binary operation `.` satisfying four properties:\n    *   **Closure**: For any `a, b` in `G`, `a . b` is also in `G`. (A binary operation on G by definition satisfies this).\n    *   **Associativity**: For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n    *   **Identity Element**: There is an element `e` in `G` such that for any `a` in `G`, `a . e = e . a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element**: For each `a` in `G`, there is an element `b` in `G` such that `a . b = b . a = e`.\n\n2.  **Test Small Values of n**: We will check for `n=1`, `n=2`, and so on, to find the smallest `n` for which we can define an operation that fails at least one of these axioms.\n    *   **Case n=1**: Let `G = {e}`. The only possible binary operation is `e . e = e`. This structure always satisfies all four group axioms, forming the \"trivial group\". Thus, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is a group.\n    *   **Case n=2**: Let `G = {e, a}`. We can define an operation that fails an axiom. For example, let `e` be the identity element, so `e.e=e`, `e.a=a`, `a.e=a`. Now, let's define `a . a = a`.\n        *   This structure has an identity element (`e`).\n        *   It is associative.\n        *   However, the element `a` does not have an inverse. There is no element `b` in `G` such that `a . b = e`. (`a . e = a` and `a . a = a`).\n        *   Since the inverse axiom fails, this is not a group.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Since any set of size `n=1` must be a group, and we can construct a set of size `n=2` that is not a group, the smallest such number is 2.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by checking the group axioms for structures of size 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef check_group_axioms(elements, op_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given set and binary operation form a group.\n\n    Args:\n        elements (list): A list of the elements in the set G.\n        op_table (dict): A dictionary representing the Cayley table of the operation.\n                         Format: {element1: {element2: result, ...}, ...}\n    \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if (G, .) is a group, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Axiom 1: Closure is assumed by the definition of a binary operation\n    # represented by a complete Cayley table with values from the set.\n    print(\"1.
