    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the set theory problem
    about the minimal length of a tower of uncountable subsets of omega_1.

    explanation = """
Let δ be the minimal length of such a tower. The problem defines a structure that is a well-known object in set theory. The minimal length δ is a cardinal characteristic known as the tower number for ω₁, denoted t(ω₁).

The problem is to find the minimal possible value of δ, provable within ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice).

The solution can be broken down into two main parts:

Part 1: Proving δ ≥ ω₂ in ZFC.

This part of the argument shows that no tower of length ω₁ can be maximal.

Let ⟨x_α : α < ω₁⟩ be a tower of uncountable subsets of ω₁, as defined in the problem. This means:
1. Each x_α is an uncountable subset of ω₁.
2. For any α < β < ω₁, the set difference |x_β \ x_α| is countable. We can write this as x_β ⊆* x_α.
3. The tower is maximal, meaning there is no uncountable set y ⊆ ω₁ such that y ⊆* x_α for all α < ω₁.

We will show that for any such tower of length ω₁, a pseudo-intersection y *does* exist, contradicting the maximality. This implies that the length δ must be greater than ω₁.

Step 1.1: Straighten the tower.
We can convert the ⊆* tower ⟨x_α⟩ into a standard ⊆ tower ⟨y_α⟩ where y_β ⊆ y_α.
For each α < ω₁, let y_α = x_α \\ ⋃_{β<α} (x_α \\ x_β).
Since α < ω₁, the set of predecessors {β | β < α} is countable. Each set (x_α \\ x_β) is countable by the tower property. A countable union of countable sets is countable.
Therefore, y_α is formed by removing a countable set from the uncountable set x_α, which means y_α is uncountable and y_α =* x_α.
A quick check shows that for α < γ < ω₁, we indeed have y_γ ⊆ y_α.

Step 1.2: Construct a pseudo-intersection by diagonalization.
Now we have a tower ⟨y_α : α < ω₁⟩ where y_0 ⊃ y_1 ⊃ ... ⊃ y_α ⊃ ... and each y_α is an uncountable subset of ω₁ (which is a well-ordered set).
We can construct a new set Z by picking one element from each y_α. Define a sequence of ordinals ⟨z_α : α < ω₁⟩ by transfinite recursion:
z_α = min(y_α \\ {z_β : β < α})
This is well-defined because each y_α is uncountable, while the set {z_β : β < α} is countable, so their difference is non-empty.
The resulting set Z = {z_α : α < ω₁} is uncountable, as the map α ↦ z_α is injective.

Step 1.3: Show Z is a pseudo-intersection.
For any given γ < ω₁, consider the set Z \\ y_γ.
If α > γ, then by construction z_α ∈ y_α. Since the y-tower is nested, y_α ⊆ y_γ. Thus, z_α ∈ y_γ.
This means any element z_α with α > γ cannot be in Z \\ y_γ.
So, Z \\ y_γ is a subset of {z_α : α ≤ γ}. This latter set is countable.
Therefore, |Z \\ y_γ| is countable, which means Z ⊆* y_γ.
Since y_γ =* x_γ, it follows that Z ⊆* x_γ for all γ < ω₁.

This construction shows that any tower of length ω₁ has a pseudo-intersection Z, and therefore cannot be maximal. Thus, the minimal length δ must be strictly greater than ω₁. As δ is a cardinal number, we must have δ ≥ ω₂.

Part 2: Showing δ = ω₂ is possible.

The argument above provides a lower bound for δ. To show it's the minimal possible value, we need to show that δ = ω₂ is consistent with ZFC.

Step 2.1: Find an upper bound for δ.
A maximal tower ⟨x_α : α < δ⟩ corresponds to a strictly decreasing sequence of length δ in the Boolean algebra P(ω₁)/I, where I is the ideal of countable subsets of ω₁. The length of any such chain cannot exceed the size of the algebra itself. The size of this algebra is 2^(ω₁).
So, in ZFC, we have the bounds: ω₂ ≤ δ ≤ 2^(ω₁).

Step 2.2: Consider a model of ZFC.
The value of 2^(ω₁) is not fixed by ZFC. However, it is consistent with ZFC to assume the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), which states that 2^κ = κ⁺ for any infinite cardinal κ.
In a model of ZFC + GCH, we have 2^(ω₁) = ω₂.
In this model, the inequality becomes ω₂ ≤ δ ≤ ω₂, which forces δ = ω₂.

Conclusion:
Since δ ≥ ω₂ is a theorem of ZFC and δ = ω₂ is consistent with ZFC (e.g., under GCH), the minimal possible value for δ is ω₂.
