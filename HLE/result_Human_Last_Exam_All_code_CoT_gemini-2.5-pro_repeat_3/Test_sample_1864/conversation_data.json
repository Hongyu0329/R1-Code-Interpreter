    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for controls that help set up the instrument, compensate for spectral overlap, and accurately define our populations of interest. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. We need one sample of streptavidin beads with no fluorophores attached. This helps define the autofluorescence of the beads.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** These are essential for compensation, which corrects for the spectral overlap between different fluorophores. You need one control for each fluorophore you are using. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for accurate gating, especially in a sorting experiment where purity is paramount. An FMO control contains all fluorophores except for one. This helps you see the spread of fluorescence from the other fluorophores into the channel of the omitted one, allowing you to set a precise gate. You will need one FMO control for each channel you are gating on.\n4.  **Calculation:** The total number of controls will be the sum of the unstained control, all single-stain controls, and all FMO controls.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total and prints the breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    \n    # 1. Unstained Control: Essential for setting baseline voltages and assessing autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: Essential for compensation. One for each fluorophore.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: Essential for accurate gating in a multi-color experiment.\n    #    One FMO control for each channel being analyzed.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"To perform a well-controlled 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"1.
