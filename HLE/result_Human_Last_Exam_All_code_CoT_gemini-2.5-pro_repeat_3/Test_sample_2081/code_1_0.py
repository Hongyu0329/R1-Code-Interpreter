# The problem states T = ln(10^34), which implies e^T = 10^34.
# We will use this value directly in our calculation.
e_T = 10**34

# The solvability condition leads to the formula for the radius R of the sphere of valid initial conditions:
# R^2 = 0.5 * e^T * (e^T + 1)
# We define the numerical components of this equation.
factor1 = 0.5
factor2 = e_T
factor3 = e_T + 1

# Calculate R^2 using these components.
R_squared = factor1 * factor2 * factor3

# Calculate R by taking the square root.
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# We will print the equation with the values substituted.
print("The final equation for the radius R is derived from the solvability condition:")

# Note: 10**34 is a very large number, so we represent it in the string.
