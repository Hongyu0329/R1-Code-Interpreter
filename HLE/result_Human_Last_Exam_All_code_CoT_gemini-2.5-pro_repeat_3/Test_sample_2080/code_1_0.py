# The second osmotic virial coefficient (B22) measures pairwise molecular interactions.
# It is the sum of steric (repulsive), electrostatic, and van der Waals (attractive) forces.
# B22_total = B_steric + B_electrostatic + B_van_der_Waals

# The question asks for the steric-only contribution (B_steric).
# This contribution is calculated based on the molecule's excluded volume.
# For a protein, it can be approximated using its partial specific volume (v_bar).
# The formula is: B_steric = 4 * v_bar

# For a typical monoclonal antibody (mAb), the partial specific volume (v_bar)
# is approximately 0.73 mL/g.
v_bar = 0.73  # units: mL/g

# Calculate the steric-only contribution to the second osmotic virial coefficient.
b_steric = 4 * v_bar

# The experimental value B22 = -7.585 mL/g represents the total interaction potential
# under specific solution conditions, where attractive forces dominate. However,
# the steric contribution is an intrinsic property calculated as follows.
