    This script presents the proof for the following problem:
    
    Suppose f is a Schwartz class function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) 
    over the real line is 0 for all non-negative integers k. Does it follow that f = 0?
    
    The proof uses the properties of the Fourier Transform.
