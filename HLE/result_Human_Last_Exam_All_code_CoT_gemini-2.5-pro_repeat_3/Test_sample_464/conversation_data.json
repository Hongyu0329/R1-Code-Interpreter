    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in analysis, and the answer can be demonstrated through the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\nMy plan is to use the Fourier transform to connect the moments of the function `f(x)` to the derivatives of its transform `hat(f)(xi)` at the origin.\n1.  First, I will establish the mathematical relationship between the k-th moment of a function and the k-th derivative of its Fourier transform at zero.\n2.  Then, I will apply the problem's condition that all moments are zero. This implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin are zero.\n3.  For a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform is analytic. An analytic function with all derivatives vanishing at a point must be identically zero.\n4.  Finally, since the Fourier transform is zero and the transformation is invertible, the original function `f` must also be zero.\n\nThe following Python script will print out this argument step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script presents the proof for the following problem:\n    \n    Suppose f is a Schwartz class function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) \n    over the real line is 0 for all non-negative integers k.
