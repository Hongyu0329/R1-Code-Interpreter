    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  I will research the legislative history of the State of Israel to identify key statutes related to civil and contract law.\n2.  I will search within this body of law for the first statute that explicitly mentions and codifies the principle of \"good faith\" (or *tom lev* in Hebrew) as a general legal duty.\n3.  I will then formulate a Python script to print the name of this statute, excluding \"the\" and the year of its enactment as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_good_faith_statute():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the first statute in modern Israeli law\n    to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Research indicates that while the concept existed in case law,\n    # the Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733-1973 was the first major statute\n    # to explicitly codify \"good faith\" as a broad, overarching duty\n    # in both pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and in the fulfillment\n    # of contractual obligations (Section 39).\n    statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n    print(statute_name)\n\nfind_first_good_faith_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
