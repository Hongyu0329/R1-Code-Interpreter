    Solves the snail puzzle and explains the maximal distance.

    The problem is a classic mathematical puzzle. The minimum distance is 7 meters,
    which occurs if 7 observers watch consecutive, non-overlapping 1-minute intervals.

    To maximize the distance, the snail's movement must be "counted" by several
    observers whose watch periods overlap. The maximum possible distance is 10 meters.

    Here is a construction that yields a distance of 10 meters.
    Let x_i be the distance the snail travels in the i-th minute, i.e., in the
    interval [i-1, i].

    Path construction:
    The snail alternates its speed, traveling 1 meter in odd-numbered minutes
    and 2 meters in even-numbered minutes, except for the last minute.
    - Minute 1 (0-1 min): travels 1 meter
    - Minute 2 (1-2 min): travels 2 meters
    - Minute 3 (2-3 min): travels 1 meter
    - Minute 4 (3-4 min): travels 2 meters
    - Minute 5 (4-5 min): travels 1 meter
    - Minute 6 (5-6 min): travels 2 meters
    - Minute 7 (6-7 min): travels 1 meter
