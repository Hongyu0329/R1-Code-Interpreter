    "My plan is to first identify the key elements from your question: the artist (Curt Querner), the year (1933), and the context (a self-portrait after escaping the Gestapo). I will then use this information to query my knowledge base to find the specific painting and identify the object held by the artist. Finally, I will write a Python script that states these facts and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the object held by Curt Querner in his 1933 self-portrait\n    as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"escaped from Gestapo\"\n    \n    # Based on art history, the object in the self-portrait from that year is known.\n    symbol_of_resistance = \"a pipe\"\n    \n    print(f\"In the year {year}, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait after he had {event}.\")\n    print(f\"As a symbol of resistance and unbowed spirit, he holds {symbol_of_resistance} in his hand.\")\n\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
