    "To determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to consult the known classification of such groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Possible Torsion Structures:** The possible structures of torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ for elliptic curves over quadratic fields like $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ have been completely classified by mathematicians such as Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. A non-cyclic torsion subgroup has the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_2 > 1$.\n2.  **List Groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** I will compile a list of all known non-cyclic torsion groups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This list includes groups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus over any of its extensions), as well as groups specific to certain quadratic fields, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is the field of third roots of unity and allows for elliptic curves with complex multiplication by its ring of integers, leading to some unique, large torsion structures.\n3.  **Calculate Orders:** For each possible group structure, I will calculate its order, which is the product of the orders of its cyclic components (i.e., $n_1 \\times n_2$).\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** I will then identify the maximum value among these calculated orders. This maximum value will be the answer.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform steps 3 and 4, clearly showing the groups, their orders, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The data is based on the complete classification of torsion structures\n    for elliptic curves over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of possible non-cyclic torsion groups over Q(sqrt(-3))\n    # Each tuple (n1, n2) represents the group Z/n1Z x Z/n2Z\n    # This list is derived from the known classification theorems.\n    # Note: n2 must divide n1.
