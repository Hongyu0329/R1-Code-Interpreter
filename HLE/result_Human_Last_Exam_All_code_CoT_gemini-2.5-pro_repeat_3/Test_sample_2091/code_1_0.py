    This function identifies the two swapped lines in the poem.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The poem is a double sestina. The end-word pattern is correct, so any swapped lines must have the same end-word.
    2. Line 74, "Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music", is thematically out of place in the concluding envoi. It belongs to the "Long since" theme of earlier stanzas.
    3. The end-word of line 74 is "music".
    4. Line 24, "And fill the vales with cries instead of music.", is a perfect thematic fit for the envoi, serving as a summary statement.
    5. Swapping lines 24 and 74 restores sense to the envoi and reveals the thematic break in Stanza 4, confirming the swap.
