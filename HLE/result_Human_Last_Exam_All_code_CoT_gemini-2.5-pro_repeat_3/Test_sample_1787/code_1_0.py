    # Step 1: Define relationships from the problem statement.
    # Let R_BD, R_1, R_2 be the radii of the brown dwarf, Planet 1, and Planet 2.
    # Let r_1, r_2 be the orbital distances of Planet 1 and Planet 2 from the brown dwarf.
    # From the two observations, we can derive a relationship between the radii and distances.
    # Let x = r_1 / r_2. The derived relationship is:
    # R_2 / R_BD = (1 - x) / (4 * x)

    # Step 2: Use orbital mechanics to find x = r_1/r_2.
    # We assume the specific angular momentum of Planet 1 at pericenter (L_1) equals
    # that of Planet 2 in its circular orbit (L_2).
    # L_1 = sqrt(2*G*M*r_1) for a parabolic orbit at pericenter r_1.
    # L_2 = sqrt(G*M*r_2) for a circular orbit of radius r_2.
    # Setting L_1 = L_2 gives sqrt(2*G*M*r_1) = sqrt(G*M*r_2), which simplifies to 2*r_1 = r_2.
    # Therefore, the ratio x = r_1 / r_2 is 0.5.
    r_ratio = 0.5

    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of Planet 2's radius to the brown dwarf's radius.
    R2_div_R_BD = (1 - r_ratio) / (4 * r_ratio)

    # Step 4: Calculate the brightness drop in magnitudes.
    # The flux ratio is determined by the ratio of the objects' disk areas.
