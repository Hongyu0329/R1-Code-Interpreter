    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** The core of the task is to find all the prime factors of the number 8139881. The largest of these factors will be our answer.\n2.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   I will start with the given number, `n = 8139881`.\n    *   First, I'll check for divisibility by 2. If it's divisible, I'll add 2 to my list of factors and divide `n` by 2 until it's odd.\n    *   Next, I will iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the current `n`.\n    *   If `i` is a divisor of `n`, I'll add `i` to the list of factors and divide `n` by `i` repeatedly.\n    *   After the loop, if there's a remaining value of `n` greater than 2, that remaining value is also a prime factor (and it will be the largest one).\n3.  **Output:** Once I have the complete list of prime factors, I will construct the factorization equation as requested and then print the largest factor from that list.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factors of a given number, prints the factorization equation,\n    and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_num = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num = num // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the number\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):\n        while num % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            num = num // i\n\n    # This condition is to handle the case when the remaining number\n    # is a prime number greater than 2 (e.g., the last and largest factor)\n    if num > 2:\n        factors.append(num)\n\n    # Print the factorization equation\n    if factors:\n        equation = f\"{original_num} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(equation)\n        largest_prime = factors[-1]\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case handles if the original number itself is prime\n        print(f\"{original_num} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = original_num\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n    \n    return largest_prime\n\n# The number to be factored\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_prime_factorization(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<44971>>>"
