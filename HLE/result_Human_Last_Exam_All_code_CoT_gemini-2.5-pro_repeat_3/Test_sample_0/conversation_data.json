    "My plan is to demonstrate the violation of one of Arrhenius's conditions by a critical-level view using a specific example.\n\n1.  **Define the Critical-Level View:** A population's value is the sum of `(welfare - c)` for each person, where `c` is a positive \"critical level\". Adding a person is only good if their welfare is above `c`.\n2.  **Define the Condition to be Tested (Weak Quality Addition):** This condition states that if you add a person with a *positive* welfare level to a population of people with positive welfare, the new population is better.\n3.  **Set Up a Counterexample:**\n    *   I will set a critical level, `c`, to a positive value (e.g., 10).\n    *   I will create an initial Population A with one person whose welfare is well above `c` (e.g., 20).\n    *   I will then consider adding a new person to create Population B. This new person will have a welfare level that is *positive* but *below* the critical level `c` (e.g., 5).\n4.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   According to **Weak Quality Addition**, since the new person has positive welfare (5 > 0), Population B should be better than Population A.\n    *   According to the **Critical-Level View**, I will calculate the value of Population A and Population B. The value of adding the new person will be `(5 - 10) = -5`, which is negative. Therefore, the total value of Population B will be less than Population A.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because the Critical-Level View judges Population B to be worse than Population A, it directly violates the Weak Quality Addition principle. The script will print out these steps and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_arrhenius_paradox():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem\n    is violated by critical-level population views.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
