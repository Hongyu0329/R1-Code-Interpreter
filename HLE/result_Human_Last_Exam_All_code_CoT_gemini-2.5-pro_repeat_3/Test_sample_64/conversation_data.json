    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), we can programmatically look it up in a data structure representing a pitch accent dictionary.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary to store the pitch accent patterns for some Japanese words, including our target word, 「弟」. The patterns are Heiban (flat), Atamadaka (head-high), Nakadaka (middle-high), and Odaka (tail-high).\n2.  The script will look up the word 「弟」 in this dictionary.\n3.  It will then print the word, its reading, and its corresponding pitch accent pattern along with a brief description.\n4.  Finally, it will match the found pattern to the given answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) and identify the correct one.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified dictionary of Japanese words and their pitch accent patterns.\n    # The value is a tuple: (Pattern Name, Numerical Notation, Romaji Reading)\n    pitch_accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": (\"Heiban\", \"[0]\", \"otouto\"),      # Younger brother\n        \"橋\": (\"Atamadaka\", \"[1]\", \"hashi\"),    # Bridge\n        \"心\": (\"Nakadaka\", \"[2]\", \"kokoro\"),   # Heart\n        \"犬\": (\"Odaka\", \"[2]\", \"inu\"),        # Dog\n        \"猫\": (\"Heiban\", \"[0]\", \"neko\")       # Cat\n    }\n\n    # The word we are interested in.\n    target_word = \"弟\"\n    \n    # The provided answer choices.\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Heiban\",\n        \"B\": \"Atamadaka\",\n        \"C\": \"Nakadaka\",\n        \"D\": \"Odaka\",\n        \"E\": \"Heiban or Nakadaka\"\n    }\n\n    if target_word in pitch_accent_database:\n        pattern, notation, reading = pitch_accent_database[target_word]\n        \n        print(f\"Looking up the pitch accent for: 「{target_word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {reading}\")\n        print(f\"Numerical Pitch Accent: {notation}\")\n        print(f\"Pattern Name: {pattern}\")\n        \n        # Explain the pattern for 'otouto'\n        print(\"\\nPattern Description for 「弟」 (おとうと):\")\n        print(\"The pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and remains high for the rest of the word (うと).
