    Based on the analysis of the FTIR data, the correct explanation for the observed behavior is that disordered structures fold into both beta sheets and alpha helices upon gelation.

    Here is the reasoning:

    1.  FTIR Peak Assignments: The observed wavenumbers correspond to specific protein secondary structures in the Amide I region.
        - The peak at {disordered_peak} cm⁻¹ (broad) represents disordered or random coil structures.
        - The peak at {alpha_helix_peak} cm⁻¹ (sharp) is characteristic of α-helices.
        - The peaks at {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm⁻¹ (sharp) and {beta_sheet_high_peak} cm⁻¹ (sharp) are characteristic of β-sheets.

    2.  Concentration-Induced Gelation: The experiment shows that as protein concentration increases, causing gelation, there is a dual increase in the peaks at {alpha_helix_peak} cm⁻¹ (α-helix) and {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm⁻¹ (β-sheet). This indicates that the initially disordered proteins are simultaneously folding into both of these ordered secondary structures to form the hydrogel network.

    3.  Heating-Induced Denaturation: The heating experiment provides corroborating evidence. Upon heating, the gel structure breaks down.
        - The increase in the {disordered_peak} cm⁻¹ peak shows an increase in disordered structures.
        - The disappearance of the {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm⁻¹ and {beta_sheet_high_peak} cm⁻¹ peaks shows the loss of the ordered β-sheet component of the gel.
        - This demonstrates that the gelled state is an ordered state composed of these structures, which is reversed upon heating.

    Therefore, the process of gelation involves a transition from a disordered state to a more ordered state containing both α-helices and β-sheets.
