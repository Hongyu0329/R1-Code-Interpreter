# Let x represent omega_0^2, which is equal to 3*gamma
x = sympy.Symbol('x')

# From the Poincar√©-Lindstedt analysis up to the third order,
# the second frequency correction omega_2 is found to be related
# to a polynomial in x = omega_0^2.
# The relationship is: 48 * omega_2 / omega_0 = -2*x**2 + 3*x + 6
final_polynomial = -2*x**2 + 3*x + 6

# The question asks for the "3rd term" of the nonlinear correction.
# We interpret this as the third term of the polynomial that determines the correction.
# In standard form (descending powers of x), the terms are:
# 1st term: -2*x**2
# 2nd term: 3*x
# 3rd term: 6

# We can extract the coefficients of the polynomial to verify.
