    "This is a fascinating problem from the realm of theoretical computer science, specifically lambda calculus and combinatory logic. The expression you've provided is a Church numeral, which is a way of representing natural numbers using only functions. To find the integer `n` that the expression represents, and then calculate `log_2(n)`, we must \"reduce\" the expression to its simplest form.\n\n### My Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression**: I'll break down the complex expression into smaller, more manageable parts.\n2.  **Identify Key Combinators**: I will identify standard combinators within the expression. The fundamental combinators are:\n    *   `Sxyz = xz(yz)` (The Substitutor)\n    *   `Kxy = x` (The Kestrel or Constant function)\n    *   `Ix = x` (The Identity function)\n    From these, other powerful combinators can be built.\n3.  **Evaluate Sub-Expressions**: I'll determine the function of the smaller parts. For example, some parts might represent the number `1`, while others might represent an operation like \"doubling\".\n4.  **Combine the Parts**: I'll put the evaluated parts back together to understand the full expression's behavior. This will reveal the final integer `n`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Once `n` is known, I'll write a simple Python script to compute `log_2(n)` and print the result in the required format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **The Main Expression Structure**: Let's call the main expression `N`.\n    `N = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B))`\n    Where:\n    *   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n2.  **Identifying Combinators**:\n    *   The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a well-known combinator for function composition, called `B`. `B f g x = f(g(x))`.\n    *   The expression `S(I)(I)` is the \"mockingbird\" combinator, `M`, where `M x = x x`.\n\n3.  **Evaluating A and B**:\n    *   `A = B(I)`. Let's see what this does. `B I f x = I(f(x)) = f(x)`. This is the definition of the Church numeral **1**.\n    *   `B = B(M)`. Let's see what this operation does to a Church numeral `k`. `(B M k) f x = M(k f) x = (k f)(k f) x`. The term `k f` is a function that applies `f`, `k` times. Applying it to `(k f) x` means we get `k` applications of `f` followed by another `k` applications of `f`. This results in `2k` applications of `f`. So, `B(M)` is an operation that **doubles** a Church numeral. Let's call it `DOUBLE`.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Full Expression**: Now we substitute our findings back into the main expression:\n    `N = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(1)))))(DOUBLE)`\n\n    The structure `S(I)(arg)` behaves like this: `(S(I) x) y = I x (y x) = x(y x)`. It applies `x` to the result of `y` applied to `x`.\n    Our expression has the form `F(DOUBLE)`, where `F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(1))))`.\n    Let's see what `F` does when applied to an argument, say `op`:\n    `F(op) = op(op(op(1)))`\n    It applies the operation `op` three times, starting with the value `1`.\n\n5.  **The Final Calculation**: In our case, `op` is `DOUBLE`.\n    *   Start with `1`.\n    *   First application: `DOUBLE(1) = 2`.\n    *   Second application: `DOUBLE(2) = 4`.\n    *   Third application: `DOUBLE(4) = 8`.\n\n    So, the entire expression `N` reduces to the Church numeral **8**.\n\n6.  **The Answer**: The question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n    `log_2(8) = 3`.\n\nTo verify this and provide the required code, here is a Python script that programmatically parses and reduces the SKI expression to find `n` and then computes the logarithm.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for potentially deep reductions\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n# --- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Node Definitions ---\nclass SKI:\n    \"\"\"Base class for all SKI expression nodes.\"\"\"\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.__class__.__name__\n\nclass S(SKI): pass\nclass K(SKI): pass\nclass I(SKI): pass\n\nclass Var(SKI):\n    \"\"\"A symbolic variable, like 'f' or 'x' for Church numerals.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.name\n\nclass Apply(SKI):\n    \"\"\"Represents a function application.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, func, arg):\n        self.func = func\n        self.arg = arg\n    def __repr__(self):\n        func_repr = repr(self.func)\n        arg_repr = repr(self.arg)\n        # Add parentheses for clarity if the function is also an application\n        if isinstance(self.func, Apply):\n            return f\"({func_repr})({arg_repr})\"\n        return f\"{func_repr}({arg_repr})\"\n\n# --- Parser ---\ndef parse_ski(s: str) -> SKI:\n    \"\"\"Parses a fully-parenthesized SKI expression string into an AST.\"\"\"\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    if s == 'S': return S()\n    if s == 'K': return K()\n    if s == 'I': return I()\n\n    # The structure must be F(A), where F is the function and A is the argument.\n    # We find the parentheses of the main (last) argument.\n    if not s.endswith(')'):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid expression format: {s}\")\n\n    balance = 0\n    split_pos = -1\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2, -1, -1):\n        if s[i] == ')': balance += 1\n        elif s[i] == '(': balance -= 1\n        \n        if balance == -1:\n            split_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    if split_pos == -1:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Mismatched parentheses in: {s}\")\n\n    func_str = s[:split_pos]\n    arg_str = s[split_pos+1:-1]\n\n    return Apply(parse_ski(func_str), parse_ski(arg_str))\n\n# --- Reducer ---\n_reduction_happened = False\n\ndef reduce_step(expr: SKI) -> SKI:\n    \"\"\"Performs a single pass of reduction on the expression tree.\"\"\"\n    global _reduction_happened\n\n    if not isinstance(expr, Apply):\n        return expr\n\n    # Recursively reduce children first (applicative order reduction)\n    expr.func = reduce_step(expr.func)\n    expr.arg = reduce_step(expr.arg)\n    \n    func = expr.func\n\n    # Rule 1: I x -> x\n    if isinstance(func, I):\n        _reduction_happened = True\n        return expr.arg\n\n    if isinstance(func, Apply):\n        # Rule 2: K x y -> x\n        if isinstance(func.func, K):\n            _reduction_happened = True\n            return func.arg\n\n        # Rule 3: S x y z -> x z (y z)\n        if isinstance(func.func, Apply) and isinstance(func.func.func, S):\n            _reduction_happened = True\n            x = func.func.arg\n            y = func.arg\n            z = expr.arg\n            return Apply(Apply(x, z), Apply(y, z))\n\n    return expr\n\ndef reduce_full(expr: SKI) -> SKI:\n    \"\"\"Repeatedly applies reduction until the expression is in normal form.\"\"\"\n    global _reduction_happened\n    current_expr = expr\n    while True:\n        _reduction_happened = False\n        new_expr = reduce_step(current_expr)\n        if not _reduction_happened:\n            break\n        current_expr = new_expr\n    return current_expr\n\n# --- Interpreter for Church Numerals ---\ndef count_applications(expr: SKI, func_var: Var) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of applications of 'f' in the reduced form f(f(...(x)...)).\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    current = expr\n    while isinstance(current, Apply):\n        if not isinstance(current.func, Var) or current.func.name != func_var.name:\n             raise ValueError(f\"Expression is not a simple Church numeral.
