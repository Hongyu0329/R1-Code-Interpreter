    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Haiku for Numbers:** I will parse each line of the haiku to extract numerical values.\n    *   \"An August tempest\": August is the 8th month of the year, so this line gives us the number 8.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": This is a straightforward calculation: 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": This phrase points to the number 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Mathematical Operation:** The central line, \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change,\" suggests it's the main part of an equation. The phrase \"winds of change\" implies a subtraction or reduction. I'll take the number from this central line (30) and subtract the numbers from the first (8) and third (1) lines.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** The equation is 30 - 8 - 1, which equals 21.\n\n4.  **Find the Alphabetical Answer:** The riddle asks for an answer \"in alphabetical order.\" This indicates the numerical result corresponds to a letter's position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.). The 21st letter is U.\n\n5.  **Connect to the Title:** The title, \"The Bays,\" is posed as a question. The answer \"U\" fits perfectly, as a \"U\" shape resembles a geographical bay.\n\n6.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation, print the full equation, and display the final letter.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the haiku riddle by extracting numbers, performing a calculation,\n    and finding the corresponding letter in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Extract numbers from the haiku's phrases\n    # \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" -> 2 * 15 = 30\n    twice_fifteen = 30\n    \n    # \"An August tempest\" -> August is the 8th month\n    august_tempest = 8\n    \n    # \"A divine one yields\" -> 1\n    divine_one = 1\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Perform the calculation\n    # The central line (30) is the minuend, and the other two numbers are subtracted.\n    result_number = twice_fifteen - august_tempest - divine_one\n    \n    # Step 4: Convert the number to its corresponding letter\n    # A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26. The 21st letter is 'U'.\n    alphabet = string.ascii_uppercase\n    final_answer = alphabet[result_number - 1]\n    \n    # Print the equation and the final result\n    print(\"The equation derived from the haiku is:\")\n    print(f\"{twice_fifteen} - {august_tempest} - {divine_one} = {result_number}\")\n    print(f\"The {result_number}st letter of the alphabet is the answer.\")\n    print(f\"The answer to 'The Bays?' is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<U>>>"
