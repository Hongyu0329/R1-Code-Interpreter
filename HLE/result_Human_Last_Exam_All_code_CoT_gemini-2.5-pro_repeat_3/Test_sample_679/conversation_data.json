    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the compound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: Determine the degree of unsaturation from the formula C7H14.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**: Interpret the number of signals, chemical shifts, and multiplicities to identify key structural features and fragments.\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments**: Combine the deduced fragments into a coherent structure that matches the molecular formula and all NMR data.\n4.  **Verify and Name the Compound**: Check the proposed structure against all the data and provide its IUPAC name.\n\nThis process will be detailed in the Python script below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"Formula: C7H14\")\n    print(\"The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\")\n    print(\"DoU = 7 + 1 - (14 / 2) = 1\")\n    print(\"A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"Signals: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\")\n    print(\"- There are 7 carbon atoms in the formula but only 6 NMR signals.
