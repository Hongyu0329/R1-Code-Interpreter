    "To find the observer canonical form for the given system using duality, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Dual System**: The principle of duality states that the observability of a system (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>). We will first transform this dual system into controller canonical form. The dual system is described by `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n\n2.  **Find the Controller Canonical Form Transformation**: For a multi-input dual system, we need to select a single input vector to create the canonical form. We will use the first column of `B_d` (which corresponds to the first row of `C`). We will then find the transformation matrix, let's call it `T`, that converts the pair `(A_d, b_d)` to the controller canonical form `(A_c, b_c)`.\n\n3.  **Transform the Original System**: The transformation matrix `P` that converts the original system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form is related to the dual's transformation matrix `T` by `P = (T⁻¹)^T`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the New C Matrix**: The state of the new system is `x_new = Px`, so `x = P⁻¹x_new`. The output equation becomes `y = Cx = C(P⁻¹x_new)`. Therefore, the new output matrix `C_new` is `C * P⁻¹`. Using the relationship from step 3, we can find that `P⁻¹ = T^T`. So, `C_new = C * T^T`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the final `C_new` matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given system matrices\nA = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1],\n    [0, 2, 0]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Define the dual system\nA_d = A.T\nC_d = C.T\n\n# Step 2: Select the first input vector of the dual system\n# This corresponds to the first row of the original C matrix\nb_d = C_d[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)\n\n# Determine the dimension of the state space\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# Compute the controllability matrix for the dual system (A_d, b_d)\nWc = b_d\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    Wc = np.hstack((Wc, np.linalg.matrix_power(A_d, i) @ b_d))\n\n# Check if the system is controllable\nif np.linalg.matrix_rank(Wc) != n:\n    print(\"The dual system (A^T, c1^T) is not controllable.\")\n    print(\"Cannot convert to controller canonical form.\")\nelse:\n    # Step 3: Find the transformation matrix T for the dual system\n    \n    # Get coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A_d\n    # p(lambda) = lambda^n + coeffs[1]*lambda^(n-1) + ... + coeffs[n]\n    coeffs = np.poly(A_d)\n    \n    # Construct the M matrix for the transformation T_inv = Wc * M\n    M = np.eye(n)\n    for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n - i):\n        if i == 0:\n            M[j, n-1-j] = 1\n        else:\n            M[j, n-1-i-j] = coeffs[i]\n\n    # Calculate T_inv\n    T_inv = Wc @ M\n\n    # Calculate T by inverting T_inv\n    T = np.linalg.inv(T_inv)\n    \n    # Step 4 & 5: Calculate the new C matrix for the original system\n    # The inverse transformation for the original system is P_inv = T^T\n    P_inv = T.T\n    \n    # The new output matrix is C_new = C @ P_inv\n    C_new = C @ P_inv\n    \n    print(\"The original A matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe original C matrix is:\")\n    print(C)\n    print(\"\\nAfter reduction to observer canonical form using duality,\")\n    print(\"the new output matrix C_new is:\")\n    print(np.round(C_new, 4))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe new output equations y = C_new * x_new are:\")\n    for i in range(C_new.shape[0]):\n        equation = f\"y{i+1} = \"\n        terms = []\n        for j in range(C_new.shape[1]):\n            # Format the number to be clean\n            num = C_new[i, j]\n            if abs(num) > 1e-9: # Only include non-zero terms\n                # Format to remove trailing .0\n                num_str = f\"{num:.4g}\".rstrip('0').rstrip('.') if '.' in f\"{num:.4g}\" else f\"{num:.4g}\"\n                terms.append(f\"{num_str}*x_new{j+1}\")\n        if not terms:\n            equation += \"0\"\n        else:\n            equation += \" + \".join(terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n        print(equation)\n\n```\n<<<\n[[0.  0.  1. ]\n [0.5 0.5 1.5]]\n>>>"
