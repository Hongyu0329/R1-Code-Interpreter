    Solves the given group theory problem and prints the answer.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The question asks for the existence and uniqueness of a minimal overgroup `hat(G)` where certain equations are solvable.
        This corresponds to the concept of a p-completion of a group, which exists and is unique up to isomorphism for the class of groups considered.
        So the answer is Yes.

    (b) The question asks for the maximum possible derived length of `hat(G)`.
        The notation for the subnormal series is `G = G_1 \triangleleft G_2 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_n \triangleleft G_{n+1} = \{1\}`.
        In a subnormal series for G, G_2 is a subgroup of G_1. However, the notation `G_1 \triangleleft G_2` means G_1 is a normal subgroup of G_2.
        For G_1 to be a normal subgroup of its own subgroup G_2, it must be that G_1 = G_2.
        By induction, this implies G = G_1 = G_2 = ... = G_n.
        The final part of the series is `G_n \triangleleft G_{n+1} = \{1\}`. For G_n to be a normal subgroup of the trivial group, G_n must be the trivial group itself.
        Thus, G must be the trivial group {1}.
        The completion of the trivial group, `hat({1})`, is just {1}.
        The derived length of the trivial group is 0.
        Therefore, the maximum possible derived length is 0.
