def solve_semidistributivity_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the largest cardinal mu for the set-theoretic problem.

    Based on the analysis:
    1.  The property of being (mu, kappa+)-semidistributive is examined for any forcing P with density kappa.
    2.  An analysis based on partitioning kappa+ by decision antichains shows that any such forcing
        must be at least (1, kappa+)-semidistributive. The key fact used is that 2^kappa >= kappa+
        is a theorem of ZFC.
    3.  A counterexample (e.g., using the forcing Add(kappa, kappa+)) can be constructed to show
        that the property does not necessarily hold for mu=2.
    4.  Therefore, the largest value of mu that holds for *all* such forcings is 1.
