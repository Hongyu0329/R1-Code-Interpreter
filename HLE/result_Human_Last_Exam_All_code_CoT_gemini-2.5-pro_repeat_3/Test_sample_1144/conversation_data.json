    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2. We are given the uncertainty in position, Δx = 10 pm. We will use the minimum uncertainty for our calculation, so Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n2.  **Calculate the momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p):** For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is quantized as L = p ⋅ r = n ⋅ ħ. The radius of the first Bohr orbit (r) is the Bohr radius, a₀. Therefore, the momentum is p = ħ / a₀.\n3.  **Find the ratio (Δp / p):** We will divide the expression for Δp by the expression for p. This simplifies to (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)) / (ħ / a₀) = a₀ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n4.  **Substitute the values and compute:** We will use the known values for the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 5.29177 × 10⁻¹¹ m) and the given uncertainty in position (Δx = 10 × 10⁻¹² m) to calculate the final numerical ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Physical Constants ---\n# Bohr radius in meters\na0 = 5.29177e-11\n# Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10e-12 m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) to the momentum (p) is:\n# delta_p / p = (h_bar / (2 * delta_x)) / (h_bar / a0)\n# This simplifies to:\n# ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\nratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(\"This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\")\nprint(\"\\nGiven:\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.1e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nConstants used:\")\nprint(f\"Bohr radius (a₀) = {a0:.5e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nThe formula for the ratio (Δp / p) simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx).\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculation:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0:.5f} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0:.5f} / {2 * delta_x}\")\nprint(f\"Final Ratio = {ratio:.4f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\n<<<The final ratio is {ratio:.4f}>>>\")\n```\n<<<The final ratio is 2.6459>>>"
