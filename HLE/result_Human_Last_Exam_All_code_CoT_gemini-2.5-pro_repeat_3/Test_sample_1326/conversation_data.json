    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of a piecewise function. The integral from x = 0 to x = 4 must be split at x = 3, which is the point where the function definition changes.\n\nTherefore, the total integral is the sum of two separate integrals:\n1.  The integral of $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ from x = 0 to x = 3.\n2.  The integral of $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$ from x = 3 to x = 4.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate each integral separately using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for numerical integration. Then, it will add the two results to find the total integral.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# The function p(x) is defined in two parts.\n# We define a function for each part.\n\n# Part 1: p(x) = 2x^3 / 8 for 0 <= x <= 3\ndef p1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function represents the first part of p(x).\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Part 2: p(x) = e^x(1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) for 3 <= x <= 5\ndef p2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function represents the second part of p(x).\n  \"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# The integral from 0 to 4 is split at x = 3.\n# We calculate the integral for the first part from 0 to 3.\nintegral_part1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# We calculate the integral for the second part from 3 to 4.\nintegral_part2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the results, showing each part of the calculation.\nprint(\"Integral of the first part (from 0 to 3):\")\nprint(f\"∫(2x^3/8)dx from 0 to 3 = {integral_part1}\")\nprint(\"\\nIntegral of the second part (from 3 to 4):\")\nprint(f\"∫(e^x(1+sinx)/(1+cosx))dx from 3 to 4 = {integral_part2}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal integral from 0 to 4:\")\nprint(f\"Total = {integral_part1} + {integral_part2}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4640301870984>>>"
