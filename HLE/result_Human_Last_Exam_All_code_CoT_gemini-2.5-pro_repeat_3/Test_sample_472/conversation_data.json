    "This is a line of Latin poetry, likely from Roman comedy. The meter is an Iambic Septenarius, which consists of seven iambic feet. Scanning this type of verse requires understanding rules like elision, long by position, and metrical substitutions common in early Latin poetry.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan for scanning the line:\n1.  **Identify the meter:** The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is an Iambic Septenarius, a 14-syllable line common in the works of playwrights like Plautus and Caecilius Statius.\n2.  **Handle Elision:** When a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word starting with a vowel, the first vowel is dropped. Here, `bene` ends with `-e` and `esse` starts with `e-`. Thus, `bene esse` elides to become `ben' esse`, which is scanned as a single unit `benesse`. This reduces the syllable count from 15 to 14, fitting the meter.\n3.  **Syllabify the line:** With the elision, the line is effectively `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`. The syllables are: `et ti-bi be-nes-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`.\n4.  **Divide into Feet:** An iambic septenarius has seven feet. We divide the 14 syllables into pairs:\n    `et ti | bi be- | -nes-se | so-li | quom si- | -bi sit | ma-le`\n5.  **Scan each foot (L=Long, S=Short):**\n    *   **Foot 1 (`et ti`):** `et` is long by position (vowel `e` followed by two consonants, the `t` in `et` and the `t` in `tibi`). `ti` is also treated as long metrically (`brevis in longo`). This gives a Spondee (`L L`), a common substitution for an Iamb.\n    *   **Foot 2 (`bi be`):** The syllable `bi` from `tibi` is short. The syllable `be` from `benesse` is short. This gives a Pyrrhic (`S S`), which is an acceptable substitution for an Iamb in comedy under the rule of *brevis brevians*.\n    *   **Foot 3 (`nes se`):** `nes` from `benesse` is long by position (before `ss`). `se` is short. This gives a Trochee (`L S`), a valid substitution.\n    *   **Foot 4 (`so li`):** `so` in `soli` is long by nature. `li` is short. This gives another Trochee (`L S`).\n    *   **Foot 5 (`quom si`):** `quom` is long by position (vowel `o` followed by `m` and the `s` of `sibi`). `si` is short. This gives a Trochee (`L S`).\n    *   **Foot 6 (`bi sit`):** `bi` from `sibi` is short. `sit` is long by position (vowel `i` followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`). This gives a perfect Iamb (`S L`).\n    *   **Foot 7 (`ma le`):** `ma` is short. `le` is short. This gives a Pyrrhic (`S S`), which is a valid final foot in an iambic septenarius.\n\nThis detailed analysis yields the final scansion. The following Python code will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the scansion of the Latin line:\n    \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    L = Long Syllable\n    S = Short Syllable\n    Feet are separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The meter is an Iambic Septenarius.\n    # Feet: et ti | bi be(nesse) | nes-se | so-li | quom si | -bi sit | ma-le\n    scansion = \"L L S S L S L S L S S L S S\"\n    print(scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L L S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
