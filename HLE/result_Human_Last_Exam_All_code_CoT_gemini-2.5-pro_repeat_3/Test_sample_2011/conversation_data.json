    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nA naive interpretation is to consider the set of all possible clique sizes `k` for which a `K_k` (a complete graph of size `k`) exists as an induced subgraph. If the largest clique in a graph is of size `ω`, then it necessarily contains smaller cliques of all sizes from 1 to `ω`. This means the number of different clique sizes would be equal to the size of the largest clique, `ω`. To maximize this, we would choose the complete graph `K_128`, which has a maximum clique of size 128, giving 128 different clique sizes.\n\nHowever, this interpretation is quite trivial. A more challenging and likely intended interpretation is to find the maximum number of **maximal cliques** of distinct sizes. A clique is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding another vertex. To construct a graph with many maximal cliques of different sizes, we can use a disjoint union of complete graphs of varying sizes.\n\nLet's say we have `m` maximal cliques of distinct sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. We can realize this by creating a graph `G` which is the disjoint union of `m` complete graphs: `G = K_{k_1} ∪ K_{k_2} ∪ ... ∪ K_{k_m}`. For the sizes `{k_i}` to be distinct, we must choose `m` different integers. The total number of vertices used is `k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`, which must be less than or equal to 128.\n\nTo maximize `m` (the number of different clique sizes), we should choose the smallest possible distinct positive integers for `k_i`. That is, we choose the sizes to be `1, 2, 3, ..., m`.\n\nThe problem then becomes finding the largest integer `m` such that the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m` does not exceed 128. The sum of the first `m` integers is given by the formula `m * (m + 1) / 2`. So, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n`m * (m + 1) / 2 <= 128`\n\nThe following Python script will solve this inequality and determine the maximum value of `m`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves for the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph\n    with n=128 vertices, interpreted as finding the maximum number of maximal\n    cliques of distinct sizes.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    # We need to find the largest integer 'm' such that 1 + 2 + ... + m <= n.\n    # This corresponds to partitioning n into the maximum number of distinct parts.\n    m = 0\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    # We iteratively add the next integer until the sum exceeds n.\n    while current_sum + (m + 1) <= n:\n        m += 1\n        current_sum += m\n\n    # The final 'm' is the maximum number of distinct parts.\n    # The prompt requires printing the final equation.\n    equation_numbers = list(range(1, m + 1))\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, equation_numbers))\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the largest integer 'm' such that the sum of the first 'm' positive integers is at most {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This can be expressed by the inequality: m * (m + 1) / 2 <= {n}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nBy solving this, we find the maximum value for 'm' is {m}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe sum of the sizes for the first m cliques is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {current_sum}\")\n    \n    # We can construct a graph with these properties.
