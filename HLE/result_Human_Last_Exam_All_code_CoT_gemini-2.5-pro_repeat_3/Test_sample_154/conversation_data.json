    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a graph theory enumeration problem that can be solved by generating and testing graphs.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to find the number of unique graph structures (nonisomorphic) with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n    *   **5 Vertices:** The graph has exactly 5 nodes.\n    *   **2-Vertex-Connected:** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to having a vertex connectivity of 2 or more.\n    *   **Nonisomorphic:** We count each unique graph structure only once, ignoring vertex labels.\n3.  **Computational Strategy:** I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph analysis.\n    *   First, I'll generate all unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs with 5 vertices using `networkx.nonisomorphic_graphs()`.\n    *   Then, for each generated graph, I will calculate its vertex connectivity using `networkx.node_connectivity()`.\n    *   Finally, I will count how many of these graphs have a vertex connectivity of 2 or greater.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_k_connected_graphs(vertices, connectivity_k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of k-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs.\n    \n    Args:\n        vertices (int): The number of vertices in the graphs.\n        connectivity_k (int): The minimum vertex connectivity required.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for simple nonisomorphic graphs with {vertices} vertices and vertex connectivity >= {connectivity_k}.\")\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Generate all nonisomorphic graphs with the specified number of vertices.\n    graph_generator = nx.nonisomorphic_graphs(vertices)\n    \n    # Iterate through each unique graph structure.\n    for G in graph_generator:\n        # A graph must have at least k+1 vertices to be k-connected.\n        # This condition is met since vertices > connectivity_k.\n        \n        # Calculate the vertex connectivity of the graph.\n        # A disconnected graph has connectivity 0.\n        # A connected graph with a cut vertex has connectivity 1.\n        # A 2-connected graph has connectivity >= 2.\n        # The complete graph K_n has connectivity n-1.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(G) >= connectivity_k:\n            count += 1\n            \n    return count\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# The problem asks for 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\nnum_vertices = 5\nrequired_connectivity = 2\n\n# Calculate the result using the function\nresult = count_k_connected_graphs(num_vertices, required_connectivity)\n\n# Output the final answer in a sentence, showing the numbers involved.\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\nprint(f\"The number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices that are {required_connectivity}-vertex-connected is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<21>>>"
