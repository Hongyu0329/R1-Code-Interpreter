# The user wants to understand the genetic event leading to an X0 male with red eyes in Drosophila.
# This is a classic genetics problem based on Calvin Bridges' experiments.

# 1. Define the parents in the classic cross.
mother_genotype = "XwXw"  # White-eyed female
father_genotype = "X+Y"   # Red-eyed male

# 2. Analyze the exceptional offspring.
offspring_genotype = "X+O"
offspring_phenotype = "Red-eyed male (sterile)"

# 3. Trace the origin of the offspring's chromosomes.
# The offspring has one X chromosome, which carries the red-eye allele (X+).
# The only parent with the X+ allele is the father.
sperm_contribution = "X+"
# Therefore, the mother must have contributed no sex chromosome.
egg_contribution = "O (nullo-X)"

# 4. Determine the event that produces a nullo-X egg.
# A female (XwXw) normally produces Xw eggs.
# An egg with no X chromosome (O) is the result of non-disjunction during oogenesis (female meiosis).

# 5. Consider the types of non-disjunction in the female.
# Event A: Non-disjunction in Meiosis I.
# The two homologous Xw chromosomes fail to separate.
# This produces two kinds of gametes: XwXw and O.
# This event CAN produce the required 'O' egg.

# Event B: Non-disjunction in Meiosis II.
# One of the secondary oocytes fails to separate its sister chromatids.
# This produces gametes that are XwXw, O, and normal Xw.
# This event CAN also produce the required 'O' egg.

# 6. Evaluate other options.
# Event C: Male non-disjunction. If the male had non-disjunction producing a nullo-sex-chromosome sperm (O), it would fertilize a normal Xw egg from the mother, resulting in an XwO male (white-eyed), which doesn't match.
# Event D: Autosomal non-disjunction. This affects other chromosomes and doesn't explain the X0 sex chromosome count.
# Event E: De novo mutation. This changes a gene but doesn't explain the missing chromosome.

# 7. Conclude the most likely cause.
# The cause is non-disjunction in the female. Both Meiosis I and Meiosis II are possible mechanisms.
# However, Meiosis I non-disjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate, which is the "primary" non-disjunction event described by Bridges. It is the canonical explanation for this phenomenon.
# This event explains not only the X+O red-eyed males (from O egg + X+ sperm) but also the XwXwY white-eyed females (from XwXw egg + Y sperm) that Bridges also observed.
