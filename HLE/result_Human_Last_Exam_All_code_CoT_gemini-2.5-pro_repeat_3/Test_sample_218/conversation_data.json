    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Irreps and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider all partitions of 25. A partition of 25 is a way of writing 25 as a sum of positive integers, for example, `(25)`, `(24, 1)`, `(23, 2)`, etc.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the Hook Length Formula. The formula is:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of the cell in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus 1 for the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    a. Generate all possible partitions of the integer 25.\n    b. For each partition, calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the Hook Length Formula.\n    c. Keep a count of the partitions for which this dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    d. Print the final count.\n\n4.  **Implementation:**\n    - I will write a Python script to perform these steps.\n    - Python's `math.factorial` can handle the large number $25!$. Python's arbitrary-precision integers prevent overflow issues.\n    - I will implement a function to generate partitions of 25.\n    - I will implement another function to calculate the product of hook lengths for a given partition.\n    - The main part of the script will loop through all partitions, calculate the dimension, and check if it's below the 500,000 threshold.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Set up the constants for the problem.\nn = 25\nlimit = 500_000\n\n# Using a dictionary for memoization to speed up partition generation.\nmemo_partitions = {}\n\ndef generate_partitions(num, max_part=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all non-increasing integer partitions of a number 'num'.\n    Partitions are returned as a list of lists.\n    Uses memoization to avoid recomputing partitions for the same number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if max_part is None:\n        max_part = num\n    \n    # Check if the result is already memoized.\n    if (num, max_part) in memo_partitions:\n        return memo_partitions[(num, max_part)]\n\n    # Base case: The only partition of 0 is an empty list.\n    if num == 0:\n        return [[]]\n    \n    partitions_list = []\n    # Iterate from min(num, max_part) down to 1 to find parts of the partition.\n    for part_val in range(min(num, max_part), 0, -1):\n        # Recursively find partitions for the remainder.\n        for sub_partition in generate_partitions(num - part_val, part_val):\n            partitions_list.append([part_val] + sub_partition)\n    \n    # Memoize the result before returning.\n    memo_partitions[(num, max_part)] = partitions_list\n    return partitions_list\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition, n_factorial):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation for a given partition\n    using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the product of all hook lengths.\n    product_of_hooks = 1\n    for i, part_len in enumerate(partition):  # i is the row index (0-based)\n        for j in range(part_len):  # j is the column index (0-based)\n            # Cells to the right in the same row.\n            cells_right = part_len - 1 - j\n            \n            # Cells below in the same column.\n            cells_below = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    cells_below += 1\n                else:\n                    # Since partition parts are sorted, we can stop early.\n                    break\n            \n            hook_length = cells_right + cells_below + 1\n            product_of_hooks *= hook_length\n            \n    # The dimension is n! divided by the product of hook lengths.\n    # We use integer division `//` as the result is always an integer.\n    return n_factorial // product_of_hooks\n\n# Step 2: Pre-calculate n!\nn_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n\n# Step 3: Generate all partitions of n.\nall_partitions = generate_partitions(n)\n\n# Step 4: Iterate through partitions, calculate dimensions, and count.\ncount = 0\nfor p in all_partitions:\n    dimension = calculate_dimension(p, n_factorial)\n    if dimension < limit:\n        count += 1\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The number of irreducible representations of S_25 with dimension strictly less than 500,000 is {count}.\")\n<<<44>>>\n```"
