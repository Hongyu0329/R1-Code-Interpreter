    "To determine the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram, we need to count the number of ways the diagram can be rearranged to look identical. The symmetry factor is the order of the automorphism group of the graph.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the symmetry factor for the described diagram:\n1.  **Identify the Diagram:** The diagram consists of two vertices and four lines (propagators) connecting these two vertices. This is sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" or \"figure-8\" diagram.\n2.  **Identify the Symmetries:** There are two types of symmetries in this diagram:\n    *   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices are identical. Swapping their positions leaves the diagram unchanged. The number of ways to permute these two vertices is 2! (2 factorial).\n    *   **Propagator Permutation:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram remains the same. The number of ways to do this is 4! (4 factorial).\n3.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor (S) is the product of the individual symmetry contributions. Therefore, S = (Vertex Permutations) Ã— (Propagator Permutations).\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a Python script to calculate 2! and 4!, and then multiply them to get the final symmetry factor. The script will print out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be interchanged\n    num_vertices = 2\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the same two vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # Calculate the contribution from permuting the vertices\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n    \n    # Calculate the contribution from permuting the propagators\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these contributions\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor for a diagram with 2 vertices and 4 propagators:\")\n    print(\"1.
