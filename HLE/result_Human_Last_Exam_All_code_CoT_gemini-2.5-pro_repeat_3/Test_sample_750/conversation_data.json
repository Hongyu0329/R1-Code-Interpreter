    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we will analyze the equation by considering different forms of the complex number $z$. The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued function in the complex plane, which we must handle carefully.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Understanding $i^z$**:\n    We can express $i^z$ using the identity $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\n    The complex logarithm $\\ln(i)$ is multi-valued. In polar form, $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\ln(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$. Let's denote $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n    So, $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i\\theta_k}$.\n    Let $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    $i^z = e^{(x+iy)i\\theta_k} = e^{ix\\theta_k - y\\theta_k} = e^{-y\\theta_k} e^{ix\\theta_k} = e^{-y\\theta_k}(\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i\\sin(x\\theta_k))$.\n\n2.  **The Full Equation**:\n    The original equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$. Substituting $z=x+iy$ on the left side gives $(x+iy)i = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n    Equating this with the expression for $i^z$:\n    $-y + ix = e^{-y\\theta_k}(\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i\\sin(x\\theta_k))$.\n    This complex equation can be split into two real equations by equating the real and imaginary parts:\n    - Real part: $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(x\\theta_k)$\n    - Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(x\\theta_k)$\n\n3.  **Searching for Solutions**:\n    We will search for solutions in three categories: real numbers, pure imaginary numbers, and general complex numbers.\n\n    a. **Real Solutions ($y=0$):**\n    If $y=0$, $z=x$. The two equations become:\n    - $0 = \\cos(x\\theta_k)$\n    - $x = \\sin(x\\theta_k)$\n    From the first equation, $x\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n    Substituting this into the second equation gives $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\n    - If $n$ is even, $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = 1$, so $x=1$.\n    - If $n$ is odd, $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = -1$, so $x=-1$.\n    Let's check these:\n    - For $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. This is a solution.\n    - For $z=-1$: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is also a solution.\n\n    b. **Pure Imaginary Solutions ($x=0$):**\n    If $x=0$, $z=iy$. The two equations become:\n    - $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(0) = e^{-y\\theta_k}$\n    - $0 = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(0) = 0$ (This is always true).\n    So we need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}$. A graphical analysis or calculus shows that real solutions for $y$ only exist if $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi < 0$, which means $k$ must be a negative integer, $k \\le -1$.\n    For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is one unique non-zero solution for $y$. These solutions cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and require numerical methods to be found.\n\n    c. **General Complex Solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$):**\n    Finding these solutions requires solving the full system of transcendental equations. While such solutions exist, they are difficult to characterize and find analytically.\n\n### Python Code for Finding Solutions\n\nThe following Python code will print and verify the two real solutions. Then, it will use a numerical solver from the `scipy` library to find the first 5 pure imaginary solutions (for $k=-1$ to $k=-5$) and verify them.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\n\ndef verify_solution(z, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies if z is a solution for a given branch k.\n    The equation is z * i = i^z.\n    i^z is calculated as exp(z * log(i)), where log(i) corresponds to branch k.\n    \"\"\"\n    lhs = z * 1j\n    \n    # Calculate ln(i) for branch k\n    log_i_k = 1j * (np.pi/2 + 2 * k * np.pi)\n    \n    # Calculate i^z for branch k\n    rhs = np.exp(z * log_i_k)\n    \n    # Check if the sides are close enough\n    is_solution = np.isclose(lhs, rhs)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nVerifying solution z = {z} for k = {k}:\")\n    print(f\"  Equation: ({z}) * i = i^({z})\")\n    print(f\"  Left side (z*i): {lhs}\")\n    print(f\"  Right side (i^z): {rhs}\")\n    print(f\"  Is it a solution for branch k={k}? {is_solution}\")\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints solutions to z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the complex equation: z * i = i^z\")\n    \n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Real Solutions ---\")\n    print(\"We found two real solutions: z = 1 and z = -1.\")\n    \n    # z = 1\n    # For z=1, we need 1*i = i^1.
