The solutions to the equation $z \cdot i = i^z$ are:
1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  An infinite set of pure imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \le -1$, where $y_k$ is the numerical solution to the equation $-y = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi)}$. The first few are approximately $z_{-1} \approx -0.2686i$, $z_{-2} \approx -0.1245i$, $z_{-3} \approx -0.0811i$, etc.
3.  Other families of complex solutions $z=x+iy$ exist but are not easily expressed in a closed form.
