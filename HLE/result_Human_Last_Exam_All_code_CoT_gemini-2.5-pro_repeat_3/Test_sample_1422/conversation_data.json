    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The simplest and most common renormalizable interacting scalar field theory is the **φ⁴ (phi-4) theory**. In this theory, each interaction vertex involves four field lines. This choice will lead to the absolute minimum number of vertices.\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** For any connected Feynman diagram, two fundamental relationships hold:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`, which relates the number of vertices (`V`), the number of lines per vertex (`n`), the number of internal lines (`I`), and the number of external lines (`E`).\n3.  **Set the Parameters:**\n    *   We are looking for a **two-loop** diagram, so `L = 2`.\n    *   We are using **φ⁴ theory**, so `n = 4`.\n    *   To find the simplest possible diagram, we consider a **vacuum diagram**, which has no external lines, so `E = 0`.\n4.  **Solve for V:** We will set up a system of two equations with two unknowns (`I` and `V`) and solve for `V`.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print out the steps and the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define the parameters ---\n    # Number of loops for a two-loop diagram\n    L = 2\n    # Number of lines per vertex for the simplest interacting scalar theory (phi^4)\n    n = 4\n    # Number of external lines for the simplest diagram (a vacuum diagram)\n    E = 0\n\n    print(\"We want to find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"The topological relations are:\")\n    print(\"1) L = I - V + 1         (Loop formula)\")\n    print(\"2) n * V = 2 * I + E     (Vertex-line relation)\")\n    print(\"\\nWe are given the following parameters:\")\n    print(f\" - Number of loops, L = {L}\")\n    print(f\" - Number of lines per vertex, n = {n} (for a phi^4 theory)\")\n    print(f\" - Number of external lines, E = {E} (for a simple vacuum diagram)\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Set up the equation to solve for V ---\n    # From equation (1), we can write I as: I = L + V - 1\n    # From equation (2), we can write I as: I = (n*V - E) / 2\n    # By equating these two expressions for I, we get:\n    # L + V - 1 = (n*V - E) / 2\n\n    print(\"\\nBy combining the two relations, we get the equation to solve for V:\")\n    print(\"L + V - 1 = (n * V - E) / 2\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\")\n    print(f\"{L} + V - 1 = ({n} * V - {E}) / 2\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Solve the equation ---\n    # 2 + V - 1 = (4*V - 0) / 2\n    # 1 + V = 2*V\n    # 1 = V\n    # We can also solve this programmatically from the general form:\n    # 2*(L + V - 1) = n*V - E\n    # 2L + 2V - 2 = nV - E\n    # 2L - 2 + E = nV - 2V\n    # 2L - 2 + E = (n - 2)V\n    # V = (2L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\n    V = (2 * L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\n\n    # Check if the result is an integer\n    if V.is_integer():\n        V = int(V)\n        # We can also find the number of internal lines (I) for this diagram\n        I = L + V - 1\n        print(\"\\nSolving the final equation gives the minimum number of vertices:\")\n        print(f\"V = {V}\")\n        print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to a 'figure-eight' diagram with {V} vertex and {I} internal lines.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nNo integer solution exists for V with these parameters.\")\n\n\nsolve_feynman_vertices()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
