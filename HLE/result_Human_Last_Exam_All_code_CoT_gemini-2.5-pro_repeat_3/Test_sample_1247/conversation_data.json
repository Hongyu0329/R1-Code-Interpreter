    "This problem asks for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the notation**: \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) is the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\). Here, \\(n=333\\), \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\sigma=1324\\).\n\n2.  **Use known results from combinatorics**: For a given pattern \\(\\sigma\\) of length \\(m\\) and a number of inversions \\(k\\), the value of \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) stabilizes for large \\(n\\). Specifically, a theorem by Elizalde (2012) states that \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) is constant for all \\(n \\ge (m-1)k\\).\n    *   In our case, \\(m=4\\) and \\(k=3\\), so this value is constant for \\(n \\ge (4-1) \\times 3 = 9\\).\n    *   Since \\(n=333\\) is much larger than 9, we can compute this stable value, let's call it \\(a_k\\).\n\n3.  **Use the generating function**: The generating function for the stable values \\(a_k = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} av_n^k(1324)\\) is known. Let \\(A(x) = \\sum_{k \\ge 0} a_k x^k\\). The formula is:\n    \\[ A(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} \\prod_{i \\ge 1} \\frac{1}{1-x^i C(x^i)} \\]\n    where \\(C(z)\\) is the ordinary generating function for the Catalan numbers, \\(C(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\text{Cat}_n z^n = 1 + z + 2z^2 + 5z^3 + \\dots\\).\n\n4.  **Calculate the coefficient**: We need to find \\(a_3\\), which is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the power series expansion of \\(A(x)\\). We can do this by expanding each term in the product up to the degree of \\(x^3\\) and then multiplying them.\n\n    The expansion will be performed up to \\(O(x^4)\\):\n    *   \\(P_1(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\dots\\)\n    *   \\(P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x C(x)} = \\frac{1}{1 - (x + x^2 + 2x^3 + \\dots)} = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 5x^3 + \\dots\\)\n    *   \\(P_3(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x^2 C(x^2)} = \\frac{1}{1 - (x^2 + x^4 + \\dots)} = 1 + x^2 + \\dots\\)\n    *   \\(P_4(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x^3 C(x^3)} = \\frac{1}{1 - (x^3 + x^6 + \\dots)} = 1 + x^3 + \\dots\\)\n\n    Then, \\(A(x) = P_1(x) P_2(x) P_3(x) P_4(x) \\dots\\). We will multiply these polynomial expansions to find the coefficient of \\(x^3\\).\n\n5.  **Write Python code**: A Python script will be provided to perform the polynomial multiplications and extract the desired coefficient, confirming the manual calculation.\n\n```python\ndef poly_mult(p1, p2, deg):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two polynomials p1 and p2, returning the result up to a given degree.\"\"\"\n    n1 = len(p1)\n    n2 = len(p2)\n    res = [0] * (deg + 1)\n    for i in range(n1):\n        for j in range(n2):\n            if i + j <= deg:\n                res[i + j] += p1[i] * p2[j]\n    return res\n\ndef poly_inv(p, deg):\n    \"\"\"Computes the multiplicative inverse of a polynomial p up to a given degree.\"\"\"\n    if p[0] == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot invert a polynomial with a zero constant term.\")\n    \n    # Normalize p so that the constant term is 1\n    const_term = p[0]\n    p_norm = [c / const_term for c in p]\n    \n    res = [0] * (deg + 1)\n    res[0] = 1.0 / const_term\n    \n    for i in range(1, deg + 1):\n        s = 0\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if j < len(p_norm):\n                s += p_norm[j] * res[i - j]\n        res[i] = -s\n        \n    return [round(c) for c in res]\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions for large n.\n    This value, av_n^k(1324), is constant for n >= (4-1)*k.\n    For k=3, this holds for n >= 9.\n    The value is the coefficient of x^3 in the generating function:\n    A(x) = (1/(1-x)) * product_{i>=1} (1 / (1 - x^i * C(x^i)))\n    \"\"\"\n    DEGREE = 3\n\n    # Catalan numbers: C(z) = 1 + z + 2z^2 + 5z^3 + ...\n    C_poly = [1, 1, 2, 5]\n\n    # Term 1: P1 = 1/(1-x)\n    P1 = [1] * (DEGREE + 1)\n\n    # Term 2: P2 = 1 / (1 - x*C(x))\n    # x*C(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + ...\n    x_C_x_poly = [0] + C_poly[:-1]\n    denom2 = [1] + [-c for c in x_C_x_poly[1:]]\n    P2 = poly_inv(denom2, DEGREE)\n\n    # Term 3: P3 = 1 / (1 - x^2*C(x^2))\n    # C(x^2) = 1 + x^2 + ...\n    # x^2*C(x^2) = x^2 + x^4 + ...\n    x2_C_x2_poly = [0, 0, 1] # x^2 * (1)\n    denom3 = [1, 0, -1]\n    P3 = poly_inv(denom3, DEGREE)\n\n    # Term 4: P4 = 1 / (1 - x^3*C(x^3))\n    # C(x^3) = 1 + ...\n    # x^3*C(x^3) = x^3 + ...\n    x3_C_x3_poly = [0, 0, 0, 1] # x^3 * (1)\n    denom4 = [1, 0, 0, -1]\n    P4 = poly_inv(denom4, DEGREE)\n    \n    # A(x) = P1 * P2 * P3 * P4 * ...
