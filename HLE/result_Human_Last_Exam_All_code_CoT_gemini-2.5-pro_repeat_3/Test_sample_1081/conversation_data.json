    "The user wants to find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** In the context of algebraic groups over finite fields, \"the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" usually refers to the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of such tori. The total number of such subgroups would be a very large and complex polynomial in $q$, which is not a standard question.\n2.  **Connect Tori Classes to the Weyl Group:** For a split reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in a one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, $W$.\n3.  **Analyze the Group Type $E_8$:** I need to determine if the group $G$ of type $E_8$ is necessarily split. The classification of forms of an algebraic group over a field is related to Galois cohomology. For the type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that all forms of $E_8$ are inner forms. By a theorem of Steinberg, any inner form of a connected reductive group over a finite field is split. Thus, any group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split.\n4.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a well-established result in mathematics.\n5.  **State the Result:** The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is 112. This number is independent of the field size $q$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final result, satisfying the user's request for a code-based solution. The script will explicitly state the logical \"equation\" that leads to the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G\n    of type E8 over the finite field F_q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the interpretation of the question.\n    print(\"Step 1: Interpreting the question\")\n    print(\"The phrase 'number of F_q-rational maximal tori' is standardly interpreted in this context as the 'number of F_q-conjugacy classes of F_q-rational maximal tori'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Relate tori classes to Weyl group conjugacy classes.\n    print(\"Step 2: Theoretical background\")\n    print(\"For any split reductive group G over a finite field F_q, there is a fundamental theorem that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between:\")\n    print(\"  (a) The F_q-conjugacy classes of F_q-rational maximal tori of G.\")\n    print(\"  (b) The conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W of G.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Justify why a group of type E8 over F_q is split.\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the group of type E8\")\n    print(\"A reductive group G of type E8 over any field is an 'inner form' of the split group.
