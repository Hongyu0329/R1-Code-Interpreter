    "Of course. The dimension of a Lie group is the number of independent parameters that define its transformations. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this corresponds to the dimension of its Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the fundamental physical symmetries that leave the equations unchanged. These are transformations of space, time, velocity, and pressure.\n2.  List the number of independent generators (dimensions) for each type of symmetry:\n    *   **Time translation:** Shifting the start time.\n    *   **Space translations:** Shifting the origin of the coordinate system.\n    *   **Rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system.\n    *   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   **Scaling:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure that preserves the equations.\n    *   **Pressure shift:** Shifting the pressure by a constant value.\n3.  Sum these dimensions to find the total dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n4.  Write a Python script that defines a variable for each dimension, calculates the sum, and prints the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3D.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of its constituent symmetries.\")\n    \n    # Dimension from time translation (t -> t + a)\n    time_translation_dim = 1\n    \n    # Dimension from space translations (x -> x + b) in R^3\n    space_translation_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension from rotations (SO(3) group) in R^3\n    rotation_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts (v -> v + v_0) in R^3\n    galilean_boost_dim = 3\n    \n    # Dimension from scaling transformations\n    # (t, x, u, p) -> (a^2*t, a*x, a^-1*u, a^-2*p)\n    scaling_dim = 1\n    \n    # Dimension from constant pressure shift (p -> p + c)\n    pressure_shift_dim = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total dimension\n    total_dimension = (time_translation_dim +\n                       space_translation_dim +\n                       rotation_dim +\n                       galilean_boost_dim +\n                       scaling_dim +\n                       pressure_shift_dim)\n                       \n    print(\"\\nBreakdown of the dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"Time Translation:    {time_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Space Translations:  {space_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Rotations:           {rotation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Galilean Boosts:     {galilean_boost_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Scaling:             {scaling_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Pressure Shift:      {pressure_shift_dim}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total dimension is:\")\n    # Using the variables to explicitly show each number in the sum\n    print(f\"{time_translation_dim} + {space_translation_dim} + {rotation_dim} + {galilean_boost_dim} + {scaling_dim} + {pressure_shift_dim} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
