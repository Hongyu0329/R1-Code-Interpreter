    print("The condition that a topological group has 'no nontrivial convergent sequences' means that if a sequence converges to a limit, it must be eventually constant and equal to that limit.")
    print("For a group topology on the integers (Z), this condition is equivalent to the topology being the discrete topology (where every subset is open).")
    print("Reasoning: If the topology is not discrete, {0} is not an open set. Since any group topology on Z is metrizable (and thus first-countable), we can find a sequence of non-zero integers that converges to 0. This would be a nontrivial convergent sequence. Thus, the topology must be discrete.")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the condition 'totally bounded'.")
    print("A topological group G is 'totally bounded' if for every open neighborhood U of the identity (0 in Z), G can be covered by a finite number of translates of U.")
    print("Let's test if the discrete topology on Z can be totally bounded.")

    print("For this topology to be totally bounded, there must exist a finite set of integers {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n} such that Z is the union of the sets (g_i + U).")
    print("This means Z = (g_1 + {0}) U (g_2 + {0}) U ... U (g_n + {0}).")
    print("So, Z = {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}.")
    print("This implies that the set of integers Z is a finite set.")
    print("This is a contradiction, as the integers are an infinite set.")
    print("This gives us Property B: A totally bounded group topology on Z cannot be discrete.\n")

    print("Step 3: Combine the properties to find the number of such topologies.")
    print("We are looking for a topology that satisfies both conditions.")
    print("From Property A, the topology must be the discrete topology.")
    print("From Property B, the topology cannot be the discrete topology.")
