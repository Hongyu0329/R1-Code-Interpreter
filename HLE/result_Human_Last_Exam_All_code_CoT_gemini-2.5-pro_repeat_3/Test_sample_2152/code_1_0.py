def calculate_cross_section_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the ratio of differential cross-sections for scattering
    by a magnetic monopole and a magnetic dipole.

    The formula for the ratio, derived under the Born approximation for small angles, is:
    Ratio = (3 * hbar^2 * e_m^2) / (4 * p^2 * mu^2)

    We substitute the given values and physical definitions:
    - e_m = (1/16) * e
    - p = m * v = m * (c/100)
    - mu = 25 * mu_B = 25 * (e * hbar) / (2 * m_e * c)

    Assuming the scattered particle is an electron (m = m_e), the fundamental constants
    cancel out, leading to a simplified formula:
    Ratio = (3 * (e_m/e)^2) / ((v/c)^2 * (mu/mu_B)^2)
