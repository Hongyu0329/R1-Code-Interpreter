    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to present the results.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework:** The problem is to find the equilibrium properties of a gas of light quanta (photons). In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the macroscopic state that corresponds to the maximum number of microscopic arrangements, i.e., the state of maximum entropy, subject to physical constraints. The large deviation theorems mentioned (Boltzmann-Sanov, Cramer-Chernoff) provide the formal mathematical foundation for this \"Principle of Maximum Entropy\". They essentially state that the probability of observing a system in any macroscopic state other than the maximum entropy state is exponentially small for a large number of particles. Therefore, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy.\n\n2.  **Applying the Maximum Entropy Principle:**\n    *   **System:** A gas of photons (bosons) in a volume V at thermal equilibrium.\n    *   **Entropy:** We use the entropy formula for bosons.\n    *   **Constraints:** The total average energy `<E>` is constant. Since photons can be created and destroyed, their total number is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero.\n    *   **Maximization:** Maximizing the entropy subject to the energy constraint yields the equilibrium distribution for the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` with energy `ε`. This is the celebrated **Planck distribution** (a specific case of the Bose-Einstein distribution).\n\n3.  **Calculating Equilibrium Values:**\n    *   **Mean Energy `<E>`:** To find the total mean energy, we will integrate the energy per photon `ε` multiplied by the Planck distribution over the density of states for photons in 3D space. This calculation leads to the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy density is proportional to `T^4`.\n    *   **Entropy `S`:** Once the mean energy `<E>` is determined, the entropy `S` can be found using fundamental thermodynamic relations. For a photon gas, a simple, elegant relationship exists between energy, entropy, and temperature.\n\n4.  **Python Code Implementation:** The Python code will not perform a numerical derivation but will display the final, established formulas for the Planck distribution, the mean energy `<E>`, and the entropy `S` that result from this procedure. It will clearly present the equations with all their numerical and symbolic components, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses established formulas from statistical mechanics,\n    which are derived using principles underpinned by large deviation theory,\n    to describe the equilibrium state of a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The equilibrium state of a photon gas is found by maximizing its entropy.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the following key results:\\n\")\n\n    # --- 1.
