# --- Main Logic ---

# Step 1: Analyze the core concept of Superlubricity.
# Structural superlubricity arises from the mismatch (incommensurability) between the atomic lattices of two sliding surfaces.
# When the lattices are misaligned or have different spacings, the potential energy landscape becomes very smooth, leading to ultra-low friction.
# Conversely, when the lattices align (commensurability or high coherence), the atoms lock into place, resulting in high friction.

# Step 2: Evaluate the provided options.
# Option B correctly identifies the two most fundamental factors:
# 1. Normal Load: As in classical friction, increasing the force pressing the surfaces together increases friction.
# 2. Alignment of atomic structures (Coherence): This is the defining feature. As coherence increases, the system moves from a low-friction superlubric state to a high-friction stick-slip state.
# Other options are less accurate: A and D oversimplify or misstate relationships, while C and E focus on secondary (though still relevant) dynamic/thermal effects or are overly restrictive.

print("Based on the principles of structural superlubricity, the frictional response is fundamentally determined by the normal load and the alignment of the atomic structures.")
print("Option B is the correct choice.")
print("\nTo illustrate this, we can create a simple conceptual model in Python.")
print("Let's model the frictional force as a function of these two factors.")

# Step 3: Create an illustrative model based on Option B.
# F_friction = (Base_Friction_Coeff * Normal_Load) + (Coherence_Impact_Coeff * Coherence_Factor * Normal_Load)
# This model shows a base friction dependent on load, plus a much larger term that "turns on" with atomic coherence.

# Define hypothetical parameters for our model
normal_load = 50.0  # in nanoNewtons (nN)
coherence_factor = 0.8 # A value from 0 (perfect mismatch) to 1 (perfect alignment)
base_friction_coeff = 0.001 # Represents the low friction in the superlubric state
coherence_impact_coeff = 0.5 # Represents the strong effect of atomic alignment

# Step 4: Calculate the frictional force using the model.
frictional_force = (base_friction_coeff * normal_load) + (coherence_impact_coeff * coherence_factor * normal_load)

# Step 5: Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
print("\n--- Illustrative Calculation ---")
print(f"Using the model: F_friction = (Base_Friction_Coeff * Normal_Load) + (Coherence_Impact_Coeff * Coherence_Factor * Normal_Load)")
print("Plugging in our hypothetical values:")

# The final print statement will show the full equation with numbers.
# We build the string carefully to show each number as requested.
final_equation_str = f"Frictional Force ({frictional_force:.2f} nN) = ({base_friction_coeff} * {normal_load}) + ({coherence_impact_coeff} * {coherence_factor} * {normal_load})"
