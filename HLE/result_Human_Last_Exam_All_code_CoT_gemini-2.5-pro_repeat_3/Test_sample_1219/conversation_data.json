    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with very high precision. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Math:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π (pi). This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The number `10^100` is a 1 followed by 100 zeros, an immense number. Directly calculating `tan(10^100)` using standard floating-point numbers (like in a calculator or standard Python floats) would lead to massive precision loss and an incorrect result. The key is to first find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by π.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool:** Standard libraries are not equipped for this. We need a library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Python `mpmath` library is perfect for this, as it's designed for high-precision floating-point calculations.\n\n3.  **Set Precision:** To get an accurate result for `10^100 mod π`, the precision for π and the calculations must be greater than the number of digits in `10^100`. Since `10^100` has 101 digits, we'll set the precision in `mpmath` to a higher value, like 110 decimal places, to ensure accuracy.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    *   Use `mpmath` to represent `10^100`.\n    *   Calculate `y = 10^100 mod π` using `mpmath` functions.\n    *   Calculate `tan(y)`. The result of this is the same as `tan(10^100)`.\n    *   Convert the final numerical result into a string.\n    *   Extract the three digits immediately following the decimal point.\n\nThis plan will give us the required digits accurately.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# 1. Set the precision for the calculation.\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits. To find its value modulo pi accurately,\n# our working precision must be greater than 101. We'll use 110 decimal places.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# 2. Define the large number x = 10^100\nx = mpmath.mpf('1e100')\n\n# 3. The tangent function is periodic with period pi.\n# So, tan(x) is equivalent to tan(y) where y = x mod pi.\n# We calculate the remainder of x when divided by pi.\n# This gives us an equivalent angle y.\ny = mpmath.fmod(x, mpmath.pi)\n\n# 4. Now, we calculate the tangent of this smaller, equivalent angle y.\n# The result is the value of tan(10^100).\nresult = mpmath.tan(y)\n\n# 5. To find the first 3 digits after the comma, we convert the result to a string.\nresult_str = str(result)\n\n# 6. Locate the decimal point and extract the 3 digits that follow it.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n# We are asked to find the first 3 digits of tan(10^100).\n# The final equation is tan(10^100) = result.\nprint(f\"The number in the function is 10^100.\")\nprint(f\"The value of tan(10^100) is approximately: {result}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits[0]}, {first_three_digits[1]}, and {first_three_digits[2]}.\")\n\n```\n<<<859>>>"
