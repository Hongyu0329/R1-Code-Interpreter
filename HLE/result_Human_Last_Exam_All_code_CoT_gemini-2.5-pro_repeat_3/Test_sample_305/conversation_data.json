    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the input:** We have a set with 3 elements. Let's label them {0, 1, 2}. A binary operation '*' is a function that takes two elements from the set and returns an element from the set. We can represent any such operation with a 3x3 Cayley table (or multiplication table).\n\n2.  **Apply the commutative property:** An operation is commutative if `x * y = y * x` for all elements x, y in the set. This means the Cayley table must be symmetric across its main diagonal. So, to define a commutative operation, we only need to specify the values for the pairs (x, y) where `x <= y`. These are the diagonal and the upper triangle of the table.\n    *   The number of these entries is `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. For n=3, this is `(3 * 4) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   The entries to define are: `0*0`, `0*1`, `0*2`, `1*1`, `1*2`, `2*2`.\n    *   Since each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements, the total number of distinct commutative operations is `3^6 = 729`.\n\n3.  **Apply the associative property:** An operation is associative if `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all elements x, y, z. There is no simple formula to count this directly. The most reliable method is to check each of the 729 commutative operations to see if it is also associative.\n\n4.  **Automate with code:** We will write a Python script to perform this check. The script will:\n    *   Generate all 729 possible commutative Cayley tables.\n    *   For each table, systematically check if the associative property `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` holds for all `3*3*3 = 27` possible choices of (x, y, z).\n    *   Count the number of tables that satisfy the property for all choices.\n    *   Print the final count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_ops():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by brute-force checking.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    \n    # For a commutative operation, the Cayley table is symmetric.
