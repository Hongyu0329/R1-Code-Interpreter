    # Step 1: Analyze incorrect or less-fitting options
    print("--- Analysis of Options A, B, and E ---")
    print("A. Gene conversion: This process homogenizes gene copies, working against divergence. So, it's incorrect.")
    print("B. Pseudogenization: This is the process of a gene copy becoming non-functional. It is a common fate, but it represents a loss of function, not the functional retention and divergence the question asks about.")
    print("E. Adaptive radiation: This is a macroevolutionary process of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. So, it's incorrect.\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the two primary correct models
    print("--- Analysis of Core Models C and D ---")
    print("C. Neofunctionalization: One gene copy retains the original function while the other acquires a novel, beneficial function through mutation. This is a major source of evolutionary innovation but relies on relatively rare gain-of-function mutations.")
    print("D. Subfunctionalization: The ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy specializes by losing a subset of the original functions through mutation. Both copies are then required to fulfill the complete original role. This process relies on more common loss-of-function (degenerative) mutations.\n")

    # Step 3: Determine which is 'most likely'
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("To be retained, a duplicate gene must avoid becoming a pseudogene. Subfunctionalization provides a powerful mechanism for this.")
    print("The 'Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation' (DDC) model, which describes subfunctionalization, shows that if two complementary loss-of-function mutations occur (one in each gene copy), natural selection will preserve both copies.")
    print("Because the loss-of-function mutations required for subfunctionalization are much more common than the specific gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization is considered the more probable, or 'most likely', initial mechanism for preserving duplicated genes.\n")
