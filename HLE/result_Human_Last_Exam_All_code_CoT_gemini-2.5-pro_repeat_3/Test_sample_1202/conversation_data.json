    "Of the provided options, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention of duplicated genes. To determine which is \"most likely,\" we can analyze the underlying probabilities of the required mutations.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the biological mechanisms listed in the answer choices.\n2.  Analyze each mechanism's role in the context of gene duplication, retention, and divergence.\n3.  Compare the relative likelihoods of neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. Subfunctionalization relies on common loss-of-function mutations, while neofunctionalization requires rarer gain-of-function mutations.\n4.  Conclude which mechanism is therefore considered more likely to be responsible for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n5.  Print the analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms related to the fate of duplicated genes\n    to determine the most likely one for retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Analyzing the choices:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze incorrect or less-fitting options\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Options A, B, and E ---\")\n    print(\"A.
