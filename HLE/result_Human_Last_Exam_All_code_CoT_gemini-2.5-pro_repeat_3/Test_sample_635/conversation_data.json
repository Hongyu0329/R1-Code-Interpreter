    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: We first find a simple diagonal polynomial matrix $D_0(s)$ that clears the denominators of $H(s)$ on a row-by-row basis. This gives an initial, but not necessarily coprime, factorization $H(s) = D_0^{-1}(s) N_0(s)$.\n2.  **Coprimeness Check**: A pair of matrices $(D, N)$ is left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. We check this condition for our initial pair $(D_0, N_0)$. It is sufficient to check at the specific values of $s$ where the determinant of $D_0(s)$ is zero.\n3.  **Extracting Common Divisors**: If the pair is not coprime, it means they share a common left divisor, $G(s)$. We find this $G(s)$ and \"cancel\" it out by defining the new factorization as $D(s) = G^{-1}(s)D_0(s)$ and $N(s) = G^{-1}(s)N_0(s)$. This process is repeated until the resulting pair is coprime.\n\nFollowing this procedure, we arrive at the final coprime matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\nThe Python code below defines the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, and then programmatically verifies that they form a correct left coprime factorization by:\n1.  Checking if $D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ simplifies back to the original $H(s)$.\n2.  Confirming the coprimeness by checking the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ at the roots of $\\det(D(s))$.\n3.
