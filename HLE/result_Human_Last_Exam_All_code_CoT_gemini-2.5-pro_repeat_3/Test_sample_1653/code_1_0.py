# Step 1: Define the points in the sets A_k and B_k for large k.
# A_k = {a_1, a_2}, with a_1 at origin, a_2 at distance k^3.
# B_k = {b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}, a cluster of 4 points at distance k^2 from origin.

# Step 2: Determine the asymptotic contribution of each point in A_k to the potential sum.
# The potential involves sum of logs of distances. We need the coefficient of ln(k).

# Contribution from a_1 = (0,0):
# For each of the 4 points in B_k, the distance to a_1 is ~ k^2.
# The log of the distance is ln(k^2) = 2 * ln(k).
# Summing over the 4 points in B_k gives a coefficient of 4 * 2 = 8.
coeff_a1 = 4 * 2

# Contribution from a_2 = (0, k^3):
# For each of the 4 points in B_k, the distance to a_2 is ~ k^3.
# The log of the distance is ln(k^3) = 3 * ln(k).
# Summing over the 4 points in B_k gives a coefficient of 4 * 3 = 12.
coeff_a2 = 4 * 3

# Step 3: Sum the coefficients.
# This corresponds to the sum over y in B_k of (ln||y-a_1|| + ln||y-a_2||).
total_coeff_log_k = coeff_a1 + coeff_a2

# Step 4: Assemble the final expression for the limit.
# The formula is ln(h_k) ~ - (1 / (2*pi)) * (total_coeff_log_k * ln(k))
# The factor of 1/2 comes from the equilibrium measure of the 2-point set A_k.
# The factor of 1/pi comes from the Green's function of the 2D random walk.
# The limit is the coefficient of ln(k) in the expression for ln(h_k).
