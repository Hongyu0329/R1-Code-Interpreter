    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to design a \"deadbeat\" observer. For a discrete-time system, this means the observer should estimate the system's state perfectly after the shortest possible number of time steps. The observation error, `e(k)`, must become zero and stay zero.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Error Dynamics:** The observer's state estimate `x_hat(k)` is updated using the equation `x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`, where `L` is the observer gain matrix we need to find. The error is defined as `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`. The dynamics of this error can be derived as `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\n\n3.  **Deadbeat Condition:** For the error to become zero in a finite number of steps, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be \"nilpotent,\" which means that for some integer `p`, `(A - LC)^p = 0`. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin (i.e., making them all zero). The characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` must be `Î»^n = 0`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector `x`.\n\n4.  **Use Pole Placement via Duality:** Finding the observer gain `L` is an observer pole placement problem. This problem is \"dual\" to the state-feedback controller pole placement problem. We can solve the dual problem, which is often more straightforward, and then convert the solution back.\n    *   The original observer problem is to find `L` such that `eig(A - LC)` are the desired poles.\n    *   The dual controller problem is to find a gain `K` for a system with matrices `A_dual = A^T` and `B_dual = C^T` such that `eig(A_dual - B_dual * K)` are the desired poles.\n    *   The relationship between the gains is `L = K^T`.\n\n5.  **Implementation in Python:** We will use the `scipy.signal.place_poles` function, which is designed for pole placement problems.\n    *   We will define the matrices `A` and `C`.\n    *   The desired poles are `[0, 0, 0, 0]` since the state dimension is 4.\n    *   We will call `place_poles` with the dual system matrices, `A.T` and `C.T`, and the desired poles.\n    *   The function will return a gain matrix `K`. We will take its transpose to find our observer gain `L`.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the resulting gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import place_poles\n\n# Define the system matrices from the problem description\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 0, -1],\n    [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# The state dimension is n\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# For a deadbeat observer, all eigenvalues of the error dynamics\n# matrix (A - LC) must be placed at the origin.\ndesired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n# We solve the dual state-feedback pole placement problem.\n# We want to find a gain K for the system (A.T, C.T) such that\n# the eigenvalues of (A.T - C.T @ K) are the desired poles.\n# The observer gain L is the transpose of this K.\n# We use scipy's place_poles function for this.\n# result = place_poles(A_sys, B_sys, poles)\n# Here, A_sys = A.T and B_sys = C.T\n# The gain K will be L.T\ntry:\n    result = place_poles(A.T, C.T, desired_poles)\n    K = result.gain_matrix\n    \n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the feedback gain K from the dual system.\n    L = K.T\n\n    # --- Final Answer Output ---\n    # The problem asks to provide the answer as a gain matrix.\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\n    # --- Verification (Optional) ---\n    # To verify, we can compute the eigenvalues of (A - L @ C)\n    # and check if they are all close to zero.\n    A_obs = A - L @ C\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_obs)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: Eigenvalues of (A - LC):\")\n    # print(eigenvalues)\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Pole placement failed.
