    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic state-space control problem known as **pole placement** or **eigenvalue assignment**.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The objective is to design a state feedback controller. We are given a system described by matrices `A` and `B`, and we need to find a feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has its eigenvalues at specific locations (`-1 + j` and `-1 - j`). These desired eigenvalue locations are also called \"poles\".\n\n2.  **Formulate the Characteristic Polynomial**:\n    *   First, we determine the desired characteristic polynomial from the target eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`.\n    *   Second, we determine the actual characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF`. This polynomial's coefficients will be in terms of the unknown elements of `F`.\n\n3.  **Solve for F**:\n    *   By equating the coefficients of the actual characteristic polynomial with the desired one, we get a system of equations.\n    *   For a multi-input system like this one (matrix `B` has two columns), the solution for `F` is not unique. There are more unknowns in `F` than there are equations.\n    *   To find one valid solution, we can simplify the problem by assuming a structure for `F`. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero. Here, I will assume the second row of `F` is zero, which is equivalent to only using the first control input to place the poles.\n    *   This simplification gives us a solvable system of linear equations for the remaining unknown elements of `F`.\n\n4.  **Verification**: After finding `F`, I will construct the matrix `A + BF` and calculate its eigenvalues to verify they match the desired locations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the matrix `F` and then verifies the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_and_verify_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system\n    such that A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set numpy print options for clean output\n    np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the system matrices A and B\n    A = np.array([[-1., 1.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n    B = np.array([[1., 2.],\n                  [1., 0.]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define the desired eigenvalues (poles)\n    # The desired characteristic polynomial for poles at -1 +/- j is:\n    # (s - (-1+j))(s - (-1-j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0\n    poles = np.array([-1. + 1.j, -1. - 1.j])\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n    # For a multi-input system, the solution for F is not unique.\n    # We find one solution by assuming F has a simpler form, e.g., F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]].\n    # By solving the characteristic polynomial equations, we get:\n    # f1 + f2 = -1\n    # f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n    # Solving this system gives f1 = 1 and f2 = -2.\n    F = np.array([[1., -2.],\n                  [0., 0.]])\n\n    print(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\n    print(F)\n\n    # Step 4: Form the closed-loop system matrix A_cl = A + B @ F\n    # and print the full equation as requested.\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation A + B * F = A_cl is:\")\n    print(f\"\\n{A}\\n\\n+ \\n\\n{B}\\n\\n@\\n\\n{F}\\n\\n= \\n\\n{A_cl}\")\n\n    # Step 5: Verify the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system\n    eigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A_cl)\n\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Verification:\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A + B * F are:\")\n    # Sorting for consistent comparison\n    print(np.sort(eigenvalues))\n    print(\"\\nThe desired eigenvalues were:\")\n    print(np.sort(poles))\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Check if the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues match\n    if np.allclose(np.sort(eigenvalues), np.sort(poles)):\n        print(\"\\nVerification successful: The eigenvalues match the desired poles.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nVerification failed: The eigenvalues do not match the desired poles.\")\n\n# Run the function\nsolve_and_verify_pole_placement()\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
