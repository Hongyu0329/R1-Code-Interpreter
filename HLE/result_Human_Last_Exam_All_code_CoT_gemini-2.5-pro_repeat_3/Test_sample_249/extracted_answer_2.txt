The final answer is given by a piecewise formula derived from the number of internal nodes ($I=n+2-m$) and the relationship between $n$ and $m$:
$D(n, m) = \begin{cases} 2 & \text{if } m=n+1 \\ 3 & \text{if } m=n \\ 4 & \text{if } m \le n-1 \text{ and } 2m \ge n+1 \\ n+5-2m & \text{if } m \le n-1 \text{ and } 2m < n+1 \end{cases}$
