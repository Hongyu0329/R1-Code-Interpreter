# The values for j, k, and l are determined by solving a multi-part riddle.
# The common theme is identified as the "Dies Irae" chant.

# From F. Liszt's piece S.(250+l) being S.252, we deduce l.
l = 252 - 250

# From B. Spears's album #k ("Circus", #6) and single #(k+l) ("Stronger", #8),
# we deduce k. 6 + 2 = 8.
k = 6

# From J. Hisaishi's score for short film #(j+l) ("Mizugumo Monmon", #4),
# we deduce j. j + 2 = 4.
j = 4 - l

# The final values for j, k, and l are:
# j = 2
# k = 6
# l = 2

# The problem asks to output the numbers.
# The final equation is not explicitly stated, but the values are j, k, and l.
# We will print each number as requested.
print(f"j = {j}")
print(f"k = {k}")
print(f"l = {l}")
print(f"{j} {k} {l}")
