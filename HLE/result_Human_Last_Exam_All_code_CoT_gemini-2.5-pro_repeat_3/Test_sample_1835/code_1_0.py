    This script models Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint to answer the question:

    # --- Step 1: Modeling the understanding of 'Fa' ---

    # The proposition 'Fa' involves a predicate 'F' and an object 'a'.

    # According to the Generality Constraint, understanding 'Fa' means you have
    # grasped the concept of the predicate 'F' itself, separate from 'a'.
    # In our model, this means you don't just know the result of F(10), you
    # understand the function `F` itself (the rule `x > 0`).

    # You are assumed to understand '∀x' ('for all x'). We can model this

    # --- Step 3: Combining concepts to understand '∀x Fx' ---

    # The Generality Constraint states that concepts are recombinable.
    # Since you have the concept 'F' and the concept '∀', you can combine them
    # to form the new thought '∀x Fx'.
