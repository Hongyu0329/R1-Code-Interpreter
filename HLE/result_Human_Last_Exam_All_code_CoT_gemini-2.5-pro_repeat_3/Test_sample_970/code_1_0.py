    Analyzes the assumptions required for a Bayesian agent's expected information gain to converge to zero.

    The core principle is that the total expected information gain over an infinite horizon
    is bounded by the entropy of the agent's prior distribution over models.
    Let p_t be the posterior at time t. The total expected information gain is:
    Sum_{t=0 to inf} E[KL(p_{t+1} || p_t)] <= H(p_0)

    For this sum of non-negative terms to be finite, the prior entropy H(p_0) must be finite.
    If the sum is finite, the terms of the series must converge to zero.
    Therefore, the assumption that the prior has finite entropy (a) is necessary.

    The other options are either sufficient but not necessary (e), simplifying but not necessary (d),
    or consequences/related structural assumptions rather than the core requirement (b, c).

    The answer is 'a'.
    In Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as requested, this is represented as [(a)].
