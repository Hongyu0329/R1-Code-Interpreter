    "Based on current group theory research, I will first deduce the general form of the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$. Then, I will provide a Python script that verifies this conclusion for a specific example, the group $D_{10}$, by directly implementing the definition of a filled group.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\n1.  **Group Structure**: A nonabelian group $G$ of order $2q^m$ (for an odd prime $q$) has a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup by Sylow's theorems. Let this subgroup be $Q$ (of order $q^m$). The group $G$ is a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$, where the action of the generator of $C_2$ on $Q$ is a non-trivial automorphism of order 2.\n\n2.  **Filled Property and the Frattini Subgroup**: The groups in question are solvable. A key theorem states that a finite solvable group $G$ is filled if and only if the quotient group $G/\\Phi(G)$ is filled, where $\\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $G$ (the intersection of all maximal subgroups).\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Problem**: For a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $|Q|$ and $|C_2|$ are coprime, the Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(G)$ is equal to $\\Phi(Q)$ (since $\\Phi(Q)$ is characteristic in $Q$ and thus invariant under the action of $C_2$). Therefore, $G$ is filled if and only if $G/\\Phi(Q)$ is filled.\n\n4.  **The Quotient Group**: The quotient group is $G/\\Phi(Q) \\cong (Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\rtimes C_2$. By Burnside's basis theorem, $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is an elementary abelian $q$-group, i.e., isomorphic to $(C_q)^k$ for some integer $k$. The integer $k$ is the minimum number of generators for $Q$.\n\n5.  **Identifying Filled Candidates**: The problem is now reduced to determining for which values of $k$ the group $H_k = (C_q)^k \\rtimes C_2$ is filled.\n    *   If $k=1$, the group is $C_q \\rtimes C_2$, which is the dihedral group $D_{2q}$. Based on the mathematical literature (e.g., Belonogov, 2005), this group is filled.\n    *   If $k \\geq 2$, the resulting groups, such as $(C_q \\times C_q) \\rtimes C_2$, are known to be not filled.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: For $G$ to be a filled group, we must have $k=1$. This implies that $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is cyclic of order $q$, which in turn means that the group $Q$ itself must be cyclic. So, $Q \\cong C_{q^m}$.\n\n7.  **Final Classification**: The nonabelian groups must be of the form $G = C_{q^m} \\rtimes C_2$. The automorphism group of the cyclic group $C_{q^m}$ has a unique automorphism of order 2, which is the inversion map ($x \\mapsto x^{-1}$). The resulting group is the **generalized dihedral group, $D_{2q^m}$**. Its presentation is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{q^m} = s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe following Python code will verify this result for the case $q=5, m=1$, which corresponds to the dihedral group $D_{10}$. It exhaustively finds all maximal product-free sets and checks that they all generate the full group, confirming that $D_{10}$ is a filled group.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.groups import PermutationGroup\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies that the dihedral group D_10 is a filled group.\n    A group G is filled if every maximal product-free set S in G generates G.\n    A set S is product-free if for any s1, s2 in S, s1*s2 is not in S.\n    A product-free set is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define parameters for the group of order 2*q^m\n    q = 5\n    m = 1\n    order = 2 * (q**m)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the group G = D_10 (D_{2*5}) using permutations\n    # Generators for D_10: rotation 'a' and reflection 'b'\n    a = Permutation(list(range(q)))  # Rotation (0 1 2 3 4)\n    b = Permutation(1, 4)(2, 3)      # Reflection\n    G = PermutationGroup([a, b])\n    \n    elements = list(G.generate())\n    identity = Permutation(q-1)\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the group G = D_{2*q^m} = D_{order}\")\n    print(f\"The equation for the group order is: 2 * {q}^{m} = {order}\")\n    print(f\"Group has {G.order()} elements.\")\n\n    # Function to check if a set is product-free\n    def is_product_free(s_tuple):\n        s_set = set(s_tuple)\n        if identity in s_set:\n            return False\n        for p1 in s_tuple:\n            for p2 in s_tuple:\n                if (p1 * p2) in s_set:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    # Step 2: Find all product-free sets.
