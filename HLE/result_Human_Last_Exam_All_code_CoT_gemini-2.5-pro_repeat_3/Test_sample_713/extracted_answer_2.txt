The set of possible values for the volume of the polytope $P$ is the set of all positive real numbers, $(0, \infty)$. This is because the volume of the initial simplex $T$, denoted as $V$, can be any positive real number. For any given simplex $T$, the volume of its corresponding polytope $P$ is uniquely determined by the dimension $d$ and the volume $V$. The relationship is given by the formula $\text{Vol}(P) = d! \times V$. Thus, the set of possible values for the ratio $\frac{\text{Vol}(P)}{V}$ is the singleton set $\{d!\}$.
