    "To solve this initial value problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the type of equation**: The given equation $x'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t)$ is a separable ordinary differential equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables**: We will move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side. This gives $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n3.  **Integrate both sides**: We will integrate both sides of the separated equation to find the general solution.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition**: We will use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to solve for the constant of integration, $C$.\n5.  **Find the particular solution**: Substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for $x(t)$.\n6.  **Calculate x(1)**: Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations and print out the steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ivp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the initial value problem x'(t) = (t-1)*x^2(t) with x(0) = -8,\n    and finds the value of x(1).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initial condition and evaluation point\n    t0, x0 = 0, -8\n    t_eval = 1\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The differential equation is separable.
