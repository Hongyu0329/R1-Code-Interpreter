# --- Given parameters ---
# Band gap in eV
Eg = 3.0
# 1s exciton resonance peak in eV
E_1s = 1.0
# Principal quantum number for the target state
n = 3

# Step 1: Calculate the 1s exciton binding energy (Eb_1s)
Eb_1s = Eg - E_1s

# Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (Ry_star) for a 2D system
# The 2D binding energy formula is Eb_n = Ry_star / (n - 0.5)^2
# For n=1, Eb_1s = Ry_star / (1 - 0.5)^2 = Ry_star / 0.25
# Therefore, Ry_star = Eb_1s * (1 - 0.5)^2
Ry_star = Eb_1s * (1 - 0.5)**2

# Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n=3 (Eb_3)
Eb_3 = Ry_star / (n - 0.5)**2

# --- Output the results ---
