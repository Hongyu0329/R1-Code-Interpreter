    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. The solution is not derived from computation but from a well-known mathematical theorem. My plan is to explain the theorem and then use a Python script to state the result clearly.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects:** The question is about \"homogeneous planar continua\".\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar** means it can be embedded in the plane (ℝ²).\n    *   **Homogeneous** means the space looks the same from every point.\n2.  **Recall the Classification Theorem:** A fundamental theorem by R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones provides a complete classification of these objects. It states that any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of two specific spaces:\n    *   The **simple closed curve** (i.e., the circle).\n    *   The **pseudo-arc**.\n3.  **Determine the number of classes:** These two spaces, the circle and the pseudo-arc, are not homeomorphic to each other (for example, the circle is locally connected, while the pseudo-arc is not). Therefore, they represent two distinct homeomorphism classes.\n4.  **Create the Python script:** The script will not compute this result but will print the explanation and the final answer, as the result is a known mathematical fact. It will state the two classes and sum them to get the total number, fulfilling the prompt's requirement to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and states the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on established mathematical theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to the classification theorem by R.
