    "Here is my plan to design the threshold signature scheme:\n\nFirst, I will choose a suitable cryptographic foundation. The Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature scheme is an excellent choice because it is deterministic, its signatures are aggregatable, and it naturally lends itself to a simple and secure threshold implementation. The security of the scheme is based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in pairing-friendly groups.\n\nNext, I will outline the three phases of the scheme:\n\n1.  **Key Generation (Setup Phase)**: This phase is performed once to set up the scheme. For simplicity, I will simulate a Trusted Dealer model, but in a real-world scenario, a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol would be used to avoid a single point of failure. The dealer will:\n    *   Create a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`.\n    *   The master secret key will be the constant term of the polynomial.\n    *   Distribute shares of this polynomial to each of the `n` participants. Each participant `i` receives a point `(i, f(i))` on the polynomial. `f(i)` is their secret key share.\n    *   Publish the public verification key for each participant's share and the master public key for the entire group.\n\n2.  **Signing (Two-Round Protocol)**: This is the core of the task. When a group of at least `t` participants decides to sign a message, they engage in a two-round protocol, coordinated by a designated leader (the combiner):\n    *   **Round 1 (Request)**: The combiner sends a request to sign a specific message `m` to the chosen set of `t` participants.\n    *   **Round 2 (Response)**: Each participant validates the request, computes their partial signature on the message using their secret share, and sends it back to the combiner.\n\n3.  **Signature Aggregation & Verification**: After Round 2, the combiner performs the following steps:\n    *   Verifies each incoming partial signature against the sender's public verification key. This is crucial for robustness, as it identifies any faulty or malicious participants immediately.\n    *   If all partial signatures are valid, the combiner uses Lagrange interpolation to combine the `t` partial signatures into a single, final group signature.\n    *   This final signature can then be verified by anyone using the master public key.\n\nFinally, I will implement this design in Python using the `py_ecc` library, which provides the necessary elliptic curve and pairing operations for the BLS12-381 curve. The code will simulate the entire process for `n=5` participants and a threshold of `t=3`, demonstrating each step from key generation to final signature verification. I will ensure the output clearly shows the components of the final signature equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\n\n# The py_ecc library is required.
