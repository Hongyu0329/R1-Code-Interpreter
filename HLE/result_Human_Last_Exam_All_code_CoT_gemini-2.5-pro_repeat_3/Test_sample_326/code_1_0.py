def solve_minimal_dimension():
    """
    Calculates the minimal possible area of a compact set C on the plane
    satisfying the given geometric property.

    The problem can be reduced to finding the minimal area of a convex set K
    such that the length of its longest chord in any direction is at least 1/2.
    This is equivalent to its minimal 'diameter' d_min being at least 1/2.

    The convex shape that minimizes the ratio Area / d_min^2 is the
    equilateral triangle. For an equilateral triangle, d_min is its altitude h.

    To find the minimal area, we set the altitude h = 1/2.
    The area of an equilateral triangle with altitude h is given by the formula:
    Area = h^2 / sqrt(3).
