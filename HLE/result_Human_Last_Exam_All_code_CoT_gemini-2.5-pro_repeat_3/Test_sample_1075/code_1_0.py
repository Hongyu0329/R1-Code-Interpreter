    This function determines the correct legal advice for Lewis based on the provided scenario.

    The analysis concludes that:
    1. The contract is for the sale of "goods," so the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) applies.
    2. Lewis made the specific purpose for the painting known (a "centrepiece").
    3. Lewis relied on the artist's skill.
    4. The delivered painting was not fit for the specified purpose and did not match the description.
    5. This breach of an implied condition allows Lewis to reject the painting and recover the purchase price.

    Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
