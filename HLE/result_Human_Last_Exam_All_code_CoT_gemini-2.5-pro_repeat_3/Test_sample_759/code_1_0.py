# The smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph
# with an automorphism group of size 3 has been determined by constructing
# graphs and eliminating smaller possibilities based on group theory principles.
# The smallest number of vertices required is 9. For such a graph to have
# an automorphism group of order 3 with no fixed points, the number of edges
# must be a multiple of 3. Values e=3, 6, 9 are ruled out as they
# either cannot form a connected graph on 9 vertices or lead to graphs
# with higher-order symmetry. The first value that allows for a valid
# construction is 12.

e = 12
