# Step 1: Define the properties of the product molecule.
# The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.
# We will analyze its structure to find the parameters for the complexity calculation.

# Step 2: Determine the parameters for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula.
# The formula is BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts.
# We will calculate the parameters based on the heavy-atom (non-hydrogen) skeleton.

# N_atoms: Number of heavy atoms.
# Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2) has 6 Carbon atoms and 2 Oxygen atoms.
N_atoms = 6 + 2

# N_bonds: Number of bonds between heavy atoms.
# - 5 C-C bonds in the cyclopentane ring.
# - 1 C-C bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group carbon.
# - 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (1 C=O and 1 C-O). The double bond is counted as one connection.
N_bonds = 5 + 1 + 2

# N_cycles: Number of rings.
# The molecule has one cyclopentane ring.
N_cycles = 1

# N_parts: Number of disconnected parts.
# The molecule is a single connected entity.
N_parts = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC).
BMC = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts

# Step 4: Print the explanation and the final calculation.
