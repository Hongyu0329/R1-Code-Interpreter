    "Integrins are cell adhesion receptors that recognize specific short amino acid motifs in their extracellular matrix ligands. The most famous of these motifs is the RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence. However, the affinity and specificity of binding are greatly influenced by the amino acids flanking this core RGD tripeptide. These flanking residues often help to form a specific three-dimensional conformation, such as a beta-turn, that presents the RGD motif optimally to the integrin binding pocket.\n\nMy plan is to analyze each peptide sequence based on known high-affinity integrin-binding motifs found in nature. I will write a Python script to perform this analysis.\n\n1.  **Store the candidate peptides:** I will put the answer choices into a data structure.\n2.  **Define known motifs:** The most well-characterized RGD-containing sequence for in vitro assays is derived from fibronectin, which contains the sequence `RGDSP`. The proline (P) following the serine (S) is crucial for inducing a stable beta-turn structure, which significantly enhances binding affinity to certain integrins, particularly α5β1.\n3.  **Analyze each candidate:** The script will iterate through each peptide and check if it contains this well-established high-affinity `RGDSP` motif.\n4.  **Output the result:** The script will print its analysis and identify the peptide that contains the known high-affinity binding sequence.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_best_integrin_binder():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to identify the one most likely to bind\n    to an integrin receptor based on known high-affinity motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of peptide candidates from the answer choices\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    # Known high-affinity motif.
