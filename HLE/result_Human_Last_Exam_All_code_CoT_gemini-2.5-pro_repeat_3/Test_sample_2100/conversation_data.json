    "My thinking process to solve this riddle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into key pieces of information:\n    *   **Subject:** A man.\n    *   **Describer:** The poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   **Description 1:** \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This points to an explorer or navigator.\n    *   **Description 2:** Voznesensky wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This indicates the man's grave was lost or its location was unknown for a long time.\n    *   **Timeline:** The location of the grave, or \"the answer to this question\", was discovered or became known in the late 1980s.\n\n2.  **Connect the Clues:** The strongest link is Andrei Voznesensky. I need to find a historical figure who fits the \"sailor/explorer with a lost grave\" profile and was a subject of Voznesensky's work.\n\n3.  **Identify the Figure:**\n    *   Andrei Voznesensky is the author of the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera *Juno and Avos* (Юнона и Авось).\n    *   The protagonist of this opera is Nikolai Rezanov, a real-life Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who promoted the Russian-American Company's interests in the early 19th century.\n    *   Rezanov's journey to California by sea fits the \"sailor\" description. Voznesensky romanticized him as an explorer of new possibilities.\n    *   Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his return journey. His grave at the Resurrection Cathedral was destroyed and lost after the Russian Revolution. Voznesensky was fascinated by this mystery and referenced it in his poetry.\n    *   In the late 1980s, during the era of Glasnost, there was a massive resurgence of public and historical interest in figures like Rezanov. The mystery of his grave became a widely discussed topic, and his story was re-evaluated. This fits the clue that \"the answer... emerged\" during this time, as his story and the search for his resting place came back into the public consciousness.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that states these facts and prints the resulting last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the clues to identify the historical figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clues from the prompt\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    grave_mystery = \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n    time_clue = \"The answer emerged in the late 1980s\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the riddle's clues:\")\n    print(f\"1. The figure was the subject of a poem by {poet}.\")\n    print(f\"2. He was described as a '{description}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. His grave was lost, prompting the question: '{grave_mystery}'?\")\n    print(f\"4. The mystery surrounding his grave was revisited in the {time_clue}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Connecting the clues:\")\n    print(f\"The poet {poet} wrote the famous rock opera 'Juno and Avos'.\")\n    print(\"The main character of this opera is the Russian explorer and statesman Nikolai Rezanov.\")\n    print(\"Voznesensky's work portrays Rezanov as a visionary explorer and focuses on the tragedy of his death and lost grave in Siberia.\")\n    print(\"Interest in Rezanov's story and the search for his grave surged during the 'Glasnost' period of the late 1980s.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # The final answer\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(f\"Based on the connection to Voznesensky's work and the historical context, the man's last name is:\")\n    print(last_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
