    "My plan is to find the first Best Picture Oscar winner that shows one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\n1.  **Identify Obelisk Locations**: I'll start by confirming the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. One is at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and the other is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **List Best Picture Winners**: I will get a chronological list of all the movies that have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n3.  **Cross-Reference Films and Locations**: I will go through the list of winners, starting from the earliest, and research the settings and scenes of each film. I'll pay special attention to movies set in Paris or Egypt.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Match**: The first movie in the chronological list that clearly depicts either the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Temple will be the answer.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will create a Python script that declares variables for the movie's title, its release year, and the obelisk's location, and then prints the answer in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Research findings\n    movie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n    release_year = 1951\n    academy_award_number = 24\n    obelisk_location = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris\"\n\n    # The final answer describing the film and the context.\n    # The prompt requires printing the numbers involved.\n    print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk was the {academy_award_number}th winner, '{movie_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The film, released in {release_year}, depicts the obelisk at the {obelisk_location}.\")\n    print(f\"Here are the numbers related to the answer:\")\n    print(f\"Year of release: {release_year}\")\n    print(f\"Academy Award session number: {academy_award_number}\")\n\n\nfind_first_movie_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
