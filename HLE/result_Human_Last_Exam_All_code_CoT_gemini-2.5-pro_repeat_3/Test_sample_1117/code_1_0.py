    # Step 1: Define the nature of the reaction.
    # The reaction is an exohedral functionalization, meaning a chemical group (from the disilirane)
    # attaches to the OUTSIDE of the C80 carbon cage. The disilirane cannot enter the fullerene.
    print("Step 1: The reaction is an 'exohedral functionalization'. The disilirane adds to the outside of the C80 cage.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the effect on the fullerene cage.
    # The addition of the external group breaks the high symmetry of the fullerene.
    # It creates a specific, unique axis in the molecule, which we can call a polar axis.
    # The point of addition defines one of the poles.
    print("Step 2: This external addition breaks the fullerene's symmetry and creates a 'polar axis'.")

    # Step 3: Consider the forces acting on the internal cerium atoms.
    # The two cerium atoms inside the cage are positively charged ions. They are influenced by the
    # electrostatic potential of the negatively charged cage.
    print("Step 3: The two internal Ce atoms are positive ions that respond to changes in the cage's electronic structure.")

    # Step 4: Determine the final position of the cerium atoms.
    # The change in the cage's symmetry creates a new electrostatic potential inside. The Ce ions
    # will be strongly directed by this new potential. To find the most stable positions, they
    # align themselves along the new polar axis created by the external group. To minimize their
    # mutual repulsion, they move as far apart as possible along this axis.
    print("Step 4: The Ce atoms align along the new polar axis to reach a stable state, moving to opposite ends.")

    # Conclusion
    final_conclusion = "The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene."
    print("\nConclusion: " + final_conclusion)
