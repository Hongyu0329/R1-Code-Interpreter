    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the fixed point coupling:\n\nTo determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `ϕ^4` theory, we will employ the renormalization group (RG) formalism near four dimensions (`d=4`). The key steps are:\n\n1.  **Define the Beta Function**: We'll start with the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the dimensionless coupling `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. For a single-component scalar field, this is `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²`.\n2.  **Apply the Fixed Point Condition**: A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant, which means the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point**: We will solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` to find the expression for `u*`. This equation has a trivial solution (`u* = 0`) and a non-trivial one, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We are interested in the latter.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to derive and display the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically derives and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables.\n    # u is the dimensionless coupling constant.\n    # epsilon represents the deviation from 4 dimensions, where d = 4 - epsilon.\n    # pi is the mathematical constant.\n    u, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u epsilon pi')\n    u_star_sym = sympy.Symbol('u^*')\n\n    # Step 2: Define the one-loop beta function for the single-component phi^4 theory.\n    # This is a standard result from Quantum Field Theory in the MS scheme.\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi**2)) * u**2\n\n    # Step 3: Solve for the fixed points where beta(u) = 0.\n    fixed_points = sympy.solve(beta_function, u)\n\n    # The solver returns two solutions: the trivial (Gaussian) fixed point u=0\n    # and the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point. We isolate the non-trivial one.\n    u_star_expression = None\n    for fp in fixed_points:\n        if fp != 0:\n            u_star_expression = fp\n            break\n\n    # Step 4: Programmatically construct and print the final equation.\n    # The prompt requires that each number in the final equation be outputted.\n    # We will parse the symbolic expression to build a clear output string.\n    if u_star_expression:\n        # The expression is of the form: (coefficient) * epsilon\n        coefficient, _ = u_star_expression.as_coeff_mul(epsilon)\n        \n        # Get the numerator and denominator of the coefficient\n        numer, denom = coefficient.as_numer_denom()\n        \n        # In the numerator, separate the numerical part from the pi term\n        num_coeff, pi_term = numer.as_coeff_mul()\n        \n        # Get the base and exponent of the pi term (pi^2)\n        pi_base, pi_exponent = pi_term.as_base_exp()\n        \n        print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is:\")\n        # Print the final, formatted equation\n        print(f\"{u_star_sym} = ({int(num_coeff)} * {pi_base}^{int(pi_exponent)} / {int(denom)}) * {epsilon}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine the non-trivial fixed point.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point()\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
