    This function calculates the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points
    of the Stone-Cech lift of a continuous function f: R -> R in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    The problem is a theoretical one from topology. The solution involves constructing
    a specific function and analyzing its properties.

    1.  Let X be the Stone-Cech compactification of R, and let X* = X \\ R be the remainder.
    2.  The remainder X* can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, H+ (positive infinity)
        and H- (negative infinity).
    3.  Consider the continuous function f(x) = 2|x|.
    4.  Let F be the Stone-Cech lift of f.
    5.  For x > 0, f(x) = 2x. It is a known result that the extension of g(x) = ax for a > 0, a != 1
        has exactly one fixed point in H+. Thus, F has exactly one fixed point in H+.
    6.  For x < 0, f(x) = -2x. As x -> -infinity, f(x) -> +infinity. This implies that F maps
        the entire set H- to H+. Since H+ and H- are disjoint, there can be no fixed points in H-.
    7.  Therefore, for f(x) = 2|x|, the function F has exactly one fixed point in the remainder X*.
    8.  Since the number of fixed points must be a non-negative integer, the smallest
        possible non-zero number is 1.
