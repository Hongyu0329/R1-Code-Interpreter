    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # G acting quasiprimitively on the face set F implies its socle N acts transitively on F.
    # The faces of D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # Transitivity means there is only one orbit, so D_N has one face. Thus, it's unicellular.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group.
    # The classification theorem for automorphism groups of regular maps that are smooth coverings
    # of their quotient by the socle states that the possible types are HA, TW, and AS.

    # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    # The constraint l > 5 is given for a specific family of AS type groups, not TW type.
    # Counterexamples for TW type with l <= 5 exist (e.g., based on A_5 wr Z_2).
