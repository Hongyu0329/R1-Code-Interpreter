# The user's program is incorrect. This is an optimal replacement.
# My plan is to:
# 1. Define the input angle and distance.
# 2. Use the `math` library to accurately convert the angle to radians and calculate the tangent.
# 3. Calculate the final height.
# 4. Use the `sys.getsizeof()` function to calculate the total memory used by all variables.
# 5. Print the final equation with the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.

# Inputs
angle_deg = 40
distance_m = 100

# Step 1: Convert angle to radians
angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)

# Step 2: Calculate tangent
tan_value = math.tan(angle_rad)

# Step 3: Calculate height
height_m = distance_m * tan_value

# For the final answer, round the height to the nearest integer
o_height_rounded = int(round(height_m))

# Calculate the memory used for all the variables created for this task.
z_memory_bytes = (sys.getsizeof(angle_deg) +
                  sys.getsizeof(distance_m) +
                  sys.getsizeof(angle_rad) +
                  sys.getsizeof(tan_value) +
                  sys.getsizeof(height_m) +
                  sys.getsizeof(o_height_rounded))

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
# The equation is: rounded_height = distance * tan(angle_in_degrees)
print(f"{o_height_rounded} = {distance_m} * tan({angle_deg})")

# The final answer format is N[o:z]
# o = 84 (the rounded height)
# z = 156 (the total bytes for the variables on a typical 64-bit system)
# The final answer is therefore N[84:156]
