# Based on the mathematical derivation, the original expression simplifies
# significantly. The expression to evaluate is:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# Our derivation shows that ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# Substituting this into the expression simplifies it to:
# 1 + 10^15
#
# The following code will display the final equation and its result.

# The numbers in the final simplified equation
first_number = 1
second_number = 10**15

# The final result of the calculation
result = first_number + second_number

# As requested, here is the final equation with each number printed.
print(f"{first_number} + {second_number} = {result}")
