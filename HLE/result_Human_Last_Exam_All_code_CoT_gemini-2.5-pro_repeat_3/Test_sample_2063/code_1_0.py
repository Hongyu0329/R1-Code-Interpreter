    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n approaches infinity.

    The problem states that for a DNA sequence of length n with 8 bases,
    a quantum polymerase collapses if for any base 'x' (from 0 to 7),
    the count of that base, c_x, satisfies c_x mod 8 = x.

    The probability of success, P(n), is the probability that this condition
    is NOT met for ANY of the 8 bases.

    As n -> infinity, the probability that c_x mod 8 = k for any specific k
    approaches 1/8 for each base x.
    Therefore, the probability that c_x mod 8 != x is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

    Since there are 8 bases and their counts become asymptotically independent
    in terms of their values modulo 8, the total probability of success is
    the product of the individual probabilities for each base.

    Limiting Probability = (7/8) * (7/8) * ... (8 times) = (7/8)^8.
