    Solves the letter-number pattern puzzle.

    The solution is based on three decoded hints:
    1.  The letters are a sequence of 10 letters in alphabetical order.
    2.  The common "shape" property is that none of the letters have a horizontal axis of symmetry.
    3.  The number for each letter is the digital root of its alphabetical position (A=1, Z=26).
