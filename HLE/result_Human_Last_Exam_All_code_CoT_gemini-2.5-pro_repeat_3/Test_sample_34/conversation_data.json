    "To determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, we need to consult a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) opening range for a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The position is the Button (BTN), which is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range. The game is 100BB deep and rake-free, which further encourages playing more hands, as there's no house cut diminishing the pot.\n2.  **Consult GTO Ranges:** GTO pre-flop charts for this scenario show a very wide opening range from the button, often including 45-50% of all possible hands. This is because the positional advantage allows a player to realize equity more effectively post-flop.\n3.  **Evaluate Suited Jacks:** Suited hands, like suited Jacks, have excellent playability due to their ability to make strong flushes and straights. Because of this, a standard BTN opening range includes all suited Jacks, from JTs down to J2s.\n4.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** The \"worst\" hand in a category that is still considered a standard, profitable open is the one with the lowest equity and playability. Among suited Jacks, the strength is determined by the kicker. J2s has the lowest kicker, offering the weakest top-pair possibilities and the least connectivity for straights compared to other suited Jacks.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, while J2s is still a profitable open-raise from the button in this format, it is the weakest, or \"worst,\" among all the suited Jacks that you should be opening.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on GTO principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In a 100BB rake-free game, the button's opening range is very wide.\n    # Standard GTO charts recommend opening all suited Jacks from this position.\n    # The list of suited Jacks, from strongest to weakest:\n    suited_jacks_to_open = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest rank/equity that is\n    # still considered a profitable open. In this list, that is J2s.\n    worst_hand = suited_jacks_to_open[-1]\n\n    print(f\"The worst suited Jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
