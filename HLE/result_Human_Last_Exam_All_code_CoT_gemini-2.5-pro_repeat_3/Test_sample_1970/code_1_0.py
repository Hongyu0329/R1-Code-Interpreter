The question asks about the existence of a function `f` that colors pairs of ordinals from `kappa++` with `kappa` colors, in such a way that every subset `x` of order type `kappa+ + kappa` uses all `kappa` colors.

The answer is that such a function can never exist. This is a theorem of ZFC and holds for any infinite cardinal `kappa`, irrespective of the existence of a Kurepa tree. Here's a sketch of the proof:

The core idea is to show that the opposite is true: for ANY function `f: [kappa++]^2 -> kappa`, there EXISTS a set `x` of order type `kappa+ + kappa` that is very simple in its coloring, using far fewer than `kappa` colors.

The argument proceeds in steps:

1.  A fundamental result in infinitary combinatorics (a consequence of the Erd?s-Rado theorem) is the relation `kappa++ -> (kappa+)^2_kappa`. This means for any coloring of pairs of elements from `kappa++` with `kappa` colors, there must exist a homogeneous subset of size `kappa+` (a set where all pairs have the same color).

2.  Let `f` be any function from `[kappa++]^2` to `kappa`. We can construct a special set `x` of order type `kappa+ + kappa` as follows:
    a. Find a homogeneous set `Y` of size `kappa+`. Let its color be `c_Y`.
    b. By a pigeonhole argument on the colors between `Y` and the ordinals larger than it, we can refine `Y` and find a large set `S` of ordinals above `Y` such that the color for any pair `{y, s}` (with `y` in the refined `Y` and `s` in `S`) is a constant, `c_cross`.
    c. Apply the partition relation from step 1 to the large set `S`. This gives us a homogeneous set `Z_large` within `S`. Let its color be `c_Z`. We can take a subset `Z` of `Z_large` of size `kappa`.
    d. Now, form the set `x = Y U Z`. Since `Y` and `Z` are constructed so that every element of `Y` is less than every element of `Z`, `x` has order type `kappa+ + kappa`.

3.  Consider the colors used on pairs from this set `x`:
    - Any pair from `Y` has color `c_Y`.
    - Any pair from `Z` has color `c_Z`.
    - Any pair with one element in `Y` and one in `Z` has color `c_cross`.

4.  This means that the set of colors `f''[x]^2` is a subset of `{c_Y, c_Z, c_cross}`. Therefore, the number of colors used is at most 3. The resulting inequality is:
    |f''[x]^2| <= 3

Since `kappa` is an infinite cardinal, `3 < kappa`. This contradicts the requirement that `|f''[x]^2| = kappa`. Because we have shown that for any `f`, there is a counterexample `x`, no function `f` with the desired property can exist. The Kurepa tree hypothesis is irrelevant.

The numbers in the final equation |f''[x]^2| <= 3 are:
