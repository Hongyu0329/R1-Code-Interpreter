    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** I will first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is a necessary condition for the standard analysis of the Galois group. I'll use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** For a quartic polynomial, the resolvent cubic is a related third-degree polynomial. Whether this cubic is reducible or irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information to narrow down the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Synthesize Results and Determine the Group:** Based on the irreducibility of the polynomial, the nature of its discriminant, and the reducibility of its resolvent cubic, I will identify the specific Galois group from the possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$.\n5.  **State the Order:** Once the Galois group is identified, its order is known from group theory.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the necessary calculations and print out the reasoning for each step to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef find_integer_roots(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds integer roots of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.\n    By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of a monic polynomial with\n    integer coefficients must be an integer and a divisor of the constant term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a monic polynomial: [1, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1, a_0]\n    constant_term = int(coeffs[-1])\n    if constant_term == 0:\n        # If the constant term is 0, then 0 is a root.\n        # This simple check is sufficient for our purpose.\n        # A more robust version would factor out powers of the variable.\n        return [0]\n\n    roots = []\n    # Test all integer divisors of the constant term.\n    for i in range(1, int(abs(constant_term)) + 1):\n        if constant_term % i == 0:\n            # Test positive and negative divisors\n            for d in [i, -i]:\n                # Evaluate polynomial P(d) using Horner's method\n                val = 0\n                for coeff in coeffs:\n                    val = val * d + coeff\n                \n                # If P(d) is 0, d is a root.\n                if val == 0:\n                    # Add to list of roots if not already found\n                    if d not in roots:\n                      roots.append(d)\n    return roots\n\ndef solve_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Polynomial f(x) = x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    # Step 1: Check Irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers.\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"- The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 2.\")\n    print(\"- The other coefficients (0, 8, 14) are all divisible by 2.\")\n    print(\"- The constant term 14 is divisible by 2, but not by 2^2=4.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S_4.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.\")\n    print(\"For a depressed quartic x^4 + px + q, the discriminant is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"Delta = -27 * p^4 + 256 * q^3\")\n    discriminant = -27 * (p**4) + 256 * (q**3)\n    p_4 = p**4\n    q_3 = q**3\n    term1 = -27 * p_4\n    term2 = 256 * q_3\n    print(f\"Substituting p={p} and q={q}:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * ({p})^4 + 256 * ({q})^3\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {p_4} + 256 * {q_3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {term1} + {term2}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {discriminant}\")\n\n    if not is_perfect_square(discriminant):\n        print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is not a perfect square in Q.\")\n        print(\"This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are S_4 (order 24) or D_4 (order 8).\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is a perfect square in Q.\")\n        print(\"This means the Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are A_4 (order 12) or V_4 (order 4).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic.\")\n    print(\"The resolvent cubic for x^4 + px + q is g(y) = y^3 -
