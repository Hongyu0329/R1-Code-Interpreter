    "To find the small molecules that interact with the target identified by ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817` (which is the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase), I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Connect to the ChEMBL Database:** I will use the official `chembl_webresource_client` library in Python to programmatically access the ChEMBL database.\n2.  **Query for Bioactivities:** I will search for all recorded bioactivity data associated with the target `CHEMBL4803817`. To ensure the data represents meaningful interactions, I will filter for activities that have a reported `pChEMBL` value (a standardized measure of potency like -log(IC50)).\n3.  **Extract Molecule IDs:** From the query results, I will extract the unique ChEMBL IDs of the small molecules (`molecule_chembl_id`) involved in these interactions.\n4.  **Display Results:** I will print the list of all unique molecule ChEMBL IDs found. Finally, I will output the total count of these unique molecules as the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.\n# If not, you can install them by running:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client pandas\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Querying ChEMBL for target: {target_id}\")\n\n    try:\n        # 1. Initialize the ChEMBL activity client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # 2. Query for activities with a pChEMBL value for the specified target\n        res = activity.filter(\n            target_chembl_id=target_id,\n            pchembl_value__isnull=False  # Ensures we get activities with a potency value\n        )\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No activities with pChEMBL values found for target {target_id}.\")\n            return 0\n\n        # 3. Convert the results to a pandas DataFrame for easier processing\n        df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(res)\n\n        # 4. Extract the unique molecule ChEMBL IDs\n        unique_molecules = df['molecule_chembl_id'].unique()\n        count = len(unique_molecules)\n\n        if count > 0:\n            print(f\"\\nFound {count} unique small molecules interacting with {target_id}:\")\n            # 5. Print each unique molecule ID\n            for molecule_id in unique_molecules:\n                print(molecule_id)\n        else:\n            print(\"No unique interacting molecules found.\")\n\n        return count\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return 0\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    target_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL4803817'\n    total_count = find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id)\n\n    # Final answer format\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of unique interacting molecules: {total_count}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{total_count}>>>\")\n\n```"
