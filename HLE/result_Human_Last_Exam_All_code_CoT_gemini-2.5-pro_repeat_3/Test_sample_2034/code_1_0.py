# Redirect stdout to the string buffer

# Step 1: Define the relationship between c1 and c2
# Based on the analysis, the relationship is c1 = c2 + 1.
# This comes from matching coefficients of the hypothesized form of the bound
# (alpha_i - 1)(1 + k*beta) with the general form derived from the problem statement.
# c1 - 1 = k
# c2 = k
# So, c1 - 1 = c2.

# Step 2: Use physical intuition to determine k.
# The term `beta * alpha_i` in the loss function acts as a regularizer on alpha_i.
# Regularization should tighten the generalization bound.
# The bound is on the leave-one-out error, represented by the LHS.
# The RHS is the bound itself. A tighter bound means a smaller RHS.
# The relevant term is (alpha_i - 1)(1 + k*beta).
# For a support vector with margin error, alpha_i > 1, so (alpha_i - 1) > 0.
# To make the RHS smaller for beta > 0, we need (1 + k*beta) < 1, which means k < 0.
# The simplest non-trivial integer choice for k is -1.

k = -1

# Step 3: Calculate c1 and c2 from k.
c2 = k
c1 = c2 + 1

# Step 4: The final equation for the bound.
# The problem asks for the final equation with the determined coefficients.
# The bound is:
# -(K * alpha_D_minus_i)_i <= (1 + c1*beta)*alpha_D_i - (1 + c2*beta)*(K * alpha_D)_i + o(beta)
# Substituting c1=0 and c2=-1:
# -(K * alpha_D_minus_i)_i <= (1 + 0*beta)*alpha_D_i - (1 + (-1)*beta)*(K * alpha_D)_i + o(beta)
# -(K * alpha_D_minus_i)_i <= alpha_D_i - (1 - beta)*(K * alpha_D)_i + o(beta)

# Print the values of c1 and c2 as requested by the thinking process.
# The final code should output each number in the final equation.
# Here, the numbers are c1 and c2.
print(f"c1 = {c1}")
print(f"c2 = {c2}")

# Restore the original stdout
sys.stdout = original_stdout
# Get the content of the buffer
output = captured_output.getvalue()

# The final response should only contain the code block.
# The thinking process leads to c1=0 and c2=-1.
# I will structure the final python code to print these values.
final_code = f"""
# Based on theoretical analysis, we determine the coefficients c1 and c2.
# The detailed derivation is as follows:
# 1. The bound is of the form:
#    -(K * alpha')_i <= (1 + c1*beta)*alpha_i - (1 + c2*beta)*(K*alpha)_i + o(beta)
# 2. For a margin support vector, (K*alpha)_i = 1 + beta*alpha_i.
# 3. Substituting this into the bound's RHS gives:
#    RHS = (alpha_i - 1) + beta*((c1 - 1)*alpha_i - c2) + o(beta)
# 4. We hypothesize the bound takes the form (alpha_i - 1)*(1 + k*beta) for some constant k.
#    (alpha_i - 1)*(1 + k*beta) = (alpha_i - 1) + beta*(k*alpha_i - k)
# 5. Matching terms proportional to beta gives c1 - 1 = k and c2 = k.
#    This implies c1 = c2 + 1.
# 6. The term `beta*alpha_i` in the loss is a regularizer, which should tighten the bound.
#    For alpha_i > 1, this means k must be negative. The simplest choice is k = -1.
# 7. With k = -1, we find c2 = -1 and c1 = 0.
