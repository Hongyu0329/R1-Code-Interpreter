    "This problem requires us to find an inequality that relates the Minkowski bound on the norm of an ideal, which we'll interpret as $k_{k,\\infty}$, to the covolume $V$ of the lattice of integers in a number field. The mention of \"squarefree natural numbers (N)\" points us toward quadratic number fields, specifically imaginary quadratic fields of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$, as this case yields the more significant and commonly cited result involving $\\pi$.\n\nHere is the plan to derive the relationship:\n1.  **Identify the field type:** We will focus on imaginary quadratic fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$, where $N$ is a positive squarefree integer. For these fields, the degree is $n=2$, and there is one pair of complex embeddings, so $r_2=1$.\n2.  **State the Minkowski Bound:** The Minkowski bound, $B_K$, guarantees that every ideal class contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ satisfying:\n    $N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le B_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n    For our case ($n=2, r_2=1$), this simplifies to $B_K = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n3.  **State the Covolume:** The covolume $V$ of the lattice of integers is given by the formula:\n    $V = 2^{-r_2} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n    For our case ($r_2=1$), this is $V = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n4.  **Relate the two:** We can express $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$ in terms of $V$ from the covolume formula: $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|} = 2V$.\n5.  **Substitute and Finalize:** Substitute this expression back into the Minkowski bound formula:\n    $B_K \\le \\frac{2}{\\pi} (2V) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}V$.\n    We interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as this upper bound $B_K$, so the final relationship is $k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\frac{4}{\\pi}V$.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the constant $\\frac{4}{\\pi}$ and print the final inequality, showing the numbers involved as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the relationship between the upper bound for the\n# norm (k_k,inf) and the covolume (V) for number fields related to\n# squarefree integers. We derive this for imaginary quadratic fields.\n# The relationship is k_k,inf <= (4/pi) * V.\n\n# Define the numbers in the equation's constant.\nnumerator = 4\ndenominator_symbol = \"pi\"\ndenominator_value = math.pi\n\n# Calculate the value of the constant.\nconstant_value = numerator / denominator_value\n\nprint(\"The relationship is of the form: k_k,inf <= C * V\")\nprint(\"The constant C is derived from the following numbers:\")\nprint(f\"Numerator: {numerator}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator: {denominator_symbol} (value ≈ {denominator_value})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe resulting constant C is {numerator}/{denominator_symbol} ≈ {constant_value}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation showing each number is:\")\n# The f-string below prints the full equation with its components.\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= ({numerator} / {denominator_value}) * V\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich simplifies to:\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= {constant_value} * V\")\n```\n<<<k_k,inf <= (4/pi) * V>>>"
