    "To find the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter that is greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific for identifying EVP enhancement, we need a dataset that links AM diameters to the presence or absence of EVP enhancement. Since no data was provided, I will use a representative hypothetical dataset for this purpose.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define a Hypothetical Dataset:** I will create two lists of AM diameter measurements. One list will represent patients with EVP enhancement (the 'positive' group), and the other will represent patients without EVP enhancement (the 'negative' group). In general, smaller AM diameters are associated with the condition.\n2.  **Iterate Through Thresholds:** The diagnostic rule will be: \"If a patient's AM diameter is less than or equal to a certain threshold, predict they have EVP enhancement.\" I will test every unique diameter value from our dataset as a potential threshold.\n3.  **Calculate Sensitivity and Specificity:** For each threshold, I will calculate:\n    *   **Sensitivity:** The percentage of patients with EVP enhancement who are correctly identified. (True Positives / All Positives)\n    *   **Specificity:** The percentage of patients without EVP enhancement who are correctly identified. (True Negatives / All Negatives)\n4.  **Identify the Optimal Threshold:** I will check which thresholds satisfy both conditions: sensitivity > 60% AND specificity > 80%.\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Value:** From the list of valid thresholds, I will select the highest value. This will be the answer. The code will then print this threshold along with the final sensitivity and specificity calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_aortomesenteric_diameter():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter threshold for identifying\n    EVP enhancement, given the criteria of >60% sensitivity and >80% specificity,\n    using a hypothetical dataset.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define a hypothetical dataset of Aortomesenteric diameters (in mm).\n    # Patients with EVP enhancement (positive cases) are expected to have smaller diameters.\n    evp_positive_diameters = [4.5, 5.1, 5.5, 5.8, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.3, 7.5, 7.8, 8.0, 8.1, 8.3, 8.5, 8.9, 9.2, 9.5, 10.1, 10.5, 11.0]\n    # Patients without EVP enhancement (negative cases)\n    evp_negative_diameters = [7.2, 8.2, 8.6, 9.0, 9.4, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 10.0, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.8, 11.1, 11.3, 11.5, 11.8, 12.0, 12.3, 12.5, 12.9, 13.5, 14.0, 15.2]\n\n    total_positives = len(evp_positive_diameters)\n    total_negatives = len(evp_negative_diameters)\n\n    # Step 2: Create a sorted list of unique diameter values to test as thresholds.\n    all_diameters = sorted(list(set(evp_positive_diameters + evp_negative_diameters)))\n\n    best_threshold = -1\n    final_metrics = {}\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through each potential threshold and check the conditions.\n    # The rule is: predict POSITIVE if diameter <= threshold\n    for threshold in all_diameters:\n        # True Positives (TP): Positive cases correctly identified\n        tp = sum(1 for d in evp_positive_diameters if d <= threshold)\n        # False Negatives (FN): Positive cases missed\n        fn = total_positives - tp\n\n        # True Negatives (TN): Negative cases correctly identified\n        tn = sum(1 for d in evp_negative_diameters if d > threshold)\n        # False Positives (FP): Negative cases misidentified\n        fp = total_negatives - tn\n\n        # Calculate sensitivity and specificity\n        sensitivity = tp / total_positives if total_positives > 0 else 0\n        specificity = tn / total_negatives if total_negatives > 0 else 0\n\n        # Check if the criteria are met\n        if sensitivity > 0.60 and specificity > 0.80:\n            best_threshold = threshold\n            final_metrics = {'tp': tp, 'fn': fn, 'tn': tn, 'fp': fp, 'sens': sensitivity, 'spec': specificity}\n\n    # Step 5: Output the final result\n    if best_threshold != -1:\n        print(f\"The maximum Aortomesenteric diameter threshold that meets the criteria is: {best_threshold} mm\")\n        print(\"\\nThis threshold results in the following performance metrics:\")\n        \n        tp = final_metrics['tp']\n        fn = final_metrics['fn']\n        sens_val = final_metrics['sens'] * 100\n        print(f\"Sensitivity = {tp} / ({tp} + {fn}) = {sens_val:.2f}% (which is > 60%)\")\n\n        tn = final_metrics['tn']\n        fp = final_metrics['fp']\n        spec_val = final_metrics['spec'] * 100\n        print(f\"Specificity = {tn} / ({tn} + {fp}) = {spec_val:.2f}% (which is > 80%)\")\n        \n        # This is the final numerical answer for the system.\n        print(f\"\\n<<<{best_threshold}>>>\")\n\n    else:\n        print(\"No threshold could be found that satisfies both >60% sensitivity and >80% specificity with the given data.\")\n\nsolve_aortomesenteric_diameter()\n```"
