# Step 1: Define the final simplified expression
# After solving the ODE and substituting t = ln(10**5), the expression simplifies to:
# (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4
# We will now calculate this value.

# Define the components of the final equation
coefficient1 = 3/2
base = 10
exponent = 10/3
term2 = 37/4

# Calculate the first term
term1 = coefficient1 * (base ** exponent)

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 + term2

# Print the breakdown of the final equation as requested
