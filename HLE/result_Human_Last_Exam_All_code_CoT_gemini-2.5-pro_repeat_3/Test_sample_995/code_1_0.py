    # Step 1: Analyze A's winning probability for a given F and a chosen D.
    # Agent A wins if |D - r| < |F - r|, where r is uniformly distributed in [0, 1].
    # This inequality leads to two scenarios for A's choice of D:
    # - If D < F, A wins if r < (D + F) / 2. Probability P = (D + F) / 2.
    # - If D > F, A wins if r > (D + F) / 2. Probability P = 1 - (D + F) / 2.

    # Step 2: Determine A's optimal strategy.
    # For a fixed F, A chooses D to maximize the winning probability.
    # - To maximize P = (D + F) / 2 (for D < F), A chooses D infinitesimally smaller than F. The probability approaches F.
    # - To maximize P = 1 - (D + F) / 2 (for D > F), A chooses D infinitesimally larger than F. The probability approaches 1 - F.
    # So, A's best possible winning probability for a given F is max(F, 1 - F).

    # Step 3: Find the optimal F that minimizes A's winning probability.
    # We need to find the F in [0, 1] that minimizes max(F, 1 - F).
    # This minimum occurs when F = 1 - F, which gives F = 0.5.
    F_opt = 0.5

    # Step 4: Calculate the minimized probability of A winning.
    # This is the value of max(F, 1 - F) at F = 0.5.
    p_a_wins = max(F_opt, 1 - F_opt)

    # Step 5: Calculate the final required value.
    # The problem asks for floor(1 / P(A wins)).
    final_result = math.floor(1 / p_a_wins)
    
    # Print the final equation and its components as requested.
