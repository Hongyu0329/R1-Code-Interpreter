    This function provides the name of the starting material, Compound A, based on the reaction scheme and NMR data analysis.
    
    The analysis indicates the final product has a 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine core.
    The two-step nucleophilic substitution implies the starting material is a dichloro-derivative of this core.
    
    The structure of Compound A is therefore determined to be 4,6-dichloro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.
