    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the required symmetric key length for security against quantum computers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary threat from quantum computers against symmetric key cryptography is Grover's algorithm. Unlike Shor's algorithm, which targets asymmetric cryptography (like RSA), Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a symmetric key.\n\n2.  **Quantify the Threat:** A classical computer needs, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to brute-force an n-bit key. The security level is considered 'n' bits. Grover's algorithm reduces the number of operations required to approximately the square root of the total possibilities, meaning it can find an n-bit key in roughly sqrt(2^n) or 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the bit-strength of the key.\n\n3.  **Establish the Security Requirement:** The current industry standard for strong cryptographic security is 128 bits. This means a successful attack would require about 2^128 operations, which is considered computationally infeasible for any conceivable classical computer. To be \"quantum-resistant,\" a system should maintain this 128-bit security level even when faced with a quantum adversary.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Key Length:** We need to find a key length, let's call it `k`, such that when its strength is halved by Grover's algorithm, it still provides at least 128 bits of security.\n    *   Quantum Security Level = `k` / 2\n    *   We need: `k` / 2 ≥ 128\n    *   Solving for `k`: `k` ≥ 256\n\nTherefore, to achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against\n    a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The industry standard for strong security is 128 bits.\n    # This is our target security level.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the\n    # bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n    # Required Key Length (k) / 2 = Target Security Level\n    grover_speedup_factor = 2\n\n    # Calculate the required key length 'k'.\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_speedup_factor\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the target security level for modern cryptography.\")\n    print(f\"Target Security Level = {target_security_level} bits\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Account for the speedup from a quantum attack (Grover's algorithm).\")\n    print(\"Grover's algorithm effectively halves the key's security strength (divides by 2).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the required key length to maintain the target security level.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is: Required Key Length = Target Security Level * Grover's Speedup Factor\")\n    print(f\"So, the required key length is: {required_key_length} = {target_security_level} * {grover_speedup_factor}\")\n\ncalculate_post_quantum_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
