    # The problem asks for ||x(1)||^2_l2.
    # The parameters alpha and f(t) are non-zero only for the index k = 2^2024.
    # For any other index j, alpha_j = 0 and f_j(t) = 0, which leads to x_j(t) = 0.
    # Therefore, ||x(1)||^2_l2 = |x_k(1)|^2 for k = 2^2024.

    # We find x_k(1) from the boundary conditions:
    # (1) m_k * x_k(0) - n_k * x_k(1) = alpha_k
    # (2) x_k(0) = 0.5 * alpha_k
    # Substituting (2) into (1): m_k * (0.5 * alpha_k) - n_k * x_k(1) = alpha_k
    # Solving for x_k(1): x_k(1) = ((m_k / 2) - 1) * alpha_k / n_k

    # Let's define the parameters for k = 2^2024.
    
    # alpha_k is given as 1.
    alpha_k = 1
    
    # For M = diag(3, 1, 3, 1, ...), m_k depends on whether k is odd or even.
    # k = 2^2024 is an even number, so m_k is the second element in the pattern.
    m_k = 1
    
    # For N = diag(e^-2, e^-4, ..., e^(-2^n), ...), n_k = e^(-2^k).
    # Since k = 2^2024, n_k = e^(-2^(2^2024)). We will work with this symbolically.

    # Now, we calculate the coefficient part of x_k(1):
    # coeff = ((m_k / 2) - 1) * alpha_k
    coeff = ((m_k / 2) - 1) * alpha_k
    
    # So, x_k(1) = coeff / n_k = -0.5 / e^(-2^k) = -0.5 * e^(2^k)
    
    # The squared norm is |x_k(1)|^2
    # ||x(1)||^2 = (-0.5 * e^(2^k))^2 = (-0.5)^2 * (e^(2^k))^2
    #            = 0.25 * e^(2 * 2^k)
