def solve_chromatic_roots_quiz():
    """
    Analyzes statements about chromatic and orbital chromatic roots and prints the correct answer.

    - Statement A: True. The largest real orbital chromatic root is bounded by the largest real chromatic root of the base graph.
    - Statement B: True. Chromatic polynomials can have complex (non-real) roots.
    - Statement C: False. Real chromatic roots are always non-negative.
    - Statement D: True. Non-integer real chromatic roots exist (e.g., for the Petersen graph).
    - Statement E: False. Chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).

    The correct options are A, B, and D.
    Sorted and concatenated, the answer is "ABD".
