    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nThe relationship is an inverse function. Specifically, the Green's function $G_0$ for a particle with momentum $k$ and energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ at a frequency $\\omega$ is given by a pole structure, where the pole is located at the particle's energy.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Concept:** I will first explain the physical meaning of the bare Green's function and its relationship to particle energy.\n2.  **State the Formula:** I will present the standard mathematical formula for $G_0(k, \\omega)$ that shows its dependence on $\\epsilon_k$.\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script to construct and print this formula. The script will first define the different components of the equation (the Green's function symbol, the numerator, and the terms in the denominator) and then combine them to display the final functional form. This fulfills the requirement of using code to present the solution and showing each part of the final equation.\n\nThe formula is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the bare Green's function.\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n*   $i\\delta$ is a crucial infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. The sign of $\\delta$ depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is above (particle) or below (hole) the Fermi level.\n\nThe following Python code will print this functional relationship.\n\n```python\ndef display_green_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0\n    on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k by printing its formula.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols used in the equation as strings\n    g0_symbol = \"G_0(k, ω)\"\n    equals = \"=\"\n    numerator = \"1\"\n    omega = \"ω\"\n    epsilon_k = \"ϵ_k\"\n    infinitesimal = \"iδ\"\n\n    # Explain the components of the equation\n    print(\"The bare Green's function, G_0, has an inverse dependence on the single-particle energy, ϵ_k.\")\n    print(\"The formula is constructed from the following parts:\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
