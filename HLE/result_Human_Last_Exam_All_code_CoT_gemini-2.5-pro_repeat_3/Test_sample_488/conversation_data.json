    "My plan is to analyze the provided phrase, \"my love for humanity,\" based on the foundational theories of conceptual metaphors as described in cognitive linguistics, particularly by Lakoff and Johnson.\n\n1.  **Define the key types of metaphors** from the answer choices, specifically orientational and structural metaphors, which are the most relevant formal types listed.\n2.  **Examine the phrase** \"my love for humanity.\" I will break down how the concept of \"love\" is being framed. It's presented as a possession (\"my love\") and as a directed entity (\"for humanity\").\n3.  **Compare the phrase against the definitions.** I will determine if the metaphor relies on spatial orientation (like up/down) or if it imposes the structure of a more concrete concept (like a possession or a force) onto the abstract concept of love.\n4.  **Conclude the correct type.** Based on the analysis, I will identify the best fit among the given choices.\n5.  **Generate Python code.** The code will print this step-by-step reasoning for clarity and then state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_metaphor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the analysis of the conceptual metaphor in \"my love for humanity\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the types of conceptual metaphors\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------\")\n    orientational_desc = \"Organizes concepts using spatial orientation, such as up-down, in-out, or front-back.
