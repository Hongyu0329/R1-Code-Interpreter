    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve. Lissajous curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x = A*sin(at + Î´)` and `y = B*sin(bt)`. In this case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the Self-Intersection Formula:** For a Lissajous curve where `a` and `b` are integers, there is a standard formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points, provided that `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\n3.  **The Formula:** The number of self-intersection points `N` is given by:\n    `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Verify Coprimality:** We need to check if `a = 9` and `b = 5` are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1. Since they are coprime, the formula can be applied.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the step-by-step result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the Lissajous curve\n    defined by x = cos(a*t) and y = sin(b*t).\n    \"\"\"\n    # For the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)), the parameters are a=9 and b=5.\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(f\"The parametric curve is (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)), which is a Lissajous curve.\")\n    print(f\"The parameters are a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections of a Lissajous curve is (a-1)(b-1)/2,\n    # provided that a and b are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\n    # First, we check if a and b are coprime.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if common_divisor == 1:\n        print(f\"The greatest common divisor of {a} and {b} is {common_divisor}, so they are coprime.\")\n        \n        # Calculate the components of the formula.\n        term1 = a - 1\n        term2 = b - 1\n        numerator = term1 * term2\n        num_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n        # Print the final calculation step-by-step.\n        print(\"\\nApplying the formula for the number of self-intersections: (a-1)*(b-1)/2\")\n        print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {term1} * {term2} / 2 = {numerator} / 2 = {num_intersections}\")\n\n        print(f\"\\nTherefore, the number of self-intersection points is {num_intersections}.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The parameters a={a} and b={b} are not coprime (GCD={common_divisor}), so the standard formula does not apply.\")\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
