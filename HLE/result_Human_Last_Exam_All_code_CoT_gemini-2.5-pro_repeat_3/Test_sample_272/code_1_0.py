def solve_group_theory_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the nine group theory questions.

    The answers are derived from the following analysis:
    H = C_2 * C_2 (infinite dihedral group)
    G = H * H = C_2 * C_2 * C_2 * C_2
    P = pro-p completion of G for an odd prime p, which is the trivial group.

    Answers:
    1. cd(H): ∞ (H has torsion)
    2. cd(G): ∞ (G has torsion)
    3. vcd(H): 1 (H is virtually Z)
    4. vcd(G): 1 (G is virtually free)
    5. ends(H): 2 (H is virtually Z)
    6. ends(G): ∞ (G is a free product of infinite groups)
    7. cd_p(P): 0 (P is the trivial group)
    8. vcd_p(P): 0 (P is the trivial group)
    9. dim H^1(G, F_p): 0 (Hom(G_ab, F_p) is trivial)
