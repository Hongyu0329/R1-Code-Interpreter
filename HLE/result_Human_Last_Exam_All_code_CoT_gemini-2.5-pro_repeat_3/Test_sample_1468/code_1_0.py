    # The problem asks for the lower bound of m asymptotically.
    # m is the width of the hidden layer of a fully connected network f(x) = g(Wx).
    # d' is the problem dimension, q is the sparsity, N is the number of data points.
    # d = d' + q + 1 is the input dimension for each data point.
    # The network must epsilon-approximate the qSA function, with epsilon = 1/(2q).

    # Plan:
    # 1. We fix the `y_i` part of the input to a "hard" configuration. The network must
    #    work for all `z_j` vectors with this fixed `Y`.
    # 2. Let h = Wx be the hidden layer activation. For a fixed Y, h is an affine
    #    function of Z = (z_1, ..., z_N), i.e., h = L(Z) + C. L is a linear map
    #    from R^(Nd') to R^m.
    # 3. The target qSA_i is a linear function of Z, A_i(Z).
    # 4. Assume m < Nd'. The kernel of L, ker(L), is non-trivial.
    # 5. For any V in ker(L), h(tV) is constant, so the network output g(h) is constant.
    # 6. The target A(tV) = tA(V) is not constant. This leads to a contradiction
    #    unless the operator norm of A is small.
    # 7. The condition is ||A||_op <= 1/q.
    # 8. We construct a hard Y configuration that makes ||A||_op = 1.
    # 9. This gives 1 <= 1/q, a contradiction for q > 1.
    # 10. Thus, the assumption m < Nd' must be false. So m >= Nd'.

    # Step 1-3: Formalize L and A
    # Let y_i = s_i for i=1..N.
    # h = Wx = W_z Z + W_y Y_fixed + C_const = L(Z) + C
    # qSA(X)_i = A_i(Z) = (1/q) * sum_{j in s_i} z_j
    # A is a linear operator R^(Nd') -> R^(Nd').

    # Step 4-6: Use the kernel argument
    # If m < Nd', dim(ker(L)) >= Nd' - m > 0.
    # Let V be in ker(L), V != 0.
    # Let Z(t) = tV. h(Z(t)) = L(tV) + C = C.
    # So f(X(tV))_i is a constant vector C'_i.
    # The target is A(tV)_i = tA(V)_i.
    # The approximation is || C'_i - tA(V)_i || <= 1/(2q).
    # For t=0, ||C'_i|| <= 1/(2q).
    # By triangle inequality, |t|*||A(V)_i|| - ||C'_i|| <= ||C'_i - tA(V)_i|| <= 1/(2q).
    # This implies |t|*||A(V)_i|| <= 2 * 1/(2q) = 1/q.
    # This must hold for any t such that tV is a valid input.
    # We can choose t such that max_j ||t*v_j||_2 = 1, i.e. |t|=1/max_j||v_j||_2.
    # So, max_i ||A(V)_i||_2 <= (1/q) * max_j ||v_j||_2.
    # Let ||V||_inf,2 = max_j ||v_j||_2. The condition is ||A(V)||_inf,2 <= (1/q) * ||V||_inf,2.
    # This must hold for any V in ker(L).

    # Step 7-9: Operator norm constraint and contradiction
    # This implies that the operator norm of A restricted to the subspace ker(L) is at most 1/q.
    # Since this must hold for any network with m < Nd', it must hold for any such kernel.
    # This implies ||A||_op <= 1/q, where the norm is the operator norm induced by ||.||_inf,2.
    # Now, we construct a specific A. Let s_i = {i, i+1, ..., i+q-1} (mod N).
    # The matrix for A is (1/q) * M kron I_d', where M_ij=1 if j is in s_i.
    # Let's compute the norm. We construct a specific vector V to get a lower bound on the norm.
    # Let V = (v_1, ..., v_N) where v_j = u for j=0..q-1, and 0 otherwise. Let u be a unit vector in R^d'.
    # ||V||_inf,2 = max_j ||v_j||_2 = ||u||_2 = 1.
    # Let's look at the 0-th component of A(V):
    # A(V)_0 = (1/q) * sum_{j in s_0} v_j = (1/q) * sum_{j=0..q-1} u = (1/q) * q * u = u.
    # So ||A(V)_0||_2 = ||u||_2 = 1.
    # Since ||A(V)||_inf,2 = max_i ||A(V)_i||_2, we have ||A(V)||_inf,2 >= 1.
    # The operator norm is ||A||_op = sup_{||V||_inf,2=1} ||A(V)||_inf,2. So ||A||_op >= 1.
    # The constraint is ||A||_op <= 1/q.
    # So we must have 1 <= 1/q.
    print("The argument leads to the inequality: 1 <= 1/q")
    print("This inequality only holds if q = 1.")
    print("For any q > 1, this is a contradiction.")
    print("The contradiction arose from the assumption m < Nd'.")
    print("Therefore, for any q > 1, we must have m >= Nd'.")
    print("The problem asks for a single asymptotic lower bound. The behavior for q>1 suggests a very high dimensional requirement.")
