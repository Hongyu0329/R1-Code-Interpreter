    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of colors, `n` (where `n > 1`), required for a non-trivial Fox n-coloring of the figure eight knot. This number `n` corresponds to the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure (specifically, a quandle) that can be used to color the knot.\n\nThe rule for determining if a knot is n-colorable is based on its determinant. A knot `K` is n-colorable if and only if its determinant, `det(K)`, is divisible by `n`. The smallest `n > 1` that allows a coloring is the smallest prime factor of the knot's determinant.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Set up the \"coloring matrix\" for the figure eight knot based on its crossings.\n2.  Calculate the determinant of the knot. For a knot with `k` crossings, this is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the coloring matrix. The figure eight knot has 4 crossings, so we'll use a 3x3 submatrix.\n3.  The resulting number, the knot determinant, will tell us which values of `n` are possible. The smallest prime factor of this determinant will be our answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the smallest algebraic structure for coloring the figure eight knot.\n\n    This is equivalent to finding the determinant of the knot, as the number of elements\n    in the coloring set must be a factor of the determinant.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The figure eight knot (4_1) has 4 crossings. We can represent the relationships\")\n    print(\"between the colors of the arcs at these crossings with a coloring matrix.\")\n    print(\"The determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any\")\n    print(\"3x3 submatrix of the full 4x4 matrix.\\n\")\n\n    # A standard (k-1)x(k-1) submatrix for the figure eight knot.\n    knot_submatrix = np.array([\n        [-2, 1, 1],\n        [1, -2, 0],\n        [0, 1, -2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"A 3x3 submatrix for the figure eight knot is:\")\n    print(knot_submatrix)\n    print(\"\\nWe calculate its determinant.\")\n\n    # Calculate determinant manually for clarity\n    a, b, c = knot_submatrix[0]\n    d, e, f = knot_submatrix[1]\n    g, h, i = knot_submatrix[2]\n\n    # det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    det_val = a * (e * i - f * h) - b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)\n    \n    # The knot determinant is the absolute value.\n    knot_determinant = abs(det_val)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"abs( {a}*({e}*{i} - {f}*{h}) - {b}*({d}*{i} - {f}*{g}) + {c}*({d}*{h} - {e}*{g}) )\")\n    print(f\"= abs( {a}*({e*i - f*h}) - {b}*({d*i - f*g}) + {c}*({d*h - e*g}) )\")\n    print(f\"= abs( {a*(e*i - f*h)} - {b*(d*i - f*g)} + {c*(d*h - e*g)} )\")\n    print(f\"= abs( {a*(e*i - f*h) + (-b)*(d*i - f*g) + c*(d*h - e*g)} )\")\n    print(f\"= abs({det_val}) = {knot_determinant}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe determinant of the figure eight knot is {knot_determinant}.\")\n    print(\"This means the knot is n-colorable for factors of 5.
