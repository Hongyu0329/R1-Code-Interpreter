    print("   - In the 'Arabidopsis + AKP1+ RIB3' experiment, treatment with flagpep140-168 resulted in 2x10^6 RLUs.")
    print("   - Individually, neither AKP1 nor RIB3 conferred a response to flagpep140-168 (both gave 2x10^2 RLUs).")
    print("   - This indicates that AKP1 and RIB3 must work together as a complex or as co-receptors to perceive flagpep140-168.")

    print("\n2. Analysis of Protein Localization (Experiment 3):")
    print("   - When Tobacco plants expressing GFP-KIB1 were treated with flagpep140-168, the protein's location changed.")
    print("   - The signal moved from being 75% at the plasma membrane to only 20% at the plasma membrane, with 50% moving to the nucleus and 30% to the cytoplasm.")
    
    print("\n3. Synthesis and Conclusion:")
    print("   - The ligand that causes KIB1 to move (flagpep140-168) is the same ligand perceived by the AKP1/RIB3 receptor pair.")
    print("   - A protein (KIB1) changing its location in response to the activation of a receptor (the AKP1/RIB3 complex) is a classic downstream signaling event.")
    print("   - Therefore, KIB1 acts downstream of the receptor complex that contains both AKP1 and RIB3.")

    print("   - The first part, 'RIB3 is the coreceptor of AKP1', is supported by the ROS data.")
    print("   - The second part, 'KIB1 acts in the signaling pathway downstream of RIB3', is supported by the localization data, as KIB1's translocation is triggered by the activation of the receptor complex containing RIB3.")
    print("   - The fact that Experiment 2 shows no direct binding between KIB1 and RIB3 (2x10^2 RLU) does not invalidate this conclusion, as signaling pathways often have multiple components and do not require direct interaction between the initial receptor and every downstream element.")
