print("------------------------------------------")
# The input is a single scalar field U(x, y) for a fixed linear polarization (e.g., horizontal).
# Its Jones vector is [U(x,y), 0].
# We can control the complex value (amplitude and phase) of U at each pixel.
# This gives us N complex numbers to control.
input_dof = 2 * N  # Each complex number has 2 real values (real/imaginary or amp/phase)

print(f"On a grid with N = {N} pixels, we have N complex values to control.")
print(f"This provides {input_dof} real degrees of freedom (DoF) for control.")


print("\nStep 2: Define the Desired Output Beam")
print("------------------------------------------")
# An arbitrary vector beam is described by two independent complex fields, Ex(x,y) and Ey(x,y).
# Its Jones vector is [Ex(x,y), Ey(x,y)].
# To specify this beam, we must define the complex value of both Ex and Ey at each pixel.
# This means we need to specify 2*N complex numbers.
output_dof = 2 * (2 * N) # 2 fields * N pixels/field * 2 real values/complex number

print("\nStep 3: Compare Input Control vs. Output Specification")
print("---------------------------------------------------------")
# The system maps the input U to the output [Ex, Ey].
# The transformation for each component, Ex and Ey, depends on the SAME input U.
# For example (simplifying the propagation), the output after the random medium is:
# Ex_out = T_xx * U
# Ey_out = T_yx * U
# While propagation complicates this, the core fact remains: both output fields originate from ONE input field.

print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
print("-------------------")
print("Since the degrees of freedom for control ({}) are fewer than the degrees of freedom required to specify an arbitrary output ({}), it is impossible to generate any vector beam of our choosing.".format(input_dof, output_dof))
print("The set of achievable vector beams is a limited subset determined by the specific properties of the random medium's transmission matrix T, not an arbitrary one.")
