    "This is a classic geometry problem. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Object and its Orientation**: An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. The problem states it is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means this face is the horizontal base. Due to the perfect symmetry of the icosahedron, there must be another face at the top that is parallel to the base.\n2.  **Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**: \"Half-filled\" means the water occupies 50% of the tank's total volume. Because the icosahedron is symmetrical from top to bottom in this orientation, the horizontal plane that is exactly halfway between the bottom face and the top face will cut the volume into two equal halves. Therefore, the water surface must lie on this plane.\n3.  **Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**: The shape of the water's surface is simply the shape of the icosahedron's cross-section at this halfway plane. We need to figure out what that shape is. This mid-plane intersects the set of 6 edges that lie around the \"equator\" of the icosahedron.\n4.  **Identify the Final Shape**: The intersection of the plane with these 6 edges creates 6 vertices. Due to the 3-fold rotational symmetry of the icosahedron around the vertical axis, these 6 vertices form a regular polygon. A regular polygon with 6 sides is a regular hexagon.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a simple Python script to state this conclusion and print the result, including the number of sides in a simple equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This problem is solved by understanding the geometry and symmetry of an icosahedron.\n\n# 1. An icosahedron standing on a face has a parallel face at the top.\n# 2. When half-filled, the water level is at the horizontal plane exactly\n#    midway between the top and bottom faces, as this plane bisects the volume.\n# 3. This mid-plane intersects 6 of the icosahedron's edges.\n# 4. Due to the icosahedron's symmetry, these 6 intersection points form a regular polygon.\n\n# Let's define the final shape with an equation for its number of sides.\n# Let S be the number of sides of the polygon.\nS = 6\nshape_name = \"regular hexagon\"\n\n# Output the reasoning and the final answer.\nprint(\"The shape of the water surface is a polygon whose properties can be described by the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of sides (S) = {S}\")\nprint(f\"A polygon with {S} sides is a hexagon.\")\nprint(f\"Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, the shape is a {shape_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
