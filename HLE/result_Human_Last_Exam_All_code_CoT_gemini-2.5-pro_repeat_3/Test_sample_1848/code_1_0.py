    print("We partition Y₂ into ω₄ pairwise disjoint sets, {S_i | i < ω₄}, each of cardinality ω₄.")

    print("Next, we use a theorem from combinatorial set theory to find an upper bound for |A|.")

    print("Therefore, the size of our family A is bounded by: |A| ≤ 2^<ω₄.")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluate the upper bound 2^<ω₄.")
    print("The expression 2^<κ is defined as the supremum of {2^λ | λ is a cardinal and λ < κ}.")

    print("So, 2^<ω₄ = sup{2^ω₀, 2^ω₁, 2^ω₂, 2^ω₃}.")
    print("Since the cardinal exponentiation function 2^λ is non-decreasing with λ, the supremum is simply the last and largest term in the set.")
    print("Thus, 2^<ω₄ = 2^ω₃.")

    print("\nStep 3: Apply the given axiom again.")
    print("We are given that 2^ω₃ = ω₄.")
