    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Definition**: I'll start by interpreting what \"the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\" means in graph theory. This typically refers to the **graph join** operation, denoted as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The join of graphs involves taking disjoint copies of them and adding an edge between every vertex of one graph and every vertex of the others.\n2.  **Recall the Chromatic Number of a Join**: I will use the well-known theorem for the chromatic number of a graph join, which states that \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This property extends to the join of multiple graphs.\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle**: The chromatic number of the component graphs, \\( C_n \\), depends on the parity of \\( n \\). I'll consider two cases:\n    *   Case 1: \\( n \\) is even.\n    *   Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd.\n4.  **Calculate the Chromatic Number of G**: Using the results from the previous steps, I will calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for both cases. This will be \\( 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Value**: By comparing the results from the two cases, I will find the maximal possible chromatic number for \\( G \\).\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that automates this reasoning, explains each step, and prints the final calculation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum (join) of three cycles of length n.
