# The user wants to find the largest p such that the function I is not in L^p(R^9).
# My analysis leads to the conclusion that this value is p=14.
# The reasoning is based on finding the dimension of the set of parameters 'a'
# that leads to the slowest decay of the integral I(a).

# Step 1: Define the polynomial P(x, y; a)
x, y, c = sympy.symbols('x y c')
a = sympy.symbols('a1:10') # a1 to a9

P = (a[0]*x + a[1]*y +
     a[2]*x**2 + a[3]*x*y + a[4]*y**2 +
     a[5]*x**3 + a[6]*x**2*y + a[7]*x*y**2 + a[8]*y**3)

# Step 2: Find conditions for P to be constant along a line y=c.
P_on_line = P.subs(y, c)

# Collect coefficients of powers of x
poly_x = sympy.Poly(P_on_line, x)
coeffs_x = poly_x.coeffs()

# For P to be constant in x, coefficients of x, x^2, x^3 must be zero.
# Coeff of x^3:
cond1 = coeffs_x[-4]  # a6
# Coeff of x^2:
cond2 = coeffs_x[-3]  # a3 + a7*c
# Coeff of x:
cond3 = coeffs_x[-2]  # a1 + a4*c + a8*c^2

# These are 3 linear equations in 'a' for a fixed 'c'.
# They define a subspace V_c of dimension 9 - 3 = 6.
dim_Vc = 9 - 3

# Step 3: The set of all such subspaces is parameterized by c in [0,1].
# This adds one dimension to the set of "degenerate" parameters.
# The dimension of the variety V = union_{c in [0,1]} V_c is k = dim_Vc + 1.
k = dim_Vc + 1

# Step 4: Determine the decay rate of the integral for a in V.
# My analysis showed the decay rate alpha is 1/2, i.e., I(lambda*a) ~ lambda^(-1/2).
alpha = 1/2

# Step 5: Calculate the critical exponent p.
# The L^p norm integral restricted to this set V behaves like:
# integral( (R^(-alpha))^p * R^(k-1) dR )
# This diverges if -alpha*p + k - 1 >= -1, which simplifies to p <= k / alpha.
p_critical = k / alpha
