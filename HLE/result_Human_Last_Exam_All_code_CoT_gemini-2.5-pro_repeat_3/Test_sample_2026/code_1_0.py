# Step 1-4: Derivation of the geometric condition.
# The analysis of the nonlinear boundary-value problem shows that for a solution to exist,
# the initial conditions of the generating solution, denoted as x₀, y₀, z₀ in the problem,
# must satisfy a specific relationship.
# By applying perturbation theory, we derive a set of solvability conditions:
# (y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - exp(-T)) = α
# (x₀² + z₀²) * (1 - exp(-T)) = β
# (x₀² + y₀²) * (1 - exp(-T)) = γ
#
# Summing these equations gives:
# 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - exp(-T)) = α + β + γ
#
# Using the given information α + β + γ = 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T)), we substitute it in:
# 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - exp(-T)) = 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T))
#
# This simplifies to the equation of a sphere for (x₀, y₀, z₀):
# x₀² + y₀² + z₀² = 0.5 * 10^25
#
# Step 5: Calculate the Area
# This equation describes a sphere with a squared radius R² = 0.5 * 10^25.
# The "area bounded by the values" is the surface area of this sphere.
# The formula for the surface area of a sphere is A = 4 * π * R².
# This simplifies to A = 4 * π * (0.5 * 10^25) = 2 * π * 10^25.
#
# The code below calculates this final value and prints the components of the equation.

# Define the components of the final area equation: Area = C1 * pi * C2
C1 = 2
pi_val = math.pi
C2 = 10**25
R_squared = 0.5 * 10**25

# Calculate the final area
area = C1 * pi_val * C2
