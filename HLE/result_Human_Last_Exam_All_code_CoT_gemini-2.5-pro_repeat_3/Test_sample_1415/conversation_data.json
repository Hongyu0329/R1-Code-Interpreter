    "The user wants to evaluate a definite integral and then perform a calculation on the result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral is of the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`. This is a standard integral form whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`. In this case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which simplifies to `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Check for Positivity:** The function `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`. Since `e^(anything)` is positive, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1. The natural logarithm of a number greater than 1 is always positive. Therefore, `F₃(x)` is always positive, and the absolute value signs can be dropped. The integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n5.  **Write Python Code:**\n    *   Import the `math` library for `sin`, `exp`, and `log`.\n    *   Calculate the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`.\n    *   Calculate the value of the integral `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n    *   Compute `10000 * V`.\n    *   Find the closest integer to this result using `round()`.\n    *   Print the intermediate values and the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and finds the closest integer to 10000*V.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The integral to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n    # The antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln(f(x)).\n    # So the definite integral is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate F₃(0)\n    # F₀(0) = 0\n    # F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    # F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    # F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n    val_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate F₃(1)\n    # F₀(1) = 1\n    # F₁(1) = sin(1)\n    # F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    # F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    val_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(val_at_1) - math.log(val_at_0)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer\n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(f\"The value of F₃(1) is: {val_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"The value of F₃(0) is: {val_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"The final value of the integral V = ln({val_at_1}) - ln({val_at_0}) is: {V}\")\n    print(f\"The value of 10000 * V is: {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {closest_integer}\")\n    \n    return closest_integer\n\n# Run the solver and store the final answer\nfinal_answer = solve_integral()\n# The final answer is wrapped as requested\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
