# The problem asks for the value of S(N) mod p, where
# S(n) is the number of valid colorings of a 2xn rectangle.
# p = 23627 (a prime number)
# N = 23626 * (23628^100 - 23628^50)

# The number of restricted colors
R = 203
# The modulus
p = 23627

# As derived in the thought process, the recurrence relation for S(n) simplifies
# modulo p because T = 510^2 is congruent to R = 203 modulo p.
# The simplified recurrence for n >= 3 is:
# S(n) = (R-1) * (S(n-1) + S(n-2)) mod p

# The index N is a multiple of the period of this recurrence, which divides p^2 - 1.
# This leads to the conclusion that S(N) mod p is equal to a constant value,
# which can be determined from the initial conditions.
# This value is R / (R-1) mod p.

# We need to calculate R * (R-1)^(-1) mod p.
R_minus_1 = R - 1

# Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of (R-1)
# using Fermat's Little Theorem: a^(p-2) = a^(-1) mod p
# Or more generally using pow(base, exp, mod)
inv_R_minus_1 = pow(R_minus_1, -1, p)

# Calculate the final result
result = (R * inv_R_minus_1) % p
