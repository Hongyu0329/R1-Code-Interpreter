    # The standard definition of continuity for a map f: X -> Y at a point x_0 in X is that
    # for any neighborhood V of f(x_0), there exists a neighborhood U of x_0 such that f(U) is a subset of V.
    # The function is continuous if this holds for all x_0 in X.

    # In nonstandard analysis, this definition is elegantly rephrased using the concept of infinitesimals.
    # A point x_1 is infinitesimally close to a standard point x_0 (denoted x_1 ~ x_0) if x_1 is in the
    # nonstandard extension of every standard neighborhood of x_0. The set of such points x_1 is the monad of x_0.

    # The equivalent statement for continuity of f at a standard point x_0 is that f maps the monad of x_0
    # into the monad of f(x_0).
    # This means that for any point x_1 (standard or nonstandard) that is infinitesimally close to x_0,
    # its image f(x_1) must be infinitesimally close to f(x_0).

    # For the function f to be continuous on the entire space X, this property must hold for every standard point x_0 in X.
    # This translates to the following logical statement:
    # For all x_0 in X (standard points), and for all x_1 in X* (standard or nonstandard points),
    # if x_0 ~ x_1, then f(x_0) ~ f(x_1).

    # Let's examine the given options:
    # A. For all x_0, x_1 in X: x_0 ~ x_1 => f(x_0) ~ f(x_1). (Too weak, only standard points)
    # B. For all x_0 in X, for all x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 => f(x_0) ~ f(x_1). (Correct)
    # C. For all x_0, x_1 in X*: x_0 ~ x_1 => f(x_0) ~ f(x_1). (Too strong, this is S-continuity/uniform continuity)
    # D, E, F are converse statements related to other properties like injectivity or being a closed map.
    
    # Therefore, option B is the correct characterization of continuity.
