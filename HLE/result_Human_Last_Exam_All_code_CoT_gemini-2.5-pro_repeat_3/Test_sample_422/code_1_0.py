    print("\nIgnoring Gettier-style counterexamples, here are two fundamental problems this definition encounters:\n")

    # Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification
    print("--- Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification ---")
    print("The 'J' (Justification) requirement leads to an infinite regress.")
    print("\nHere's how:")
    print("  - To know a proposition (P), you must have a justification (J1) for believing P.")
    print("  - But for J1 to be a *good* justification, you must be justified in believing that J1 is valid. This requires a second justification (J2).")
    print("  - This, in turn, requires a justification for J2, which is J3, and so on, forever.")
    print("  - P requires J1, which requires J2, which requires J3 ... ad infinitum.")
    print("\nThis means no belief can ever be fundamentally justified, as the chain of justification never ends. It fails to provide a solid foundation for knowledge.\n")

    # Problem 2: The Problem of Access to Truth
    print("--- Problem 2: The Problem of Access to Truth ---")
    print("The 'T' (True) requirement creates a problem of circularity because a subject cannot access objective truth directly.")
    print("\nHere's how:")
    print("  - The 'Truth' of a belief is a fact about the external world, independent of the believer's mind.")
    print("  - For a believer to check if their belief 'P' is actually true, they cannot step outside their own consciousness to compare their belief with reality.")
    print("  - Instead, to verify 'P is true', they must rely on other beliefs and evidence.")
    print("  - Therefore, to confirm they meet the 'T' condition for knowing P, they would essentially need to *already know* that P is true, which is what they are trying to establish in the first place.")
    print("\nThis makes the 'T' condition something that can be asserted by a third party, but is inaccessible to the person claiming knowledge, making the definition unworkable from a first-person perspective.")
