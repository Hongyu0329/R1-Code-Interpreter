    "Here is a breakdown of the two primary problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, aside from Gettier problems, given the constraints.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the JTB Definition:** State the three components: Justification, Truth, and Belief.\n2.  **Identify Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification:** The \"Justified\" (J) condition creates a logical problem. If every belief needs a justification, then the justification itself (which is also a belief, e.g., \"I believe my evidence is reliable\") needs its own justification. This creates an infinite chain of justifications, which is logically untenable as a foundation for knowledge.\n3.  **Identify Problem 2: The Problem of Access to Truth:** The \"True\" (T) condition poses a practical and philosophical problem. Truth is an objective, external state of the world. However, a person (the subject) has no way to step outside of their own mind to directly compare their belief with objective reality. To confirm that their belief is *true*, they must rely on... more beliefs and justifications. This makes it impossible for the subject to ever definitively confirm that the \"T\" condition has been met, leading to a circular dependency.\n\nThe following Python script will articulate these two problems.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two fundamental problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition states that Knowledge is:\")\n    print(\"1. A Belief that is...\")\n    print(\"2. True, and...\")\n    print(\"3. Justified.\")\n    print(\"\\nIgnoring Gettier-style counterexamples, here are two fundamental problems this definition encounters:\\n\")\n\n    # Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\n    print(\"--- Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification ---\")\n    print(\"The 'J' (Justification) requirement leads to an infinite regress.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's how:\")\n    print(\"  - To know a proposition (P), you must have a justification (J1) for believing P.\")\n    print(\"  - But for J1 to be a *good* justification, you must be justified in believing that J1 is valid. This requires a second justification (J2).\")\n    print(\"  - This, in turn, requires a justification for J2, which is J3, and so on, forever.\")\n    print(\"  - P requires J1, which requires J2, which requires J3 ... ad infinitum.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means no belief can ever be fundamentally justified, as the chain of justification never ends. It fails to provide a solid foundation for knowledge.\\n\")\n\n    # Problem 2: The Problem of Access to Truth\n    print(\"--- Problem 2: The Problem of Access to Truth ---\")\n    print(\"The 'T' (True) requirement creates a problem of circularity because a subject cannot access objective truth directly.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's how:\")\n    print(\"  - The 'Truth' of a belief is a fact about the external world, independent of the believer's mind.\")\n    print(\"  - For a believer to check if their belief 'P' is actually true, they cannot step outside their own consciousness to compare their belief with reality.\")\n    print(\"  - Instead, to verify 'P is true', they must rely on other beliefs and evidence.\")\n    print(\"  - Therefore, to confirm they meet the 'T' condition for knowing P, they would essentially need to *already know* that P is true, which is what they are trying to establish in the first place.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis makes the 'T' condition something that can be asserted by a third party, but is inaccessible to the person claiming knowledge, making the definition unworkable from a first-person perspective.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are the **Regress Problem of Justification** (the requirement for justification leads to an infinite, ungrounded chain) and the **Problem of Access to Truth** (a believer cannot independently verify that their belief is true without circular reasoning).>>>"
