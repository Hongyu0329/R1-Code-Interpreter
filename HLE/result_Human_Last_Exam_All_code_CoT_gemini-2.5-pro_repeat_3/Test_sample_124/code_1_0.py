    # Based on the analysis of the properties of the junction tree algorithm:
    # C: Correct. The algorithm works with joint distributions within clique nodes.
    # E: Correct. High treewidth leads to large cliques, making the algorithm impractical due to exponential complexity.
    # G: Correct. The use of joint distributions over large cliques is the reason for the impracticality with high treewidth.
    # I: Correct. The complexity is exponential in the size of the largest clique.
    # L: Correct. This is a valid description of the running intersection property.
