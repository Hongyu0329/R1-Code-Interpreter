    "Based on the principles of nonlinear optics, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are generally not expected to exhibit significant spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Requirement for SPDC**: SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A material must possess a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) to facilitate this effect efficiently.\n2.  **Symmetry Condition**: A fundamental requirement for a material to have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). In materials with inversion symmetry, the second-order effects cancel out on a macroscopic level.\n3.  **Boron Nanosheet Structure**: The most stable and commonly synthesized polymorphs of borophene (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are centrosymmetric. They possess a center of inversion.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Because the common forms of borophene are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order susceptibility χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Consequently, they are not expected to be efficient materials for spontaneous parametric downconversion. While symmetry can be broken at edges or by defects, this effect would be very weak compared to conventional non-centrosymmetric crystals used for SPDC (e.g., BBO, KDP).\n\nTo illustrate a key principle of SPDC—energy conservation—I will provide a Python script. The script calculates the wavelength of the resulting photons in the simplest case of degenerate SPDC, where the initial \"pump\" photon splits into two new photons of identical energy.\n\nThe governing equation for energy conservation is: `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`.\nIn the degenerate case, `λ_signal = λ_idler`, so the equation simplifies to `λ_signal = 2 * λ_pump`.\n\nThis script will use a common pump laser wavelength (405 nm) to calculate the wavelength of the two identical down-converted photons.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_degenerate_spdc(pump_wavelength_nm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the wavelength of down-converted photons in degenerate SPDC.\n\n    In degenerate Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), a pump photon\n    splits into two identical photons (signal and idler). Energy conservation dictates\n    that the energy of the pump photon is split equally between the two new photons.\n    Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (E = hc/λ), the wavelength\n    of the down-converted photons is double that of the pump photon.\n\n    Equation: λ_signal = 2 * λ_pump\n\n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): The wavelength of the pump laser in nanometers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the wavelength of the degenerate signal/idler photons\n    signal_wavelength_nm = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n    idler_wavelength_nm = signal_wavelength_nm\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with values\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) Energy Conservation:\")\n    print(\"Principle: A high-energy 'pump' photon splits into two lower-energy 'signal' and 'idler' photons.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the degenerate case (signal and idler photons are identical):\")\n    print(\"The wavelength of the new photons is double the pump wavelength.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Given a pump wavelength (λ_pump) of {pump_wavelength_nm} nm...\")\n\n    # Output each number in the final equation\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is: λ_signal = 2 * λ_pump\")\n    print(f\"Result: {signal_wavelength_nm} nm = 2 * {pump_wavelength_nm} nm\")\n\n# --- User Input ---\n# Define the pump laser wavelength in nanometers.\n# A common value for SPDC experiments is 405 nm (blue-violet laser).\npump_wl = 405.0\n\n# Run the calculation and print the results\ncalculate_degenerate_spdc(pump_wl)\n```\n<<<No>>>"
