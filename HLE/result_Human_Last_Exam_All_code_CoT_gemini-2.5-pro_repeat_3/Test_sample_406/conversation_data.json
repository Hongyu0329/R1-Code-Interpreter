    "This problem requires finding sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a so-called \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from fixed-point theory, a branch of mathematical analysis. My plan is to solve this by applying the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a composite operator defined on a product of metric spaces.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem**: First, I will clearly define what an FGH-tripled fixed point is, based on the function signatures provided: `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z`. A triplet `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n2.  **Reformulate as a Standard Fixed-Point Problem**: I will show that finding this triplet is equivalent to finding a single fixed point for a combined operator `T` on the product space `S = X * Y * Z`. The operator `T` will be defined as `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`.\n3.  **Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**: The Banach theorem guarantees a unique fixed point for a contraction mapping on a complete metric space. Therefore, the core conditions will be:\n    *   `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n    *   The combined operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on the product space `S`.\n4.  **Derive Conditions on F, G, and H**: I will translate the contraction condition for `T` into a more practical set of conditions on the individual functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. This involves assuming that `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz continuous with certain constants and then deriving a set of inequalities that these constants must satisfy.\n5.  **Present the Result using Python**: I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to clearly explain the setup, the derivation, and the final conditions. This fulfills the user's request to provide the solution in a code block. The code will explicitly print the numbers in the final equations, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the conditions for the existence and\n    uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n    print(\"Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n    print(\"\\nLet (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be non-empty complete metric spaces.\")\n    print(\"Let the three functions be defined as:\")\n    print(\"  F: X x Y x Z -> X\")\n    print(\"  G: Y x X x Y -> Y\")\n    print(\"  H: Z x Y x Z -> Z\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\")\n    print(\"An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points (x, y, z), where x is in X,\")\n    print(\"y is in Y, and z is in Z, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"  1.
