The essential conditions are that (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a joint contraction property. Assuming F, G, H are Lipschitz continuous with non-negative constants (a,b,c), (d,e), and (f,g,h) respectively, the sufficient conditions for a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are: a+d+h < 1, b+e+g < 1, and c+f < 1.
