    # Step 1 & 2: Define parameters and derive the relationship between y0 and x0.
    # The relationship derived from the solvability condition is y0^q = K * x0^p,
    # where K = -C1/C2. The constants p, q, etc., are given.
    # We don't need to calculate K explicitly because it cancels out.
    p = 6
    q = 4

    # Step 3: Solve for X0.
    # The integral equation is given by:
    # integral(y0(x0) * x0^(p-1), dx0, 0, X0) = beta
    # Substituting y0(x0) = K^(1/q) * x0^(p/q), the integral becomes:
    # K^(1/q) * integral(x0^(p/q + p - 1), dx0, 0, X0) = beta
    # K^(1/q) * [x0^(p/q + p) / (p/q + p)]_0^X0 = beta
    # K^(1/q) * X0^(p/q + p) / (p/q + p) = beta
    
    # Let's calculate the exponent of X0:
    exponent = p / q + p
    # exponent = 6/4 + 6 = 1.5 + 6 = 7.5
    # The integral gives X0^(exponent) / exponent.
    # Oh, the integral is of x0^(p/q + p - 1), so the result is x0^(p/q + p) / (p/q+p).
    # Wait, the power in the integral is x0^(p-1) * x0^(p/q) = x0^(p-1+p/q)
    # The integral of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1).
    # So the resulting power is p-1+p/q+1 = p+p/q.
    power_in_integral = p - 1 + p / q # 6 - 1 + 6/4 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
    power_of_X0 = power_in_integral + 1 # 7.5 = 15/2
    
    # From the analytical derivation, the equation for X0 simplifies to:
    # X0^(15/2) = 10^120 / 1000
    X0_pow_15_div_2 = 10**120 / 1000
    
    # This simplifies to 10^117
    # So, X0 = (10^117)^(2/15)
    X0 = (10**117)**(2/15)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the final expression.
    # The expression is 10^30 * X0^2 - 10^30 * X0 + 10
