def calculate_number_of_coverings():
    """
    This function calculates the total number of smooth coverings mentioned in the problem.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2,p), b, w)
    that arise from the covering group G = SL(2,p) for a prime p > 5.

    The relationship is that G is a central extension of S = PSL(2,p) by the center Z(G).
    1 -> Z(G) -> G -> S -> 1

    The different types of coverings are classified by the irreducible characters of the
    kernel of the map from G to S, which is the center Z(G). The number of such
    coverings is equal to the number of irreducible characters of Z(G).

    For any finite abelian group, the number of its irreducible characters is equal to its order.
    So, we need to find the order of the center of SL(2, p).
    """

    # The center of SL(2, p) consists of scalar matrices k*I such that det(k*I) = 1.
    # For a 2x2 matrix, det(k*I) = k^2. So we need to solve k^2 = 1 in the field F_p.
    # For any prime p > 2, this equation has exactly two solutions: k = 1 and k = -1.
    # The problem states p > 5, which satisfies p > 2.
    # The elements of the center are I (for k=1) and -I (for k=-1).
    order_of_center = 2

    # The number of coverings is the order of the center.
