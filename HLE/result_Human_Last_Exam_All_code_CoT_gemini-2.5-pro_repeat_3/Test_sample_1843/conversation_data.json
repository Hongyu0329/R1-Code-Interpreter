    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ and order $k$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of Characters**: Any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_r^{a_r}}$, where $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, and each $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n3.  **Primitivity and Order Conditions**:\n    *   A character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n    *   The **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_r^{a_r}}))$.\n    We need this order to be 6.\n\n4.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: To find the number of characters with order exactly 6, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The order is 6 if and only if it divides 6, is not a divisor of 2, and is not a divisor of 3.\n    Number of characters of order 6 =\n    (Number of chars with order dividing 6)\n    - (Number of chars with order dividing 2)\n    - (Number of chars with order dividing 3)\n    + (Number of chars with order dividing 1)\n\n5.  **Counting Characters for each Factor**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we need to count the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. The total number of characters of a certain type is the product of the counts for each factor.\n\n6.  **Calculation**: We will implement a Python script to:\n    a. Determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor ($4, 9, 7, 11, 13$) for orders dividing 6, 3, and 2.\n    b. Calculate the total number of characters whose orders divide 6, 3, and 2 by multiplying the counts for each factor.\n    c. Apply the inclusion-exclusion formula to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef get_prime_power(m):\n    \"\"\"Decomposes m into p^a.\"\"\"\n    if m == 1:\n        return 1, 0\n    num = m\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= num:\n        if num % p == 0:\n            a = 0\n            while num % p == 0:\n                num //= p\n                a += 1\n            if num == 1:\n                return p, a\n        p += 1\n    if num > 1:\n        return num, 1\n    return None, None # Should not happen for p^a\n\ndef count_primitive_chars_order_k(m, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor m and order k.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 1:\n        # Primitive characters cannot have order 1 (only the principal character has order 1, conductor 1)\n        return 0\n\n    p, a = get_prime_power(m)\n\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: # m = 2\n            return 0\n        if a == 2: # m = 4\n            return 1 if k == 2 else 0\n        if a >= 3:\n            # Not needed for N=36036, but for completeness:\n            # G_2^a is C_2 x C_{2^{a-2}}.
