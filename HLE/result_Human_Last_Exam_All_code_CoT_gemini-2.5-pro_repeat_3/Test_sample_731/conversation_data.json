    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. The order of a semidihedral group is always a power of 2, written as $2^n$. For a size of 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\"**: A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element (e.g., $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some element $g$ in the group). The task is to count the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Plan**: The number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 3$) can be found using a known formula derived from the group's structure. The formula is:\n    Total Cyclic Subgroups = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$\n\n    This formula is composed of three parts:\n    *   $n$: The number of cyclic subgroups that are subsets of the main cyclic subgroup of order $2^{n-1}$.\n    *   $2^{n-2}$: The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 2 that are not contained in the main cyclic subgroup.\n    *   $2^{n-3}$: The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 that are not contained in the main cyclic subgroup.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We will now apply this formula with $n=9$.\n    *   Number of subgroups from the main cyclic part = $n = 9$.\n    *   Number of additional order-2 subgroups = $2^{9-2} = 2^7 = 128$.\n    *   Number of additional order-4 subgroups = $2^{9-3} = 2^6 = 64$.\n    *   Total number = $9 + 128 + 64$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_sd512():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power (cyclic) subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n    \n    # For a semidihedral group SD_2^n, find n.\n    # 2^n = 512\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{{group_size}}}, where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"A 'power subgroup' is another name for a cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(\"The number of cyclic subgroups in SD_{2^n} is given by the formula: n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3).\\n\")\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the formula\n    term1 = n\n    term2 = 2**(n - 2)\n    term3 = 2**(n - 3)\n    \n    # Calculate the total\n    total_subgroups = term1 + term2 + term3\n    \n    print(\"Calculating each part of the formula:\")\n    print(f\"1.
