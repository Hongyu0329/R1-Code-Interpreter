    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, such that $L$ is the left adjoint of $R$. This adjunction is uniquely determined by either $L$ or $R$. The task is to count how many such pairs exist for $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The condition for an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to have a left adjoint $L$ is that for every $i \\in [m]$, the set $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$ is non-empty. Since $R$ is order-preserving, its maximum value is $R(n)$. This condition is satisfied if and only if $m \\le R(n)$. As the codomain of $R$ is $[m]$, we must have $R(n) \\le m$. Combining these, the condition simplifies to $R(n) = m$.\n2.  Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $R: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $R(n)=m$. For this problem, we need to count the order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ where $R(37) = 23$.\n3.  An order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of 38 integers $(R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37))$ where each $R(i)$ is in $[23]$. The condition $R(37)=23$ fixes the last element of the sequence.\n4.  We are left with counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $(R(0), \\dots, R(36))$ of length 37, where each element is in $[23]$. This is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\n5.  The number of order-preserving maps from $[k]$ to $[l]$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{l+k+1}{k+1}$. In our case, $k=36$ and $l=23$.\n6.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get $\\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36 + 1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n7.  The final step is to write a Python script to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem.\n# We are looking for adjunctions from [m] to [n].\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# Step 2: The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient\n# C(m + n, n) or equivalently C(m + n, m).\n# This is derived by counting the number of order-preserving maps R: [n] -> [m]\n# that satisfy R(n) = m. This count is equivalent to the number of\n# order-preserving maps from [n-1] to [m].\n# Using the standard formula for counting order-preserving maps from [k] to [l],\n# which is C(l + k + 1, k + 1), we set k = n-1 = 36 and l = m = 23.\n# The number is C(23 + 36 + 1, 36 + 1) = C(60, 37).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the parameters for the binomial coefficient.\nN = m + n\nK = n\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K).\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final equation and the result.\n# The numbers in the final equation are N, K, and the result.\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is calculated by the formula C({m} + {n}, {n}).\")\nprint(f\"C({N}, {K}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<17363362402441000>>>"
