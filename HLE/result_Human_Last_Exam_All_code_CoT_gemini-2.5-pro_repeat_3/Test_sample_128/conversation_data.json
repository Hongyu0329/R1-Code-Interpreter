    "Answering this question requires understanding a fundamental property of quantum gates: linearity. A unitary quantum gate operation is a linear transformation on the state vectors. This means for any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `a` and `b`, the transformation `U` must satisfy:\n\n`U(a|ψ₁⟩ + b|ψ₂⟩) = aU|ψ₁⟩ + bU|ψ₂⟩`\n\nWe can use this property to check the validity of each transformation given in the answer choices. We can express some of the basis states as linear combinations of others. The most convenient relations are:\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩) / √2`\n\nLet's test a given transformation `T`. If `T` corresponds to a linear operator `U`, then `U|+⟩` must equal `U((|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2)`. By linearity, this must be equal to `(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) / √2`.\n\nSo, the test is as follows:\n1.  For a given transformation `T` from the answer choices, find the results for `T(|0⟩)` and `T(|1⟩)`.\n2.  Calculate the state `|ψ_predicted⟩ = (T(|0⟩) + T(|1⟩)) / √2`. This is what `T(|+⟩)` *should* be if the transformation is linear.\n3.  Compare `|ψ_predicted⟩` with the state `|ψ_actual⟩ = T(|+⟩)` given in the transformation's rules.\n4.  If `|ψ_predicted⟩` and `|ψ_actual⟩` are not the same state (i.e., they are not equal up to a global phase factor), the transformation is not linear and therefore not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this check for all the provided options and identify the one that fails this test of linearity.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_transformations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which of the quantum transformations is not possible by testing linearity.\n    A unitary transformation U must be linear, e.g., U(|+>) = (U|0> + U|1>)/sqrt(2).\n    This script checks this condition for all provided transformations.\n    \"\"\"\n    s2 = np.sqrt(2)\n    # Define the six basis states as complex vectors\n    states = {\n        '0': np.array([1, 0], dtype=complex),\n        '1': np.array([0, 1], dtype=complex),\n        '+': np.array([1/s2, 1/s2], dtype=complex),\n        '-': np.array([1/s2, -1/s2], dtype=complex),\n        'i': np.array([1/s2, 1j/s2], dtype=complex),\n        '-i': np.array([1/s2, -1j/s2], dtype=complex)\n    }\n\n    # Define the transformations from the answer choices\n    # Each key is the initial state, each value is the final state\n    transforms_text = {\n        'A': \"0>1 1>0 +>- ->+ i>i -i>-i\",\n        'B': \"0>0 1>1 +>- ->+ i>-i -i>i\",\n        'C': \"0>+ 1>- +>0 ->1 i>-i -i>i\",\n        'D': \"0>0 1>1 +>i ->-i i>- -i>+\",\n        'E': \"0>0 1>1 +>+ ->- i>i -i>-i\",\n        'F': \"0>+ 1>- +>1 ->0 i>i -i>-i\",\n        'G': \"0>- 1>+ +>0 ->1 i>i -i>-i\",\n        'H': \"0>i 1>-i +>+ ->- i>1 -i>0\",\n        'I': \"0>-i 1>i +>+ ->- i>0 -i>1\",\n        'J': \"0>+ 1>- +>-i ->i i>1 -i>0\",\n        'K': \"0>-i 1>i +>0 ->1 i>- -i>+\",\n        'L': \"0>i 1>-i +>0 ->1 i>+ -i>-\",\n        'M': \"0>+ 1>- +>i ->-i i>0 -i>1\",\n        'N': \"0>- 1>+ +>i ->-i i>1 -i>0\",\n        'O': \"0>-i 1>i +>1 ->0 i>+ -i>-\",\n        'P': \"0>- 1>+ +>-i ->i i>0 -i>1\",\n        'Q': \"0>- 1>+ +>-i ->i i>1 -i>0\",\n        'R': \"0>i 1>-i +>1 ->0 i>- -i>+\",\n        'S': \"0>i 1>-i +>- ->+ i>0 -i>1\",\n        'T': \"0>-i 1>i +>- ->+ i>1 -i>0\",\n        'U': \"0>- 1>+ +>1 ->0 i>-i -i>i\",\n        'V': \"0>1 1>0 +>i ->-i i>+ -i>-\",\n        'W': \"0>1 1>0 +>-i ->i i>- -i>+\",\n    }\n\n    transforms = {}\n    for choice, text in transforms_text.items():\n        pairs = text.split(' ')\n        mapping = {}\n        for pair in pairs:\n            initial, final = pair.split('>')\n            mapping[initial] = final\n        transforms[choice] = mapping\n        \n    impossible_choice = None\n    \n    print(\"Checking for linearity: U(|+>) should be proportional to U(|0>) + U(|1>)\\n\")\n\n    for choice, t_map in sorted(transforms.items()):\n        # Get the transformed |0> and |1> states from the table\n        t_0 = states[t_map['0']]\n        t_1 = states[t_map['1']]\n\n        # Based on linearity, calculate what the transformed |+> state should be\n        predicted_t_plus = (t_0 + t_1) / s2\n\n        # Get the actual transformed |+> state from the table\n        actual_t_plus = states[t_map['+']]\n        \n        # Check if the predicted and actual states are the same (up to a global phase)\n        # We check this by calculating the fidelity squared: |<actual|predicted>|^2\n        # If fidelity is 1, they are the same state.
