    "Answering this question requires a careful interpretation of the terminology, as a standard interpretation leads to a trivial answer.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Standard Interpretation:**\n    *   A **finite ultrametric space** `X` is a finite set with a distance function `d` satisfying the strong triangle inequality: `d(x, z) <= max(d(x, y), d(y, z))`.\n    *   A **Banach space** `B` is a complete normed vector space. Typically, this is over the field of real or complex numbers. Any such non-trivial space (with more than one element) is uncountably infinite. The question mentions `B` has cardinality `K`, hinting that we should consider its size.\n    *   An **isometric embedding** is a function `f: X -> B` that preserves distances: `||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y)`.\n    *   **The Problem:** If we take a standard Banach space (e.g., `R^n`), and if an isometric embedding `f` exists, then for any constant vector `c` in `B`, the translated function `g(x) = f(x) + c` is also an isometric embedding. Since there are infinitely many choices for `c`, there are infinitely many embeddings. If no embedding exists, the number is 0. So, the number of embeddings is either 0 or infinite. The \"smallest possible number\" would be 0, which is likely not the intended answer as it's trivial.\n\n2.  **A Non-Standard Interpretation:**\n    *   The problem becomes non-trivial if we can find a scenario with a finite, non-zero number of embeddings. This is possible if the Banach space `B` itself is finite.\n    *   While unusual, a vector space over a **finite field** `F_q` (with `q` elements) can be considered a Banach space. The cardinality `|B|` of such a space is `q^d` where `d` is the dimension. The norm must be the **trivial norm**: `||v|| = 1` for `v != 0` and `||0|| = 0`. This space is complete, so it qualifies as a Banach space under this setup.\n    *   The distance function in this space `B` is `d_B(u, v) = ||u - v||`, which is 1 if `u != v` and 0 if `u = v`. This is the **discrete metric**.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Problem:**\n    *   For an isometric embedding `f: X -> B` to exist, the distances in `X` must match the distances in `B`. This means the ultrametric space `X` must also have distances of only 0 or 1. Such a space is called a **uniform space**, where `d(x, y) = 1` for all distinct `x, y`. A uniform space is a valid type of ultrametric space.\n    *   An isometric embedding `f` must map distinct points in `X` to distinct points in `B` (otherwise their distance would be 0, not 1). So, `f` must be an **injective function**.\n    *   The problem now is to find the smallest possible number of injective functions from a set `X` of size `n` to a finite vector space `B` of size `m`.\n    *   The number of such functions is given by the number of permutations, `P(m, n) = m! / (m-n)!`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Minimum:**\n    *   We want to find the minimum of `P(m, n)`.\n    *   For the problem to be non-trivial, `X` must have at least two points, so `n >= 2`.\n    *   For an injective map to exist, `B` must have at least as many points as `X`, so `m >= n`.\n    *   The size `m` of the finite Banach space `B` must be a prime power (`q^d`).\n    *   We need to find `min(P(m, n))` subject to `n >= 2`, `m >= n`, and `m` being a prime power.\n    *   Let's test the smallest possible values:\n        *   **Case n = 2:** We need the smallest prime power `m >= 2`. This is `m = 2` (since 2 is prime). The number of embeddings is `P(2, 2) = 2! / (2-2)! = 2`.\n        *   **Case n = 3:** We need the smallest prime power `m >= 3`. This is `m = 3` (since 3 is prime). The number of embeddings is `P(3, 3) = 3! / (3-3)! = 6`.\n        *   **Case n = 4:** We need the smallest prime power `m >= 4`. This is `m = 4` (since `4 = 2^2`). The number of embeddings is `P(4, 4) = 4! / (4-4)! = 24`.\n    *   The values are increasing, so the minimum value is 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The smallest possible (non-zero) number of isometric embeddings is 2. This occurs when embedding a 2-point uniform space `X` into a 2-element Banach space `B` (the vector space `F_2`). The final equation representing this is `P(2, 2) = 2`. The following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings based on a\n    specific interpretation of the problem.\n\n    The reasoning is as follows:\n    1.  A standard interpretation leads to 0 or infinitely many embeddings.\n    2.  We assume a non-standard interpretation where the Banach space B can be finite.\n        This occurs if it's a vector space over a finite field with the trivial norm.\n        The cardinality 'm' of such a space must be a prime power.\n    3.  For an isometric embedding to exist, the ultrametric space X must also have\n        distances of only 0 or 1 (a uniform space).\n    4.  An embedding is then an injective map from X (size n) to B (size m).\n        The number of embeddings is the number of n-permutations of m, P(m, n).\n    5.  We seek to minimize P(m, n) for n >= 2, m >= n, and m being a prime power.\n    6.  The minimum occurs for the smallest possible n, which is n=2.\n    7.  The smallest prime power m >= 2 is m=2.\n    8.  Therefore, the smallest number of embeddings is P(2, 2).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Smallest size of the ultrametric space X\n    n = 2\n    # Smallest size of the Banach space B (must be a prime power >= n)\n    m = 2\n\n    # Calculate the number of permutations P(m, n)\n    num_embeddings = math.perm(m, n)\n\n    # The final equation is P(m, n) = result\n    print(f\"The analysis leads to the equation P(m, n) = C, with the following values:\")\n    print(f\"Size of the ultrametric space, n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Size of the Banach space, m = {m}\")\n    print(f\"The resulting smallest number of embeddings is P({m}, {n}) = {num_embeddings}\")\n\nsolve_embedding_problem()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
