def solve_embedding_problem():
    """
    This function finds the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings based on a
    specific interpretation of the problem.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  A standard interpretation leads to 0 or infinitely many embeddings.
    2.  We assume a non-standard interpretation where the Banach space B can be finite.
        This occurs if it's a vector space over a finite field with the trivial norm.
        The cardinality 'm' of such a space must be a prime power.
    3.  For an isometric embedding to exist, the ultrametric space X must also have
        distances of only 0 or 1 (a uniform space).
    4.  An embedding is then an injective map from X (size n) to B (size m).
        The number of embeddings is the number of n-permutations of m, P(m, n).
    5.  We seek to minimize P(m, n) for n >= 2, m >= n, and m being a prime power.
    6.  The minimum occurs for the smallest possible n, which is n=2.
    7.  The smallest prime power m >= 2 is m=2.
    8.  Therefore, the smallest number of embeddings is P(2, 2).
