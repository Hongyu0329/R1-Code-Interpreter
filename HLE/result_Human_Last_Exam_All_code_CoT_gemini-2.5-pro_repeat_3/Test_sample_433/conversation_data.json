    "My plan is to address this pharmaceutical standards question by referencing the guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically chapter <797> on sterile compounding. The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a single-dose ampule after it has been opened in a sterile environment. I will create a Python script that defines the scenario's parameters and then prints the established rule and the reasoning behind it, as there is no calculation to perform.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on sterile compounding standards (USP <797>).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters of the Scenario ---\n    container_type = \"single dose container ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment\"\n    action = \"puncture or opening\"\n\n    # --- Established Guideline ---\n    # According to USP <797>, an opened ampule cannot be stored.\n    bud = \"immediately\"\n    disposal_rule = \"Any unused portion must be discarded.\"\n\n    # --- Reasoning ---\n    reason = (\n        \"An ampule is a sealed glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed. \"\n        \"Once opened, it is an open system that is exposed to the environment. \"\n        \"This exposure creates a risk of microbial contamination that cannot be mitigated, \"\n        \"so the contents must be used without delay.\"\n    )\n\n    # --- Final Output ---\n    print(f\"The BUD for a {container_type} from the time of {action} in a {environment} is determined as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"BUD = Use {bud}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Explanation ---\")\n    print(f\"Rule: {disposal_rule}\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {reason}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate use>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
