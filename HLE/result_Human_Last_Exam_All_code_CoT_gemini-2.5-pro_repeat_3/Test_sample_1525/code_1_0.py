# The task is to evaluate five statements (A-E) about a mathematical claim
# regarding Datalog programs and count how many of them are correct.

# Statement A is correct because the "order of appearance" for constants
# is not a well-defined property of a Datalog program (which is a set),
# making the segregation operator ambiguous.

# Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the main claim. The claim is about
# the equality of the *outputs* of the programs, not the equality of the programs themselves.

# Statement C is correct because it accurately describes a key property of the operators:
# aggregation (gamma) is generally lossy, and therefore segregation (gamma_inv) cannot
# reliably reverse it. This context is crucial for understanding the claim's premises.

# Statement D is correct for the same reason as A. It points out that the segregation
# operation on the set of facts, gamma_inv[S0], is also not well-defined due to the
# lack of a canonical order of constants.

# Statement E is correct as it provides an accurate semantic interpretation of the claim,
# describing it as an equivalence between performing inference at a coarse-grained level
# versus performing it at a fine-grained level and then coarsening the result.

# The correct statements are A, C, D, and E.
# We count the number of correct statements.
correct_statements_count = 4

# The final answer is the count of correct statements.
