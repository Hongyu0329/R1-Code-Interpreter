def demagnetizing_factor_expression():
    """
    This function prints the analytical expression for the fluxmetric
    demagnetizing factor of a magnetic cylinder.

    The expression is for a cylinder with:
    - Uniform susceptibility chi = 0 (uniformly magnetized)
    - g: length-to-diameter ratio (L/D)
    - F(m): complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus m
    - E(m): complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus m
    - m: modulus defined as m = sqrt(g^2 / (4 + g^2))

    The user provided a modulus k = sqrt(4 / (4 + g^2)). Note that k
    is the complementary modulus to m (i.e., m^2 + k^2 = 1). The standard
    and correct formula is expressed in terms of m.
