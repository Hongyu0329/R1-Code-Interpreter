    "My plan is to determine which Turing Machine runs the longest by simulating each one step-by-step.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Rules:** Each machine's definition is a string of rules. I'll assume the rules are ordered for states A, B, C, D, and E. For each state, the first rule listed is for when the machine reads a '0', and the second is for reading a '1'. For example, in the first machine, the rules for state 'A' are `B1L` (on reading 0, transition to state B, write 1, move Left) and `B0R` (on reading 1, transition to state B, write 0, move Right).\n2.  **Simulate the Execution:** I will write a Python script to perform the simulation. The script will track:\n    *   The machine's current state (starts at 'A').\n    *   The tape, which is infinite and starts filled with zeros. I'll use a dictionary for this, which is well-suited for a sparse, infinite tape.\n    *   The position of the read/write head (starts at 0).\n    *   The number of steps taken (starts at 0).\n3.  **Run Until Halt:** The simulation for each machine will continue until it enters the special 'H' (Halt) state.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** After simulating all three machines, I'll compare their total step counts. The final answer will be the machine that took the most steps to halt and the corresponding number of steps.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rules_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing Machine based on a given rule string.\n    \n    The machine starts in state 'A' on an empty tape (all zeros) at position 0.\n    The simulation runs until it reaches the halt state 'H'.\n    \n    Args:\n        rules_string: A space-separated string of rules.\n    \n    Returns:\n        The total number of steps taken to halt.
