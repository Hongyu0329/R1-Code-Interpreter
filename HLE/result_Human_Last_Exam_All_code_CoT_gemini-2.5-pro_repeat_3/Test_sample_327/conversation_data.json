    "To find the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can use its binary representation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Representation:** In red-blue-Hackenbush, a positive dyadic fraction (a fraction of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) can be represented by a single stalk of red and blue pieces. The representation is determined by the fraction's binary expansion.\n2.  **Binary Conversion:** Convert the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ into its binary form. Since the denominator is $16 = 2^4$, the binary expansion will have exactly 4 digits after the decimal point.\n3.  **Construct the Stalk:** The binary expansion $0.b_1b_2b_3b_4...$ corresponds to a stalk of pieces where the piece at position $i$ (from the ground up) is Red if $b_i = 1$ and Blue if $b_i = 0$.\n4.  **Count the Pieces:** The total number of pieces required is simply the number of digits in the binary expansion after the decimal point.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to perform these steps and calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a dyadic fraction\n    in Red-Blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The fraction given in the problem\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    # For a simple stalk representation, the denominator must be a power of 2.\n    # The exponent 'n' where denominator = 2^n determines the number of pieces.\n    try:\n        n = int(math.log2(denominator))\n        if 2**n != denominator:\n            raise ValueError\n    except ValueError:\n        print(f\"Error: The denominator {denominator} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # Convert the numerator to its binary representation string, removing the '0b' prefix.\n    binary_numerator_str = bin(numerator)[2:]\n\n    # The binary representation of the fraction has 'n' digits after the decimal point.\n    # We pad the numerator's binary string with leading zeros to ensure it has length 'n'.\n    binary_fraction_str = binary_numerator_str.zfill(n)\n\n    # The total number of pieces is the length of this binary string.\n    total_pieces = len(binary_fraction_str)\n\n    # A '1' corresponds to a red piece and a '0' to a blue piece.\n    red_pieces = binary_fraction_str.count('1')\n    blue_pieces = binary_fraction_str.count('0')\n\n    print(f\"The fraction to represent is {numerator}/{denominator}.\")\n    print(f\"The binary expansion of {numerator}/{denominator} is 0.{binary_fraction_str}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a stalk of pieces where '1' is Red and '0' is Blue.\")\n    print(f\"The number of red pieces is {red_pieces}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of blue pieces is {blue_pieces}.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the total number of pieces is:\")\n    print(f\"{red_pieces} + {blue_pieces} = {total_pieces}\")\n\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
