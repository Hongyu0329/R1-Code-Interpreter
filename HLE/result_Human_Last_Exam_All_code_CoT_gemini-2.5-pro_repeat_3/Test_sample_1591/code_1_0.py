    Solves the given boundary-value problem.
    
    The detailed step-by-step derivation shows that the problem requires an assumption
    for the parameter 'r' to be uniquely solvable. The structure of the boundary
    conditions strongly suggests that r=1.
    
    With r=1, we can determine the initial state (x_0^1, x_0^2) and subsequently
    the value of the expression at n = 10^15. The expression simplifies to
    the squared norm of the initial state vector, ||X_0||^2.
