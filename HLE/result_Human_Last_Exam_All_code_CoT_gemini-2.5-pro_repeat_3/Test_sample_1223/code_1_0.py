    This script solves a theoretical problem about the composants of a Stone-Cech remainder

    # Let X be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and x be a point in X.
    # The space in question is Y = X \ {x}.
    # We want to find the maximum number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder, R = βY \ Y.

    # Step 1: Characterize the remainder R.
    # A key theorem in continuum theory states that if K is an indecomposable continuum,
    # then for any point p in K, the remainder β(K \ {p}) \ (K \ {p}) is also an
    # indecomposable continuum. Since X is indecomposable, our remainder R is an
    # indecomposable continuum.

    # Step 2: Determine the number of composants for an indecomposable continuum.
    # The number of composants depends on whether the continuum is degenerate (a single point)
    # or non-degenerate.
    # - A degenerate indecomposable continuum has 1 composant.
    # - A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has 'c' composants, where 'c' is the
    #   cardinality of the continuum.

    # Step 3: Check if R is degenerate.
    # The remainder R is a single point if and only if the space Y = X \ {x} is pseudocompact.
    # A space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on it is bounded.

    # We can test for pseudocompactness by trying to construct an unbounded function.
    # Consider the function f(p) = 1 / d(p, x), where d is the metric on X.
    # - This function is continuous on Y = X \ {x}.
    # - As a point p in Y gets closer to x, the distance d(p, x) approaches 0.
    # - Therefore, f(p) grows without bound as p approaches x.
    # Since we found an unbounded continuous function, Y is not pseudocompact.

    # Step 4: Conclude the number of composants.
    # Because Y is not pseudocompact, the remainder R is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.
    # Therefore, R must have 'c' composants.

    # Step 5: Final Answer
    # The number of composants is always 'c' (for any non-degenerate X).
    # Thus, the maximum possible number of composants is 'c'.

    # There is no numerical equation, but we can represent the result symbolically.
    N_max = 'c'
    symbol_meaning = "the cardinality of the continuum"

    print("The maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is N_max.")
    print("The final result is given by the equation:")
    # The following line prints the "equation" as requested by the prompt.
    print(f"N_max = {N_max}")
    print(f"where '{N_max}' represents {symbol_meaning}.")
