    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the parametric curve:** I will break down the curve into its two parts based on the interval of `t`.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$. This is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5\\sin t$. This is the lower semi-ellipse with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n2.  **Determine the bounding box:** I will find the minimum and maximum values for both `x` and `y` coordinates over the entire curve.\n    *   The `x` coordinates are given by $\\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, so the range for `x` is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The `y` coordinates range from 0 to 1 in the first part and from -5 to 0 in the second part. Combining these, the total range for `y` is $[-5, 1]$.\n3.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that can contain the figure must be equal to the larger dimension of its bounding box (i.e., the maximum of its width and height).\n    *   Width of the bounding box = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   Height of the bounding box = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n    *   The side length of the square will be $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n4.  **Calculate the area:** I will square the side length to find the area of the square.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the ranges of x and y for the entire curve.\n# For x = cos(t), the range over [0, 2*pi] is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For the first part, y = sin(t) for t in [0, pi]. The range is [0, 1].\n# For the second part, y = 5*sin(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi). The range is [-5, 0].\n# The combined range for y is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\nprint(f\"The figure spans from x={x_min} to x={x_max} and from y={y_min} to y={y_max}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The total width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The total height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side length must be at least as large as both the width and the height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest square that outcircles the figure must be the maximum of its width and height, which is {side_length}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The area of this square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n<<<36>>>\n```"
