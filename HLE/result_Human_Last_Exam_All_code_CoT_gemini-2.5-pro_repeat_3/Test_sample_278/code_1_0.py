# Step 1: Define the ranges of x and y for the entire curve.
# For x = cos(t), the range over [0, 2*pi] is [-1, 1].
x_min = -1
x_max = 1

# For the first part, y = sin(t) for t in [0, pi]. The range is [0, 1].
# For the second part, y = 5*sin(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi). The range is [-5, 0].
# The combined range for y is [-5, 1].
y_min = -5
y_max = 1

print(f"The figure spans from x={x_min} to x={x_max} and from y={y_min} to y={y_max}.")

# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box.
width = x_max - x_min
height = y_max - y_min

print(f"The total width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.")
print(f"The total height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.")

# Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.
# The side length must be at least as large as both the width and the height.
side_length = max(width, height)

print(f"The side length of the smallest square that outcircles the figure must be the maximum of its width and height, which is {side_length}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.
area = side_length ** 2

print(f"The area of this square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.")
