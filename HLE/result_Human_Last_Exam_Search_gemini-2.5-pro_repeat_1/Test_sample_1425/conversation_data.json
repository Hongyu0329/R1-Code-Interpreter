    "<<<In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z is given by the trace of the operator e^(-β(H^ - μN^)), where H^ is the Hamiltonian, N^ is the particle number operator, μ is the chemical potential, and β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse temperature.\n\nThe partition function is defined as:\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(H^ - μN^))]\n\nGiven the Hamiltonian H^ = -μN^, we substitute this into the expression for Z:\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(-μN^ - μN^))]\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN^))]\nZ = Tr[e^(2βμN^)]\n\nThis expression can be represented using a functional path integral over coherent states (for bosons) or Grassmann fields (for fermions), which we will denote generically by φ(x, τ) and its conjugate φ*(x, τ). These fields are functions of position x and imaginary time τ.\n\nThe path integral representation for the grand canonical partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = ∫ D[φ*, φ] e^(-S_E)\n\nwhere D[φ*, φ] is the functional measure of integration over all possible field configurations, and S_E is the Euclidean action. The integration is over fields that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time τ with period β.\n\nThe Euclidean action S_E is formulated from the operator in the exponent of the trace, which is K^ = H^ - μN^. The general form of the action is:\n\nS_E[φ*, φ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ φ*(x, τ)∂_τφ(x, τ) + K(φ*, φ) ]\n\nwhere K(φ*, φ) is the field representation of the operator K^.\n\nFor the given system, the operator K^ is:\n\nK^ = H^ - μN^ = -μN^ - μN^ = -2μN^\n\nThe field representation of the particle number operator N^ is ∫ d³x φ*(x, τ)φ(x, τ). Therefore, the field representation of K^ is:\n\nK(φ*, φ) = -2μ ∫ d³x φ*(x, τ)φ(x, τ)\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the action, we get:\n\nS_E[φ*, φ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ φ*(x, τ)∂_τφ(x, τ) - 2μφ*(x, τ)φ(x, τ) ]\n\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out the fields:\n\nS_E[φ*, φ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ φ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)φ(x, τ) ]\n\nFinally, the partition function Z is the path integral with the negative of this action in the exponent:\n\nZ = ∫ D[φ*, φ] exp( -∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ φ*(x, τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)φ(x, τ) ] )\n\nThis is the partition function for the given system in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed as a path integral.>>>"
