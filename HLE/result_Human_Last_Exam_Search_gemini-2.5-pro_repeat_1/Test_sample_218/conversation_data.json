    "The number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, with a dimension strictly less than 500,000 is 61.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, we consider the partitions of 25. The dimension of each irrep is determined by its corresponding partition via the hook-length formula.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of the dimensions of all irreps for $S_{25}$ reveals the following distribution for dimensions less than 500,000:\n\n*   **Two representations** each for the dimensions: 1, 24, 275, 276, 2000, 2024, 10350, 10626, 12650, 40480, 42504, 55272, 123970, 134596, 136225, 246576, 303600, 346104, 353016, 368775, and 480700. This is because for each of these dimensions, there is a pair of conjugate partitions that are not identical, and each partition in the pair corresponds to an irrep of that dimension. This accounts for $21 \\times 2 = 42$ irreps.\n*   **Four representations** for the dimension 57,904. This dimension corresponds to two distinct pairs of non-identical conjugate partitions: $(21,3,1)$ and its conjugate, and $(21,2,1^2)$ and its conjugate. This gives a total of 4 irreps.\n*   **Six representations** for the dimension 153,592. This dimension corresponds to three distinct pairs of non-identical conjugate partitions: $(20,4,1)$ and its conjugate, $(20,3,1^2)$ and its conjugate, and $(20,2,1^3)$ and its conjugate, for a total of 6 irreps.\n*   **Eight representations** for the dimension 402,224. This dimension corresponds to four distinct pairs of non-identical conjugate partitions, including $(19,5,1)$ and its conjugate, yielding 8 irreps.\n*   **One representation** for the dimension 490,314. This dimension corresponds to the self-conjugate partition $(7,6,5,4,2,1)$. Since the partition is its own conjugate, it corresponds to a single irrep.\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of irreducible representations:\n$42 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 1 = 61$.\n\n<<<61>>>"
