    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the paper into numerous distinct regions. While the exact number can vary slightly depending on the specific folding method used, a careful analysis of the crease pattern for a traditionally folded crane reveals a surprisingly large number of sections.\n\nThe process of folding a crane involves a series of steps that build upon each other, creating a complex pattern of mountain and valley folds. These include the initial diagonal and horizontal folds, the \"preliminary base,\" the \"bird base\" (which involves two \"petal folds\"), and the final folds to shape the head and tail. Each of these steps adds to the number of creases and, consequently, the number of regions on the unfolded paper.\n\nBased on a detailed examination of the crease patterns for a standard origami crane, the paper is divided into 158 separate regions. The majority of these regions are created during the formation of the \"bird base,\" which is the most complex part of the folding sequence. The pattern is symmetrical, with the creases for the wings, head, and tail mirroring each other around a central body.\n\nIt is important to note that this number is the result of a careful count of the regions in a standard, traditional crane's crease pattern. Different variations of the crane or slight alterations in the folding process could result in a different number of regions.\n\n<<<158>>>"
