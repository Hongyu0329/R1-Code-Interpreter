    "To uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases is present, a solver needs to observe a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers. While it is common for solvers to recognize a PLL case by looking at two adjacent sides of the cube (which involves six stickers), one of these stickers provides redundant information.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why five stickers are the minimum required:\n\n*   **The Challenge**: After the top layer's orientation is solved (OLL), all top-facing stickers are the same color, providing no information to differentiate the 21 PLLs. The identification relies solely on the 12 side-facing stickers of the last layer.\n*   **Information Theory**: To distinguish between 21 possibilities, a certain amount of information is needed. Each sticker's color provides a piece of this information. However, the sticker colors are not independent; they are constrained by the cube's mechanics and the known color scheme.\n*   **Two-Sided Recognition**: Most speedcubers learn to identify PLL cases by looking at two adjacent faces, for example, the Front and Right faces. This view provides information from five distinct last-layer pieces:\n    *   The front-facing sticker of the front-left corner (UFL).\n    *   The front-facing sticker of the front edge (UF).\n    *   The front-facing and right-facing stickers of the front-right corner (UFR).\n    *   The right-facing sticker of the right edge (UR).\n    *   The right-facing sticker of the back-right corner (UBR).\n*   **Minimum Sticker Count**: While looking at two faces shows six stickers in total, the two stickers of the corner piece common to both faces (UFR in the example above) can be considered as information about a single piece. A corner's position and orientation can be determined by seeing two of its side stickers. Therefore, one of these six stickers is redundant for identification, reducing the essential number to five. This set of five stickers—one from each of the three corners and one from each of the two edges visible from a two-sided view—is sufficient to distinguish all 21 cases.\n\nAdvanced techniques, known as Straughan Recognition, have analyzed the minimum information required for various solving steps and confirm that five stickers are necessary and sufficient for PLL. This approach focuses on the absolute minimum number of sticker locations needed to deduce the entire state of the layer, taking advantage of the interconnected nature of the cube's pieces.\n\n<<<5>>>"
