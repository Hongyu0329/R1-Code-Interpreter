    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nThis is based on the comprehensive data compiled on the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht. For the packing of 1135 circles, the entry for the symmetry group is empty. According to the site's legend, an empty field in the symmetry group column indicates that the packing has a symmetry element of C_1. The C_1 symmetry group, in Schoenflies notation, represents asymmetry, meaning the packing has no rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
