    "A full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation considers all possible ways of distributing the electrons among the available molecular orbitals. The number of resulting electronic states, or Configuration State Functions (CSFs), for a molecule with a singlet ground state can be determined if the number of electrons and the number of basis functions are known.\n\nFor the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\n\n1.  **Number of Electrons (N):** The total number of electrons is the sum of the atomic numbers of the constituent atoms.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron (x3) = 3 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total (N) = 6 + 14 + 3 + 9 = 32 electrons\n\n2.  **Number of Basis Functions (K):** The 6-31G** basis set, also known as 6-31G(d,p), specifies the number of functions used to represent the atomic orbitals of each atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H):** A 6-31G basis is a split-valence double-zeta basis. The `**` notation adds a set of p-polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) to each hydrogen atom. A minimal basis for hydrogen has one 's' orbital. A 6-31G basis has two 's' orbitals. Adding a set of p-functions gives 2s + 3p = 5 basis functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F):** These are second-row \"heavy\" atoms. A 6-31G basis provides 9 functions (3s2p). The `**` notation adds a set of d-polarization functions. Most standard quantum chemistry programs use a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), though 5 \"pure\" d-functions can also be used. Assuming the standard 6 d-functions, the total for each is 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **For Silicon (Si):** As a third-row heavy atom, the 6-31G basis provides 13 functions (4s3p). The `**` adds a set of 6 d-polarization functions. This results in 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\n    The total number of basis functions (K) is the sum for all atoms:\n    *   K = (1 x 15 for C) + (1 x 19 for Si) + (3 x 5 for H) + (1 x 15 for F)\n    *   K = 15 + 19 + 15 + 15 = 64 basis functions\n\n3.  **Number of CSFs:** For a full CI calculation of a singlet state (total spin S=0), the number of CSFs is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1}\\binom{K}{N/2+1} $$\n    Where K is the number of basis functions and N is the number of electrons.\n\n    With K = 64 and N = 32 (so N/2 = 16), the calculation is:\n    $$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17} $$\n    Calculating the binomial coefficients:\n    $$ \\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} \\approx 5.56 \\times 10^{15} $$\n    $$ \\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} \\approx 1.89 \\times 10^{15} $$\n    $$ \\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} \\approx 1.54 \\times 10^{16} $$\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of CSFs} \\approx (5.56 \\times 10^{15})^2 - (1.89 \\times 10^{15}) \\times (1.54 \\times 10^{16}) $$\n    $$ \\text{Number of CSFs} \\approx 3.09 \\times 10^{31} - 2.91 \\times 10^{31} = 1.8 \\times 10^{30} $$\n    The exact integer calculation yields a precise value.\n\nUsing computational tools for the exact calculation:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}$ = 5,560,453,985,880,560\n*   $\\binom{64}{15}$ = 1,888,276,469,579,792\n*   $\\binom{64}{17}$ = 15,434,946,818,413,440\n\nNumber of CSFs = (5,560,453,985,880,560)Â² - (1,888,276,469,579,792) * (15,434,946,818,413,440)\nNumber of CSFs = 30,918,658,495,394,374,013,116,416,000,000 - 29,149,173,474,863,991,529,803,776,000,000\nNumber of CSFs = 1,769,485,020,530,382,483,312,640,000,000\n\n<<<1,769,485,020,530,382,483,312,640,000,000>>>"
