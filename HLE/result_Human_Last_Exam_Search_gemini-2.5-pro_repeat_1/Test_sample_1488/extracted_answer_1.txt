Based on the analysis of the provided X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, the material scanned is identified as **Corundum (α-Al₂O₃)**.

**Chemical Phase:**
*   The chemical phase is **Corundum**, a crystalline form of aluminum oxide (α-Al₂O₃). This is confirmed by comparing the peak positions in the XRD data with standard reference patterns.

**Unit Cell Structure:**
*   The material has a **trigonal** crystal structure.
*   The space group is **R-3c** (No. 167).
*   The structure is formed by a hexagonal close-packed arrangement of oxygen atoms, with aluminum cations occupying two-thirds of the octahedral sites.

**Lattice Constants:**
*   The lattice constants for the unit cell are:
    *   **a = 4.75 Å**
    *   **c = 12.982 Å**
