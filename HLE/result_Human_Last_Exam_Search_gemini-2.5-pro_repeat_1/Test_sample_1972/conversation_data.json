    "Jorge Luis Borges was not referring to a single novel with both of these descriptions, as the user's question suggests. The phrases are taken from two separate critiques about two different authors.\n\nThe novel that Borges said has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is **Brighton Rock** by the British author **Graham Greene**. This review was originally published in the Argentine magazine *El Hogar* and was later included in Borges's collection *Textos cautivos*.\n\nThe author whom Borges described as a continuator of William Faulkner is the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Borges's translation of Faulkner's novel *The Wild Palms* is considered to have \"naturalized\" Faulkner's style in the Spanish language, which in turn influenced writers like Onetti. While the exact phrase \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is widely attributed to Borges in reference to Onetti, the specific source is not readily found in his main collections of prologues. However, the intellectual link between Borges's view of Faulkner's work and Onetti's style is well-documented by literary critics.\n\nIn summary, the user's question combines a quote about Graham Greene's *Brighton Rock* with a description of Juan Carlos Onetti.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene and Juan Carlos Onetti>>>"
