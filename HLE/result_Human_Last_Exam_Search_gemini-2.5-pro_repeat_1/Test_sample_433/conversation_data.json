    "For a single-dose container ampule, once it is punctured or opened in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately. Opened single-dose ampules cannot be stored for any period of time.\n\nUnlike single-dose vials, which have a rubber stopper that can be resealed, ampules are glass containers that are broken open. This means that once an ampule is opened, it becomes an open system and cannot be hermetically sealed again.\n\nIf a single-dose *vial* is entered in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, as long as storage requirements are met. However, this extended use does not apply to ampules.\n\nTherefore, any unused portion of a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after the initial use.\n\n<<<Immediately>>>"
