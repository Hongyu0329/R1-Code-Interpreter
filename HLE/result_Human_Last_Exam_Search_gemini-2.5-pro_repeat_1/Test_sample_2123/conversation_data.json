    "The essay in question is the memoir \"The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European\" (original German title: \"Die Welt von Gestern: Erinnerungen eines Europäers\") by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. Written during his exile in the final years of his life, it was published posthumously in 1942.\n\nIn the Russian translation of the book, titled \"Вчерашний мир,\" a passage describing the boulevards of Vienna contains a creative and poetic rendering. When describing the new, bright gaslights that replaced the old, dim ones, the original German text refers to them as \"Auerlichte\" (Auer lights), after their inventor, the Austrian scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach.\n\nThe Russian translator, however, used a clever pun. Instead of a literal translation, the text describes them as \"ослепительно яркие бернсовские горелки\" (oslepitel'no yarkie bernsovskie gorelki), which means \"dazzlingly bright Burns burners.\" The adjective \"бернсовские\" (bernsovskie) is derived from the surname of the Scottish poet Robert Burns, likely chosen as a wordplay on the English word \"burn,\" fitting for a description of bright lights.\n\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is Burns.\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
