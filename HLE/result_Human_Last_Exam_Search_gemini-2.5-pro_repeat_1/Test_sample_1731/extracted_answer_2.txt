The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, as derived from the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chenoff large deviation theorems, are given by:

**Entropy (S):**
S = k Σ_s [ (n_s + g_s - 1)ln(n_s + g_s - 1) - n_s ln(n_s) - (g_s - 1)ln(g_s - 1) ]

**Mean Energy (<E>):**
<E> = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (e^(ε_s / kT) - 1)
