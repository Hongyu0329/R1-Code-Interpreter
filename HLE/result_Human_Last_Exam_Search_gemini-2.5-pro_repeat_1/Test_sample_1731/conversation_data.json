    "My initial search has provided a good foundation for understanding the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. I have learned that both are fundamental results in large deviation theory, dealing with the probabilities of rare events. Specifically, Sanov's theorem concerns the large deviations of the empirical measure of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables from the true distribution, with the rate function being the relative entropy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem deals with the large deviations of the sample mean, and its rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function. Importantly, these two theorems are closely related, and one can be derived from the other. The search results also highlight the deep connection between these theorems and statistical mechanics, where the rate function is related to entropy.\n\nHowever, I still need to find specific information on how to apply these theorems to the \"Bose case of light quanta.\" This will require me to understand the statistical properties of photons (which are bosons) and how to model their energy distribution. I need to find resources that explicitly make this connection and show how to derive the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy using the large deviation framework. My next step will be to focus my search on these specific aspects.The second search was highly successful. I found a key preprint paper by D. P. Shinde titled \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators\" which directly addresses the user's question. This paper explicitly states that it uses the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems to calculate entropies and rate functions for a Bose gas of photons. It also mentions that these calculations reproduce the results of Bose and Planck. Several other search results provide context on large deviation theory applied to Bose-Einstein statistics and condensation.\n\nI now have the necessary information to proceed. The next logical step is to synthesize the information from the Shinde paper and other related articles to derive the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy. The plan needs to be updated to reflect this direct path to the solution.\n\nI will now proceed to the next step of synthesizing the information and formulating the answer.\n\n- **Synthesize the information from the gathered resources, with a particular focus on the Shinde paper, to understand how the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems are applied to the Bose case of light quanta.**\n- **From this synthesis, extract the methodologies used to define and calculate the entropy and mean energy at equilibrium.**\n- **Finally, present the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta as the definitive answer.**The previous searches, particularly the discovery of the preprint by D. P. Shinde, have provided the core information needed to answer the user's question. I now have a direct reference that applies the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to a Bose gas of photons and explicitly discusses the calculation of entropy and mean energy. I have a clear path to formulating the final answer by synthesizing the information from this key resource. Therefore, I have sufficient information and do not need further search actions.\n\nIn the framework of large deviation theory, the equilibrium properties of a Bose gas of light quanta (photons) can be determined by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a powerful connection between probability theory and statistical mechanics, allowing for the calculation of entropy and mean energy.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy from Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, the probability of observing an empirical distribution of particles that deviates from the true underlying distribution is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy. In the context of a Bose gas, this principle can be used to find the most probable distribution of photons among different energy levels, which corresponds to the state of maximum entropy at equilibrium.\n\nFor a system of photons, which are bosons, the number of ways to distribute `n_s` photons into `g_s` states with the same energy `ε_s` is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, when applied to the spatial and energy distributions of photons, leads to the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy. At thermodynamic equilibrium, this entropy is maximized under the constraints of a fixed total number of particles and total energy. This maximization procedure, which is analogous to the standard microcanonical ensemble approach in statistical mechanics, yields the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\nThe resulting expression for the equilibrium entropy (S) of a Bose gas is:\n\n**S = k Σ_s [ (n_s + g_s - 1)ln(n_s + g_s - 1) - n_s ln(n_s) - (g_s - 1)ln(g_s - 1) ]**\n\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `n_s` is the number of photons in the energy state `ε_s`.\n*   `g_s` is the degeneracy of the energy state `ε_s`.\n\nThis formula is a direct consequence of the statistical nature of bosons as described by the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and represents the equilibrium value of entropy for the system.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy from Cramer-Chernoff Theorem\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem deals with the large deviations of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables. In the context of a photon gas, this theorem can be applied to the distribution of the total energy of the system. The theorem establishes a relationship between the probability of large fluctuations in the total energy and a rate function, which is related to the cumulant generating function (or partition function in statistical mechanics).\n\nBy applying the Cramer-Chernoff theorem to the energy distribution of photons, one can derive the equilibrium properties of the system. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the system will be in the state that minimizes the large deviation rate function for the energy. This corresponds to the most probable energy distribution. This analysis shows that the mean energy `<E>` of the photon gas at a given temperature T is given by Planck's law for black-body radiation:\n\n**<E> = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (e^(ε_s / kT) - 1)**\n\nwhere:\n*   `<E>` is the mean energy of the photon gas.\n*   `ε_s` is the energy of the s-th state.\n*   `g_s` is the degeneracy of the s-th state.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\nThis expression for the mean energy is a direct outcome of applying the principles of large deviations, as formalized by the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, to the statistical mechanics of a photon gas. In essence, the large deviation framework provides a rigorous probabilistic foundation for the well-known results of Bose-Einstein statistics and Planck's theory of black-body radiation.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, as derived from the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chenoff large deviation theorems, are given by:\n\n**Entropy (S):**\nS = k Σ_s [ (n_s + g_s - 1)ln(n_s + g_s - 1) - n_s ln(n_s) - (g_s - 1)ln(g_s - 1) ]\n\n**Mean Energy (<E>):**\n<E> = Σ_s (g_s * ε_s) / (e^(ε_s / kT) - 1)>>>"
