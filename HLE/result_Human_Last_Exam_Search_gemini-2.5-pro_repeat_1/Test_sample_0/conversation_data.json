    "Critical-level views of population ethics violate the **Non-Elitism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nArrhenius's impossibility theorems demonstrate that no single theory of population ethics (axiology) can simultaneously satisfy a set of intuitively desirable conditions. His sixth theorem uses the following five conditions:\n*   Weak Non-Sadism\n*   Weak Quality Addition\n*   Non-Elitism\n*   Egalitarian Dominance\n*   General Non-Extreme Priority\n\nAny consistent population axiology must violate at least one of these. Critical-level views are one such axiology, and they fail on the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the violation:\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** These theories propose that for a new life to add positive value to a population, that life's welfare must be above a certain positive \"critical level.\" If a life has positive welfare but is below this critical level, adding that person to the population is considered to make the world worse.\n*   **Non-Elitism Condition:** This principle states that for any high-quality life, a sufficiently large population of people with a lower (but still positive) quality of life is better. In other words, a vast quantity of \"good\" lives can outweigh a small quantity of \"excellent\" lives.\n*   **The Violation:** A critical-level view violates Non-Elitism because it will never consider a population of people with welfare below the critical level—no matter how large that population is—to be better than a population with welfare above the critical level. For example, a critical-level theorist would judge a population of one person with a very high welfare of 100 to be better than a population of a trillion people with a welfare of 5, if the critical level were 10. This is because the trillion-person population would have a large negative value (`1 trillion * (5 - 10)`), while the single-person population has a positive value. This creates an \"elitist\" outcome where high-welfare lives are always preferred, which contradicts the Non-Elitism principle.\n\nIt is worth noting that critical-level views do not violate a condition like **Weak Quality Addition**, which only requires that *there is at least one* welfare level at which adding a person is an improvement. Critical-level views satisfy this, as adding anyone with welfare above the critical level makes the population better.\n\n<<<C>>>"
