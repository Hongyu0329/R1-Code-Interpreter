    "The puzzle is a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's deduce the rule from the given examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Identify the core change:** In both `Input_A` to `Output_A` and `Input_B` to `Output_B`, a cell with the value '2' changes to '0', and a cell with the value '0' changes to '2'. This suggests the '2' is \"moving\" from its original position to a position formerly occupied by a '0'.\n\n2.  **Determine the destination:** We need to figure out which '0' the '2' moves to.\n    *   The new '2' is always in a cell that is in the 3x3 neighborhood of the original '2'.\n    *   Let's establish a search order for the 8 neighbors of the '2'. The search order must be consistent for both examples A and B. The directions are: North (N), North-East (NE), East (E), South-East (SE), South (S), South-West (SW), West (W), and North-West (NW).\n    *   Let's test the search order `NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Examples\n\n*   **Example A:**\n    *   **Input:** `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   The '2' is at position `(1,1)` (row 1, column 1, using 0-based indexing).\n    *   Its neighbors are checked in the specified order for a '0':\n        *   `NE`: `(0,2)` is '1'.\n        *   `E`: `(1,2)` is '1'.\n        *   `SE`: `(2,2)` is '1'.\n        *   `S`: `(2,1)` is '1'.\n        *   `SW`: `(2,0)` is '1'.\n        *   `W`: `(1,0)` is '1'.\n        *   `NW`: `(0,0)` is '0'. The first '0' is found.\n    *   The transformation is: the '2' at `(1,1)` becomes '0', and the '0' at `(0,0)` becomes '2'.\n    *   This results in `201111,101111,111111`, which matches `Output_A`.\n\n*   **Example B:**\n    *   **Input:** `...,1111000011110,1111002111111,...`\n    *   The '2' is at position `(3,6)`.\n    *   Its neighbors are checked for a '0':\n        *   `NE`: `(2,7)` is '0'. The first '0' is found.\n    *   The transformation is: the '2' at `(3,6)` becomes '0', and the '0' at `(2,7)` becomes '2'.\n    *   This results in `...,1111000211110,1111000111111,...`, which matches `Output_B`.\n\nThe rule is consistent and fully explains the transformations.\n\n### Solving for MISSING (Input_C)\n\nNow, we apply the established rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'` which can be seen as the grid:\n    `000000`\n    `011120`\n    `111111`\n\n1.  The '2' is located at position `(1,4)`.\n2.  The neighbors of `(1,4)` are checked for a '0' using the search order `NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW, N`:\n    *   `NE`: The neighbor at `(0,5)` contains a '0'. This is the first '0' found.\n3.  The '2' at `(1,4)` will become a '0'.\n4.  The '0' at `(0,5)` will become a '2'.\n\nApplying these changes to the grid:\n*   The second row `011120` becomes `011100`.\n*   The first row `000000` becomes `000002`.\n*   The third row `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n`000002`\n`011100`\n`111111`\n\nConcatenating these rows with commas gives the value for MISSING.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
