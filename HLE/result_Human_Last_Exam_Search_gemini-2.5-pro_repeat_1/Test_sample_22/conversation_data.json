    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) of the trait.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case:\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)** represents the proportion of variation in a trait that is attributable to the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a study. It is a theoretical ceiling for how much variance could possibly be explained if one had a perfect genetic predictor based on these SNPs.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS)** is a practical tool used to estimate an individual's genetic predisposition for a trait. It is constructed by summing the effects of many genetic variants, but the \"effect sizes\" used are *estimates* derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on a finite sample.\n\n*   **The Gap Between Theory and Practice** Because the effect sizes used to build a PGS are estimates and not the true, underlying values, they contain a degree of error. This \"noisy\" estimation means that when the PGS is applied to a new, independent set of individuals, its predictive power (variance explained) will inevitably be lower than the total SNP heritability. The accuracy of a PGS is highly dependent on the statistical power of the initial GWAS, but even with massive sample sizes, its predictive ability will only approach the SNP heritability as a limit.\n\nIn summary, SNP heritability is the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by SNPs, while a polygenic score's explained variance is the currently achieved prediction accuracy, which is limited by factors like GWAS sample size and methodological imperfections. Therefore, the predictive ability of a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nWhile some rare exceptions have been noted under specific conditions of heterogeneity between study cohorts, the foundational principle is that SNP heritability serves as the upper bound for the predictive power of a polygenic score.\n\n<<<True>>>"
