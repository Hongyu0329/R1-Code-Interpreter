    "Answering the question requires a multi-step chemoinformatic approach. The final numerical ratio cannot be determined without the use of specialized computational software, but the precise methodology is outlined below.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Major Reduction Product\n\nThe starting compound is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide. The disulfide bond (–S–S–) is readily reduced, cleaving the bond and typically adding a hydrogen atom to each sulfur. This reaction yields two identical molecules. The major reduction product is therefore **perylene-3-thiol**.\n\nThe chemical structure of perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S) is a perylene core with a thiol (–SH) group attached at the 3-position. For the calculation, it is crucial to consider the entire molecule, including all hydrogen atoms, as specified in the prompt. This results in a molecular graph with 33 vertices (20 carbon, 1 sulfur, and 12 hydrogen atoms) and their corresponding edges (covalent bonds).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Topological Indices\n\n**Wiener Index (W):**\nThe Wiener index is one of the oldest topological indices and is defined as the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all non-ordered pairs of vertices in the molecular graph. It is a measure of the compactness of a molecule. For a graph G, it is calculated as:\n*W(G) = ½ Σ<sub>u,v ∈ V(G)</sub> d(u,v)*\nwhere *d(u,v)* is the shortest path distance between vertices *u* and *v*.\n\n**Szeged Index (Sz):**\nThe Szeged index is a distance-based topological index that is particularly useful for cyclic systems. For a given edge *e = (u,v)* in a graph G, two sets of vertices are defined:\n*   *n<sub>u</sub>(e)*: The set of vertices closer to vertex *u* than to vertex *v*.\n*   *n<sub>v</sub>(e)*: The set of vertices closer to vertex *v* than to vertex *u*.\n\nThe Szeged index is the sum of the products of the sizes of these sets over all edges in the graph:\n*Sz(G) = Σ<sub>e=(u,v) ∈ E(G)</sub> |*n<sub>u</sub>(e)*| × |*n<sub>v</sub>(e)*|*\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Indices and the Ratio\n\nCalculating these indices by hand for a complex graph with 33 vertices like perylene-3-thiol is impractical and highly prone to error. The calculation requires specialized computational software that can:\n1.  Generate the molecular graph from a chemical identifier (like its SMILES string: `C1=CC2=C3C(=C1)C4=C5C(=CC=C4)C(=CC=C5C3=CC=C2)S`).\n2.  Explicitly include all hydrogen atoms in the graph.\n3.  Compute the all-pairs shortest path matrix to find the Wiener Index.\n4.  Compute the per-edge vertex partitions to find the Szeged Index.\n\nTools capable of these calculations include:\n*   **Wolfram Language:** It has specific functions `WienerIndex` and `SzegedIndex` that can operate on chemical structures and include an option to account for all hydrogens (`IncludeHydrogens -> All`).\n*   **Cheminformatics Toolkits:** Software packages like Chemaxon's `cxcalc` or other similar platforms can compute a wide range of topological descriptors from molecular structures.\n\nWithout access to execute these computational tools, the exact numerical values for the Szeged and Wiener indices for perylene-3-thiol (including hydrogens) cannot be provided. The final step is to compute the ratio from these values:\n\n**Ratio = Szeged Index / Wiener Index**\n\nThis ratio provides a comparative measure of the molecule's topological properties, and its calculation is contingent on the computational results from the appropriate software."
