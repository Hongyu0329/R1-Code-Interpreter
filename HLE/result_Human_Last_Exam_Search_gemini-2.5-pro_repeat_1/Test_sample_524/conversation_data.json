    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA continuum is a compact and connected metric space. A space is homogeneous if, for any two points in the space, there is a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. In the context of the plane, there are both degenerate and non-degenerate homogeneous continua.\n\nThe degenerate case is a single **point**.\n\nFor non-degenerate continua (those with more than one point), a complete classification was achieved in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen. This work demonstrated that there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes:\n\n*   **The circle:** This is the only non-degenerate locally connected homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a one-dimensional, chainable, and indecomposable continuum. It is notable for not containing any arcs.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is a continuum that can be thought of as a \"circle\" where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nTherefore, including the degenerate case, there are a total of four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
