The displacement field $\vec{D}$ through the transistor is given by the vector sum of the displacement fields from the top and bottom gates. Defining the direction from the bottom gate to the top gate as the positive z-direction, the displacement field is expressed as: $\vec{D} = (C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg})\hat{z}$.
