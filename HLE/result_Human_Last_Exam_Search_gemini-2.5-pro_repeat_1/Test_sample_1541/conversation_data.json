To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency, we should avoid storing the entire input string. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can process the input character by character and simply count the occurrences of each number. This method, known as counting sort, is ideal for this scenario.\n\nAfter counting, we can print the numbers in non-decreasing order, adding the \"+\" symbol between them. The program below uses `getchar()` to read one character at a time, uses a small array to store the counts of the numbers, and then prints the formatted result. It is optimized to use the smallest possible data types for its variables to minimize memory consumption.\n\n### The C Program\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) as a string,\n * sorts the numbers in non-decreasing order, and prints the new sum.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by not storing the\n * entire input string and using minimal-size variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Use `short` for counts. Max string length 1000 -> max ~501 numbers.\n    // An unsigned char (0-255) is too small, but short (-32768 to 32767) is sufficient.\n    short counts[4] = {0}; // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n\n    int c; // Use int for getchar() to correctly handle EOF.\n    \n    // Read input character by character and count the numbers.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Flag to handle printing '+' symbols correctly.\n    // `char` is the smallest addressable memory unit (1 byte).\n    char first = 1;\n    \n    // Loop counters. `i` only goes up to 3, so `char` is sufficient.\n    // `j` can go up to ~500, so `short` is required.\n    char i;\n    short j;\n\n    // Print the sorted sum.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            if (!first) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar(i + '1'); // Convert number back to character and print.\n            first = 0; // After the first number, the flag is set to 0.\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all variables declared in the `main` function. The sizes are based on typical values on modern 32-bit and 64-bit systems.\n\n*   **`short counts[4]`**: An array of 4 `short` integers.\n    *   `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes.\n    *   Memory = `4 * 2 bytes` = 8 bytes.\n*   **`int c`**: A variable to store the return value of `getchar()`. It must be an `int` to hold any possible character value as well as the special `EOF` (End Of File) marker.\n    *   `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = 4 bytes.\n*   **`char first`**: A flag variable to manage the printing of the `+` symbol.\n    *   `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 1 byte.\n*   **`char i`**: The loop counter for the outer loop, which iterates from 0 to 3. A `char` is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int`.\n    *   `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = 1 byte.\n*   **`short j`**: The loop counter for the inner loop. The count of a number can be up to ~500, which fits within a `short` but not a `char`.\n    *   `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes.\n    *   Memory = 2 bytes.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `first`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `j`)\nm = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **16 bytes**\n\n<<<16>>>"
