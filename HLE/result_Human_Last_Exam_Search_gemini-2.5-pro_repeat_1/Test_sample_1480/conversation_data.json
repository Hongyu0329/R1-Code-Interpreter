    "The calculation of the rule activation level in a fuzzy system involves applying a t-norm operation to combine the firing strengths of the antecedent parts of a rule. In the context of an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, this process becomes more complex due to the higher-order uncertainty it is designed to handle. However, the fundamental operation often boils down to a t-norm applied at various levels.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7**: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent of the k-th rule.\n*   **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**: This is the membership degree of the output variable in the consequent part of the rule.\n\nThe \"rule activation level\" typically refers to the result of the fuzzy implication, which combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function. This is calculated using a t-norm. A t-norm is a function that models the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic.\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided, we can calculate the result using the two most common t-norms: the Minimum t-norm and the Product t-norm.\n\n### Using the Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm)\n\nThe minimum t-norm is defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\nApplying this to the given values:\n`min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n### Using the Product t-norm\n\nThe product t-norm is defined as `T(a, b) = a * b`.\nApplying this to the given values:\n`0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nIn an interval type-3 fuzzy system, operations are performed on intervals rather than single crisp numbers to handle the higher degree of uncertainty. The provided values would likely represent a specific point or a bound (upper or lower) of a fuzzy set within the complex structure of a type-3 membership function. The activation level would itself be an interval or a more complex fuzzy set. However, without further information on the specific structure (like the α-cuts or the lower/upper bounds of the intervals), the calculation is demonstrated with the provided crisp values as a direct application of the t-norm operation.\n\nTherefore, depending on the t-norm used, the rule activation level is:\n*   **0.7** if using the Minimum t-norm.\n*   **0.63** if using the Product t-norm.\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the Minimum t-norm and 0.63 when using the Product t-norm.>>>"
