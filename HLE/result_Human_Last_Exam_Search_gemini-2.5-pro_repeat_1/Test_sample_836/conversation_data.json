    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear community, particularly in the context of neutron scattering.\n\nThis is often denoted as S(q,ω) or S(k,ω), where:\n*   **q** or **k** represents the wave vector (the Fourier variable corresponding to space).\n*   **ω** represents the angular frequency (the Fourier variable corresponding to time).\n\nThe time-dependent pair correlation function, G(r,t), gives the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform, the dynamic structure factor, provides information about the collective dynamics and correlations within the system as a function of momentum and energy transfer.\n\nIn the context of nuclear engineering and physics, the dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity for understanding how neutrons scatter inelastically from materials. This information is essential for calculating thermal scattering cross-sections, which are important for nuclear reactor design and criticality safety analyses.\n\nWhile the field of nuclear criticality is broad, the terminology for this fundamental relationship is largely adopted from the well-established field of neutron scattering and condensed matter physics.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
