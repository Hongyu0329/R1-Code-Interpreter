The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations that makes the given differential equation invariant is generated by the infinitesimals `τ = c_1`, `ξ = c_2`, and `φ = 0`, where `c_1` and `c_2` are arbitrary constants.

The general representation for the transformations on `x` is given by:

`x' = x + a`

where `a` is a constant. This represents a simple spatial translation.
