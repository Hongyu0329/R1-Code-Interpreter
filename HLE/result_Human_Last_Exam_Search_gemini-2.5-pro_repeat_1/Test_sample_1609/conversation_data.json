    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2^(n-1). A prime implicant is a product term that cannot be simplified further by combining with other terms.\n\nFor a Boolean function of 4 variables (n=4), the maximal number of prime implicants is calculated as follows:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nThis can be visualized using a Karnaugh map for 4 variables, where an arrangement of minterms can be made such that a maximum of 8 prime implicants are formed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
