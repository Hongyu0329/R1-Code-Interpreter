    "Based on an analysis of the sequence, a recurring pattern appears to be the presence of palindromic triplets in the form of (x, y, x). Three such triplets can be identified:\n\n*   (111, 142, 111)\n*   (49, 155, 49)\n*   (124, 36, 124)\n\nThe numbers that immediately follow the first two of these triplets are 41 and 62, respectively. The provided sequence ends with the completion of the third triplet, (124, 36, 124).\n\nTo determine the next number in the sequence, we can examine the sequence formed by the numbers that follow these triplets: 41, 62, ...\n\nAssuming this secondary sequence follows an arithmetic progression, we can calculate the difference between the first two terms:\n\n62 - 41 = 21\n\nIf this difference remains constant, the next term would be:\n\n62 + 21 = 83\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is likely 83.\n\n<<<83>>>"
