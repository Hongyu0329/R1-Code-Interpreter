    "An upper semilattice, denoted as $J$, is a partially ordered set where every non-empty finite subset has a least upper bound, or join. A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is considered \"tame\" if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite sub-poset of $J$. More formally, a functor is tame if it is a left Kan extension of a functor from a finite poset.\n\nIn the context of homological algebra, a functor is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. A projective resolution of a functor $f$ is an exact sequence of projective functors that terminates with a map onto $f$. The length of the shortest such resolution is the functor's projective dimension.\n\nFor a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of such functors possesses well-defined homological properties. It is an abelian category where every object has a minimal free (and thus projective) resolution. Research into the homological properties of such functors reveals that the minimal projective resolutions of their homologies have a length of at most 1. This property, where the kernels of surjective maps from projective objects are themselves projective, is the definition of having a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
