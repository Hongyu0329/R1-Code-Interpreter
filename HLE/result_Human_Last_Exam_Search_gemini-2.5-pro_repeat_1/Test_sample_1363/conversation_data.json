    "In the European Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the fundamental techniques of the dance.\n\nThe core technique of the European Tango is distinct from the other dances listed. It is a flat-footed dance with no rise and fall, no swing, and no sway. Turns are executed with sharp, staccato movements and precise foot placements. A reverse turn in Tango involves specific actions like Contra Body Movement (CBM) and controlled rotation to achieve a defined amount of turn.\n\nTo \"overturn\" a turn, as the term is used in swing dances like the Waltzes and Foxtrot, implies using momentum, swing, and sway to rotate more than the standard amount for a figure. These elements are fundamentally absent in Tango. Attempting to overturn a Tango reverse turn would require introducing swing and sway, which violates the core staccato and flat character of the dance. One instructional source notes that if a leader overturns a specific step in a reverse turn, it creates a completely different figure (a Fallaway) rather than simply being an overturned version of the original.\n\nIn contrast:\n*   **Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep** are all swing dances. While they have different characteristics, their techniques incorporate elements like momentum, swing, and sway, which make overturning a turn technically possible, even if it is a variation or a choreographed amendment to a standard figure. In fact, overturned figures are explicitly named and used in choreography for these dances, such as the \"Overturned Spin Turn\" in the Waltz.\n\nTherefore, due to its unique technical foundation that excludes swing and sway, the European Tango is the dance in which a reverse turn cannot be overturned without abandoning its essential technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
