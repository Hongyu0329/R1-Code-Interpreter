    "The provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nA search for this sequence reveals that these are four-digit numbers divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. This means the number must be even, and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's verify this for a few numbers in the sequence:\n*   **1014**: It is an even number. The sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6, which is divisible by 3.\n*   **1020**: It is an even number. The sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 3, which is divisible by 3.\n*   **2352**: It is an even number. The sum of its digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12, which is divisible by 3.\n\nThe sequence appears to be a list of these numbers, but it is not a simple arithmetic progression, as some numbers divisible by 6 are missing (e.g., 1002, 1008, 1026 are missing between 1020 and 1032).\n\nWithout a clear rule for which multiples of 6 are included, it's impossible to definitively determine the next number. However, if the intention is to simply provide the next number divisible by 6 after the last term in the sequence, the process is as follows:\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The next multiple of 6 would be 2352 + 6 = 2358.\n\nLet's check if 2358 is divisible by 6:\n*   It is an even number.\n*   The sum of its digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence, assuming it follows the pattern of being a multiple of 6, is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
