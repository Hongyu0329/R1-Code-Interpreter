    "This is a highly technical question from arithmetic geometry. The \"thickness of a double point\" refers to a specific invariant of the stable reduction of an algebraic curve over a p-adic field. The stable reduction is, in essence, the \"best possible\" version of the curve's special fiber, which is the curve reduced modulo a prime number (in this case, 2).\n\nThe curve in question is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The process of finding its stable model and the thickness of any resulting double points can be quite involved, often requiring a sequence of transformations known as blow-ups and the analysis of the valuations of the roots of the defining polynomial.\n\nA detailed analysis of this specific curve, $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$, can be found in recent literature on the subject. The analysis proceeds by first changing coordinates to study the curve \"at infinity\". The relevant model becomes a singular plane curve, and the resolution of this singularity reveals the structure of the stable reduction. This process shows that the stable reduction has a double point, and its thickness is determined by the valuation of the parameters in the transformed equations.\n\nAccording to research in this area, for the curve $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$, the stable reduction has a double point whose thickness with respect to the 2-adic valuation normalized by $v(2)=1$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
