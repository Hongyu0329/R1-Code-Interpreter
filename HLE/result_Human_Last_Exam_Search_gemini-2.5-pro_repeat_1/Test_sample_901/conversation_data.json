    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered base, which favors elimination reactions.\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and the hydrogen being removed must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement, meaning they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring.\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a trans-disubstituted cyclohexane. It exists in two chair conformations: one where both the bromo and methyl groups are in equatorial positions, and another, less stable conformation where both groups are in axial positions.\n\nThe E2 elimination must proceed through the conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. In this di-axial conformation, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon (C2) is also axial. The hydrogen atom on C2 is therefore in an equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (the Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene) is not possible.\n\nHowever, the adjacent carbon C6 has an axial hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine atom. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, can abstract this accessible axial proton. This allows for the elimination to proceed, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nTherefore, the product formed is the less substituted alkene, which is known as the Hofmann product.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
