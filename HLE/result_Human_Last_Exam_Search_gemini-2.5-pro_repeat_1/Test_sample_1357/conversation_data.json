    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there are 7 types of stable reductions for the curve.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following facts from algebraic geometry:\n1.  **Good Reduction of the Jacobian Implies Stable Reduction of the Curve:** A fundamental result by Deligne and Mumford states that if the Jacobian variety of a curve has good reduction, then the curve itself must have a stable reduction.\n2.  **Structure of the Stable Fiber:** For the Jacobian to have good reduction (meaning its special fiber is an abelian variety), the toric part of the Jacobian of the stable fiber of the curve must be trivial. This constrains the dual graph of the stable reduction to be a tree (i.e., it can have no cycles). Such curves are sometimes called \"of compact type\".\n3.  **Genus Calculation:** When the dual graph of a stable curve is a tree, its arithmetic genus is simply the sum of the geometric genera of its irreducible components. Since the original curve has genus 4, the sum of the genera of the components of its stable reduction must also be 4.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to a combinatorial enumeration of the possible structures of the stable fiber. These structures are determined by the partitions of the integer 4 into positive integers (representing the genera of the components) and the possible tree-like configurations for these components.\n\nThe possible types of stable reduction are as follows:\n\n*   **One Component:** This corresponds to the partition `4`.\n    1.  An irreducible smooth curve of genus 4. This is the case where the curve itself has good reduction.\n\n*   **Two Components:** The dual graph is a simple line segment. The genera of the components must sum to 4.\n    2.  **Partition 3+1:** One component of genus 3 and one component of genus 1 (an elliptic curve), connected at a single node.\n    3.  **Partition 2+2:** Two components of genus 2, connected at a single node.\n\n*   **Three Components:** The dual graph is a path of length two. The genera of the components must sum to 4.\n    4.  **Partition 2+1+1:** One component of genus 2 and two elliptic components. There are two distinct configurations for assigning the genera to the vertices of the path graph:\n        *   An elliptic curve, a genus 2 curve, and an elliptic curve connected in a line (`g=1 — g=2 — g=1`).\n        *   A genus 2 curve connected to two elliptic curves in a line (`g=2 — g=1 — g=1`).\n\n*   **Four Components:** The dual graph is a tree with four vertices. There are two non-isomorphic trees on four vertices: a path graph and a star graph. The only partition of 4 into four positive integers is `1+1+1+1`.\n    6.  Four elliptic curves connected in a line (a path graph).\n    7.  One central elliptic curve connected to three other elliptic curves (a star graph).\n\nIn total, this gives 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 distinct types of stable reductions.\n\n<<<7>>>"
