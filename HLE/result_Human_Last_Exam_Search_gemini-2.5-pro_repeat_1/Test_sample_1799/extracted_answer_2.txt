Whether the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous is a nuanced question with no simple "yes" or "no" answer.

**In the standard, historical formulation of special relativity, the second postulate is not superfluous; it is a crucial and independent assumption.** The first postulate, the principle of relativity, states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. However, this postulate alone is also consistent with Galilean relativity, which assumes absolute time and does not feature a constant speed of light. It is the second postulate—that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers—that forces a departure from classical physics and leads to the unique predictions of special relativity, such as the Lorentz transformations.

**However, from a different perspective, the second postulate can be seen as a consequence of the first.** If one considers Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism to be among the "laws of physics" referred to in the first postulate, then the constancy of the speed of light can be derived. Maxwell's equations predict a specific speed for electromagnetic waves (light) in a vacuum. For these laws to be the same in all inertial frames, the speed of light must also be the same for all inertial observers.

Furthermore, it can be shown from the principle of relativity, along with assumptions about the homogeneity and isotropy of space, that the only possible transformations between inertial frames are the Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian transformations. In this context, the second postulate serves to select the Lorentzian case and identify the invariant speed as the speed of light. Some physicists have even developed formulations of relativity based on a single postulate.

In summary, while the two-postulate foundation is the traditional and clearest way to introduce special relativity, it is a valid viewpoint to consider the second postulate as being deeply embedded within, and derivable from, a full application of the first postulate to all known laws of physics, particularly electromagnetism.
