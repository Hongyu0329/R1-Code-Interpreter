The function `f` and the formula `C` are defined as follows.

First, define a base formula `A` using only the allowed connectives and constants:
$$
A = (1 \multimap \bot) \multimap 1
$$

The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the `w`-fold tensor product of `A`:
$$
f(w) = \underbrace{A \otimes A \otimes \dots \otimes A}_{w \text{ times}}
$$
(with `f(0) = 1`).

The formula `C = C(W, m, b)` is constructed as an `m`-fold tensor product of a formula `B`, where `B` itself is the `b`-fold tensor product of `A`:
$$
C(W, m, b) = \underbrace{(\overbrace{A \otimes \dots \otimes A}^{b \text{ times}}) \otimes \dots \otimes (\overbrace{A \otimes \dots \otimes A}^{b \text{ times}})}_{m \text{ times}}
$$
