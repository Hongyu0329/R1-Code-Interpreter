    "## Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets: Prospects for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) only if they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.** This critical requirement dictates whether a material can exhibit second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC, a quantum process where one photon splits into two entangled photons of lower energy. The likelihood of observing SPDC in boron nanosheets, therefore, depends on the specific type of nanosheet and its atomic arrangement.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is governed by the material's second-order susceptibility, denoted as χ(2). A material must have a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice for χ(2) to be non-zero. This means that the crystal structure must not have a point of inversion symmetry.\n\nWhen considering free-standing boron nanosheets, it is crucial to distinguish between two main types: borophene (sheets of pure boron) and boron nitride nanosheets (composed of boron and nitrogen atoms).\n\n### Borophene\n\nBorophene, the two-dimensional allotrope of boron, can exist in various crystalline phases, some of which are predicted to be non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical studies have indicated that certain borophene structures should exhibit a significant second-order nonlinear optical response, a prerequisite for SPDC. However, producing large, free-standing, and stable borophene sheets remains a significant experimental challenge. Most synthesis methods require a substrate, which can influence the crystal structure.\n\n### Boron Nitride Nanosheets\n\nThe case of boron nitride (BN) nanosheets is more nuanced and depends on the stacking of the atomic layers.\n\n*   **Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN):** A single monolayer of h-BN has a non-centrosymmetric structure and can exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), another second-order nonlinear effect. However, in its most common bulk form, h-BN typically has a centrosymmetric stacking arrangement (AA' stacking), which causes the second-order nonlinearity to be canceled out in even-layered and bulk structures. Therefore, free-standing multilayer h-BN nanosheets would generally not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n*   **Rhombohedral Boron Nitride (r-BN):** In contrast, rhombohedral boron nitride, a different polymorph of BN, possesses a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure regardless of the number of layers. Recently, rhombohedral boron nitride has been successfully used as a source for polarization-entangled photon pairs via SPDC. This makes free-standing r-BN nanosheets a promising candidate for SPDC.\n\nFurthermore, introducing defects, doping, or creating hybrid structures like boron-carbon-nitride (BCN) nanosheets can break the inversion symmetry of the material and potentially induce or enhance second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n\nIn conclusion, while not all forms of free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, specific types, particularly those with an inherent non-centrosymmetric crystal structure like monolayer borophene and rhombohedral boron nitride, are indeed expected to display this quantum optical phenomenon. The ability to engineer the crystal structure and enhance the nonlinear optical properties of these materials opens up possibilities for their use in developing ultrathin quantum light sources.\n\n<<<Based on the analysis of its material properties, it is plausible that free-standing boron nanosheets could exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
