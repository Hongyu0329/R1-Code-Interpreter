    "Based on established principles of coiled-coil design and published research, primarily from the Woolfson group which designed these specific sequences, the oligomeric states can be determined as follows:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This peptide, known as CCTK-P3, is designed to be a **trimer**. Its heptad repeat core positions contain a mixture of `(I,A)` pairs, which are weakly dimeric, and a single `(I,W)` pair. The potent influence of the tryptophan (W) at a core 'd' position drives the assembly to a trimeric state.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This peptide, often referred to as P_DI, is a classic **dimer**. Its design is based on the canonical `a=I, d=L` (Isoleucine at position 'a', Leucine at position 'd') motif in the heptad repeat, which robustly specifies a parallel dimeric coiled-coil.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This peptide, known as P_TI, is a **trimer**. It is designed with isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' core positions (`a=I, d=I`), a pairing that is a well-established motif for forming trimers.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This peptide is a variant designed to be a **trimer**. While its sequence does not follow the simple hydrophobic core rules, it utilizes specific interactions, including those from glutamine (Q) and a stabilizing tryptophan (W), to favor a trimeric assembly.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This peptide, CCTK-P4, was designed as a **tetramer**. The design places isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and the polar, beta-branched amino acid threonine (T) at the 'd' position. The `(I,T)` pairing is a known motif for specifying a tetrameric state, which is further reinforced by a tryptophan in one of the repeats.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of oligomeric states for the given protein sequences is 3, 2, 3, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<E>>>"
