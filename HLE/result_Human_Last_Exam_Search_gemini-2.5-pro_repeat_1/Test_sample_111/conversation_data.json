    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, Geoffrey Chaucer was in England, serving as an esquire in the royal court of King Edward III.\n\nSeveral key facts place Chaucer in England during this period:\n*   **Royal Service:** In 1367, Chaucer began receiving a life pension as a yeoman of the king and by 1368 was listed among the king's esquires, positions that required his presence at the English court.\n*   **The Book of the Duchess:** Following Blanche's death, Chaucer wrote his first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" as an elegy for her. It is widely believed that the poem was written at the request of Chaucer's patron, John of Gaunt, to commemorate his late wife. This literary work, composed in Middle English, strongly ties Chaucer to the events of the English court at that time.\n*   **Travel Records:** While Chaucer undertook numerous diplomatic missions to continental Europe, his first recorded journey to Italy was not until 1372. In 1368, he was noted as being abroad on a mission, but his primary location and service were based in England.\n\nGiven his role in the royal household and the creation of \"The Book of the Duchess\" as a memorial for Blanche, it is clear he was in England when she passed away.\n\n<<<C>>>"
