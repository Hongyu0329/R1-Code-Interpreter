    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field can be interpreted in two ways, depending on the expansion convention. The spectral action functional `S` has an asymptotic expansion for a large cutoff scale `Λ`:\n\n`S = Tr(f(D^2/Λ^2)) ∼ a_0 f_2 Λ^4 + a_2 f_1 Λ^2 + a_4 f_0 Λ^0 + ...`\n\nwhere `D` is the gauged Dirac operator, `f` is a test function, and `f_k` are its moments. The coefficients `a_{2n}` are the integrated Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the operator `D^2`. In an alternative notation, the heat kernel trace has the expansion:\n\n`Tr(e^{-tD^2}) ∼ (4πt)^{-2} [ a_0(x) + a_1(x) t + a_2(x) t^2 + O(t^3) ]`\n\nHere, `a_0 = \\int a_0(x) d^4x`, `a_2 = \\int a_1(x) d^4x`, and `a_4 = \\int a_2(x) d^4x`. The \"second coefficient\" can refer to `a_2` (the `Λ^2` term) or `a_4` (the `Λ^0` term), which is the second non-vanishing coefficient after the leading cosmological constant term. The `a_4` coefficient is particularly significant as it contains the Yang-Mills action for the gauge field. We will provide the local density for this coefficient, `a_2(x)`.\n\nThe square of the gauged Dirac operator `D` on a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be written as a generalized Laplace operator `D^2 = -g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu - E`, where `∇` is the covariant derivative including the spin connection and the gauge connection, and `E` is an endomorphism term. Using the Lichnerowicz formula, one finds `E = \\frac{1}{4}R - \\frac{1}{4}[\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu]F_{\\mu\\nu}`, where `R` is the scalar curvature and `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength.\n\nThe local Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2(x)` for a general operator of this form is given by a standard, albeit complex, formula involving the curvature of the manifold and the connection, as well as the endomorphism `E`. The trace of this local coefficient over the fiber (spinor and gauge spaces) determines the action density.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field (with field strength `F_{\\mu\\nu}`) in a representation `V` of the gauge group, the trace of the local `a_2` coefficient is given by:\n\n`tr_{S \\otimes V}(a_2(x)) = N \\left( \\frac{1}{180}C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}C^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{180}E_4 + \\frac{1}{72}R^2 \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_V(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the dimension of the gauge group representation `V`.\n*   `C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Weyl curvature tensor.\n*   `E_4 = R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - 4R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + R^2` is the integrand of the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant.\n*   `R` is the Ricci scalar.\n*   `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the field strength of the gauge connection.\n*   `\\text{tr}_V` denotes the trace over the gauge group representation space.\n\nThe conventions for the precise coefficients of the purely gravitational terms can vary in the literature. However, the coefficient of the gauge field strength term is a robust result. This term gives rise to the Yang-Mills action functional.\n\nThe second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion is thus composed of purely gravitational terms and a term for the gauge field. The expression for the trace of the local coefficient `a_2(x)` is:\n`N \\left( \\frac{1}{180}C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}C^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{180}(R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - 4R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + R^2) + \\frac{1}{72}R^2 \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_V(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`\n\n<<<N \\left( \\frac{1}{180}C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}C^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - \\frac{1}{180}(R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - 4R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + R^2) + \\frac{1}{72}R^2 \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_V(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})>>>"
