    "To calculate the state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of A + BF are at -1 ± j, we will follow the pole placement method.\n\nGiven the system matrices:\nA = [[-1, 1],]\nB = [,]\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: -1 + j and -1 - j. The desired characteristic polynomial is formed as follows:\n(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j) = (s + 1)² - (j)² = s² + 2s + 1 + 1 = s² + 2s + 2\n\nThe state feedback law is given by u = -Fx, where F is the feedback gain matrix. For a multi-input system, the solution for F is generally not unique. Let's define F as:\nF = [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]]\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF.\nBF = [,] * [[f₁₁, f₁₂], [f₂₁, f₂₂]] = [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [f₁₁, f₁₂]]\nA + BF = [[-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁, 1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂], [1 + f₁₁, f₁₂]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is given by det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0.\ndet(sI - (A + BF)) = s² - trace(A + BF)s + det(A + BF)\n\nThe trace and determinant of A + BF are:\ntrace(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) + f₁₂ = f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1\ndet(A + BF) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁)(f₁₂) - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)(1 + f₁₁)\n            = -f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - (1 + f₁₁ + f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂)\n            = -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ - 2f₂₂\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial is:\ns² - (f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1)s + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ - 2f₂₂) = 0\ns² + (1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁)s + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ - 2f₂₂) = 0\n\nWe now equate the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired characteristic polynomial, s² + 2s + 2.\n1.  Coefficient of s: 1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁ = 2  =>  -f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁ = 1\n2.  Constant term: -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ - 2f₂₂ = 2 => -f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ - 2f₂₂ = 3\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns, which confirms that the solution is not unique. We can simplify the problem by setting some of the elements of F to zero. Let's assume we only use the first input, which means the second row of F is zero (f₂₁ = 0 and f₂₂ = 0).\n\nThe equations become:\n1.  -f₁₁ - f₁₂ = 1\n2.  -f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ = 3\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n(-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂) - (-f₁₁ - f₁₂) = 3 - 1\n-f₁₂ = 2\nf₁₂ = -2\n\nSubstituting f₁₂ = -2 into the first equation:\n-f₁₁ - (-2) = 1\n-f₁₁ + 2 = 1\nf₁₁ = 1\n\nThus, a possible state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = [[1, -2],]\n\nTo verify, let's calculate the eigenvalues of A + BF with this F:\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\n         = [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\n         = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\n\nThe characteristic equation is det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0:\ndet([[s, 1], [-2, s + 2]]) = s(s + 2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2 = 0\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are:\ns = [-2 ± sqrt(2² - 4*1*2)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [-2 ± 2j] / 2 = -1 ± j.\nThe resulting eigenvalues match the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
