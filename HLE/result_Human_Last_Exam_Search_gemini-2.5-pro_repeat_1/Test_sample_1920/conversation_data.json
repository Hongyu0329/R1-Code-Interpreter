    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$. In this decomposition, each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial primitive character with conductor $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character).\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\nLet $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. The condition is $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. This implies that each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, its order $k_i$ must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 4. Counting Characters for Each Prime\nThe number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nLet's check this condition for each prime factor of $d$:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6.\n*   For $p_2 = 13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12.\n*   For $p_3 = 19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. The orders 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18.\n*   For $p_4 = 31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. The orders 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30.\n\nFor each of the four primes, we can have characters of order 2, 3, or 6. The number of characters for each order is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four components $\\chi_i$, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices of characters whose order is a divisor of 6 (and greater than 1).\n\n### 5. Combinatorial Calculation\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that the least common multiple of their orders is exactly 6. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. The condition $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$ requires that:\n1.  At least one order $k_i$ is a multiple of 2.\n2.  At least one order $k_j$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nThe total number of ways to choose one character for each of the four primes from the set of characters with orders in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we subtract the combinations that do not satisfy the lcm condition:\n*   **Case 1: The lcm is not a multiple of 2.**\n    This occurs if all character orders are odd. The only available odd order is 3. For each of the four primes, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n*   **Case 2: The lcm is not a multiple of 3.**\n    This occurs if no character order is a multiple of 3. The only available order is 2. For each of the four primes, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n\nThe set of combinations where the lcm is not a multiple of 2 and the set where it is not a multiple of 3 are disjoint (as an order cannot be simultaneously only divisible by primes dividing 3 and only divisible by primes dividing 2). Therefore, the total number of invalid combinations is the sum of the numbers from these two cases.\n\nNumber of invalid combinations = $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of valid combinations is the total number of combinations minus the number of invalid ones:\nNumber of primitive characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
