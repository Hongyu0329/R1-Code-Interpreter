    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its faces, that face becomes the horizontal base. An icosahedron has 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. A key symmetrical property of the icosahedron is that for any given face, there is another face on the opposite side that is parallel to it.\n\nBecause the icosahedron is a symmetrical polyhedron, the plane that divides it into two equal volumes is a horizontal plane located exactly at its mid-height (midway between the top and bottom faces). When the tank is half-filled with water, the water level will reach this midway plane.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is therefore the cross-section of the icosahedron at this mid-height. When an icosahedron is oriented on one of its faces, the cross-section at its midpoint is a regular hexagon. This hexagonal shape is formed by the plane cutting through six of the icosahedron's edges.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
