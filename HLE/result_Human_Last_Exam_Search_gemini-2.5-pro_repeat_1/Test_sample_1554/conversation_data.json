    "The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposed the notion of a sign into symptoms and signals was Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\nIn his work on semiotics, Ajdukiewicz distinguished between different types of signs based on their relationship with what they signify. He identified \"symptoms\" (or \"indications\") as signs that have a natural, causal connection to what they represent. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n\nOn the other hand, \"signals\" are signs that are created intentionally to convey a specific meaning, based on a convention or agreement. An example of a signal would be a traffic light, where the colors are used to direct the flow of traffic by convention.\n\nTherefore, Ajdukiewicz's analysis breaks down the general concept of a sign (often referred to as a \"hallmark\" in a broader sense) into these distinct categories based on their intentionality and the nature of their connection to the object or state of affairs they point to.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
