The approximate number of non-Clifford gates required to run a simulation of the implementation of a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-3 code and a faulty gate error rate of at most 1% is on the order of **1 to 10**. For implementing a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-5 code under the same conditions, the number of non-Clifford gates could be in the range of **thousands to tens of thousands**.
