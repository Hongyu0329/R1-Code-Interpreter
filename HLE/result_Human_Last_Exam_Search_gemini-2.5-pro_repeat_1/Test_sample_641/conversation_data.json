    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) can be determined by identifying the conjugacy classes of involutions and calculating their sizes.\n\nAn involution in a group is an element `g` such that `g^2` is the identity and `g` is not the identity. The involutions in PSU(4, q) are the images of the involutions in the special unitary group SU(4, q), excluding those that become the identity in the projective group.\n\nThe involutions in SU(n, q) have determinant 1. An involution is diagonalizable with eigenvalues +1 and -1. For the determinant to be 1, the number of -1 eigenvalues (the dimension of the -1 eigenspace, denoted by `k`) must be even. For SU(4, q), `k` can be 2 or 4.\n\n1.  **Involution of type `t_4`**: This corresponds to `k=4`, where the involution is the matrix `-I`. For this to be in the center of SU(4, q), we require `(-1)^(q+1) = 1`, which is true for `q=997` since `q+1` is even. The image of this central involution in PSU(4, q) is the identity element, so it does not contribute to the count of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n2.  **Involution of type `t_2`**: This corresponds to `k=2`. These are the non-central involutions in SU(4, 997). Their images in PSU(4, 997) are the involutions of this group. For `q` odd, where `q ≡ 1` or `5 \\pmod 8`, these involutions form a single conjugacy class in PSU(4, q). Since `997 ≡ 5 \\pmod 8`, there is one conjugacy class of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\nThe number of involutions is the size of this conjugacy class, which is given by the formula:\n`Number of involutions = |PSU(4, q)| / |C_{PSU(4, q)}(t)|`\nwhere `t` is a representative of the involution class.\n\nThe order of PSU(4, q) for `q=997` is:\n`|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/gcd(4, 998)) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1) * (997^3 + 1) * (997^4 - 1)`\n`|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1) * (997^3 + 1) * (997^4 - 1)`\n\nThe centralizer of an involution of type `t_2` in PSU(4, q) has the order:\n`|C_{PSU(4, q)}(t)| = |S(U_2(q) x U_2(q))| / gcd(4, q+1)`\nThe order of `S(U_2(q) x U_2(q))` is `|GU(2,q)|^2 / (q+1) = q^2(q^2-1)^2(q+1)`.\nWith `q=997`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`, so:\n`|C_{PSU(4, 997)}(t)| = (997^2 * (997^2 - 1)^2 * (997 + 1)) / 2`\n\nDividing the group order by the centralizer order yields the number of involutions:\n`N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\nFor `q = 997`:\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994,009`\n*   `q^4 = (994,009)^2 = 988,053,848,081`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994,009 + 1 = 994,010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `988,053,848,081 * 993,013 * 994,010`\nNumber of involutions = `988,053,848,081 * 987,063,857,130`\nNumber of involutions = `975,288,113,452,834,114,814,930`\n\n<<<975288113452834114814930>>>"
