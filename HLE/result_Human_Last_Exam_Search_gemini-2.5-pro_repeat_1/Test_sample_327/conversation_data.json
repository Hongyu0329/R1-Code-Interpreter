    "To represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we need to construct a \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces with the appropriate value. In Red-Blue Hackenbush, the values of games are dyadic rational numbers, which are fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator.\n\nThe value of a simple stalk of colored edges connected to the ground can be calculated using a specific algorithm. A common method for representing a positive dyadic rational number is as follows:\n*   Convert the number to its binary representation. For 13/16, this is 0.1101 in binary.\n*   The binary representation is interpreted as a sequence of colored edges on a stalk, starting from the ground up.\n*   The \"0\" integer part indicates that the stalk starts with a red edge connected to the ground.\n*   Each digit after the binary point corresponds to an edge. A \"1\" represents a blue edge, and a \"0\" represents a red edge.\n\nFollowing this method for 13/16 (0.1101â‚‚):\n1.  The first digit after the point is 1, so we place a **blue** edge.\n2.  The second digit is 1, so we place another **blue** edge on top of the first.\n3.  The third digit is 0, so we place a **red** edge on top.\n4.  The fourth digit is 1, so we place a **blue** edge on top.\n\nThis creates a stalk that, from the ground up, has the color sequence: Blue, Blue, Red, Blue. This construction method for representing dyadic fractions requires a total of 4 pieces.\n\nAnother way to calculate the value of such a stalk is to assign values to each edge based on its position and color. The first edge (closest to the ground) has a value of 1/2, the next 1/4, the next 1/8, and so on, with the sign being positive for blue and negative for red. However, the binary representation method is a more direct construction.\n\nThe stalk representing 13/16 is composed of four edges.\n\n<<<4>>>"
