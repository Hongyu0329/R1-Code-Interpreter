The initiating biochemical reaction is the binding of the causative drug or its metabolite to a specific HLA protein on keratinocytes, which triggers a T-cell mediated immune response. This cascade culminates in the release of granulysin, a cytotoxic protein that causes widespread keratinocyte death and subsequent blister formation.
