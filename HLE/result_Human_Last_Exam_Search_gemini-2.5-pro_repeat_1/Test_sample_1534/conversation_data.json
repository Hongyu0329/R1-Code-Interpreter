    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily other lobes within the same functional grouping, the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is located in the posterior part of the subesophageal mass. The entire posterior aspect of the brain is encased in cartilage.\n\nThe lobes adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe include:\n*   **Posterior chromatophore lobes (PC)**: These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. Their name explicitly indicates their posterior position.\n*   **Fin lobes (F)**: These control the movement of the cuttlefish's fins. Anatomical diagrams show them located in the posterior region of the brain.\n*   **Dorsal and Ventral vasomotor lobes (DV, VV)**: These are also part of the same posterior complex.\n\nThese lobes, together with the palliovisceral lobe, form a cluster in the posterior-most part of the subesophageal mass, which governs locomotion and other motor actions.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.>>>"
