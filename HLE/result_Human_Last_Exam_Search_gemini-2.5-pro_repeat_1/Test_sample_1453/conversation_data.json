    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the identity and packing of amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of its heptad repeat, a pattern of seven amino acids denoted (abcdefg)n. This specific arrangement, known as knobs-into-holes packing, dictates how the α-helices coil around each other.\n\n**1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat:**\n\nFirst, the given sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` must be analyzed to identify the repeating heptad pattern. The 'a' and 'd' positions are crucial as they are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the core of the coiled-coil. By aligning the sequence to maximize hydrophobicity at the 'a' and 'd' positions, the following register is the most plausible:\n\n```\nPosition: g' a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c\nSequence: G  E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G\n```\nThis alignment reveals four complete heptad repeats.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Core 'a' and 'd' Positions:**\n\nBased on this alignment, the residues at the critical 'a' and 'd' core positions are:\n*   **'a' positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n*   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Tryptophan (W), Leucine (L)\n\nThe sequence shows a consistent pattern where the 'a' positions are occupied by Isoleucine and the 'd' positions are occupied by large hydrophobic residues (Leucine and Tryptophan).\n\n**3. Determining Oligomeric State from Core Residues:**\n\nThe specific combination of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions strongly influences the number of helices in the final structure. Decades of research have established general rules:\n*   **Dimers (2 helices):** Often favored by a pattern of Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' (`a=I, d=L`).\n*   **Trimers (3 helices):** Strongly favored when Isoleucine is at both 'a' and 'd' positions. Another powerful trimer-promoting motif is having Isoleucine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position. The β-branched nature of isoleucine at the 'a' position fits well into the packing of a trimer but can cause steric hindrance in dimers and tetramers.\n*   **Tetramers (4 helices):** Typically formed when Leucine is at the 'a' position and Isoleucine is at the 'd' position (`a=L, d=I`).\n\nThe sequence in question has a clear and consistent `a=I` and `d=L/W` pattern. The consistent presence of the β-branched amino acid Isoleucine at the 'a' position is a very strong indicator for a trimeric coiled-coil. The large hydrophobic residues at the 'd' position (Leucine and Tryptophan) are also highly compatible with a stable, tightly packed trimeric core. Therefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and established sequence determinants, the protein would be a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
