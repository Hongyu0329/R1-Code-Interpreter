    "The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. It is a synthetic dye recognized for its vibrant, fluorescent pink or reddish-violet hue. While Rhodamine B is used in various applications, including as a colorant in paints, inks, and textiles, there is no publicly available information from Crayola that definitively confirms its presence in a specific crayon color.\n\nCrayola's crayon formulas are proprietary, and the exact chemical composition of their pigments is not disclosed. The company has produced a range of fluorescent crayons since 1972, including colors such as \"Hot Magenta,\" \"Shocking Pink,\" and \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\". It is known that the color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was previously named \"Hot Magenta\" from 1972 to 1990.\n\nRhodamine B, sometimes identified by the Color Index numbers BV10 (Basic Violet 10) or PR173 (Pigment Red 173) when laked, is a common ingredient in art supplies to achieve bright \"opera,\" \"neon pink,\" or \"opera rose\" shades. However, without a specific chemical analysis of individual Crayola crayons, it is not possible to conclusively identify which color, if any, contains Rhodamine B. Scientific studies and reports on crayon composition tend to focus on general safety and heavy metal content rather than identifying specific organic pigments for each color.\n\nTherefore, while it is plausible that a fluorescent pink or magenta Crayola crayon could contain Rhodamine B, there is no definitive, publicly accessible evidence to confirm this and name a specific crayon.\n\n<<<It is not possible to definitively identify a specific Crayola crayon color containing 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride based on publicly available information.>>>"
