    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" Albert Einstein did not cite the lectures of any other scientist. In fact, the paper is noted for its lack of references to contemporary literature on the subject.\n\nHowever, the paper does make reference to one of Einstein's own previous works. Specifically, his 1905 paper on Brownian motion cites his 1903 paper titled \"Eine Theorie der Grundlagen der Thermodynamik\" (\"A Theory of the Foundations of Thermodynamics\").\n\nWhile there was related work by other physicists at the time, such as William Sutherland who published a similar equation in early 1905, Einstein did not cite him in his paper on Brownian motion.\n\nTherefore, the only work formally cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper was his own earlier publication.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein cited his own 1903 paper, \"Eine Theorie der Grundlagen der Thermodynamik\".>>>"
