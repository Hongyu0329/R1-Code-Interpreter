For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j* are 3/2 and 1/2.

The common eigenvalues are:
*   When *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.
*   When *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.
