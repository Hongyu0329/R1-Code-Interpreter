    "In a spin-orbit coupling problem, the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S** of an electron interact, and they are no longer separately conserved quantities. Instead, the total angular momentum **J** = **L** + **S** is conserved. The operators for the square of the total angular momentum, $J^2$, and its projection onto the z-axis, $J_z$, commute with each other, meaning they have a common set of eigenstates and their eigenvalues can be determined simultaneously.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. As with all electrons, the spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the vector sum of **L** and **S**, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\nFor a p-electron:\n*   *j<sub>min</sub>* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j<sub>max</sub>* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the p-electron can exist in two states characterized by the total angular momentum quantum numbers *j* = 3/2 and *j* = 1/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$ = ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$ = ħ *m_j*\n\nwhere *m_j* is the total magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nWe can now find the common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*:\n\n### Case 1: j = 3/2\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\nħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n*   ** (3/2)ħ **\n*   ** (1/2)ħ **\n*   ** (-1/2)ħ **\n*   ** (-3/2)ħ **\n\n### Case 2: j = 1/2\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\nħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n*   ** (1/2)ħ **\n*   ** (-1/2)ħ **\n\n### Summary of Common Eigenvalues\n\nThe common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ are found in pairs corresponding to the simultaneous eigenstates |*j*, *m_j*⟩:\n\n*   For the **j = 3/2** state, there are four degenerate states with the same $J^2$ eigenvalue and different $J_z$ eigenvalues:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (15/4)ħ²; $J_z$ eigenvalues: (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (-3/2)ħ.\n\n*   For the **j = 1/2** state, there are two degenerate states with the same $J^2$ eigenvalue and different $J_z$ eigenvalues:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (3/4)ħ²; $J_z$ eigenvalues: (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j* are 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nThe common eigenvalues are:\n*   When *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (15/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\n*   When *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
