    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0.\n\nThis result is derived from a general theorem in algebraic topology concerning the homotopy groups of smooth hypersurfaces in complex projective spaces. The argument proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **A Key Theorem:** A significant result by F.E.A. Johnson states that for a smooth algebraic hypersurface $V_d^n$ of degree $d$ in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$, the homotopy groups $\\pi_k(V_d^n)$ are independent of the degree $d$ for $k \\le 2n-1$. Consequently, for this range of $k$, the homotopy groups are isomorphic to those of a hyperplane, which is simply $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.\n\n2.  **Application to the Quintic Surface:** The space $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. In the notation of the theorem, this corresponds to $V_5^2 \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so we have $n=2$ and $d=5$. The theorem applies for $k \\le 2n-1 = 2(2)-1 = 3$.\n\n3.  **Reducing the Problem:** For the specific case of $k=3$, the theorem yields the isomorphism $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$. This reduces the problem of computing the homotopy group of the quintic surface to computing the corresponding homotopy group of the complex projective plane.\n\n4.  **Homotopy Group of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$:** The third homotopy group of the complex projective plane, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$, can be determined using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the Hopf fibration. The complex projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ is the base space of a fiber bundle with total space the 5-sphere $S^5$ and fiber the circle $S^1$:\n    $$S^1 \\to S^5 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^2$$\n    The long exact sequence in homotopy for this fibration gives the relation:\n    $$\\dots \\to \\pi_3(S^1) \\to \\pi_3(S^5) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\to \\pi_2(S^1) \\to \\dots$$\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The homotopy groups of spheres are well-known. Specifically, $\\pi_k(S^1) = 0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Therefore, both $\\pi_3(S^1)$ and $\\pi_2(S^1)$ are the trivial group. The exact sequence thus implies that the map between $\\pi_3(S^5)$ and $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$ is an isomorphism:\n    $$\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\cong \\pi_3(S^5)$$\n    Furthermore, it is a standard result that for spheres, $\\pi_k(S^n) = 0$ for all $k < n$. In this case, for $\\pi_3(S^5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n=5$, so the group is trivial.\n\nCombining these steps, we have $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\cong \\pi_3(S^5) = \\{0\\}$. The third homotopy group of the smooth quintic hypersurface is the trivial group.\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part. Since $\\pi_3(X)$ is the trivial group, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
