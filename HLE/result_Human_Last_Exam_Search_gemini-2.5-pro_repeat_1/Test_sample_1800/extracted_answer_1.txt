The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for both reactions. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal Ni content can range from approximately 7% molar to as high as 15 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst formulation. For water splitting, optimal compositions have been identified as Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).
