    "### Optimal Nickel-to-Cerium Ratio Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel (Ni) to cerium (Ce) in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends significantly on the specific application, whether it be the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting. Research indicates that different optimal ratios exist for each of these catalytic processes, influenced by the reaction conditions and the specific composition of the catalyst.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, studies have identified varying optimal Ni concentrations. In the context of the reverse WGS reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of approximately 7% molar has been reported. Another study focusing on Ni-W-Ce mixed oxide catalysts found the highest catalytic activity with a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂. Research on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt% did not pinpoint a single optimum, noting similar high CO conversion rates for 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni. Furthermore, a 15% NiO/CeO₂ catalyst has been highlighted for its high activity and stability. This variability suggests that the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for WGS is influenced by factors such as the presence of other elements and the specific reaction conditions.\n\nIn the case of **water splitting**, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is also not uniform and depends on the specific half-reaction being targeted, such as the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) or the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). For the OER, which is a key step in water splitting, research on Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce<sub>100−y</sub>O<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts demonstrated that formulations of Ni₇₅Ce₂₅O<sub>x</sub> and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀O<sub>x</sub> exhibited superior activity. This enhanced performance is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. Conversely, for the HER, a different study on Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 was optimal. Additionally, in a study involving co-doping with iron, a high concentration of 20 mol% of Ni and Fe in a 1:1 ratio in ceria showed excellent overall water splitting activity.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes the catalytic performance for both the Water Gas Shift reaction and water splitting. The optimal ratio is contingent upon the specific reaction, the targeted half-reaction in water splitting, and the overall composition of the Ni-Ceria catalyst.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not the same for both reactions. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal Ni content can range from approximately 7% molar to as high as 15 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst formulation. For water splitting, optimal compositions have been identified as Ni₇₅Ce₂₅O<sub>x</sub> and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀O<sub>x</sub> for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).>>>"
