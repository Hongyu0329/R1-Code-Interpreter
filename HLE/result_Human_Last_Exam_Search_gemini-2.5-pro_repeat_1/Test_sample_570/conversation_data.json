    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, is a classic problem in the field of geometry of numbers. The set of lines `px + qy = 1` with `gcd(p, q) = 1` represents all lines in the plane that pass through at least two integer points.\n\nFirst, let's establish a convex domain that satisfies the condition. Consider the square `S` defined by the vertices (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1), and (-1, 1). The area of this square is 4. Let's verify that this square intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nFor a line to not intersect the convex square `S`, all four vertices of the square must lie on the same side of the line. Let's evaluate the expression `f(x, y) = px + qy - 1` at the four vertices:\n*   `f(1, 1) = p + q - 1`\n*   `f(1, -1) = p - q - 1`\n*   `f(-1, -1) = -p - q - 1`\n*   `f(-1, 1) = -p + q - 1`\n\nIf the line does not intersect the square, then these four values must all have the same sign (all positive or all negative).\n\n**Case 1: All values are positive.**\nThis means `p + q > 1`, `p - q > 1`, `-p - q > 1`, and `-p + q > 1`.\nFrom `-p - q > 1`, we can deduce `p + q < -1`. This directly contradicts `p + q > 1`. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: All values are negative.**\nThis means `p + q < 1`, `p - q < 1`, `-p - q < 1`, and `-p + q < 1`.\nFrom `-p - q < 1`, we get `p + q > -1`. Combining this with `p + q < 1`, we have `-1 < p + q < 1`.\nSimilarly, from `-p + q < 1` and `p - q < 1` (which is `- ( -p + q) < 1`), we get `-1 < -p + q < 1`.\n\nSince `p` and `q` are integers, `p + q` and `-p + q` must also be integers. The only integer strictly between -1 and 1 is 0.\nSo, we must have:\n1.  `p + q = 0`\n2.  `-p + q = 0`\n\nAdding these two equations gives `2q = 0`, so `q = 0`. Substituting this back gives `p = 0`. However, `p` and `q` cannot both be zero as they are coprime.\nIf `p+q` or `p-q` were on the boundary (equal to 0), the line would pass through a vertex and thus intersect the square. For example, if `p+q=0`, since `p` and `q` are coprime, we have either `(p,q) = (1,-1)` or `(-1,1)`. The line is then `x-y=1` or `-x+y=1`, both of which intersect the square.\n\nThis shows that the square with vertices at (±1, ±1) and an area of 4 intersects all the specified lines.\n\nThe more challenging part is to prove that this is the minimal area. This is a well-established result in geometry. A theorem by L. Moser and J. H. H. Chalk states that any convex planar set with an area less than 4 can be positioned so that it does not cover any point of the integer lattice. The contrapositive of this result implies that a convex set that intersects every line passing through two integer points must have an area of at least 4.\n\nThe proof of this is non-trivial and relies on results from the geometry of numbers, such as Minkowski's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
