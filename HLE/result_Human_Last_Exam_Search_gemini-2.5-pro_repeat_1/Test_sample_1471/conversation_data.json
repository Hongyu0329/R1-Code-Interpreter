    "The solution to the equation is calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, we convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers:\n*   **XL** = 40\n*   **CXX** = 120\n*   **CXLVII** = 147\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the equation:\n\n40 / 120 - 147\n\nThen, we perform the calculation:\n\n1.  **Division**: 40 divided by 120 is 1/3.\n2.  **Subtraction**: 1/3 minus 147 equals -440/3.\n\nAs a decimal, this is -146.666...\n\n<<<-146.666...>>>"
