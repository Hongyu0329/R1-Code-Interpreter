    "**The 1937 biographical film, *The Life of Emile Zola*, holds the distinction of being the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to feature the Luxor Obelisk on-screen.**\n\nThe film, which chronicles the life of the famed French writer and his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, is set primarily in Paris. Among the various Parisian landmarks depicted, a night scene at the Place de la Concorde is included. A wide shot of this iconic square would inherently capture its famous centerpiece, the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners, such as *An American in Paris* (1951) and *Gigi* (1958), also feature scenes at the Place de la Concorde, *The Life of Emile Zola* was the first to do so, securing its place in cinematic history for this particular on-screen depiction. The 1951 film *An American in Paris* notably includes a ballet sequence with a set inspired by the Place de la Concorde, and a model of the fountain at the location was used in its production. Similarly, *Gigi* was partially filmed at the actual Place de la Concorde. However, with its earlier release date, *The Life of Emile Zola* precedes both of these films.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
