The problem as stated contains contradictory information. The molecular formula of X is best determined as C₁₀H₁₂O₂, leading to an ozonolysis product A with formula C₅H₆O₂. The product B, however, is determined to be C₅H₁₂O₃. It is chemically impossible to form B from A by a simple reduction. Assuming the reaction involves an unstated hydration step (`A + H₂O + reduction → B`) and that all other data is correct, it is still not possible to determine a single unambiguous structure for X that satisfies all constraints (symmetric alkene, enol, and aldehyde properties, leading to meso-pentan-2,3,4-triol). Therefore, a definitive structure cannot be provided.
