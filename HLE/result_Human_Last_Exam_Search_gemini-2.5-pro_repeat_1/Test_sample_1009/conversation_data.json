    "The problem asks for the largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group $G$ with cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The group is not required to be Hausdorff.\n\nLet's denote the cardinality of the continuum by $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. The given cardinality of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nWe will use the following standard cardinal invariants of a topological space $X$:\n*   **Weight** $w(X)$: the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology.\n*   **Density** $d(X)$: the minimum cardinality of a dense subset.\n*   **Character** $\\chi(X)$: the supremum of the local character $\\chi(x, X)$ over all points $x \\in X$, where $\\chi(x, X)$ is the minimum cardinality of a local base at $x$.\n\nThe group $G$ has the following properties:\n1.  $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n2.  $G$ is a topological group.\n3.  $G$ is compact.\n4.  $G$ is first-countable. This means that $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n5.  $G$ might not be Hausdorff. This implies that $G$ might not satisfy the T2, T1, or T0 separation axioms.\n\nFor any topological group $G$, its weight, density, and character are related by the following fundamental equality, established by Arhangel'skii:\n$w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n\nSince $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Assuming the density $d(G)$ is an infinite cardinal (which will be confirmed shortly), the formula simplifies to:\n$w(G) = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0) = d(G)$.\n\nTherefore, finding the maximum possible weight of $G$ is equivalent to finding its maximum possible density.\n\nNow, we use another key inequality from the theory of cardinal invariants of topological groups, which relates the cardinality of a group to its density and character. For any T0 topological group $H$, the following inequality holds:\n$|H| \\le d(H)^{\\chi(H)}$.\n\nThe problem states that $G$ might not be Hausdorff, which means it might not even be T0. If a topological group is not T0, we can consider its T0-quotient. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element $e$. $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$. The quotient group $G_0 = G/N$ is a T0 topological group (and is in fact Hausdorff).\n\nThe cardinal invariants of $G$ and $G_0$ are related:\n*   $\\chi(G_0) = \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$ (since the quotient map is open and continuous).\n*   $d(G_0) \\le d(G)$ (since the continuous image of a dense set is dense).\n*   $|G| = |G_0| \\cdot |N|$.\n\nApplying the inequality to the T0 group $G_0$:\n$|G_0| \\le d(G_0)^{\\chi(G_0)}$\n$|G|/|N| \\le d(G_0)^{\\aleph_0} \\le d(G)^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThis inequality alone does not provide a tight bound, as the size of $N$ is unknown. For instance, if $G$ has the indiscrete topology, then $N=G$, $|G_0|=1$, and $w(G)=d(G)=1$, which is a very small weight.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *largest possible* weight. To find this, we should consider the case that imposes the strongest constraints on the cardinal invariants, which typically involves assuming the strongest possible separation property that is consistent with the problem statement. A group that is not Hausdorff can still be T1 or T0. If we assume that $G$ is a T1 space, the inequality $|G| \\le d(G)^{\\chi(G)}$ applies directly to $G$. A topological group is T1 if and only if it is T0.\n\nLet's assume $G$ is T1. The inequality is:\n$|G| \\le d(G)^{\\chi(G)}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} \\le d(G)^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nLet $\\kappa = d(G)$. The inequality is $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\kappa^{\\aleph_0}$.\nWe can use a result from cardinal arithmetic: for infinite cardinals $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, if $\\gamma^\\beta \\ge \\alpha$ and $\\alpha > 2^\\beta$, then $\\gamma \\ge \\alpha$.\nIn our case, $\\beta = \\aleph_0$ and $\\alpha = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. We have $2^{2^\\frak c} > 2^{\\aleph_0}$, so the condition holds.\nThus, we can conclude that $\\kappa \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nSo, the density of the group must be at least $2^{2^\\frak c}$:\n$d(G) \\ge 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nOn the other hand, the density of a space can never exceed its cardinality, as the space itself is a dense subset.\n$d(G) \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nCombining these two results, we must have:\n$d(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nNow, we use the formula for the weight:\n$w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G) = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\aleph_0 = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nThis shows that if such a T1 group exists, its weight must be $2^{2^\\frak c}$. The existence of such a group is a non-trivial problem, but within the framework of cardinal invariants, this value is the maximum possible one consistent with the given properties under the T1 assumption. Since non-T1 groups can have smaller weights (like the indiscrete group of weight 1), the largest possible weight will be achieved in the T1 case.\n\nThus, the largest possible weight of the group is $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n<<<2^(2^c)>>>"
