    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of six *sissone fermes* in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThe variation features a sequence of soaring jumps that are characteristic of the Grigorovich style, emphasizing the swan's fluttering, bird-like movements. Within this choreography, Zakharova executes six distinct *sissone fermes*, which are jumps initiated from two feet and landing on one, with the other foot then closing. These steps contribute to the overall ethereal and poignant quality of Odette's dance as she tells her story to Prince Siegfried.\n\nThis specific number of *sissone fermes* is a key choreographic detail in Grigorovich's interpretation of the classic ballet, and Zakharova's execution of them is a notable feature of her performance in this role.\n\n<<<6>>>"
