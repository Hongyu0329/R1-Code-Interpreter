    "When considering the \"Justified True Belief\" (JTB) definition of knowledge, and restricting our epistemic states to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems emerge that are separate from the famous Gettier cases. These problems challenge the coherence and applicability of the \"justification\" condition itself.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Epistemic Regress Problem (Agrippa's Trilemma):** This problem fundamentally questions how any belief can be ultimately justified. The JTB model requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. However, that justification must also be supported by a reason or another belief. This leads to three problematic possibilities:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** Each justification requires a further justification, creating an endless chain of reasons with no ultimate foundation.\n    *   **Circularity:** The chain of justification eventually loops back on itself, meaning a belief is used to justify itself, which is a logical fallacy.\n    *   **Dogmatism:** The chain of justification stops at a \"basic belief\" that is asserted without its own justification. This amounts to an arbitrary, unproven starting point.\n\n    This trilemma suggests that the justification condition might be an impossible standard to meet, casting doubt on whether any belief can be formally justified and thus become knowledge under the JTB framework.\n\n2.  **The Vagueness of the Justification Condition:** The JTB definition fails to specify *how much* or *what kind* of justification is sufficient to turn a true belief into knowledge. Justification is not an all-or-nothing quality; it exists on a spectrum. A belief can be weakly or strongly supported by evidence. The JTB account provides no clear threshold for when a belief crosses the line from being merely a \"True Belief\" to becoming \"Knowledge.\" This inherent vagueness creates an arbitrary and subjective boundary. For example, if one person believes a stock will rise based on a rumor (weak justification) and another believes it based on extensive financial analysis (strong justification), and the stock does rise, both have a justified true belief. The JTB model, without a clear standard, struggles to differentiate between these two states, yet one seems more like knowledge than the other. This ambiguity is a critical flaw when operating in a binary system of only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief.\"\n\n<<<The two problems JTB runs into, ignoring Gettier problems, are the epistemic regress problem (Agrippa's Trilemma) and the problem of the vagueness of the justification condition.>>>"
