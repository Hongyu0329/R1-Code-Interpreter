In scalar field theoretical frameworks, below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, according to the relation derived from the hyperscaling equation α = 2 - dν. Using the first-order epsilon expansion (where ε = 4 - d) for the correlation length exponent ν ≈ 1/2 + ε/12, the quantitative scaling of α is found to be approximately **α ≈ (4 - d)/6**. This indicates that α is zero at d=4 and increases as the dimensionality decreases.
