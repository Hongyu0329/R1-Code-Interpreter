    "### From Proto-Indo-European to Germanic: The Journey of a Word\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning \"'(s)he is giving a sign\" or \"'(s)he seeks out, tracks,\" serves as the ancient root for words related to seeking and perception in various Indo-European languages. Its descendants can be traced through the linguistic evolution of the Germanic languages, undergoing predictable sound changes.\n\nThe journey of this word from its PIE form to its appearances in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German is as follows:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** The PIE verb *seh₂gieti evolved into the reconstructed Proto-Germanic verb **\\*sōkijaną**, meaning \"to seek\" or \"to look for\".\n\n*   **Old Norse:** In Old Norse, the language of the Vikings, *sōkijaną gave rise to the verb **sǿkja**, with the alternative spellings **sœkja** and **sækja**.\n\n*   **Old English:** The Anglo-Saxons used the verb **sēċan** (also found as **sœ̄ċan** and **sēċean**), which is the direct ancestor of the modern English word \"seek\".\n\n*   **Old High German:** In the various dialects of Old High German, the verb appeared as **suohhen** or **suochen**. This form would later evolve into the modern German \"suchen\".\n\nThe Latin verb *sāgīre*, meaning \"to be keen-nosed\" or \"to perceive keenly,\" and the Hittite *sākizzi*, \"'(s)he gives a sign,\" are cognates, sharing the same PIE origin as their Germanic counterparts.\n\n<<<The Proto-Indo-European verb *seh2gieti developed into the following forms in the Germanic languages:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sǿkja, sœkja, sækja\n*   **Old English:** sēċan, sœ̄ċan, sēċean\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen, suochen>>>"
