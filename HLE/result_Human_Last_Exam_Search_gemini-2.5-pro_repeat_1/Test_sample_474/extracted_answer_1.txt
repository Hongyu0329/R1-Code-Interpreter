The proposed approach is not valid because human visual perception is a poor proxy for the vision of avian predators, which are the primary selective force behind the evolution of bumblebee mimicry. The method fails to account for differences in color perception (especially UV light) and the critical role of predator learning, which gives the mimicry its ecological function.
