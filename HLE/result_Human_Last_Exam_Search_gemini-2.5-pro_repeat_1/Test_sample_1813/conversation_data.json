    "The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is given by the following sequence of integers:\n\n\n\nThis result is obtained from the work of Esther Banaian and Archan Sen in their paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\". Specifically, in the preprint version arXiv:2210.07366v1, Table 2 on page 9 provides a list of these continued fractions for various rational numbers p/q. The entry corresponding to p=4 and q=7 is the sequence listed above.\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers in this context are integers that are part of a solution to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz\\). The indexing of these numbers by rational numbers p/q is a key aspect of their work, and the associated continued fraction provides a way to compute the number itself.\n\n<<<>>>"
