    "I have conducted extensive searches and have not been able to identify an Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus. My investigation included reviewing scripts of films with prominent bus scenes, such as \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Forrest Gump,\" and \"Babel,\" as well as broader searches for films with fateful moments on public transportation.\n\nWhile bus scenes are a common trope in cinema, and characters often express gratitude, the specific combination of an Oscar nomination, a character boarding a bus, the line \"Thank you,\" and that phrase directly leading to a fateful event does not appear to correspond to a known film.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your query. It is possible that the film is not Oscar-nominated, or that the details of the scene are slightly different from what is recalled.\n\n<<<I am unable to find an Oscar-nominated film that matches the precise scene described.>>>"
