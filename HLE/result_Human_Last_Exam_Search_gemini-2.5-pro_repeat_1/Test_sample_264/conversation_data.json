    "To find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the coordinate system and the first cube.**\n    Let the first cube, C₁, be a unit cube with one vertex at the origin (0,0,0) and its sides aligned with the x, y, and z axes. This cube occupies the space defined by:\n    0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n2.  **Determine the shift vector.**\n    The main diagonal of this cube connects the vertex at the origin to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1). This can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1). The length of this diagonal is ||**d**|| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n\n    The second cube, C₂, is shifted by \"1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first. This is interpreted as a shift by a distance equal to half the length of the main diagonal.\n    Shift distance = (1/2) * ||**d**|| = √3 / 2.\n\n    The direction of the shift is along the main diagonal, which is represented by the unit vector **u** = **d** / ||**d**|| = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n\n    The shift vector is the shift distance multiplied by the unit vector:\n    Shift vector **s** = (√3 / 2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the second cube's position.**\n    The second cube, C₂, is translated by the shift vector **s**. Its coordinates are therefore in the ranges:\n    0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\n    The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the coordinate constraints of both cubes. This is found by finding the overlap in each coordinate range.\n\n    *   **x-dimension:** The overlap of and [1/2, 3/2] is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   **y-dimension:** The overlap of and [1/2, 3/2] is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   **z-dimension:** The overlap of and [1/2, 3/2] is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n    The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of this intersection is the product of the lengths of these overlapping intervals.\n\n    Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
