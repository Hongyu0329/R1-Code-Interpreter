    "Let $K$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of these degrees:\n\n### 1. Factor the Polynomial\nThe given polynomial $P(x)$ can be factored:\n$P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Galois Groups of the Factors\n*   **For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$**: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**:\n    *   The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n    *   The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots. This implies that $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n    *   An irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. So, if $K_g$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$, then $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Galois Group of the Full Polynomial\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups if the intersection of the fields is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is determined by the square root of the discriminant of $g(x)$. The discriminant is $D = 4^4(-9)^5 + 5^5(3)^4 = -14,863,419$. The quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n### 4. Find the Degrees of Intermediate Normal Extensions\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is the corresponding normal subgroup.\n\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  **Product Subgroups**: These are formed by taking direct products of normal subgroups of $S_5$ (which are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$) and $C_2$ (which are $\\{e\\}, C_2$).\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, with order $|H_1|=60$.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, with order $|H_2|=120$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$, with order $|H_3|=2$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$, with order $|H_4|=120$.\n2.  **\"Skew\" Subgroup**: There is one additional normal subgroup that is not a direct product. It arises from the isomorphism $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid c = \\text{sgn}(g)\\}$. This subgroup has order 120.\n\nThe possible degrees of the intermediate normal extensions are the indices of these subgroups:\n*   $[L_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_1| = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n*   $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_2| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_3| = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n*   $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_4| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[L_5:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_5| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nCollecting the distinct values, the possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
