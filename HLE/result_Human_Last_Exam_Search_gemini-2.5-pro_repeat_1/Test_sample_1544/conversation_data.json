    "In the chess position represented by the FEN string 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1, the optimal move for White is to trade queens.\n\nWhite's primary advantage in this position is the powerful passed pawn on the d6 square. This pawn significantly restricts the movement of the Black king. Conversely, Black's queen on c5 is very active and poses the most significant threat to White.\n\nBy playing the move Qxc5+, White forces an exchange of queens. Black's only legal response is to recapture with the king (...Kxc5). This action transitions the game into a king and pawn endgame. In this endgame, White's passed d-pawn becomes the decisive factor, and with optimal play, White can secure a win.\n\nAny other move by White would allow Black's queen to remain on the board, maintaining counterplay and complicating White's path to victory. Therefore, exchanging queens is the most direct and effective strategy.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
