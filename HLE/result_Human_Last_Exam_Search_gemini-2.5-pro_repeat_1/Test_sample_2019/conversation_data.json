    "It is not possible to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Therefore, the number of ways is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by a discussion on a mathematics forum where a user, after investigating a related problem, mentioned that they \"discovered that 4 queens could be placed into two non-attacking groups but not four individual ones\" on a 5x5 toroidal board. This implies that no configuration for 4 non-attacking queens exists.\n\nThe problem of placing non-attacking queens on a toroidal board is a well-studied mathematical problem. For an *n*x*n* toroidal board, it is known that a solution for placing *n* queens exists if and only if the greatest common divisor of *n* and 6 is 1. For a 5x5 board, since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is possible to place 5 non-attacking queens. However, this does not guarantee a solution for a different number of queens.\n\nWhile there are extensive resources on the n-queens problem and its variants, including enumerations for different board sizes and pieces, a specific formula or count for placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is not readily available for all *k* and *n*. A related problem for \"semi-queens,\" which have a more restricted diagonal movement, does have a known formula, but this is not applicable to standard queens.\n\nBased on the available information, the placement of 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is not possible.\n\n<<<0>>>"
