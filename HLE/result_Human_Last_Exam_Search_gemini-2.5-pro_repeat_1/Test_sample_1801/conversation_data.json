    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is explicitly mentioned in several sources as having appeared in the commercial. A Reddit thread discussing the commercial identifies the man with white hair and glasses as Gell-Mann.\n\nThe second laureate was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. While his name does not appear as frequently in the initial search results, the repeated description of the second individual as a prominent \"Indian commentator\" and public intellectual strongly points to Sen, who fits this description and was a globally recognized figure at the time.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was part of a broader effort by Enron to portray itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company, a narrative that crumbled with its scandalous collapse in 2001. The commercials featured a montage of imagery, including historical figures and symbols of progress, set to what was described as \"urgent\" and \"haunting\" music.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
