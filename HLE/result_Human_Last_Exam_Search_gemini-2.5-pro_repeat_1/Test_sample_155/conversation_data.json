    "This is a classic visual puzzle. The word is encoded in the shape of the letters formed by the `t` and `b` characters. These types of puzzles often have a second layer of encoding, where 't' and 'b' refer to the top and bottom rows of a standard QWERTY keyboard, respectively. The letters 't' and 'b' are used to construct the shape of a word.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, one must visually interpret the arrangement of the characters. The word spelled out by the shape is **BITBLITTER**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the word is formed:\n*   The overall arrangement of the `t` and `b` characters forms the block letters of the word \"BITBLITTER\".\n*   The first character block on the left forms a 'B'.\n*   The vertical lines of characters form the 'I's and the vertical stems of other letters like 'T' and 'L'.\n*   The remaining clusters of `t`'s and `b`'s form the other letters.\n\nThis type of puzzle is notoriously difficult to solve without prior experience, as the letterforms can be highly stylized and abstract.\n\n<<<BITBLITTER>>>"
