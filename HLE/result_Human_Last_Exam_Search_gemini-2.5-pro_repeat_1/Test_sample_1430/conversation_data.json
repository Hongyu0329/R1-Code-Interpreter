    "Here's a breakdown of the possible ranks for the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nFirst, let's define the terms:\n*   **Riemann Surface (C):** A one-dimensional complex manifold. In this case, it has genus `g=3`. A genus 3 curve can be either a hyperelliptic curve or a non-hyperelliptic curve (a plane quartic).\n*   **Symmetric Power (X = Sym¹⁵(C)):** The variety formed by unordered sets of 15 points on the curve C.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group (NS(X)):** The group of divisors (geometric subvarieties of codimension 1) on X, considered up to a form of equivalence called algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted by ρ(X), is known as the Picard number of X.\n*   **Jacobian Variety (Jac(C)):** An abelian variety (a complex torus with a group structure) that is associated with the curve C. For a genus `g` curve, its Jacobian is a `g`-dimensional abelian variety.\n\n### Calculating the Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve C is given by the formula:\n\n**ρ(X) = ρ(Sym¹⁵(C)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))**\n\nThis formula holds when the degree of the symmetric power (in this case, 15) is greater than or equal to `2g - 1`. Here, `g=3`, so `2g - 1 = 5`, and since 15 > 5, the formula is applicable.\n\nThis means the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\n### The Range of ρ(Jac(C)) for a Genus 3 Curve\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian, ρ(Jac(C)), depends on the specific properties of the curve C, particularly its endomorphism algebra.\n\n*   **Smallest Possible Rank:** The minimum rank occurs for a \"very general\" curve. For a generic curve of genus g ≥ 2, its Jacobian has the minimal possible endomorphism algebra (the integers, **Z**), and its Néron-Severi group has rank 1. This means the smallest possible value for ρ(Jac(C)) is **1**.\n\n*   **Largest Possible Rank:** The maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension `g` is `g²`. For a genus 3 curve, the dimension of the Jacobian is `g=3`, so the maximum possible rank is 3² = **9**. This maximum is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication and are isogenous to a product of mutually isogenous elliptic curves.\n\nA well-known example that achieves this maximum rank is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation X⁴ + Y⁴ + Z⁴ = 0. The Jacobian of this curve is isogenous to the product of three copies of a specific elliptic curve that has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers **Z**[i]. For this curve, ρ(Jac(C)) = 9.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing the formula and the range for ρ(Jac(C)):\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(Jac(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.>>>"
