    "The determinant of the given matrix is calculated as follows:\n\nLet A be the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of A can be computed using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) - (-1) * (-2 - 1) + (-1) * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 + 1 * (-3) - 1 * 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, we can use row operations. If we add the second and third rows to the first row (R1 -> R1 + R2 + R3), we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2-1-1 & -1+2-1 & -1-1+2 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSince the resulting matrix has a row of zeros, its determinant is 0.\n\nThe term \"Markov quiver\" relates to the study of cluster algebras and the Markov equation, \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The solutions to this Diophantine equation are called Markov numbers, of which 13 is an example. The given matrix A is related to the Tits form for the three-block quiver case which is connected to the Markov equation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
