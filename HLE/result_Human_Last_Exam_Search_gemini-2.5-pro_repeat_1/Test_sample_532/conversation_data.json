    "A finite group G is called a **filled group** if all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets are complete. A subset S of a group G is called **product-free** if for all s1 and s2 in S, the product s1s2 is not in S. A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. A product-free set S is **complete** if every non-identity element of G can be expressed as a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups have been classified. A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n\n*   **An elementary abelian 2-group:** This is a group where every element has order 2. These are isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).**\n*   **The cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).**\n*   **The quaternion group of order 8 (Q₈).**\n\nThis classification is a result of the work by C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart, who studied groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete. Their research provides a comprehensive list of such groups, and for the case of finite nilpotent groups, the above list is exhaustive.\n\nIt is noteworthy that while the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈) is a nilpotent group (as it is a 2-group), it is not a filled group. The classification of filled abelian groups had been established earlier, identifying them as elementary abelian 2-groups, C₃, and C₅. The work on filled nilpotent groups confirms this and adds the non-abelian quaternion group Q₈ to the list of filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are elementary abelian 2-groups, the cyclic group of order 3, the cyclic group of order 5, and the quaternion group of order 8.>>>"
