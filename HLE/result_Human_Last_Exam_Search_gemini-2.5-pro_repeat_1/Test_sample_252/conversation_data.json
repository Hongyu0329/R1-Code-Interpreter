    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method requires capturing multiple, spectrally dispersed \"projections\" of the scene onto a single detector array in one snapshot.\n\nThe key component for creating these projections is a two-dimensional (2D) disperser, which is essentially a specialized diffraction grating. In early implementations, these 2D gratings were created by physically stacking and crossing two one-dimensional gratings. This configuration disperses the light in two perpendicular directions, creating a grid of spectrally smeared images on the sensor.\n\nEach of these dispersed images acts as a projection through the three-dimensional (x, y, Î») data cube, similar to how projections are used in medical CT scans. A single 1D grating would only disperse light in one direction, which is insufficient for the tomographic reconstruction of the 2D spatial information at each wavelength. To obtain the necessary projections from multiple angles to reconstruct the spatial-spectral data cube, a minimum of two gratings, arranged perpendicularly, is required. Modern systems often use a single, more complex computer-generated hologram (CGH) that functions as a 2D grating, but the underlying principle of needing dispersion in two dimensions remains.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
