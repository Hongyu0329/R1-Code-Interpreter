    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we must break down the notation for both heavy atoms (any atom not Hydrogen or Helium) and for Hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Breakdown of the 6-311G** Basis Set Notation:\n\nThe notation can be deconstructed as follows:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This describes the contraction scheme for the atomic orbitals.\n    *   **6**: The core atomic orbitals are described by a single basis function, which is a linear combination (a contraction) of **6 primitive Gaussian functions**.\n    *   **311**: The valence atomic orbitals are described by three basis functions (a triple-zeta basis set).\n        *   The first basis function is a contraction of **3 primitive Gaussians**.\n        *   The second basis function consists of a single **1 primitive Gaussian**.\n        *   The third basis function also consists of a single **1 primitive Gaussian**.\n*   **\\*\\***: This part of the notation indicates the addition of polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by allowing for more flexible orbital shapes.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **d-type polarization functions** to each heavy atom. This is a single uncontracted set of d-functions, meaning each d-function is a single primitive Gaussian. Standardly, this means adding 6 primitive Gaussians for the 6 Cartesian d-functions (d<sub>x²</sub>, d<sub>y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>).\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **p-type polarization functions** to each hydrogen atom. This consists of 3 uncontracted p-functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>), adding **3 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Calculation of Primitive Gaussians per Atom:\n\nBased on this breakdown, the number of primitive Gaussians can be calculated for each type of atom.\n\n#### For a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon):\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence s-orbital (2s):** 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence p-orbitals (2p<sub>x</sub>, 2p<sub>y</sub>, 2p<sub>z</sub>):** Each of the three p-orbitals is described by 3+1+1=5 primitives, for a total of 3 × 5 = 15 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization d-functions:** 6 primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a carbon atom is 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32**.\n\n#### For a Hydrogen Atom:\n\n*   A hydrogen atom has no core orbitals; its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence s-orbital (1s):** 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization p-functions:** 3 primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom is 5 + 3 = **8**.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value but depends on the specific atom. For a heavy atom like carbon, it is 32 primitive Gaussians. For a hydrogen atom, it is 8 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
