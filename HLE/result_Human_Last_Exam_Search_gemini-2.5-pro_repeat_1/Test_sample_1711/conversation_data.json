    "Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that $A$ has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the cyclic subgroups of $G$. A cyclic subgroup is generated by an element $g \\in G$. The order of an element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ where $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components $g_i$. The possible orders for an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the order of any element $g \\in G$ must also be 1, 7, or 49.\n\nLet's consider the cyclic subgroups based on their order:\n1.  **Order 1:** The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, which is generated by the zero element of $G$. For $A$ to intersect this subgroup, it must contain the zero element. Thus, $0 \\in A$.\n\n2.  **Order 49:** Let $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. The order of $g$ is 49. Such a subgroup $H$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7, which is generated by the element $7g$. Let's call this subgroup $H' = \\langle 7g \\rangle$. The order of $7g$ is 7.\n\n3.  **Order 7:** Let $K = \\langle k \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 7. The order of $k$ is 7.\n\nThe key insight is that if a set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it will automatically intersect every cyclic subgroup of order 49. This is because any order-49 cyclic subgroup $H$ contains an order-7 cyclic subgroup $H'$. If $A \\cap H' \\neq \\emptyset$, then since $H' \\subset H$, it follows that $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A$ that satisfies two conditions:\na) $0 \\in A$.\nb) $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nLet's focus on the elements of order 7. These are the elements $g \\in G$ such that $7g=0$ but $g \\neq 0$. The set of all elements $g$ with $7g=0$ forms a subgroup of $G$, let's call it $G_7$.\n$G_7 = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g=0 \\}$. An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ is in $G_7$ if and only if $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This is equivalent to each $g_i$ being a multiple of 7. The multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ form a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $G_7$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nThis group $G_7$ can be viewed as a vector space $V$ of dimension 2024 over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V$.\n\nOur task now is to find the minimum size of a set $A_0 = A \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that intersects every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\nLet $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Their intersection is just the zero vector, i.e., $L_1 \\cap L_2 = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $A_0$ be the set of non-zero elements of $A$. For $A_0$ to intersect every 1-dimensional subspace, for each such subspace $L$, we must have at least one element $a \\in A_0 \\cap L$.\nSince an element $a \\in A_0$ is non-zero, it belongs to exactly one 1-dimensional subspace (the one it generates, $\\text{span}(a)$). Therefore, to intersect all the 1-dimensional subspaces, we need at least as many elements in $A_0$ as there are 1-dimensional subspaces.\n\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n$$ N = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} $$\nThe minimum size of $A_0$ is thus $N$. This minimum is achieved by choosing exactly one non-zero element from each 1-dimensional subspace.\n\nThe total size of $A$ is the size of $A_0$ plus the zero element.\nSo, the minimum size of $A$ is $N+1$.\n\nSize of $A = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1$.\n\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{7^{2024}-1+6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024}+5}{6}$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1$>>>"
