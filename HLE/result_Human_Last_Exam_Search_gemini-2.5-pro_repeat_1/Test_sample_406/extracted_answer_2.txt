The conditions for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The key conditions are: the spaces X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces; the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property; the functions must adhere to specific contractive conditions that reduce the "distance" between points upon successive applications; and there must exist an initial point that is related to its image under the functions in a specific way according to the partial order.
