    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it can have several evolutionary fates. To determine which of the listed mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention *and* divergence of these duplicate genes, each option must be evaluated.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of nonreciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This process, known as concerted evolution, homogenizes gene copies and actively works *against* their divergence. Therefore, it is not a mechanism for retaining divergent duplicates.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy of the gene accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional, turning into a pseudogene. While the sequence of a pseudogene diverges, this process represents the *loss* of a functional gene copy, not its retention in a functional state.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a key mechanism where both gene copies are retained. One copy preserves the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This process explains both the retention of the two genes (as they serve different, necessary roles) and their divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This is another primary mechanism for retaining duplicate genes. It proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses different, complementary subfunctions through mutation. Consequently, both genes are required to fully perform the original set of ancestral functions. This \"division of labor\" ensures both copies are retained through selection and results in their divergence.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for retaining and diverging specific genes within a single genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the primary evolutionary models that explain the retention and functional divergence of duplicate genes. Pseudogenization is a loss of function, and gene conversion prevents divergence. Between neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, subfunctionalization is often considered a highly likely mechanism because it provides a passive route for preservation. It relies on common loss-of-function mutations to make both gene copies indispensable, whereas neofunctionalization requires a rarer beneficial gain-of-function mutation to arise before the redundant gene copy is lost to pseudogenization. However, both are considered major, valid pathways. Given the choices, both C and D are the correct categories of mechanisms. As the question asks for the mechanism most likely responsible, and both are significant, they represent the best answers among the choices. In many contexts, one may be more prevalent than the other, but they are the two established models for this phenomenon.\n\n<<<D>>>"
