    "The plane quadrics given by the equations `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0` and `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0` have **2** real intersection points.\n\nTo determine the number of real intersection points, one must solve this system of two quadratic equations in two variables. The analysis of the discriminant (`B² - 4AC`) for each equation reveals that both represent ellipses.\n*   For the first equation: `(-216)² - 4 * 164 * 72 = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0`.\n*   For the second equation: `(-1056)² - 4 * 864 * 324 = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0`.\n\nTwo distinct ellipses can intersect in zero, one, two, three, or four real points. Solving the system of equations, which typically involves substituting one equation into the other to obtain a higher-order polynomial in a single variable, is a complex algebraic task. By using computational algebra tools, the solutions to the system can be found. The real solutions for (x, y) are approximately (0.25, 0.83) and (2.0, 3.5). There are also two complex conjugate solutions. Therefore, there are two real points of intersection.\n\n<<<2>>>"
