    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in a 1D box within a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval.\n\n### 1. The Wavefunction and Probability Density\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy state is given by:\n\n*   **ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)**\n\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position is given by the square of the wavefunction's magnitude, known as the probability density function P(x).\n\n*   **P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)**\n\nFor the first excited state, the principal quantum number is **n = 2**. The interval is from **0.495a** to **0.505a**.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Integral\n\nThe probability (Prob) of finding the particle in the interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by the integral:\n\n*   **Prob = ∫[x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx**\n\nSubstituting the values for n, x₁, and x₂:\n\n*   **Prob = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx**\n\n### 3. Solving the Integral\n\nThe center of the given interval is x = 0.5a (or a/2). At this point, the probability density for n=2 is zero, as sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0. This point is a node. Since the interval is very small and centered around this node, we expect the probability to be very low.\n\nBecause the interval (Δx = 0.01a) is very small, we can use an approximation. Let's define a new coordinate `y = x - a/2`. The integration interval for `y` becomes [-0.005a, 0.005a]. The term inside the sine function becomes:\n\n*   **sin(2π(y + a/2)/a) = sin(2πy/a + π) = -sin(2πy/a)**\n\nSquaring this gives:\n\n*   **sin²(2πy/a)**\n\nFor small angles θ, sin(θ) ≈ θ. Here, the angle is `2πy/a`, which is small within the integration interval. Thus, we can approximate:\n\n*   **sin²(2πy/a) ≈ (2πy/a)²**\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\n*   **Prob ≈ ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (2πy/a)² dy**\n*   **Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[-0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy**\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n\n*   **Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [y³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a**\n*   **Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * 2 * [(0.005a)³/3]**\n*   **Prob ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³**\n*   **Prob ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)**\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\n*   **Prob ≈ 52.6378 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)**\n*   **Prob ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶**\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 0.00000658, or about 0.000658%.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
