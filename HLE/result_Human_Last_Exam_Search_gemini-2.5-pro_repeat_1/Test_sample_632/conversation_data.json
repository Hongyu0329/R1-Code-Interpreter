    "Until 1950, the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome was paved with a unique architectural feature: wooden cobblestones, also known as *sanpietrini in legno*. This distinctive paving was removed by the city administration due to frequent complaints from citizens.\n\nThe wooden blocks, particularly on the sloped areas of the piazza, required a coating of grease for their preservation. This made the surface slippery and led to many people falling. In 1950, the wooden cobblestones were removed and the square was paved with asphalt. The few wooden cobblestones that were salvaged were reportedly donated to the Salesian Convent in Castro Pretorio for use in a driveway. Today, the piazza is once again paved with the more common stone *sampietrini*.\n\n<<<wooden cobblestones>>>"
