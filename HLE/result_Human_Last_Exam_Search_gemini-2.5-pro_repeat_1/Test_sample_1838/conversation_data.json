    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that form the line.\n\nThe line starts at (1, 1) and ends at (11, 5).\n\nThe steps of Bresenham's algorithm will produce the following sequence of pixels:\n(1, 1)\n(2, 1)\n(3, 2)\n(4, 2)\n(5, 3)\n(6, 3)\n(7, 3)\n(8, 4)\n(9, 4)\n(10, 5)\n(11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this line. The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the list is (6, 3).\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
