    "Following the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule 20 times results in the binary pattern **11010000111011110001**.\n\nRule 110 is an elementary cellular automaton where the state of a cell, represented by a 0 or a 1, is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors in the previous step. The rule to determine the next state of the central cell is as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n|---|---|\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nThe evolution of Rule 110 from a single 'on' cell (a '1' surrounded by '0's) generates a specific sequence of patterns. These patterns, when read as binary numbers (ignoring trailing zeros), correspond to the integer sequence A006978 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nTo find the pattern at the 20th iteration, we look at the 20th term of the sequence A006978, which is 855,793. The binary representation of this number gives the resulting pattern.\n\nThe decimal number 855,793 is equivalent to the binary number 11010000111011110001. This is the pattern of active cells after 20 applications of Rule 110.\n\n<<<11010000111011110001>>>"
