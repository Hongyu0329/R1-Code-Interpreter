    "In quantum computing, there are two primary methods for encoding multiple logical qubits using surface codes: creating separate patches for each qubit or introducing defects, known as holes, into a single larger patch.\n\nIn the scenario described, a hybrid approach is used, involving two distinct patches of surface code, each containing defects (holes) to increase its capacity. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the properties of each patch and then summed.\n\nA single patch of surface code with two \"closed\" holes can encode two logical qubits. The holes, which are essentially areas where stabilizer measurements are turned off, create the topological features necessary to define the logical qubit states and operators. Therefore, a single patch with two such holes can store two logical qubits.\n\nSince the system consists of two independent patches of this type, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** 2 holes → 2 logical qubits\n*   **Patch 2:** 2 holes → 2 logical qubits\n\nThis results in a total capacity of four logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
