    "Before the armistice of June 22, 1940, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a German U-boat during World War II was the passenger liner **SS *Bretagne***. The vessel was sunk on October 14, 1939, by the German submarine U-45.\n\nThe *Bretagne* was a steam merchant ship with a Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) of 10,108 tons. While GRT measures a ship's internal volume and not its weight, it is often used as an indicator of a vessel's size. In the absence of specific displacement tonnage figures for all merchant ships of that era, the *Bretagne* stands out as the most significant loss in terms of overall size.\n\nSeveral other French vessels were also sunk by U-boats during this period. The only warship confirmed to have been sunk by a U-boat before the armistice was the submarine *Doris* (Q135), which was torpedoed by U-9 on May 8 or 9, 1940. The *Doris* had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons.\n\nOther notable French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in this timeframe include:\n*   ***Arijon***: A steam merchant of 4,374 GRT, sunk by U-43 on November 22, 1939.\n*   ***Quiberon***: A steam merchant of 1,296 tons, sunk by U-59 on January 19, 1940.\n\nThere is some ambiguity regarding the auxiliary cruiser *Charles Plumier*. While some sources list a displacement of 4,626 tons, historical records indicate that this ship was seized by the British in Gibraltar in November 1940 and was not sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, the passenger liner *Bretagne* was the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<SS Bretagne>>>"
