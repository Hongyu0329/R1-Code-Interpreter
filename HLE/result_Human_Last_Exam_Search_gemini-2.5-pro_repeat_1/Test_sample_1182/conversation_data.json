    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2, a multi-step analysis based on the theory of arithmetic of curves is required. The number of double points is the number of nodes in the special fiber of the stable model of the curve.\n\nFirst, the given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, as the degree of the polynomial in x is 5.\n\nThe process to find the stable reduction involves finding a minimal integral model of the curve and then analyzing its special fiber (its reduction modulo 2).\n1.  **Initial Model and its Discriminant:** The initial equation is $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The 2-adic valuation of its discriminant, a key invariant, is calculated to be 19. This high valuation indicates that the given model is not minimal.\n\n2.  **Finding a Minimal Model:** A sequence of transformations is applied to find a minimal model.\n    *   A first transformation $(x_1, y_1) = (x, (y-x)/2)$ yields the model $y_1^2 + x_1 y_1 = x_1^3 + x_1^4 + 2x_1 + 2x_1^5$. The discriminant valuation remains 19.\n    *   A second transformation $(x_2, y_2) = (x_1/2, y_1/2)$ leads to a new model: $y_2^2 + x_2y_2 - (x_2 + 2x_2^3 + 4x_2^4 + 16x_2^5) = 0$.\n    *   The 2-adic valuation of the discriminant of this new model is $19 - 12 = 7$. For a genus 2 curve, a model is considered minimal if the valuation of its discriminant is less than 12. Thus, this model is a minimal model.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Special Fiber:** The special fiber of this minimal model is found by reducing its equation modulo 2, which gives the curve $y_2^2 + x_2y_2 + x_2 = 0$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This curve can be shown to be a smooth rational curve (isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n4.  **Determining the Stable Reduction:** The theory of stable reduction, developed by Deligne, Mumford, and others, classifies the reduction types of curves. When a genus 2 curve has a minimal model whose special fiber is a smooth rational curve, this corresponds to a specific reduction type (often denoted as Type II or $I_1-II-0$).\n\nFor this type of reduction, the theory dictates that the stable reduction of the curve is obtained after a quadratic extension of the base field. The resulting stable fiber consists of two elliptic curves that intersect transversally at a single point. An elliptic curve is a smooth curve of genus 1. The union of two such curves intersecting at one point forms a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2, which matches the genus of the original curve.\n\nThe number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is the number of points where the components of the stable fiber intersect. In this case, the two elliptic curves intersect at one point.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has exactly one double point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
