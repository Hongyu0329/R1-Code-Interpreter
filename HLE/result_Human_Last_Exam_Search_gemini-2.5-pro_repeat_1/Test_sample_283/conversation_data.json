    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix and the algorithm for matrix-matrix multiplication using this representation.\n\n### HSS Matrix Structure\n\nAn HSS matrix is a rank-structured matrix that can be recursively partitioned into smaller submatrices. This hierarchical partitioning is represented by a binary tree, in this case, a tree of depth 4. The key idea of the HSS representation is that the off-diagonal blocks at each level of the hierarchy can be approximated by low-rank matrices, which allows for significant savings in storage and computational cost.\n\nInstead of storing the full matrix, an HSS matrix is stored as a collection of smaller generator matrices. The matrix multiplication algorithm then operates on these generators. The number of \"submatrices accessed\" refers to the total number of these fundamental generator matrices for the two input matrices being multiplied.\n\nA full binary tree of depth 4 has 5 levels of nodes (from level 0, the root, to level 4, the leaves).\n*   **Number of leaf nodes (level 4):** `2^4 = 16`\n*   **Number of internal nodes (levels 0, 1, 2, 3):** `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`\n\nThe HSS representation for a single matrix consists of the following sets of generator matrices:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Leaf Blocks (`D_i`):** At the lowest level (level 4), the diagonal blocks are typically stored as dense matrices. There is one such matrix for each of the 16 leaf nodes.\n2.  **Leaf Basis Matrices (`U_i`, `V_i`):** The HSS recursion requires a base case. The row and column basis matrices (`U_i` and `V_i`) for the 16 leaf nodes are stored explicitly. This amounts to `16 * 2 = 32` matrices.\n3.  **Translation Matrices (`R_c`, `B_c`):** For the hierarchy to work, there must be \"translation\" matrices that connect the bases of a child node to the bases of its parent. Every node that is a child (i.e., all nodes except the root) requires a set of translation matrices. In a tree of depth 4, the nodes at levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are child nodes. The total number of such nodes is `2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30`. For each of these 30 nodes, we store two translation matrices (`R` for the column bases and `B` for the row bases). This results in `30 * 2 = 60` matrices.\n4.  **Off-Diagonal Generator Matrices (`G_p`):** For each of the 15 internal nodes, the interaction between its children (the off-diagonal block) is stored in a compressed form. For a general non-symmetric matrix, this requires two generator matrices per internal node. This gives `15 * 2 = 30` matrices.\n\nSumming these up, the total number of generator submatrices for a single HSS matrix of depth 4 is:\n`16 (D) + 32 (U, V) + 60 (R, B) + 30 (G) = 138`\n\n### Matrix Multiplication\n\nThe HSS matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm, `C = A * B`, works by traversing the HSS trees of both matrices `A` and `B` and computing the generators for the resulting HSS matrix `C`. This process requires accessing all the stored generator matrices of both `A` and `B`.\n\nAssuming both matrices `A` and `B` are represented by an HSS tree of depth 4, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the submatrices in each:\n\nTotal Accessed Submatrices = (Submatrices in A) + (Submatrices in B)\nTotal Accessed Submatrices = 138 + 138 = 276\n\n<<<276>>>"
