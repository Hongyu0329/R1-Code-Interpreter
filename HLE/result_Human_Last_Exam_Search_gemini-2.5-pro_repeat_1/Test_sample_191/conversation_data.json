    "A protein that, when broken down or inhibited, allows for the increased engulfment of amyloid by macrophages is **Glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG)**.\n\nGMFG is an actin-disassembly protein found in immune cells. Research has shown that reducing the amount of GMFG in macrophages leads to an increase in their ability to phagocytose, or engulf, amyloid-β 42 (Aβ42), a key component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease. The breakdown of GMFG enhances the levels of a cell-surface receptor called scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI), which is involved in the clearance of amyloid-β. Therefore, the reduction of GMFG activity promotes the macrophage's ability to clear amyloid.\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-gamma (GMFG)>>>"
