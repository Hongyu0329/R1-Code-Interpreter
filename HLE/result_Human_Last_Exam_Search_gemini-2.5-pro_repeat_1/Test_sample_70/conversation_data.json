    "When viewed as matrices, a flag's linear algebraic rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in its design. For the rank of each flag to be maximal, we assume that each distinct color in a flag is assigned a unique numerical value.\n\n### The Rank of the Danish Flag\n\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, features a white Scandinavian cross on a red field. When represented as a matrix, its structure consists of two fundamental types of rows and columns, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross are composed of a single color (white).\n*   Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar are composed of two colors in a set pattern (red, white, red).\nThese two types of rows are linearly independent. Similarly, there are two types of linearly independent columns. Therefore, the linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### African Nations' Flags with Rank 2\n\nSeveral African nations have flags with designs that also result in a rank of 2. These flags typically fall into one of the following categories:\n*   **Bicolor flags:** Flags with two horizontal or two vertical stripes.\n*   **A-B-A stripe patterns:** Flags with three stripes where the outer two are the same color (e.g., green-white-green).\n*   **Emblem on a monochromatic field:** Flags with a single color background featuring a simple, central emblem.\n*   **Specific complex designs:** Flags whose combination of vertical and horizontal elements still resolves to two linearly independent vectors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following African flags share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria:** The flag is vertically divided into green and white, with a central red crescent and star. The fundamental structure is a vertical bicolor, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Angola:** The flag is horizontally divided into red and black, with a central emblem. This horizontal bicolor structure has a rank of 2.\n*   **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green band on the hoist side and two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) on the fly side. This design resolves to two linearly independent columns.\n*   **Burkina Faso:** The flag consists of two horizontal stripes, red and green, with a yellow star in the center. The two stripes give it a rank of 2.\n*   **Djibouti:** The flag features two horizontal stripes of blue and green, with a white triangle at the hoist. This structure results in two linearly independent columns.\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** The design consists of a vertical red band with a black star, and two horizontal stripes of yellow and green. This is structurally similar to the flag of Benin and has a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white stripe with two horizontal stripes of red and green. This design is also rank 2.\n*   **Mauritania:** The current flag features a green field with a gold crescent and star, with red bands at the top and bottom. This red-green-red pattern has two unique row types, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Morocco:** The flag is a solid red field with a green pentagram in the center. This design, an emblem on a monochromatic field, has two types of rows (all red, and red with green), giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Nigeria:** The flag consists of three vertical stripes of green, white, and green. This A-B-A pattern has only two unique column vectors, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **São Tomé and Príncipe:** The flag has a red triangle at the hoist and three horizontal stripes of green, yellow, and green, with two black stars on the yellow stripe. The underlying green-yellow-green structure combined with the triangle results in a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag is a light blue field with a single white star in the center. As an emblem on a monochromatic field, it has a rank of 2.\n*   **Tunisia:** The flag is a red field with a central white disk containing a red crescent and star. This design is another example of an emblem on a monochromatic field, giving it a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
