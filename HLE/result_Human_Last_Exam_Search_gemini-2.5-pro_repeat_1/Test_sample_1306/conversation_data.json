    "The question asks for the percentage of irreducible representations among all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations for the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. To answer this, we need to determine the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations and the total number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations.\n\n### 1. The Quantum Group and its Simple Representations\n\nThe algebra in question is the \"small\" quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, also known as the Frobenius-Lusztig kernel, specialized at a primitive third root of unity, $q$. The representation theory of this algebra is indexed by an integer $\\ell$, which is the smallest positive integer such that $q^{2\\ell}=1$. If $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, then $q^2=e^{4\\pi i/3}$, and the order of $q^2$ is 3. Thus, we have $\\ell=3$.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic simple (irreducible) modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is equal to $\\ell$. For $\\ell=3$, there are exactly **three** irreducible representations. These are often denoted as $L_1, L_2, L_3$, with dimensions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\n### 2. Indecomposable Representations and Representation Type\n\nThe classification of all indecomposable modules depends on the \"representation type\" of the algebra. An algebra can be of finite, tame, or wild representation type.\n\n*   **Finite Type**: Has a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   **Tame Type**: Has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, but they can be classified and fall into a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension.\n*   **Wild Type**: The classification of its indecomposable modules is an unsolved problem. It is considered as complicated as classifying representations of any finitely generated algebra. A key feature of wild type algebras is the existence of continuous families of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n\nFor the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the representation type depends on the parameter $\\ell$:\n*   For $\\ell=1, 2$, the algebra is of tame representation type.\n*   For $\\ell \\ge 3$, the algebra is of **wild representation type**.\n\nSince we are considering $q$ as a primitive third root of unity, we have $\\ell=3$. Therefore, the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is of wild representation type.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Percentage\n\nAn algebra of wild representation type has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. This is because the classification problem contains, as a subproblem, the classification of pairs of matrices up to simultaneous conjugation, which admits continuous families of solutions.\n\nSo, in our case:\n*   The number of irreducible objects in the category $C$ is **3**.\n*   The total number of objects in the category $C$ (the indecomposable representations) is **infinite**.\n\nThe percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible is the ratio of the number of irreducible modules to the total number of indecomposable modules. This ratio is:\n\n$$ \\frac{3}{\\infty} = 0 $$\n\nTherefore, 0% of the objects in the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations are irreducible.\n\n<<<0>>>"
