    "**The first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is Genesis, and it is mentioned in *The Second Part of King Henry VI*.**\n\nIn Act II, Scene 2 of *The Second Part of King Henry VI*, the Duke of York, in explaining his claim to the throne, says, \"Which is posted as the book of Genesis.\" This is the earliest instance in Shakespeare's plays, according to scholarly consensus on their chronological order, where a canonical book of the Bible is explicitly named. The play is believed to have been written around 1591.\n\nWhile Shakespeare's works are rich with biblical allusions, with a significant number of references to the book of Genesis, direct naming of the books is less frequent. For instance, the story of Cain and Abel, from Genesis, is referenced numerous times across his plays. Characters in early plays like *Titus Andronicus* and *The Comedy of Errors* allude to events and figures from Genesis, but the book itself is not named.\n\nIn *Love's Labour's Lost*, a play also from the early 1590s, the word \"Numbers\" appears, but it is used in the context of poetry and verse, not as a reference to the biblical Book of Numbers. This same play features a schoolmaster named Holofernes, a name taken from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith. Additionally, the pageant of the \"Nine Worthies\" mentioned in *Love's Labour's Lost* includes biblical figures, but does not name the specific books from which they come.\n\nAnother early play, *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*, contains allusions to the stories of Jonah and the travels of Saint Paul as recorded in the Book of Acts, but again, the books are not mentioned by name. Later plays also contain biblical references, such as a debated allusion to Deuteronomy in *Henry V* and a reference to \"Jacob's staff\" from Genesis in *The Merchant of Venice*. However, the explicit mention in *The Second Part of King Henry VI* predates these.\n\n<<<The Second Part of King Henry VI>>>"
