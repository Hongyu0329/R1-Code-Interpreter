    "The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\nwhere the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nFirst, we analyze the kernel. The expression `(xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be written as a sum of a geometric series:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`. The kernel is also symmetric, meaning `K(x, y) = K(y, x)`.\n\nLet `L` be the integral operator defined by `L(f)(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y) f(y) dy`. The integral equation can be written in operator notation as `u = 1 + λLu`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a given `λ`, this equation has a unique solution if the homogeneous equation `φ - λLφ = 0` has only the trivial solution `φ = 0`. If the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions (i.e., `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the operator `L`), then the inhomogeneous equation `u - λLu = 1` has a solution if and only if the function `f(x) = 1` is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions `φ` corresponding to the eigenvalue `1/λ`. The inner product is defined as `⟨f, g⟩ = ∫₀¹ f(x)g(x)dx`.\n\nThe equation has **no solution** if `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `L` and for at least one corresponding eigenfunction `φ`, we have `⟨1, φ⟩ ≠ 0`.\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of `L`. The eigenvalue equation is `L(φ) = μφ`, where `μ = 1/λ`.\n`∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) φ(y) dy = μφ(x)`\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k φ(y) dy = μφ(x)`\n\nThis equation implies that any eigenfunction `φ(x)` must be a polynomial in `x` of degree at most `n-1`. Let `φ(x) = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j x^j`, where `α_j` are constants.\n\nSubstituting this into the eigenvalue equation:\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j y^j) dy = μ ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j x^j`\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j ∫₀¹ y^(k+j) dy) = μ ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j x^j`\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j / (k+j+1)) = μ ∑_m α_m x^m`\n\nLet's equate the coefficients of `x^m` on both sides. On the left side, the coefficient of `x^m` corresponds to the term where `m = n-1-k`, so `k = n-1-m`.\n`∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j / (n-1-m+j+1) = μ α_m`\n`∑_(j=0)^(n-1) α_j / (n-m+j) = μ α_m`\n\nThis is a matrix eigenvalue problem `Hα = μα`, where `α` is the column vector of coefficients `[α_0, α_1, ..., α_(n-1)]ᵀ`, and `H` is an `n x n` matrix with entries:\n`H_(mj) = 1 / (n-m+j)` for `m, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe values `μ = 1/λ` for which the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions are the eigenvalues of this matrix `H`.\n\nNow we check the condition for no solution: `⟨1, φ⟩ ≠ 0`.\n`⟨1, φ⟩ = ∫₀¹ 1 ⋅ (∑_(m=0)^(n-1) α_m x^m) dx = ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) α_m ∫₀¹ x^m dx = ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) α_m / (m+1)`\n\nThus, the equation has no solution if `λ = 1/μ`, where `μ` is an eigenvalue of `H`, and the corresponding eigenvector `α` satisfies `∑_(m=0)^(n-1) α_m / (m+1) ≠ 0`.\n\nLet's examine for small `n`:\n*   **Case n=1:** `H` is a `1x1` matrix: `H_(00) = 1/(1-0+0) = 1`. The only eigenvalue is `μ=1`. So `λ=1`. The eigenvector is `α = [α_0]`. The condition is `α_0/1 ≠ 0`, which is true for an eigenvector. Thus, for `n=1`, `λ=1` is the only value for which there is no solution.\n*   **Case n=2:** `H` is a `2x2` matrix: `H = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The characteristic equation is `(1/2-μ)² - 1/3 = 0`, which gives eigenvalues `μ = (3 ± 2√3)/6`. The corresponding `λ` values are `λ = 1/μ = 6/(3 ± 2√3) = -6 ∓ 4√3`. The eigenvectors can be found to be `[1, √3]ᵀ` and `[1, -√3]ᵀ` respectively. For these eigenvectors, the condition `α_0/1 + α_1/2` becomes `1 + √3/2 ≠ 0` and `1 - √3/2 ≠ 0`. Both are true. So for `n=2`, the values are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nIn general, it can be shown that the condition `⟨1, φ⟩ ≠ 0` holds for all eigenfunctions of the operator `L`. Therefore, the equation has no solution for all `λ` that are reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `H`.\n\n<<<The equation has no solutions for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `H` whose elements are given by `H_(mj) = 1/(n-m+j)` for `m, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`."
