    "To determine how many edge squares would lack bishops, we first need to establish the total number of edge squares and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares consist of all the squares in the first and last rows (ranks 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (files 'a' and 'h'). This amounts to a total of 28 squares (8+8+6+6).\n\nThe problem then becomes a classic chess puzzle: finding the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a board without any bishop attacking another. For a standard 8x8 board, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops is 14. This is calculated with the formula 2n - 2, where 'n' is the number of rows or columns. For an 8x8 board, this is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14.\n\nIt is possible to place all 14 of these non-attacking bishops on the edge squares. One common solution, for instance, places the bishops on all the squares of one entire edge file (e.g., the 'a' file) and the adjacent file (the 'b' file), and then removes those that can attack each other. A simpler method to visualize the placement of 14 non-attacking bishops involves placing them on all the squares of the first rank and all the squares of the last rank, and then removing the two bishops that can attack each other diagonally.\n\nSince the two players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, they placed 14 bishops.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares without bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\nTotal edge squares: 28\nNumber of placed bishops: 14\nEdge squares lacking bishops: 28 - 14 = 14\n\nTherefore, 14 edge squares would be left without bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
