  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "To determine the maximum length of the secret message, we must first understand the encoding system. The problem describes a scenario where symbols from one system (the Ching) are used to represent characters from another (the Shu).\n\n### 1. The \"Ciphertext\" Alphabet\nThe Ching contains 9,999 symbols. These symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing.\" This implies a combination of two sets of concepts:\n*   **Yinyang**: Consists of two possibilities, yin and yang.\n*   **Wuxing**: These are the Five Elements or Phases: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n\nBy combining these, we get 2 (yinyang) Ã— 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire, yin-wood, etc.). This set of 10 symbols forms the alphabet of the \"ciphertext.\"\n\n### 2. The \"Plaintext\" Alphabet\nThe secret message is written using characters from the Shu. While the Shu contains many characters, the message uses a specific set of the 120 most common ancient Chinese characters. This set of 120 characters is the alphabet for the \"plaintext\" message.\n\n### 3. The Encoding Scheme\nTo encrypt the message, a sequence of symbols from the Ching must be used to represent a single character from the Shu. We need to find the minimum number of Ching symbols required to represent any of the 120 possible characters.\n\nLet `N` be the number of Ching symbols needed to encode one message character. With an alphabet of 10 symbols, the number of possible combinations using `N` symbols is 10<sup>N</sup>. This number must be large enough to assign a unique code to each of the 120 characters.\n\n*   If N = 1, we can represent 10<sup>1</sup> = 10 characters. This is not enough.\n*   If N = 2, we can represent 10<sup>2</sup> = 100 characters. This is still not enough.\n*   If N = 3, we can represent 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 characters. This is more than the 120 needed, so it is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, a sequence of 3 yinyang-wuxing symbols is required to encode one character of the secret message.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Maximum Message Length\nThe Ching provides a total of 9,999 symbols. Since each character of the message requires 3 of these symbols, we can find the maximum length of the message by dividing the total number of symbols by the number of symbols per character.\n\nMaximum Message Length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character\nMaximum Message Length = 9,999 / 3 = 3,333\n\nThe irrelevant numerical data, such as the total number of characters in the Shu (around 3,000) and the various computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns), do not affect the calculation of the message's maximum possible length.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
