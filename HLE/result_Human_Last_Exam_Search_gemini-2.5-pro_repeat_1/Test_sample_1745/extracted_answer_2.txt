The expression for the Electrical double-layer (EDL) potential distribution, $\psi(y)$, in a parallel-plate microchannel is governed by the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation, assuming low zeta potentials. The problem specifies a 1D scenario where the potential only varies in the direction perpendicular to the plates (let's call it the y-direction).

The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is:
$\frac{d^2 \psi}{dy^2} = k^2 \psi$

Here, $\psi$ is the EDL potential and $k$ is the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter.

The microchannel has a height $H$. We can set the coordinate system such that the bottom plate is at $y=0$ and the top plate is at $y=H$.

The boundary conditions for the potential are given by the slip-dependent zeta potentials at the surfaces.
At the bottom surface (j=1), the zeta potential is $\zeta_1 = z_1(1+\beta k)$.
So, the boundary condition at $y=0$ is: $\psi(0) = \zeta_1 = z_1(1+\beta k)$.

At the top surface (j=2), the problem states that $z_2=0$. This implies the zeta potential $\zeta_2=0$.
So, the boundary condition at $y=H$ is: $\psi(H) = 0$.

The general solution to the second-order linear differential equation is:
$\psi(y) = A \cosh(ky) + B \sinh(ky)$

We apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A and B.

1.  Applying the first boundary condition at $y=0$:
    $\psi(0) = A \cosh(0) + B \sinh(0)$
    $z_1(1+\beta k) = A(1) + B(0)$
    $A = z_1(1+\beta k)$

2.  Applying the second boundary condition at $y=H$:
    $\psi(H) = A \cosh(kH) + B \sinh(kH) = 0$
    Substituting the value of A we found:
    $z_1(1+\beta k) \cosh(kH) + B \sinh(kH) = 0$
    $B = -z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\cosh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)}$

Now, we substitute the constants A and B back into the general solution:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \cosh(ky) - z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\cosh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)} \sinh(ky)$

Factoring out the common term $z_1(1+\beta k)$:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \left( \cosh(ky) - \frac{\cosh(kH)}{\sinh(kH)} \sinh(ky) \right)$

To simplify this expression, we find a common denominator:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(kH)\cosh(ky) - \cosh(kH)\sinh(ky)}{\sinh(kH)}$

Using the hyperbolic trigonometric identity $\sinh(a-b) = \sinh(a)\cosh(b) - \cosh(a)\sinh(b)$, we can simplify the numerator:
$\sinh(kH)\cosh(ky) - \cosh(kH)\sinh(ky) = \sinh(kH-ky) = \sinh(k(H-y))$

Therefore, the final expression for the electrical double-layer potential distribution is:
$\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)}$
