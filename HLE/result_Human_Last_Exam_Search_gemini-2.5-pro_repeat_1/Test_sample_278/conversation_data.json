    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given curve, we first need to determine the extent of the figure in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:\n    $x = \\cos(t)$\n    $y = \\sin(t)$\n    This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin. In this interval, $x$ ranges from -1 to 1, and $y$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n2.
