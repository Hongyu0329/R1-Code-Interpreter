    "To solve the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$, we must consider the multi-valued nature of the complex power $i^z$.\n\nThe definition of a complex power is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is a multi-valued function, defined as $\\log a = \\text{Log } a + 2\\pi i k$ for any integer $k$, where $\\text{Log } a$ is the principal value of the logarithm.\n\nFor the imaginary unit $i$, its principal logarithm is $\\text{Log } i = \\ln|i| + i \\text{Arg}(i) = \\ln(1) + i\\frac{\\pi}{2} = i\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nTherefore, the expression $i^z$ can take on a set of values:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z(i\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi i k)} = e^{iz(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k)}$ for any integer $k$.\n\nThe problem is to find all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for which there exists an integer $k$ satisfying the equation. Let's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k$. The equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{izC_k}$\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can introduce a substitution. Let $w = iz$. This implies $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$.\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n$(-iw) \\cdot i = e^{wC_k}$\n$w = e^{wC_k}$\n\nThis form of the equation is related to the Lambert W function, which is defined by the equation $W(a)e^{W(a)} = a$. The function $W$ is multi-valued, and its branches are denoted by $W_n$ for integers $n$.\n\nTo transform our equation into the form defining the Lambert W function, we rearrange it:\n$w = e^{wC_k}$\n$1 = \\frac{e^{wC_k}}{w} = w^{-1}e^{wC_k}$\n$1 = \\frac{1}{w} e^{wC_k}$\n$w = e^{wC_k}$\n$-wC_k e^{-wC_k} = -C_k$\nLet $X = -wC_k$. The equation becomes $X e^X = -C_k$.\nBy the definition of the Lambert W function, the solutions for $X$ are:\n$X = W_n(-C_k)$ for any integer branch $n$ of the Lambert W function.\n\nSubstituting back $X = -wC_k$, we have:\n$-wC_k = W_n(-C_k)$\n$w = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nFinally, substituting back $z = -iw$, we find the solutions for $z$:\n$z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = \\frac{i W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nThe complete set of solutions for the original equation is the set of all values $z$ generated by this formula for all possible integer values of $k$ and $n$:\n$z_{k,n} = \\frac{i W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k}$ for $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe can identify some specific solutions without resorting to the Lambert W function.\n\n**1. Real Solutions**\nLet's test for $z=1$:\nLeft side: $1 \\cdot i = i$.\nRight side: $i^1 = e^{1 \\cdot \\log i} = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k)} = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}e^{2\\pi ik} = i \\cdot 1 = i$.\nThe equation $i=i$ is true for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n\nLet's test for $z=-1$:\nLeft side: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$.\nRight side: $i^{-1} = e^{-1 \\cdot \\log i} = e^{-i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k)} = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}e^{-2\\pi ik} = (-i) \\cdot 1 = -i$.\nThe equation $-i=-i$ is true for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**2. Purely Imaginary Solutions**\nLet $z=iy$ for some real number $y$.\nThe equation becomes $(iy)i = i^{iy}$.\n$-y = e^{iy(i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k))} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k)} = e^{-yC_k}$.\nWe are looking for real solutions $y$ to the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for some integer $k$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k > 0$. The function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$ has a positive minimum value, so there are no real solutions for $y$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. The function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$ is strictly increasing from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, so there exists a unique real solution $y_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$. For $y=0$, $f(0)=1$, so the root $y_k$ must be negative.\n\nThis gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique (negative) real solution to $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k)}$.\n\nAll these specific solutions are contained within the general formula involving the Lambert W function. For example, for $k \\le -1$, the argument of the W function $-C_k$ is real and positive. This means the branch $W_0$ gives a real value, leading to a purely imaginary solution for $z$. The other branches $W_n$ for $n\\neq 0$ are complex, leading to solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n\nThe complete set of solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ is given by:\n$z = \\frac{i W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k}$\nfor all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThis set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite number of purely imaginary solutions, and an infinite number of other complex solutions.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is given by $z = \\frac{i W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi k}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, as well as infinite sets of purely imaginary and other complex solutions.>>>"
