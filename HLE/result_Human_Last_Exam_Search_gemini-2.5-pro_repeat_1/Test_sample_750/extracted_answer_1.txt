The set of all solutions for $z\in\mathbb{C}$ is given by $z = \frac{i W_n(-(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k))}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, as well as infinite sets of purely imaginary and other complex solutions.
