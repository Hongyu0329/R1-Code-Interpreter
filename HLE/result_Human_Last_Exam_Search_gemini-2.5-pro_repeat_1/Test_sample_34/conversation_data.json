    "Based on a common GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy for a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x is J5s.\n\nOne poker coaching resource explicitly states that a button raising range includes \"suited jacks down to J5s\". This indicates that J5s is the weakest suited jack that is still considered a standard open from this position under these conditions. Weaker suited jacks like J4s, J3s, and J2s would typically be folded.\n\nIt is important to remember that this is based on a GTO baseline. In practice, you might adjust your opening range based on the tendencies of the players in the blinds. For example, against tighter opponents, you might profitably open even wider, while against very aggressive opponents who 3-bet frequently, you might tighten your range.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
