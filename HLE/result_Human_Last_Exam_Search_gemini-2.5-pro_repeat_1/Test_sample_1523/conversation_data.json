    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by \\( \\phi \\), is expressed through a functional integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time with a period \\( \\beta = 1/T \\), where \\( T \\) is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function \\( Z \\) is given by:\n\\( Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]} \\)\n\nHere, \\( S_E[\\phi] \\) represents the Euclidean action of the scalar field. For a free or non-interacting neutral scalar field with mass \\( m \\), the Euclidean action is:\n\\( S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right] \\)\nwhere \\( \\tau \\) is the imaginary time.\n\nTo identify the inner product \\( (\\phi, D\\phi) \\), we can rewrite the action by performing an integration by parts on the kinetic term, assuming appropriate boundary conditions. This brings the action into a quadratic form:\n\\( S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2)\\phi \\)\n\nThis expression is in the form of \\( \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi) \\). The inner product \\( (\\phi, \\psi) \\) in this context is defined as the integral over imaginary time and space of the product of the two fields:\n\\( (\\phi, \\psi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x, \\tau) \\psi(x, \\tau) \\)\n\nFrom this, we can identify the operator \\( D \\) as the differential operator acting on \\( \\phi \\) within the integral.\n\nTherefore, the inner product \\( (\\phi, D\\phi) \\) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is given by the expression:\n<<<(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x, \\tau)(-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2)\\phi(x, \\tau)>>>"
