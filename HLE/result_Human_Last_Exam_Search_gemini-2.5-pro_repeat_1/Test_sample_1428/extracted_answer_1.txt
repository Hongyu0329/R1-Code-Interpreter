The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is $P(i, t+1) = p \cdot P(i-1, t) + q \cdot P(i+1, t) + r \cdot P(i, t)$. The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ has elements $A_{i,i-1} = p$, $A_{i,i+1} = q$, and $A_{i,i} = r$ (with indices modulo N), and is a circulant matrix. The eigenvectors are indeed $e^{ijk_n}$ with $k_n = 2\pi n/N$, and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = p e^{-ik_n} + q e^{ik_n} + r$. For a symmetric walk ($p=q=1/2, r=0$), the eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, which is $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$.
