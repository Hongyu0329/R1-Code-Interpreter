    "A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512, we must count its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, has the presentation:\nSD_512 = < a, b | a^256 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^127 >\n\nThe elements of this group are of the form `a^i` or `a^i * b` for `0 <= i < 256`. We can find the cyclic subgroups by examining the subgroups generated by each of these elements.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `a^i`:**\n    These elements form a cyclic subgroup `<a>` of order 256. A cyclic group of order n has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of n. Since 256 = 2^8, the number of divisors is 8 + 1 = 9. These 9 subgroups are generated by elements `a^(2^k)` for k = 0, 1, ..., 8. This gives us 9 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `a^i * b`:**\n    To find the subgroups these elements generate, we first need their orders. The order of an element `g = a^i * b` depends on whether `i` is even or odd.\n    *   The square of `g` is `(a^i * b)^2 = a^(128i)`.\n    *   If `i` is even (i.e., `i = 2k`), then `(a^(2k) * b)^2 = a^(256k) = 1`. These elements have an order of 2. There are 128 such elements (for k from 0 to 127), and each generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives us 128 distinct subgroups.\n    *   If `i` is odd (i.e., `i = 2k + 1`), then `(a^(2k+1) * b)^2 = a^(128(2k+1)) = a^128`. Since this is not the identity, the order is not 2. However, `(a^i * b)^4 = (a^128)^2 = 1`, so these elements have an order of 4. There are 128 such elements (for odd `i` from 1 to 255). Each cyclic subgroup of order 4 has two generators. Therefore, these 128 elements form 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are distinct from those in `<a>` because they contain elements not in `<a>`.\n\nAdding up the distinct cyclic subgroups from all cases:\n*   9 subgroups from `<a>`.\n*   128 subgroups of order 2 from elements `a^i * b` with `i` even.\n*   64 subgroups of order 4 from elements `a^i * b` with `i` odd.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
