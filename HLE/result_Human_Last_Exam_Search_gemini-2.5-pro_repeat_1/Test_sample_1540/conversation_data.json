    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency in C, the strategy is to avoid storing both strings in memory at the same time. We can read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string character by character, performing the comparison on the fly. This eliminates the need for a second 101-byte buffer that a more straightforward approach would use.\n\nAdditionally, we will use the smallest possible data types for our variables. A `char` is sufficient for the loop index, as the string length will not exceed 100.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case,\n * in a memory-efficient way.\n *\n * It reads the first string into a buffer `s1`. Then, it reads the\n * second string one character at a time using getchar(), comparing it\n * with the corresponding character in `s1`. This avoids allocating a\n * second buffer for the second string.\n *\n * Variables are chosen to be of the smallest possible data type to\n * further conserve memory.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer to store the first string (up to 100 chars + 1 null terminator).\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // scanf leaves a newline character ('\\n') in the input stream.\n    // This getchar() consumes it, preparing for the character-by-character\n    // read of the second string.\n    getchar();\n\n    // A 'char' is sufficient for the loop index since the string length is <= 100.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // A 'char' to hold the current character from the second string.\n    char char2;\n\n    // Loop until the end of the first string. The problem guarantees equal lengths.\n    // The cast to (unsigned char) is a safe way to handle array indexing with a char.\n    while (s1[(unsigned char)i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read a single character for the second string.\n        char2 = getchar();\n\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        // The cast to (unsigned char) is necessary for ctype functions to work\n        // correctly with all possible char values.\n        int lower1 = tolower((unsigned char)s1[(unsigned char)i]);\n        int lower2 = tolower((unsigned char)char2);\n\n        // If the first string is smaller, print -1 and exit.\n        if (lower1 < lower2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If the first string is larger, print 1 and exit.\n        if (lower1 > lower2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, continue to the next.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: An array to store the first string. It requires 101 bytes (100 for characters and 1 for the null terminator).\n*   **`char i;`**: The loop index. As a `char`, it uses 1 byte.\n*   **`char char2;`**: The variable to store a character from the second string. As a `char`, it uses 1 byte.\n*   **`int lower1`, `int lower2`**: These variables hold the temporary result of the `tolower` function. A compliant compiler will likely optimize their storage into CPU registers, not requiring additional stack memory. Even if they were allocated on the stack, their scope is within the `while` loop, but for the most conservative count of explicitly declared variables, we focus on those declared at the top level of the function. The core memory footprint is defined by the buffers and persistent variables. For the purpose of this problem, we count the variables declared at the function scope.\n\nThe total memory `m` for the variables declared is:\nm = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(char2) = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
