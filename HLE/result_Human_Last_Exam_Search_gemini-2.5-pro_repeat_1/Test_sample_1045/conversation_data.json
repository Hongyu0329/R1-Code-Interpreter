    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, we need to find the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted Gaussian functions (a split-valence double-zeta basis). These correspond to the 1s orbital being described by two functions, one composed of 3 primitive Gaussians and the other of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom is represented by 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This includes one function for the 1s core orbital (a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussians) and four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz), each split into two functions (a double-zeta representation). The inner part of the valence shell is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian. This results in 1 (core) + 4 * 2 (valence) = 9 functions.\n\nCalculation for Toluene (C7H8):\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total functions:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nTherefore, a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene.\n\n<<<79>>>"
