    "The haiku's riddle is solved by deciphering its three lines, which point to a significant historical event, and then understanding the question posed by the title to find an answer that is in alphabetical order.\n\nThe haiku reads:\n\"An August tempest\nTwice fifteen brings winds of change\nA divine one yields\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as follows:\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This refers to the final conflict and turmoil surrounding the end of a historical era. This turmoil occurred in the month of August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty, pointing to the pivotal year 30 BC. This year marked a profound \"wind of change\" as it saw the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the absorption of Egypt into the Roman Empire.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This alludes to Cleopatra VII, the last pharaoh of Egypt. Cleopatra was considered a living goddess by her people. Her suicide in August of 30 BC was the ultimate act of yielding to the victorious Octavian.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is posed as a question. In ancient Rome, wreaths made from bay laurel were a symbol of victory and triumph. The question therefore alludes to the outcome of the events described in the haiku—the victory of Octavian (the future Emperor Augustus) over Cleopatra.\n\nThe challenge requires the answer to be in alphabetical order. The fitting word that describes the new era of protection and power under Octavian, and whose letters are in alphabetical order, is **Aegis**. The term \"aegis\" refers to protection or support and is famously associated with the shield of the gods Zeus and Athena, symbolizing divine power. Octavian's victory ushered in the *Pax Romana*, or Roman Peace, placing the Roman world under his protective \"aegis.\"\n\n<<<AEGIS>>>"
