    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler was the Battle of Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917. The painting is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, was a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. While many of her well-known works depict 19th-century conflicts, such as the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, she continued to paint scenes of contemporary military events into the 20th century. Her work often focused on the pathos and heroism of the common soldier.\n\nOther battles from the First World War that she depicted include:\n*   **The Retreat from Mons**, which occurred in 1914.\n*   **The Battle of Loos**, specifically an event in September 1915 involving the London Irish Rifles, which she captured in a watercolour titled *A London Irish at Loos* (1916).\n\nThe Charge at Huj, part of the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the First World War, was one of the last great cavalry charges of the British Army. Lady Butler's depiction of this event stands as the representation of the most recent historical battle in her extensive portfolio of military art.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj (Battle of Huj, 1917)>>>"
