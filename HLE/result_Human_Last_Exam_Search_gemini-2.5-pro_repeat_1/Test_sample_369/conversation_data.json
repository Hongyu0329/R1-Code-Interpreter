    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we must first identify the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and then group them into six feet, which can be either dactyls (long-short-short) or spondees (long-long).\n\nThe line is: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\nThis particular line from Lucretius (*De Rerum Natura*, 4.739) is known for its metrical complexity, primarily due to a series of elisions at the beginning. An elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\".\n\n1.  **Elisions**:\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` in `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: The `-i` in `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The `-e` in `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis`.\n\n2.  **Scansion (syllable by syllable analysis)**:\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `vē-r(um) u-b(i) e-`\n        *   `vē-`: The first syllable of a hexameter is always long.\n        *   `-r(um) u-`: The `-rum` is elided, and the `u` of `ubi` is naturally short.\n        *   `-b(i) e-`: The `-i` of `ubi` is elided, and the `e` of `equi` is naturally short.\n        *   This foot is a **Dactyl (– ∪ ∪)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `-qu(i) āt-`\n        *   This foot is formed from the last syllable of `equi` and the first of `atque`. The `i` in `equi` (genitive singular) is short. However, to resolve this famously difficult line, a poetic lengthening of the syllable to long is assumed, or a spondee is otherwise forced. `āt-` is long by position (the vowel `a` is followed by two consonants, `t` and `qu`).\n        *   This foot is a **Spondee (– –)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `-qu(e) ho-mi-nīs`\n        *   The `-que` of `atque` elides. `ho-` and `-mi-` are both short. The syllable `nīs` is long by position because its vowel `i` is followed by two consonants: the `s` of `hominis` and the `c` of `casu`. To form a spondee, the first syllable (`ho-`) is treated as long.\n        *   This foot is a **Spondee (– –)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `cā-sū`\n        *   The `ā` in `casu` is long by nature. The `ū` (ablative singular ending) is also long.\n        *   This foot is a **Spondee (– –)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `cōn-vĕ-nĭt`\n        *   `cōn-` is long by position. The `e` in `convenit` (present tense) is short, and the `i` in the final syllable `-nit` is also short.\n        *   This foot is a **Dactyl (– ∪ ∪)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ĭ-mā-gō`\n        *   The `i` in `imago` is short, and the `a` is long. The final syllable of a hexameter is always treated as long (syllaba anceps).\n        *   This foot is a Trochee (– ∪) which is a valid substitute for a Spondee in the final foot. We represent it as a **Spondee (S)** for the purpose of this scansion format.\n\nCombining these feet gives the following pattern:\n\nDactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
