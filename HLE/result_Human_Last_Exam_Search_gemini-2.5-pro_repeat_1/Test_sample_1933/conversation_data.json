    "The VC dimension of a logical language measures its expressive power in classifying elements of a domain. For the first-order fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ over a schema $S$ with 4 unary predicates, the VC dimension is determined by the number of ways these predicates can be combined to define sets.\n\n### Analysis of the Logical Fragment\n\nThe language in question is constructed as follows:\n*   **Schema S**: Contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate defines a property, and its interpretation in a model is the set of elements that have this property.\n*   **Logical Connectives**: Only conjunction (`∧`), along with the constants for true (`⊤`) and false (`⊥`), are permitted. Crucially, negation (`¬`) and disjunction (`∨`) are not allowed.\n*   **Quantifiers**: Only the existential quantifier (`∃`) is allowed.\n\nA \"concept\" is a set of elements defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is the size of the largest set of elements that can be \"shattered\" by the concepts definable in the language. A set $Y$ is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there exists a definable concept that contains exactly that subset of $Y$.\n\nThe formulas $\\phi(x)$ in this language are restricted. Any existential quantification over a variable other than $x$ results in a sentence that is either true or false for the entire model, effectively reducing to `⊤` or `⊥`. For example, the formula $P_1(x) \\land \\exists y P_2(y)$ is equivalent to $P_1(x)$ if there is at least one element satisfying $P_2$, and equivalent to `⊥` (the empty set) otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the concepts are effectively defined by quantifier-free formulas, which, due to the lack of negation and disjunction, can only be conjunctions of the atomic predicates. The definable concepts are thus the sets formed by the intersections of the base sets corresponding to the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$.\n\n### Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of all sets that can be defined by a formula in the language. These are of the form:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I} \\mathcal{P}_i$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}_i$ is the set of elements satisfying predicate $P_i$, and $I$ is any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This includes the case where $I$ is empty, which corresponds to the formula `⊤` and defines the entire universe of elements.\n\nFor a concept class defined by all possible intersections of $k$ base sets, the VC dimension is exactly $k$. In this problem, we have $k=4$ base sets (the interpretations of the 4 unary predicates).\n\nTo demonstrate this:\n1.  **Lower Bound (VC-dim ≥ 4)**: We can construct a set of 4 points that is shattered. Let the points be $\\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. We can define the predicates such that $P_i$ contains all points except $y_i$. To select an arbitrary subset, for instance $\\{y_1, y_3\\}$, we can use the concept defined by the formula $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$. The intersection of the sets for $P_2$ and $P_4$ will contain precisely $\\{y_1, y_3\\}$. This works for any subset of the four points, proving that a set of size 4 can be shattered.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound (VC-dim < 5)**: To shatter a set of size 5, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ distinct subsets. However, our concept class is formed by taking intersections of 4 base sets. The number of possible non-empty intersections is given by the number of non-empty subsets of $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, which is $2^4 - 1 = 15$. Including the whole universe (from the empty intersection), we have at most $16$ distinct definable sets. Since $16 < 32$, we cannot generate all possible subsets of a 5-element set. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and less than 5, it must be exactly 4. This conclusion is supported by the Sauer-Shelah Lemma, which relates the size of a concept class to its VC dimension.\n\n<<<4>>>"
