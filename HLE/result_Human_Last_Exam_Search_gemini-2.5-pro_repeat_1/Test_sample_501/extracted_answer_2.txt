The force law for the attraction between the polymer ends is:
$F(x) = \frac{2E(0)x}{n(n-1)\ell^2} \exp\left(\frac{x^2}{n(n-1)\ell^2}\right)$
where:
*   $x$ is the separation of the ends.
*   $E(0)$ is the kinetic energy of the polymer at zero separation.
*   $n$ is the number of mass points (with $n$ being large).
*   $\ell$ is the length of the struts between mass points.
