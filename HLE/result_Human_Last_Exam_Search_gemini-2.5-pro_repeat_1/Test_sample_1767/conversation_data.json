    "When two Chern insulators with the same Chern number are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction, interpreted as the number of chiral edge states at the interface, is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is a direct result of the bulk-boundary correspondence principle in the study of topological materials. This principle dictates that the number of robust, conducting edge states that form at the interface between two topologically distinct regions is equal to the difference in their topological invariants, in this case, the Chern number.\n\nFor the given scenario, we have two Chern insulators, let's call them region 1 and region 2.\n*   The Chern number of region 1 is C₁ = 1.\n*   The Chern number of region 2 is C₂ = 1.\n\nAccording to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of chiral edge states (N) at the junction between these two regions is given by:\n\nN = |C₁ - C₂|\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nN = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nTherefore, no topologically protected chiral edge states are formed at the junction where the two Chern insulators meet. While each Chern insulator individually hosts chiral edge states on its external boundaries, the interface between them is trivial from a topological perspective because there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction. The negligible tunneling barrier ensures that the two systems are effectively a single, larger system with a uniform Chern number of 1, and thus no internal boundaries with distinct topological properties exist.\n\n<<<0>>>"
