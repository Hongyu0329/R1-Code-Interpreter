A functional MRI coil might not show resonance when probed with a magnetic loop antenna due to several factors. The most likely reason is that the coil's active detuning circuit is engaged, which alters the coil's resonant frequency or dampens it to prevent RF heating and image artifacts during the MRI's transmit phase. When disconnected from the scanner, this circuit can default to a detuned state. Additionally, MRI coils are designed to operate when "loaded" by a patient or phantom; an unloaded coil may have a shifted or unstable resonance. Modern coils also feature advanced designs that can impede measurement. Shielded loop coils and decoupled elements in phased arrays are designed to minimize external coupling. Furthermore, coils with non-traditional geometries, such as dipole antennas or quadrature coils, may not couple effectively with a simple magnetic loop probe.
