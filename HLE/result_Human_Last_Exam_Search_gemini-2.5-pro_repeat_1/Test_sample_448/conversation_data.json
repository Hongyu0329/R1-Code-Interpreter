    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\nThe abundance of noble gases in the Earth's atmosphere and crust determines their overall percentage in terrestrial matter. Of the naturally occurring noble gases, radon is the rarest. This is due to its radioactive nature and short half-life. Radon is a product of the radioactive decay of radium, which itself is a decay product of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n\nFollowing radon, xenon is the next rarest stable noble gas. The abundances of noble gases in the atmosphere, from most to least common, are argon, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon. In the Earth's crust, argon is also the most abundant noble gas, followed by helium, neon, xenon, and krypton. However, the overall terrestrial abundance is dominated by atmospheric concentrations for most noble gases except for helium, which is more abundant in the crust.\n\nWhile the provided data is not specific to the year 2002, the natural abundances of these elements are a result of long-term geological and atmospheric processes, and therefore would not have been significantly different in 2002. Oganesson, a synthetic noble gas, was first created in 2006 and does not occur naturally on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
