    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest with verifiable terrestrial lengths are the Aras, the Tiber, and the Acheron. Many of the other rivers mentioned are mythological and confined to the underworld, therefore having no measurable length.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Aras River**, which flows through Turkey, Armenia, Iran, and Azerbaijan. It is mentioned in Book VIII of the *Aeneid* and has a total length of approximately **1,072 kilometers (666 miles)**.\n\nThe second longest is the **Tiber River**, the most significant river in the narrative's Italian setting. The Trojans are fated to establish their new city on its banks. The Tiber runs for **406 kilometers (252 miles)** through Italy.\n\nThe third longest is the **Acheron River** in the Epirus region of northwest Greece. In the *Aeneid*, it is one of the rivers of the underworld, but it is also a real river with a length of **52 kilometers (32 miles)**.\n\nOther rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid*, such as the Styx, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe, are purely mythological features of the underworld and do not have measurable terrestrial counterparts that are referenced in the epic. While there are real-world rivers with these names, they are not the ones spoken of in the *Aeneid*.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras River (1,072 km), the Tiber River (406 km), and the Acheron River (52 km).>>>"
