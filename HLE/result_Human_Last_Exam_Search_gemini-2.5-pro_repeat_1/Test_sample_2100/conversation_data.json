    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nThe story of Rezanov's life, his love for Concepción Argüello, and his untimely death became the basis for Voznesensky's work, which was later adapted into the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". Rezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. His original grave was destroyed, but the location was rediscovered, and a monument was placed at his burial site in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
