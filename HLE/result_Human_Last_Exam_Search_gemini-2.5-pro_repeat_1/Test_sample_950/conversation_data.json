    "The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ or $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring is $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor any abelian group $A$, its torsion subgroup, denoted $Tors(A)$, consists of all elements of finite order. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, which can be calculated as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nA torsion group is a group in which every element has finite order. By definition, the torsion subgroup of any abelian group is a torsion group. The rank of any torsion group is 0. This is because if $T$ is a torsion group, then for any $x \\in T$ and any non-zero rational number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the element $x \\otimes q$ in $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero. Thus, $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = 0$, and the rank is 0.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$:\n$Tors(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} Tors(H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$\n\nSince this is a direct sum of torsion groups, it is itself a torsion group. Therefore, its rank is 0.\n\nWhile the question as stated has a straightforward answer, it is possible the user was interested in the structure of the torsion in the cohomology of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. It is a known fact that the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians can have 2-torsion. For the specific case of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the integral cohomology groups have been computed. For example, $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This shows that there is indeed a non-trivial torsion subgroup. However, the rank of this torsion subgroup (and the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring) is still zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
