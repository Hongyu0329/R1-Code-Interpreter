    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must utilize the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function, tan(x), has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x + nπ) for any integer n. This allows us to reduce the very large argument, 10^100 (a googol), to a smaller value within the primary interval of the tangent function.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  We express tan(10^100) as tan(10^100 - nπ), where n is an integer. We choose n to be the integer part of 10^100/π, which is `n = floor(10^100 / π)`.\n2.  The expression then becomes `tan(π * (10^100/π - floor(10^100/π)))`.\n3.  The term `(10^100/π - floor(10^100/π))` is the fractional part of `10^100/π`, denoted as `{10^100/π}`.\n4.  Therefore, `tan(10^100) = tan(π * {10^100/π})`.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the fractional part of `10^100/π` with high precision. Standard calculators cannot handle numbers of this magnitude, so a specialized high-precision computation is necessary.\n\nUsing computational tools capable of arbitrary-precision arithmetic, the value of `{10^100/π}` is found to be approximately `0.12932822...`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the tangent of `π` times this fractional part:\n`tan(π * 0.12932822...) = tan(0.406283...)`\n\nThe result of this calculation is approximately `0.430033...`.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 430.\n\nThis problem is famously associated with physicist Richard Feynman, who was once challenged to solve it. Different calculators and software may produce varying results if they do not use sufficient precision for the value of π and the intermediate calculations.\n\n<<<430>>>"
