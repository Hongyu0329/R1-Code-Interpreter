    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with the by-product triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n### Reaction Analysis:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is known for its significant steric bulk due to the tert-butyl group.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄). This type of ylide, where the carbon atom bonded to phosphorus is attached to an alkyl group, is classified as an unstabilized ylide.\n\n2.  **The Wittig Reaction**: This reaction converts a carbonyl group (C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone into a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The oxygen atom of the carbonyl is replaced by the carbanionic moiety of the ylide, forming an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a stable by-product.\n\n3.  **Product Formation**:\n    The carbon-oxygen double bond of pivalaldehyde is replaced by the carbon-phosphorus double bond of the ylide. This connects the tert-butyl-ethylidene fragment from the aldehyde to the 2-chlorophenylethyl fragment from the ylide, resulting in the alkene:\n\n    (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)\n\n    The systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Stereochemistry:\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting double bond (whether it is E or Z) is a critical aspect of the Wittig reaction.\n\n*   Typically, Wittig reactions involving **unstabilized ylides** are kinetically controlled and selectively produce the **Z-alkene** (cis isomer).\n*   However, when a sterically hindered aldehyde such as pivalaldehyde is used, the reaction outcome can change. Studies have shown that the significant steric hindrance can lead to a reversal of selectivity, favoring the formation of the more thermodynamically stable **E-alkene** (trans isomer). In some cases with pivaldehyde, the E-alkene can be the almost exclusive product.\n\nTherefore, the reaction is expected to predominantly yield the **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
