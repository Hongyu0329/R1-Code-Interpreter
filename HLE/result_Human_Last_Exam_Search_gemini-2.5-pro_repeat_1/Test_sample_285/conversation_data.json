    "To determine the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to analyze the decay properties of the integral $I(\\mathbf{a})$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$. The $L^p$-integrability of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is determined by the slowest possible decay rate of $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$.\n\nThe integral in question is:\n$I(a_1, \\dots, a_9) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i P(\\mathbf{a}, x, y)} dxdy$\nwhere the phase $P(\\mathbf{a}, x, y)$ is a general polynomial of degree 3 in two variables, $x$ and $y$, with no constant term:\n$P(\\mathbf{a}, x, y) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe decay rate of such an oscillatory integral for large values of the parameter vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is determined by the \"flattest\" possible point of the phase polynomial $P(\\mathbf{a}, x, y)$. This, in turn, depends on the direction of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ in the 9-dimensional parameter space. The overall $L^p$ integrability is governed by the directions in the parameter space that yield the slowest decay.\n\nLet's analyze the problem by considering subspaces of the parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^9$. If the function $I(\\mathbf{a})$ belongs to $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, then its restriction to any affine subspace must be in $L^p$ (with respect to the measure on that subspace). Therefore, if we find a subspace where the restricted function is not in $L^p$, the original function cannot be in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ either. The most restrictive condition will determine the final answer.\n\nWe can group the parameters by the degree of the corresponding monomial:\n1.  **Linear part (degree 1):** $\\mathbf{a}^{(1)} = (a_1, a_2)$. The phase is $P_1 = a_1 x + a_2 y$.\n2.  **Quadratic part (degree 2):** $\\mathbf{a}^{(2)} = (a_3, a_4, a_5)$. The phase is $P_2 = a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2$.\n3.  **Cubic part (degree 3):** $\\mathbf{a}^{(3)} = (a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$. The phase is $P_3 = a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nLet's find the $L^p$ threshold for each of these homogeneous parts by setting the other coefficients to zero. Let $I_d$ be the integral with only degree-$d$ terms.\n\n*   **Cubic Subspace:** Consider the 4-dimensional subspace where $a_1=...=a_5=0$.\n    $I_3(\\mathbf{a}^{(3)}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3)} dxdy$.\n    This is an oscillatory integral with a homogeneous cubic phase. For a generic choice of $(a_6, ..., a_9)$, the phase is non-degenerate in a certain sense, and a standard result from harmonic analysis states that the decay rate of the integral as $|\\mathbf{a}^{(3)}| \\to \\infty$ is $|I_3| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}^{(3)}|^{-2/3}$.\n    To determine the integrability of $|I_3|^p$ over the 4-dimensional space of coefficients $\\mathbf{a}^{(3)}$, we integrate in polar coordinates:\n    $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} |I_3(\\mathbf{a}^{(3)})|^p d\\mathbf{a}^{(3)} \\approx \\int_c^\\infty (r^{-2/3})^p r^{4-1} dr = \\int_c^\\infty r^{3 - 2p/3} dr$.\n    This integral converges if the exponent is less than -1, i.e., $3 - 2p/3 < -1$, which implies $4 < 2p/3$, or $p > 6$.\n    Thus, on the subspace of cubic coefficients, the function is in $L^p$ only for $p>6$. This implies that the full function $I(\\mathbf{a})$ cannot be in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for any $p \\le 6$.\n\n*   **Quadratic Subspace:** Consider the 3-dimensional subspace where only $a_3, a_4, a_5$ are non-zero.\n    $I_2(\\mathbf{a}^{(2)}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2)} dxdy$.\n    For a generic quadratic form (i.e., non-degenerate, $4a_3a_5-a_4^2 \\neq 0$), the method of stationary phase shows that the decay rate is $|I_2| \\sim |\\mathbf{a}^{(2)}|^{-1}$.\n    To check the $L^p$ integrability over this 3D subspace:\n    $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} |I_2(\\mathbf{a}^{(2)})|^p d\\mathbf{a}^{(2)} \\approx \\int_c^\\infty (r^{-1})^p r^{3-1} dr = \\int_c^\\infty r^{2-p} dr$.\n    This converges if $2-p < -1$, which means $p > 3$.\n    This condition ($p>3$) is less restrictive than the one from the cubic part ($p>6$).\n\n*   **Linear Subspace:** For the 2D subspace of linear coefficients, a similar analysis shows the condition for integrability is $p>1$. This is even less restrictive.\n\nThe overall integrability of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ on $\\mathbb{R}^9$ is limited by the \"worst\" part of the phase. The worst behavior (slowest decay, leading to the most restrictive condition on $p$) comes from the highest degree terms. The analysis of the cubic subspace showed that $I_3 \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^4)$ for $p \\le 6$. This implies that $I \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le 6$.\n\nAdding lower-degree terms to a phase generally does not slow down the decay rate; in fact, it often makes it faster by removing degeneracies of the highest-order part. For example, the phase $\\lambda x^3$ leads to an integral with decay $\\lambda^{-1/3}$, but adding a term $\\epsilon x^2$ perturbs the critical point at the origin to be non-degenerate, improving the decay to $\\lambda^{-1/2}$. The slowest decay rates are typically found when the polynomial phase is as \"flat\" as possible, which occurs when lower-degree terms are absent.\n\nTherefore, the most restrictive condition comes from the pure cubic part, which requires $p>6$ for the integral to be in $L^p$. This means that for any $p \\le 6$, the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. The question asks for the largest $p$ for which $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This value is the threshold $p=6$.\n\n"
