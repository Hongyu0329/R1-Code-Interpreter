    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ are the generalized Pauli operators, which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be written as $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks from the system to the environment. The rank of the complementary channel is a measure of the dimension of the subspace of the environment that becomes correlated with the system.\n\nA fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ of the Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$ of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The elements of the Gram matrix are given by:\n$G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l)$\n\nFor a Pauli channel, we substitute the expressions for the Kraus operators:\n$G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l)) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l)$\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ have the orthogonality property:\n$\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\nwhere $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $k=l$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Gram matrix elements, we get:\n$G_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}) = d \\cdot p_k \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n\nThis means the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix of size $d^2 \\times d^2$. Its diagonal entries are $\\{d \\cdot p_1, d \\cdot p_2, \\dots, d \\cdot p_{d^2}\\}$.\n\nThe rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. In this case, the rank of $G$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to find the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$.\n\nThe probabilities must satisfy $\\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k = 1$ and $p_k \\ge 0$. It is possible to choose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. For example, one can choose $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k = 1, \\dots, d^2$. This corresponds to the depolarizing channel. In this case, all $d^2$ diagonal entries of the Gram matrix are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$. This leads to the conclusion that the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^2$.>>>"
