    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability.\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points exist where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t)=0$, we have $(u-1)u^2 = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which means $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ and $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the plane are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\nWe analyze the stability by linearizing the system at each equilibrium point, which involves the Jacobian matrix:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, the point $(1,0)$ is an unstable node.\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves often correspond to the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. A saddle point has trajectories, called separatrices, that flow into or away from it.\n\nWe look for a trajectory that corresponds to one of the manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The equation for the trajectories in the phase plane is:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2}$\n\nThis is a Riccati differential equation for $d(u)$. We can test for a simple particular solution. Let's test the parabolic curve $d = -u^2$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n\nSubstituting $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the trajectory equation:\nRHS = $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2}$\nNumerator = $2u^4 - (5u^4 - 3u^3) + u^4 - u^3 = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^3(u-1)$\nRHS = $\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$\n\nSince the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory for the system.\n\nThis trajectory connects the equilibrium point $(0,0)$ (since $0 = -0^2$) and the saddle point $(1,-1)$ (since $-1 = -1^2$). Trajectories that connect equilibrium points are separatrices. Specifically, this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The stable manifold of this saddle point is the line $u=1$ for $d<0$.\n\nGiven the options of a straight line ($u=1$) and a parabolic curve ($d=-u^2$), the term \"the separatrix\" typically refers to the more complex and dynamically significant curve that often dictates the boundaries of basins of attraction. In this context, the specific trajectory $d=-u^2$ is the most significant separatrix.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
