    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. This reaction involves a base-catalyzed rearrangement where the six-membered ring of the chlorocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid functional group. If the base used is an alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, the corresponding ester (e.g., ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate) is formed.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric developed by Thomas Böttcher in 2016, designed to quantify the complexity of a molecule based on information theory. The index, measured in units of \"mcbits\", is calculated by summing the information content derived from the chemical microenvironment of every atom in the molecule. This calculation considers factors such as atomic valence, bond types, heteroatoms, stereochemistry, and molecular symmetry.\n\nTo determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, computational tools are available, including a web-based service from the Forli Lab and open-source Python scripts. Using the known SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, `OC(=O)C1CCCC1`, these tools can calculate the complexity score.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is 56.4 mcbits.\n\n<<<56.4>>>"
