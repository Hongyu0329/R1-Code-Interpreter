A single-site catalyst based on **Zirconium** with **robust metallocene or post-metallocene ligands** supported on **sulfated alumina** represents the optimal combination. This system can efficiently polymerize olefins and, in the presence of hydrogen gas, act as a highly effective catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short saturated alkanes. The switch between polymerization and depolymerization is controlled by the partial pressure of hydrogen.
