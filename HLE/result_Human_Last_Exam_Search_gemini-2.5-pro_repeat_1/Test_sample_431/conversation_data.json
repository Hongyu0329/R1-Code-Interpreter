    "The human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1), also known as GABRR1, is a protein that forms ligand-gated chloride channels. Like other members of its family, the GABRR1 protein has four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4). The region connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains is a large intracellular loop, often referred to as the TM3-TM4 linker.\n\nBased on the canonical sequence data for human GABRR1 from the UniProt database (accession number P24046), the domains are located as follows:\n\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 3 (TM3):** a.a. 344-366\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 4 (TM4):** a.a. 454-475\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 367 to 453. Analysis of this specific region of the protein reveals the presence of one Cysteine (C) residue at position 442.\n\n<<<1>>>"
