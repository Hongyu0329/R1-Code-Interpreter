    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. Their diet consists mainly of soft-bodied arthropods like aphids and mites. In addition to prey, some adult snakeflies have also been recorded consuming pollen and other sugary substances like nectar.\n\nBased on the provided choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies have been recorded feeding on nectar and other sugary substances.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are known to be significant predators of aphids. While \"Totara Aphids\" are a specific type, aphids are a staple of the snakefly diet.\n\nThere is no scientific record of adult snakeflies feeding on fungus or leaf tissue, making options C and D incorrect. Option B is also incorrect as Māhoe is a plant native to New Zealand, and snakeflies are not found in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, the diet of adult Raphidopterans includes both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
