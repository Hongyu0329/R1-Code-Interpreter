    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" in this context refers to a standard two-dimensional square lattice. The number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin is denoted by a(n).\n\nThe calculation of a(n) is a complex combinatorial problem with no known simple formula. However, the initial terms of this sequence have been computed and are well-documented. The sequence is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value of a(10) has been determined through computational enumeration. The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is 44,100.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks, a(n), for n=1 to 10 is as follows:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
