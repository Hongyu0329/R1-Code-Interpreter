    "I have been unable to find a Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio that perfectly matches the description of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nWhile my search has identified several films with memorable bicycle scenes, none contain this specific sequence of events. Searches for variations of this scene, including a \"game of chicken\" scenario and movies prominently featuring a pink bicycle, have also not yielded a match within the specified parameters.\n\nThere is a short independent film titled \"Pink Bike\" and a YouTube video called \"The Pink Bicycle,\" but neither is a major Hollywood feature film. It is possible the scene as described is from a lesser-known film, a foreign film, a television show, or that the details have been misremembered.\n\nIf you have any additional details about the film, such as the approximate year of release, the genre, or any of the actors involved, it may be possible to narrow the search further.\n\n<<<I am unable to find a film that matches the user's description.>>>"
