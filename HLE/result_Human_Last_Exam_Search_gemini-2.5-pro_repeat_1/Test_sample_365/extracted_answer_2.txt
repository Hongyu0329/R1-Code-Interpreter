The reaction that occurs is an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement.
1.  **Deprotonation:** Potassium hydride (KH), a strong base, deprotonates the tertiary alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide.
2.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The starting material is a 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene, which upon deprotonation, is perfectly set up for this rearrangement. The strained C1-C2 bond of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring breaks, and a new C-C bond forms, leading to a ring expansion. This concerted reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state to form a thermodynamically stable enolate intermediate. The formation of the enolate makes the reaction irreversible.
3.  **Protonation/Tautomerization:** The aqueous/methanolic workup protonates the enolate, which then tautomerizes to the stable ketone.

The resulting product is a bicyclic ketone with a *cis*-hydrindanone core structure. The TBDMS ether and the dimethoxy ketal groups are unaffected by the reaction conditions.

The product is:
**(3aS,7R,7aS)-7-((S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclopent-2-en-1-yl)-3,3-dimethoxy-2,3,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-inden-4(5H)-one**
