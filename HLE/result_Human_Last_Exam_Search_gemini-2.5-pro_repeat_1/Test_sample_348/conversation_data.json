    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n**1. Find Market Equilibrium**\n\nEquilibrium occurs when `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the price is the same. We set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`):\n`ln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis equation does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved using numerical methods. Using a computational solver, we find the equilibrium quantity to be:\n`Q_E ≈ 4.7128`\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` into either function. Using the demand function:\n`P_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.7128)) ≈ 18e^(-1.3618) ≈ 4.612`\n\n**2. Calculate Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It represents the total area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price.\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price.\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) can be calculated as:\n`TW = ∫[0, Q_E] P_D(Q) dQ - ∫[Q_min, Q_E] P_S(Q) dQ`\n\nThe supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is defined only for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > ∛2`. Therefore, the lower limit for the supply integral (`Q_min`) is `∛2 ≈ 1.2599`.\n\nThe total welfare is given by the expression:\n`TW = ∫[0 to 4.7128] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to 4.7128] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ`\n\nThese integrals must also be evaluated numerically:\n*   The area under the demand curve from 0 to `Q_E`:\n    `∫[0 to 4.7128] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 31.28`\n*   The area under the supply curve from `∛2` to `Q_E`:\n    `∫[∛2 to 4.7128] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ ≈ 10.83`\n\nThe total welfare is the difference between these two values:\n`TW ≈ 31.28 - 10.83 = 20.45`\n\n<<<20.45>>>"
