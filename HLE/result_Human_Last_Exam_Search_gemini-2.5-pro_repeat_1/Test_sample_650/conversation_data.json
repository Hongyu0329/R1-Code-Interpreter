    "The computational time complexity of an algorithm is determined by the number of basic operations it performs as a function of the size of its input. In the case of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, the input size is related to the magnitude of the number `n`.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a `while` loop that executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. Let's analyze the number of times this loop runs.\n\n*   **Initialization:** Before the loop, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   **Loop Iteration 1:** `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n*   **Loop Iteration 2:** `x` becomes `⌊n/c²⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n*   **Loop Iteration k:** The value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This occurs when `n/c^(k+1)` is less than 1, which implies `n < c^(k+1)`. The number of iterations, `k`, is the number of times we can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1. This is precisely the definition of the logarithm. Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\nInside the loop, a constant number of basic arithmetic operations are performed: an increment, an assignment, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Assuming these operations take constant time, the work done in each iteration is constant.\n\nThus, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the constant work per iteration. This gives a complexity of `O(log_c(n))`. In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm is a constant factor and can be omitted. A search result confirms that the time complexity for this method is O(log<sub>base</sub>n).\n\nTherefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
