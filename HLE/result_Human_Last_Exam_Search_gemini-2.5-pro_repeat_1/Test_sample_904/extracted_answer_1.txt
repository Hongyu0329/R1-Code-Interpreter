The governing linear equation for the interfacial shape $\xi(r)$ is derived from the balance of pressures at the fluid-fluid interface. The pressure difference across the curved interface due to surface tension is given by the Young-Laplace equation. For a small displacement $\xi(r)$ in cylindrical coordinates, the curvature is approximated by $\nabla^2 \xi = \frac{d^2\xi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{d\xi}{dr}$. The pressure jump due to surface tension is therefore $P_{ST} = \gamma \left( \frac{d^2\xi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{d\xi}{dr} \right)$.

The radial electric field $E(r)$ exerts an electrostatic pressure on the interface due to the difference in dielectric properties of the two fluids. This pressure, known as the Maxwell stress, is given by $P_{el} = \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_b - \epsilon_a) E(r)^2$, where $\epsilon_a$ and $\epsilon_b$ are the electric permittivities of the upper and lower fluids, respectively.

In equilibrium, and neglecting gravity as specified, the sum of these pressures must be constant. We can set this constant to zero by a suitable choice of reference pressure. The balance equation is:
$P_{ST} - P_{el} = 0$
$\gamma \left( \frac{d^2\xi}{dr^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{d\xi}{dr} \right) - \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_b - \epsilon_a) E(r)^2 = 0$

This equation can be rearranged to match the requested form $A(r) \frac{d^2 \xi(r)}{dr^2} + B(r) \frac{d\xi(r)}{dr} + C(r, \xi(r)) = 0$.

By comparing the terms, we find:
*   The coefficient of the second derivative term, $\frac{d^2 \xi(r)}{dr^2}$, is $A(r) = \gamma$.
*   The coefficient of the first derivative term, $\frac{d\xi(r)}{dr}$, is $B(r) = \frac{\gamma}{r}$.
*   The remaining term is $C(r, \xi(r)) = - \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_b - \epsilon_a) E(r)^2$.

Thus, the expressions for $A(r)$ and $B(r)$ are:
$A(r) = \gamma$
$B(r) = \frac{\gamma}{r}$
