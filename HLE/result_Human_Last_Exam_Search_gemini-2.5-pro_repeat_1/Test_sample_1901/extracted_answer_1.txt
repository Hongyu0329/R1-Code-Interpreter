The proposed design strategy is chemically sound and follows established principles for creating liquid crystal materials. All steps (A through F) represent a valid and logical approach. The core concepts—using a para-substituted benzene ring, a flexible alkyl chain, and a polar terminal group—are fundamental to designing calamitic (rod-shaped) liquid crystals. The tuning methods described are also standard practice in the field. The only practical caveat is that achieving the desired room-temperature range often requires creating a eutectic mixture of several similar compounds rather than relying on a single pure substance. Therefore, the overall design plan is correct and well-conceived.
