    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a specific instance of a Galois connection. The objects of $\\Delta$ are finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, and the morphisms are order-preserving maps. The 2-morphisms are defined by the pointwise order on these maps.\n\nAn adjunction from $[n]$ to $[m]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, along with 2-morphisms $\\mathrm{id}_{[n]} \\to g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[m]}$. These conditions are equivalent to the definition of a Galois connection, where $f$ is the left adjoint to $g$ ($f \\dashv g$). This means that for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$, the following equivalence holds: $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$.\n\nFor an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a left adjoint, it must possess a right adjoint. A map between posets has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). In the context of the totally ordered sets $[n]$, an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ has a right adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nIf $f(0)=0$, its right adjoint $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is uniquely determined by the formula $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$. Since the right adjoint $g$ is uniquely determined by the left adjoint $f$, counting the number of internal adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy the condition $f(0)=0$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$, so we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values, so we need to count the number of sequences $(f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23))$ such that $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, the problem reduces to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $(f(1), \\dots, f(23))$, with values in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{k+N-1}{k}$, where $k$ is the length of the sequence and $N$ is the number of possible values.\n\nIn this case, $k=23$ (for the values $f(1)$ through $f(23)$) and $N=38$ (since the values can range from 0 to 37). Applying the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis number represents the total count of possible order-preserving maps that satisfy the condition, and thus the total number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$.\n\n<<<$$ \\binom{60}{23} $$>>>"
