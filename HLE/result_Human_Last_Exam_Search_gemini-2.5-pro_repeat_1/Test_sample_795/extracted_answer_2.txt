The analytical expression for the initial magnetization curve is given in two parts, defined by the full penetration field `H_p = Jc * a`:
For an applied field `H` in the range `0 ≤ H ≤ H_p`:
`M(H) = (H² / (2*a*Jc)) - H`   or equivalently   `M(H) = -H * (1 - H / (2*H_p))`

For an applied field `H` greater than the penetration field, `H > H_p`:
`M(H) = -Jc * a / 2`   or equivalently   `M(H) = -H_p / 2`
