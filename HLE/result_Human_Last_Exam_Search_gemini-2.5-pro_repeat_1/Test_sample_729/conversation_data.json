    "The search results confirm the structure of generalized quaternion groups and their subgroups. Specifically, they confirm that for Q_4n, where n is a power of 2, the group is a generalized quaternion group. A key property mentioned is that every subgroup of a generalized quaternion group is either cyclic or a generalized quaternion group. This supports my approach of analyzing the cyclic subgroups generated by powers of elements.\n\nMy derivation identified the power subgroups as G, <x²>, and <x^d> where d is a multiple of 4 that divides 64. Let's list them again for clarity:\n1.  **G = Q₁₂₈**: This is the power subgroup G¹ (for m=1).\n2.  **<x²>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 32. This is G² (for m=2).\n3.  **<x⁴>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 16. This is G⁴ (for m=4).\n4.  **<x⁸>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 8. This is G⁸ (for m=8).\n5.  **<x¹⁶>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 4. This is G¹⁶ (for m=16).\n6.  **<x³²>**: A cyclic subgroup of order 2. This is G³² (for m=32).\n7.  **{1}**: The trivial subgroup of order 1. This is G⁶⁴ (for m=64).\n\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups. The analysis showed that these are the only possible outcomes for G^m = {g^m | g ∈ G}. My initial derivation appears to be correct and is consistent with the general properties of generalized quaternion groups found in the search results.\n\n<<<7>>>"
