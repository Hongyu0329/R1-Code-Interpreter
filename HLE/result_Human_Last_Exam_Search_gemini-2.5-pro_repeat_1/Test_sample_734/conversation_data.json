    "Balthasar van der Pol, a Dutch physicist and lay theologian, is credited with first developing specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, which is applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural law at the Fall. He proposed a concept that was later termed the \"law of the conservation of creation\" by theologian Arnoldus van Ruler, who built upon his work.\n\nThis principle suggests that the created order is a conserved system. For a new, miraculous event like the Incarnation (which includes the virgin birth) to occur, a corresponding alteration or \"taking away\" must happen elsewhere in the system to maintain a type of metaphysical balance. This framework can also be applied to the Fall of Man, viewing it as a negative alteration to the created order that necessitated the positive creative act of redemption.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like Augustine of Hippo and Robert Boyle developed significant concepts to explain miracles, van der Pol's idea offers a unique and specific terminology for the *process of change* itself within the natural order.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine proposed the idea of *rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons.\" He suggested that God embedded latent potentialities within creation from the beginning. Miracles, like the virgin birth, were not violations of nature but the actualization of these hidden potentials at a divinely appointed time. This framework also helps understand the consequences of the Fall, where human nature and its relationship with creation were fundamentally altered.\n\n*   **Robert Boyle (1627-1691):** The 17th-century natural philosopher and theologian Robert Boyle also contributed specialized terms. He distinguished between God's \"general concourse,\" which upholds the regular laws of nature, and \"special providence\" or \"supernatural concourse,\" where God chooses to suspend or override those laws to perform miracles. For Boyle, a miracle was an instance where God acted contrary to the ordinary experience of nature.\n\nUnlike these earlier thinkers, van der Pol's concept, as developed by van Ruler, focuses on a \"law\" governing the change itself, framing miraculous interventions and foundational shifts like the Fall within a conserved creative system.\n\n<<<Balthasar van der Pol>>>"
