    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned across four couplets, or *abyat* (singular: *bayt*).\n\nThe enumeration of the Prophets begins in the bayt:\n*hamm Ādamu Idrīsu Nūḥu Hūdu maʿ*\n*Ṣāliḥu wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ*\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed)\n\nAnd concludes with the bayt:\n*Ilyāsu Yūnus Zakariyyā Yaḥyā*\n*ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ghayyā*\n(Elias, Jonah, Zechariah, John, Jesus, and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the last of the prophets, so leave misguidance)\n\nWhile the verses themselves are consistent across different publications, the numbering of the *abyat* may vary slightly depending on the edition. In some versions, the listing of the prophets starts from **bayt 13 and ends at bayt 16**. In other, slightly more detailed versions of the poem, this section corresponds to **bayt 16 through bayt 19**. This difference in numbering is due to the inclusion of additional introductory couplets in some editions."
