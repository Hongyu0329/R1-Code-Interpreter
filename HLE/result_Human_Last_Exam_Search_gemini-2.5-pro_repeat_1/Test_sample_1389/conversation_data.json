    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (1-IRR) correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. This is because the underlying assumptions of the two concepts align in this specific scenario.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine provides complete (100%) protection to a portion of vaccinated individuals, while providing zero protection to the rest. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would fully protect 80% of recipients, and the remaining 20% would have no more protection than an unvaccinated person.\n*   **Leaky Vaccine:** In contrast, a leaky vaccine provides partial protection to all vaccinated individuals. An 80% effective leaky vaccine would reduce the per-exposure risk of infection by 80% for every recipient.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the incidence rate of infection in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** Commonly calculated as 1 - IRR, this metric represents the proportionate reduction in the disease rate in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This refers to the reduction in the probability of infection from a single exposure to a pathogen.\n\n### Why 1-IRR Correctly Estimates Efficacy for All-or-Nothing Vaccines\n\nIn the \"all-or-nothing\" model, the infections in the vaccinated group only occur in the subgroup of \"non-responders\" who received no protection. Since this subgroup's risk is identical to that of the unvaccinated group, the overall reduction in the incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group directly reflects the proportion of \"responders\" who are fully protected.\n\nLet's consider a vaccine that provides all-or-nothing protection to a proportion `p` of recipients.\n*   The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group is `IR_u`.\n*   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is driven only by the `(1-p)` fraction that is not protected. Therefore, `IR_v = IR_u * (1-p)`.\n*   The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = `IR_v / IR_u` = `(IR_u * (1-p)) / IR_u` = `1-p`.\n*   The calculated vaccine efficacy is `1 - IRR` = `1 - (1-p)` = `p`.\n\nIn this case, the calculated value `p` is exactly the proportion of the vaccinated population that is perfectly protected. This value is conceptually equivalent to the average per-exposure efficacy across the entire vaccinated group (where a proportion `p` has 100% efficacy and `1-p` has 0% efficacy). Therefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, 1-IRR is a direct and time-invariant measure of vaccine efficacy.\n\nIt is important to note that this relationship becomes more complex with \"leaky\" vaccines, where the measured efficacy can be influenced by the intensity of exposure (force of infection).\n\n<<<C>>>"
