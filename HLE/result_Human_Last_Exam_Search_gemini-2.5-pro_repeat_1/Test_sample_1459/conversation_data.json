    "### The Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between the Interval and the Unit Circle is (π-1)/2\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the standard absolute value metric and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric is $(\\pi-1)/2$. This result was established by mathematicians Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin.\n\nThe unit circle, denoted as $S^1$, when considered with its intrinsic metric, has distances measured as the shortest arc length between two points. This is also known as the geodesic distance. The total circumference of a standard unit circle (with radius 1) is $2\\pi$.\n\nThe calculation of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between these two fundamental metric spaces is a non-trivial problem in metric geometry. The solution was presented in the paper \"Gromov–Hausdorff distance between interval and circle\" published in the journal *Topology and its Applications* in 2022. The paper provides a precise formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of any length and a circle of any circumference.\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, in essence, measures the \"dissimilarity\" between two metric spaces. It is defined as the infimum of the Hausdorff distances of all possible isometric embeddings of the two spaces into a common metric space. Ji and Tuzhilin's work introduced new concepts such as \"round spaces\" and the \"nonlinearity degree\" of a metric space to arrive at their exact calculation.\n\nFor the specific case of the interval $$ (with length $\\lambda=1$) and the unit circle (with circumference $C=2\\pi$), the formula derived by Ji and Tuzhilin yields the value of $(\\pi-1)/2$.\n\n<<<(\\pi-1)/2>>>"
