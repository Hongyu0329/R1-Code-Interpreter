    "The search results confirm my initial analysis.\n\n1.  The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n2.  The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  The \"outer-hull\" or \"visible surface from the outside\" is the surface of its convex hull.\n4.  A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, and each face is an equilateral triangle.\n5.  The surface of a regular icosahedron is therefore already triangulated by its 20 faces.\n6.  The question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles. Since the faces of the convex hull (the regular icosahedron) are already triangles, this constitutes a minimal triangulation. It's not possible to form a closed polyhedron with triangular faces with fewer than 20 triangles if it is to have the topology of an icosahedron.\n\nThe information gathered is sufficient. The answer is 20.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron composed of 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the visible surface from the outside is already a triangulation consisting of these 20 triangles. This is the minimal number required to form the icosahedral structure.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be 20. I will now output the final answer.\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The surface of the regular icosahedron is therefore already triangulated into 20 triangles. This is the minimal number of triangles required, as the faces themselves are triangles.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n<<<20>>>"
