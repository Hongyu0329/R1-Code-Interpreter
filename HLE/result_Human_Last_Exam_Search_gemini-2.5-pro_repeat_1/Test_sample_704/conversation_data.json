    "On Isaac Newton's colour circle, he correlated the seven colors of the spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. The color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Newton's circle, as described in his 1704 book *Opticks*, maps the colors to the notes of the Dorian mode scale starting on D.\n\nIn this arrangement, the colors are assigned to the spaces between the notes on the circle. The color green is allocated to the segment between the notes F and G, while blue (\"blew\") is assigned to the segment between G and A. Therefore, the musical note that represents the division or range between green and blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
