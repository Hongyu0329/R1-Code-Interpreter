    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most transparent in the energy-momentum representation.\n\nThe two-point bare Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. It can be calculated using the path integral over the fields weighted by the exponential of the free action. For a non-interacting system, this integral is Gaussian and can be solved exactly.\n\nAfter performing a Fourier transform from spacetime to energy-frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space, the bare Green's function for a single-particle takes the form:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)*** for ω > µ\nand\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k - iδ)*** for ω < µ\n\nHere:\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum k.\n*   **ω** is the frequency (energy).\n*   **µ** is the chemical potential, which is the Fermi energy at zero temperature.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of the Green's function, with δ being a small positive real number. The sign of this infinitesimal term depends on whether the state is occupied (hole) or unoccupied (particle).\n\nThis relationship can also be understood through the **Lehmann representation** of the Green's function. The Lehmann representation expresses the Green's function in terms of the exact energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the system. For a non-interacting system, the many-body states are simple Slater determinants of single-particle states, and the excitation energies are just the single-particle energies ϵ_k. The general Lehmann representation then simplifies to the form given above, showing that the poles of the bare Green's function are precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nIn summary, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k, with a small imaginary part that dictates the analytic structure and ensures causality.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k in the energy-momentum representation is given by G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k ± iδ), where ω is the energy (frequency) and iδ is an infinitesimal term that ensures causality.>>>"
