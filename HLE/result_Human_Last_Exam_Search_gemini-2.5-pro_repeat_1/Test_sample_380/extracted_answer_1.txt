In summary, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the calculation. Instead, the calculation of normalized magnetic helicity is performed using components perpendicular to the radial direction as a direct consequence of applying Taylor's hypothesis to the radially flowing, super-Alfv√©nic solar wind. This practical approach is most accurate when the interplanetary magnetic field happens to align with the radial solar wind flow, a condition that researchers often specifically search for or account for in their analyses.
