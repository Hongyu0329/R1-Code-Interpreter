    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph on n = 128 vertices. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. An induced subgraph on a subset of vertices consists of those vertices and all edges from the original graph that connect pairs of vertices in the subset. A clique of size *k* (a *k*-clique) is an induced subgraph if there exists a set of *k* vertices in G that induces a complete graph.\n\nLet S(G) be the set of all integers *k* for which an induced *k*-clique exists in G. The problem is to find the maximum possible value of |S(G)|, the number of elements in this set.\n\nThe key insight is to understand the structure of the set S(G). If a graph G contains an induced clique of size *k*, let's say on a set of vertices V<sub>k</sub>, then any subset of V<sub>k</sub> of size *j* < *k* also forms an induced clique. This is because every pair of vertices in the subset is also in V<sub>k</sub>, and all vertices in V<sub>k</sub> are mutually adjacent. Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset is a complete graph of size *j*.\n\nThis means that if *k* is in S(G) and *k* > 1, then *k*-1 must also be in S(G). Applying this reasoning repeatedly, it follows that if the largest induced clique in G has size ω(G) (the clique number of G), then G must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to ω(G). Consequently, the set of induced clique sizes for any graph G is always of the form {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number, ω(G). To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to find the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nFor a graph with *n* vertices, the size of the largest possible clique is *n*. This is achieved by the complete graph, K<sub>n</sub>, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nIn our case, n = 128. Consider the complete graph K<sub>128</sub>.\n*   The number of vertices is 128.\n*   The largest clique in this graph is the graph itself, so its clique number is ω(K<sub>128</sub>) = 128.\n*   As established, this graph contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. For any integer *k* between 1 and 128, we can simply choose any *k* vertices from K<sub>128</sub>, and the subgraph induced by them will be a complete graph of size *k*.\n\nTherefore, for the graph G = K<sub>128</sub>, the set of different clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of these sizes is 128. No graph on 128 vertices can have a clique of a size larger than 128, so no graph can have more than 128 different induced clique sizes.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
