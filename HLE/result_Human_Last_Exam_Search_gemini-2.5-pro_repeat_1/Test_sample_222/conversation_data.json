    "Let the given 4-point DFTs be:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for the sequence `x(n)`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for the sequence `h(n)`\n\nThe new 8-point sequence is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nThe problem asks for the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence. This implies a decimation (downsampling) in the frequency domain. First, we find the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, which we'll call `Y(k)`, and then we decimate it by a factor of 2 to get the final 4-point DFT, let's call it `Z(k)`.\n\nThe relationship between the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of the interleaved sequence and the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` is a standard result from the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The even-indexed elements of `y(n)` correspond to `x(n)`, and the odd-indexed elements correspond to `h(n)`.\n\nThe formula for the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is given by:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`\nwhere `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)` is the twiddle factor.\n\nThe requested 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is obtained by taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`. This is equivalent to time-aliasing the 8-point sequence `y(n)` into a 4-point sequence and then computing its DFT.\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nLet's compute the required components of `Z(k)`:\n\n**For k = 0:**\n`Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4)`\n`Z(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0)`\n`Z(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n\n**For k = 1:**\n`Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4)`\n`W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n`Z(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2)`\n`Z(1) = -1 - j * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n**For k = 2:**\n`Z(2) = Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n`W_8^4 = e^(-j*2*pi*4/8) = e^(-j*pi) = -1`\n`Z(2) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0)`\n`Z(2) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n\n**For k = 3:**\n`Z(3) = Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n`W_8^6 = e^(-j*2*pi*6/8) = e^(-j*3*pi/2) = j`\n`Z(3) = X(2) + j * H(2)`\n`Z(3) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n\nCombining these results, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
