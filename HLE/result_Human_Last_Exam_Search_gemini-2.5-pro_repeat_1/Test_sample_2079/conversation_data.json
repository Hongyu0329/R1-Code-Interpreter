    "I have been unable to determine the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nMy research indicates that the town of Bártfa did have a system of lay judges during that year. A letter from 1461 makes reference to \"lay judges in Bártfa,\" confirming the existence of such officials at the time.\n\nA key source that likely contains the specific name of the judge is the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by historian Mária Fedorčáková. Reviews and summaries of this book state that its appendices include comprehensive lists of judges and town council members of Bardejov up to the 1520s. However, the content of these appendices is not available in the online resources I have access to.\n\nThe historical archives of Bardejov are known to be remarkably well-preserved from the medieval period and would almost certainly contain records of the town's officials. Unfortunately, these archives have not been digitized in a way that is accessible through my current tools.\n\nTherefore, while the information very likely exists within these specific historical records, I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa for the year 1461.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.>>>"
