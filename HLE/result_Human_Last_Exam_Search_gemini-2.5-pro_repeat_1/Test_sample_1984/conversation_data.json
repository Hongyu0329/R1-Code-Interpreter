    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given autonomous differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe equilibrium points are the constant solutions of the differential equation, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$. We need to solve the algebraic equation:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out a common term, $-x$:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if solutions that start near $x^*$ approach $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This means that for $x > x^*$, $f(x) < 0$, and for $x < x^*$, $f(x) > 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the stability for each point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point** $x = 0$:\n    *   Consider a value slightly less than 0, for example, $x = -0.1$.\n        $f(-0.1) = -(-0.1)(-0.1 - 1)^{2} = 0.1(-1.1)^{2} = 0.1(1.21) = 0.121 > 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will increase towards 0.\n    *   Consider a value slightly greater than 0, for example, $x = 0.1$.\n        $f(0.1) = -(0.1)(0.1 - 1)^{2} = -0.1(-0.9)^{2} = -0.1(0.81) = -0.081 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will decrease towards 0.\n    Since solutions on both sides of $x=0$ move towards it, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is a **stable equilibrium**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point** $x = 1$:\n    *   Consider a value slightly less than 1, for example, $x = 0.9$.\n        $f(0.9) = -(0.9)(0.9 - 1)^{2} = -0.9(-0.1)^{2} = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will move away from 1 (decreasing towards 0).\n    *   Consider a value slightly greater than 1, for example, $x = 1.1$.\n        $f(1.1) = -(1.1)(1.1 - 1)^{2} = -1.1(0.1)^{2} = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ will move towards 1.\n    Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium. Therefore, it does not count towards the number of stable equilibria, $m$.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point, $x=0$. This means $m=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
