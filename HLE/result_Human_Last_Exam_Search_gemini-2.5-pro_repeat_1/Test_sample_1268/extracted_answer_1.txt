An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\|f\|_\infty$ for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with fixed eigenvalue $\lambda$ and squarefree level $N$, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular surface, is given by $\|f\|_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.
