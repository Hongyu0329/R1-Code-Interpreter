    "In the context of automorphic forms, specifically for Hecke-Maass cusp forms on the modular surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, there has been significant research into the relationship between the maximum norm of a form and the geometry of the surface, particularly its volume. When $N$ is a squarefree natural number, the covolume $V$ of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is proportional to the level $N$.\n\nThe maximum norm, or sup-norm, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ for squarefree level $N$ has been a subject of intense study. The goal is often to find an upper bound for $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ that shows how the norm behaves as the level $N$ (and thus the covolume $V$) or the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ grows.\n\nFor a fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the \"trivial bound\" for the sup-norm is $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda} N^{\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Significant efforts have been made to improve this bound. A key result in this area, particularly for the level aspect with squarefree $N$, was achieved by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier. They established the following upper bound:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nHere, the notation $\\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of the modular surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is given by the formula:\n$V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\nFor squarefree $N$, this means that the covolume $V$ is of the order of $N$, i.e., $V \\asymp N$.\n\nBy substituting $N \\asymp V$ into the bound for the maximum norm, we can express the upper bound in terms of the covolume $V$. Interpreting the user's notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ as the sup-norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, the upper bound in relation to the covolume $V$ is:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$\n\nMore recently, hybrid bounds that are uniform in both the eigenvalue and the level have also been developed. For instance, Nicolas Templier established a hybrid bound for squarefree level $N$:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$.\n\nWhen considering the level as the primary growing parameter, the Harcos-Templier bound provides a strong estimate for the decay of the maximum norm. It is important to note that these bounds are part of an active area of research, and the exponents may see further improvements.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and squarefree level $N$, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular surface, is given by $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.>>>"
