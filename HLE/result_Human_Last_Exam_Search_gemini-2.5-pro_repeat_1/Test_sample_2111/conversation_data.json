    "The conceptual entity that Fernand Braudel, quoting Paul Morand, suggested should be inscribed within a sphere, with the nation serving as an example, is **civilization**.\n\nIn his historical work, Braudel emphasized a comprehensive view of history, moving beyond the mere recording of events to analyze the long-term structures that shape societies. For Braudel, \"civilization\" was a major analytical category, representing a large-scale, enduring entity that encompassed various social, economic, and cultural aspects of a society.\n\nWhile the precise quote from Paul Morand remains elusive in direct search, the conceptual framework is evident in Braudel's writings. In his book, *A History of Civilizations*, Braudel explores the idea that broader civilizations are composed of more specific national ones. A review of this work highlights that Braudel acknowledges that under a wide-ranging European civilization, there are distinct \"national\" civilizations. This hierarchical understanding, where a nation is a manifestation of a larger civilizational entity, aligns with the idea of inscribing the particular (the nation) within the general (the sphere of civilization).\n\nBraudel's approach was to study these large civilizational units to understand the deep currents of history, what he famously termed the *longue dur√©e*. His work consistently points to \"civilization\" as the overarching framework for understanding the development of different societies around the world.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
