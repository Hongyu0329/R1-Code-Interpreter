    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the \"7 Deer\" glyph, discovered at the San Bartolo archaeological site in Guatemala. This notation, representing a date in the 260-day ritual calendar, was found on painted mural fragments. Through radiocarbon dating, these fragments have been assigned to a period between 300 and 200 BCE.\n\nThis discovery is significant as it pushes back the evidence of a recorded date in the Americas by several centuries. The \"7 Deer\" glyph is considered the earliest securely dated example of the Maya calendar. The style of the glyph and the accompanying text fragments suggest that a sophisticated writing and artistic tradition was already established in the region by the third century BCE.\n\nPrior to this finding, the earliest recorded dates were from the more complex Long Count calendar. The oldest known Long Count date is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico, and corresponds to December of 36 BCE. Another very early Long Count date is inscribed on Stela C from Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico, which dates to 32 BCE. These dates are expressed using a system of bars and dots to represent numbers in the Mesoamerican calendrical system.\n\nWhile the Long Count dates are significant for their complexity in tracking long periods of time, the \"7 Deer\" glyph from San Bartolo currently stands as the earliest known instance of a date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<The \"7 Deer\" glyph, dating to 300-200 BCE.>>>"
