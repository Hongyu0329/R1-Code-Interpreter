    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with holes, we first need to establish the topology of the surface. The name \"toric code\" suggests that the model is defined on a torus, a surface with genus g=1. The GSD of the toric code depends on the genus of the surface and the number of boundaries (holes).\n\n1.  **GSD on a Torus (No Holes):** For a standard toric code on a torus with no holes (n=0, m=0), there are two independent non-contractible loops. This gives rise to two logical qubits, and thus a 4-fold ground state degeneracy. The GSD is given by 2^(2g) = 2^(2*1) = 4.\n\n2.  **Effect of Holes:** When holes (also called punctures or defects) are introduced into the surface, the number of non-trivial operators increases, which in turn increases the ground state degeneracy. Each hole, whether smooth or rough, introduces a new boundary and allows for new types of logical operators, effectively adding logical qubits to the system.\n\n3.  **Counting Logical Qubits:**\n    *   A surface with genus *g* provides `2g` logical qubits. For a torus, this is 2 qubits.\n    *   Each hole or boundary is typically understood to add one logical qubit to the system. A logical operator can be formed by a string running from one hole to another, or by a loop around a single hole that is topologically distinct from other loops.\n\n4.  **The Formula:** If we start with a torus (g=1), which has a base degeneracy of 2^2 = 4, and each of the *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes adds one logical qubit, the total number of logical qubits (*k*) becomes:\n    *   k = (qubits from genus) + (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes)\n    *   k = 2 + n + m\n\n5.  **Calculating the GSD:** The ground space degeneracy is 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits (*k*).\n    *   GSD = 2^k = 2^(n + m + 2)\n\nThis formula is consistent with the base case of a simple torus (n=0, m=0), where it correctly gives GSD = 2^(0+0+2) = 2^2 = 4.\n\nComparing this result with the given answer choices:\nA. 2^(m+n)\nB. 2^(m+n-2)\nC. 2^(m+n+2)\nD. 2^(2m)\nE. 2^(2n)\nF. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)\n\nThe derived formula, GSD = 2^(m+n+2), matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
