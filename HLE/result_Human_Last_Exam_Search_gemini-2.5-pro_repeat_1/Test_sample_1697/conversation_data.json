    "When N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide is treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), a directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM) reaction occurs. The subsequent addition of methyl iodide serves to introduce a methyl group onto the aromatic ring.\n\nThe starting molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs): the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3. Both of these groups can direct the deprotonation (lithiation) to a position *ortho* to themselves.\n\n*   The powerful N,N-diethylcarboxamide group directs lithiation to the C2 and C6 positions.\n*   The moderately strong dimethylamino group directs lithiation to the C2 and C4 positions.\n\nIn situations with competing directing groups, a hierarchy determines the site of reaction. The tertiary amide is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine. Furthermore, the C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. This cooperative effect strongly favors deprotonation at the C2 position, as its acidity is enhanced by both functional groups.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two steps:\n1.  **Directed *ortho*-Metalation:** The sec-BuLi, activated by TMEDA, selectively removes a proton from the C2 position to form a stable aryllithium intermediate. TMEDA chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the butyllithium and facilitating the deprotonation.\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I), in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The carbanion attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
