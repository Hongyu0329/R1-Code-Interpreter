    "The largest natural number *n* such that the (2n)th *K*-group of ℤ/27 is nonzero is **8**.\n\nThis result is a specific case of a more general theorem in algebraic *K*-theory concerning the vanishing of higher *K*-groups for rings of the form ℤ/pᵏ. The relevant formula, derived from the work of Hesselholt and Madsen on topological cyclic homology, gives a condition for when the even-indexed *K*-groups, denoted *K*₂ₙ(ℤ/pᵏ), become zero.\n\nAccording to a result summarized by Charles Weibel, for an odd prime *p*, the group *K*₂ₙ(ℤ/pᵏ) is zero for all *n* such that:\n2*n* ≥ (*p* - 1) *p*ᵏ⁻¹\n\nFor the ring ℤ/27, we have *p* = 3 and *k* = 3. Plugging these values into the formula gives the condition for the vanishing of the *K*-groups:\n2*n* ≥ (3 - 1) * 3³⁻¹\n2*n* ≥ 2 * 3²\n2*n* ≥ 18\n*n* ≥ 9\n\nThis implies that *K*₂ₙ(ℤ/27) is zero for all *n* ≥ 9. Consequently, the last non-zero even *K*-group occurs for the largest natural number *n* that is less than 9. This value is *n* = 8. Therefore, *K*₁₆(ℤ/27) is non-zero, while *K*₁₈(ℤ/27) and all subsequent even-indexed *K*-groups are zero.\n\n<<<8>>>"
