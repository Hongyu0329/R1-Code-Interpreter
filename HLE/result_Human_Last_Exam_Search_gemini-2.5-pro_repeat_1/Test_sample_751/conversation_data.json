    "To reduce a discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using the principle of duality, one can transform the dual of the system into controller canonical form. The resulting output matrix of the observer canonical form (`C_o`) is the transpose of the input matrix from the controller canonical form of the dual system (`B_c`).\n\nAlternatively, a more direct method involves a state transformation `x_o(k) = P * x(k)`, where `P` is the transformation matrix. The new system matrices are given by:\n`A_o = P * A * P^-1`\n`C_o = C * P^-1`\n\nFor a multi-output system, the observer canonical form and the transformation matrix are not unique and depend on the observability indices. A standard procedure to find the transformation matrix `P` is as follows:\n\n1.  **Check for observability and determine the observability indices.** The observability matrix is constructed from the rows of `C`, `CA`, `CA^2`, and so on. The observability indices (`ν_1, ν_2, ...`) indicate how many rows related to each output are needed to form a basis for the state-space.\n2.  **Construct the transformation matrix `P`**. The rows of `P` are selected from the rows of `C, CA, CA^2, ...` based on the observability indices. A common convention is to select the rows `c_1, c_1*A, ..., c_1*A^(ν_1-1), c_2, ...`.\n\nFor the given system:\n`A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`\n`C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\n1.  The rows of `C` are `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]` and `c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`.\n2.  We compute `c_1*A = [2, 1, 1]`.\n3.  We check for linear independence. The vectors `c_1`, `c_2`, and `c_1*A` are linearly independent, which means the system is observable. The observability indices are `ν_1 = 2` (from `c_1` and `c_1*A`) and `ν_2 = 1` (from `c_2`).\n4.  Following the standard procedure, the transformation matrix `P` is constructed with the rows `c_1`, `c_1*A`, and `c_2`.\n    `P = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`\n5.  The inverse of `P` is calculated as:\n    `P^-1 = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n6.  Finally, the new matrix `C` in observer canonical form, `C_o`, is computed as `C_o = C * P^-1`.\n    `C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]`\n    `C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
