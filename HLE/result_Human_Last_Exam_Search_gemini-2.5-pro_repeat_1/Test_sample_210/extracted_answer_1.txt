While the exact number of destitute migrants who settled on Colonel Thomas Talbot's land grant between 1803 and 1823 is not recorded, by 1826, about 20,000 immigrants had settled there. By 1821, the acreage he claimed had grown to over 65,000 acres, making it at least 60,000 acres larger than his original 5,000-acre grant.
