    "To date, there are 10 identified members of the let-7 family in humans. These members are mature microRNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression.\n\nThe human let-7 family includes the following unique sequences: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. While there are more than 10 genes that code for these microRNAs, some genes are redundant, leading to the 10 distinct mature forms. Specifically, 13 precursor genes give rise to these 10 mature let-7 miRNAs.\n\nThe let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and was one of the first families of microRNAs to be discovered. In humans, these molecules are recognized as tumor suppressors because they regulate the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and proliferation.\n\n<<<10>>>"
