    "The problem defines a recursive function $f(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n})$ and asks for the calculation of three values: $f(2,4,5)$, $f(9000,9000,9000)$, and $f(p,p,p,p)\\mod p$ for the prime $p=10^9+7$.\n\nThe function is defined as follows:\n(1) $f(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n})=0$ if $a_{1}<0$ or if the sequence $a_{k}$ is not in increasing order. It is assumed that \"increasing order\" means non-decreasing, i.e., $a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots \\le a_n$.\n(2) $f(0,0,\\ldots,0)=1$.\n(3) $f(a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(a_1, \\ldots, a_i-1, \\ldots, a_n)$ in all other cases.\n\nThis recursive function counts the number of paths on an n-dimensional lattice from the point $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ to the origin $(0,0,\\ldots,0)$ using steps in the negative cardinal directions, constrained to stay within the Weyl chamber defined by $x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\ldots \\le x_n$.\n\nA known result from representation theory and combinatorics provides a closed-form formula for this function, which is the dimension of an irreducible representation of the general linear group GL(n). This dimension is given by the hook-length formula for semi-standard Young tableaux or, more directly, by the following formula:\n\n$f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} \\frac{a_j - a_i + j - i}{j - i}$\n\nThis formula holds when the arguments $a_i$ correspond to the highest weight of the representation, which are ordered non-increasingly. In our problem, the arguments are non-decreasing. By reversing the order of the arguments to match the conventional representation theory notation ($\\lambda_i = a_{n-i+1}$), the formula becomes:\n\n$f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} \\frac{a_{n-i+1} - a_{n-j+1} + j - i}{j - i}$\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the requested values.\n\n**Calculation of f(2,4,5)**\nHere, $n=3$, $a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=5$. The product is over pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i < j \\le 3$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (1,2)$: $\\frac{a_3 - a_2 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\frac{5 - 4 + 1}{1} = 2$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (1,3)$: $\\frac{a_3 - a_1 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{5 - 2 + 2}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (2,3)$: $\\frac{a_2 - a_1 + 3 - 2}{3 - 2} = \\frac{4 - 2 + 1}{1} = 3$.\n\nThe product is $2 \\times \\frac{5}{2} \\times 3 = 15$. The result must be an integer, which it is. A non-integer term can arise if the conditions for the underlying combinatorial object are not met, making the value 0. However, in this case, the final product is an integer.\n\n**Calculation of f(9000, 9000, 9000)**\nHere, $n=3$, and $a_1=a_2=a_3=9000$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (1,2)$: $\\frac{9000 - 9000 + 1}{1} = 1$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (1,3)$: $\\frac{9000 - 9000 + 2}{2} = 1$.\n*   For $(i,j) = (2,3)$: $\\frac{9000 - 9000 + 1}{1} = 1$.\n\nThe product is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n**Calculation of f(p, p, p, p) mod p**\nHere, $n=4$, and $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=p$, where $p=10^9+7$ is a prime number.\nThe factors in the product are of the form $\\frac{p - p + j - i}{j - i} = \\frac{j-i}{j-i} = 1$ for all $1 \\le i < j \\le 4$.\nThe product is a product of ones, which equals 1. Therefore, $f(p,p,p,p) = 1$.\nThe value modulo p is $1 \\pmod p = 1$.\n\nThe final answers are separated by a comma.\n\n15, 1, 1\n<<<15, 1, 1>>>"
