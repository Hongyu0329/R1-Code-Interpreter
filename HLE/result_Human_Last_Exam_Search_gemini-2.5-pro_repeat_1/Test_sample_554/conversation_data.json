    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms. The term \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms on the original molecule's hydrocarbon framework are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe original nanocar, developed at Rice University in 2005, consists of an H-shaped chassis with four fullerene (C60) wheels. The fluorination process would affect the hydrocarbon chassis, as the C60 fullerene wheels are composed entirely of carbon and have no hydrogen atoms to replace.\n\nA model of a flexible nanocar chassis has the molecular formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. Based on this structure, there are 34 hydrogen atoms available for substitution. Therefore, replacing each hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom would result in a molecule containing 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
