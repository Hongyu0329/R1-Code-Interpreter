    "The problem asks for the value of the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$.\n\nFirst, we simplify the integrand, which is the infinite sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. Using the property of logarithms, this sum can be written as the logarithm of an infinite product:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThere is a well-known identity for the infinite product of cosines, given by:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nThis identity can be derived from the repeated application of the sine double-angle formula, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nFor the integrand to be well-defined, we must have $\\cos(x/2^n) > 0$ for all $n \\geq 1$. This condition is met for $x$ in the interval $(0, \\pi)$. If we consider the integral over the entire range from $0$ to $\\infty$, we should technically consider the logarithm of the absolute value, $\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|$.\n\nThus, the original integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|\\mathrm{d}x $$\nThis is a known definite integral. A common method to evaluate it involves considering a more general integral with a parameter and then differentiating under the integral sign. Another approach involves complex analysis and contour integration.\n\nThe value of this integral is a standard result in mathematical analysis. While the indefinite integral of $\\log(\\sin x)$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, several related definite integrals have concise values. For instance, a well-known result is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\log(2) $$\nThis can be proven by using the symmetry of the sine and cosine functions over the interval $[0, \\pi/2]$.\n\nThe evaluation of $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|\\mathrm{d}x$ is more involved but is known to be $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nA key step in a full derivation involves showing that we can interchange the summation and integration:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nHowever, if we attempt to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side, we encounter divergence, which suggests this interchange is not permissible and the summation must be performed before integration.\n\nBy evaluating the sum first, as shown above, we arrive at the integral of $\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|$. The value of this integral is established to be $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n"
