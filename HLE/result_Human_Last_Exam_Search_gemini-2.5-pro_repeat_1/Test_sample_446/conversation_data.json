    "The Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) motif is a primary recognition site for many integrin receptors, which are crucial for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). While the RGD sequence is central to binding, the amino acids flanking this core motif can significantly influence binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nAmong the choices provided, the peptide **RGDSPSS** is well-documented as a sequence that binds to integrin receptors. This sequence is derived from fibronectin, a major ECM protein and a natural ligand for integrins. Specifically, the shorter peptide RGDSP has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of integrin binding to fibronectin, indicating a direct interaction. One study demonstrated that the RGDSP peptide is a functional ligand for α5β1 and αVβ5 integrins and can activate them. The closely related peptide GRGDSP, also derived from fibronectin's cell-binding site, has been used extensively in in vitro assays to study fibroblast adhesion and the organization of integrin subunits.\n\nEvidence for the other peptides is less direct or established in the context of well-known in vitro assays:\n*   **RGDMAA:** The sequence RGDMA is found in the VP1 capsid protein of Human Parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) and is involved in the virus's binding to cellular integrins. While it's a known integrin-binding motif in a viral context, it is less commonly used as a standard peptide in in vitro integrin assays compared to fibronectin-derived sequences.\n*   **RGDLTTP:** This specific peptide was identified through directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids to create variants with high efficiency for transducing muscle cells, a process dependent on integrin binding. Like RGDMAA, its binding is confirmed but in the more complex context of a modified viral capsid rather than as a standalone peptide in a classic binding assay.\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG:** There is limited specific scientific literature available from the searches confirming these particular peptides have been found to bind integrin receptors in standard in vitro assays.\n\nGiven the extensive use and direct evidence of RGDSP and its longer variant RGDSPSS as functional ligands derived from fibronectin and used in competitive binding and cell adhesion assays, it is the most strongly supported choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
