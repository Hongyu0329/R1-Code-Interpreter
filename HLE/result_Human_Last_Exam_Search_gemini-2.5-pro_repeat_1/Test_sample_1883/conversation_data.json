    "## FMO Theory Predicts Exclusive Formation of *trans*-Isomer in Decatetraene Cyclization\n\nUnder thermal conditions, the electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is predicted by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory to be a highly stereospecific reaction, yielding predominantly the *trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene isomer (B) and virtually none of the *cis*-isomer (A). This leads to a predicted ratio of A:B approaching 0:100.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of this pericyclic reaction is governed by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the reacting polyene. For a thermal reaction, the ground-state electronic configuration is considered. \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a conjugated system with eight π-electrons (a 4n system, where n=2). The HOMO for an 8π-electron system is ψ₄.\n\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are a direct consequence of FMO theory, thermal electrocyclic reactions of 4n π-electron systems proceed via a conrotatory mechanism. This means that the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to allow for the constructive overlap of lobes with the same phase to form the new sigma bond.\n\nTo visualize the outcome for \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, we must consider the geometry of the starting material. The substituents at the termini of the reacting system are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom on each end (C2 and C9). In the specified isomer, the substituents at C2 are in a *Z* configuration, and at C8, they are in an *E* configuration.\n\nDuring the conrotatory ring closure, the two methyl groups will be directed either both \"inward\" or both \"outward\" relative to the newly forming ring. Due to the specific stereochemistry of the starting material, a conrotatory motion will inevitably place the two methyl groups on opposite faces of the resulting eight-membered ring, leading to the formation of the *trans*-isomer (B). The alternative disrotatory pathway, which would be required to form the *cis*-isomer (A), is thermally forbidden as it would involve the destructive overlap of orbital lobes of opposite phases.\n\nTherefore, the reaction is stereospecific, meaning that a specific stereoisomer of the reactant will form a specific stereoisomer of the product. The thermal cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene yields *trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene as the exclusive product. Consequently, the amount of the *cis*-isomer (A) formed is negligible.\n\n<<<0:100>>>"
