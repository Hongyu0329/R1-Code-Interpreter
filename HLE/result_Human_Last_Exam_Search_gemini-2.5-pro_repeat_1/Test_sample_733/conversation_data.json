    "There are exactly four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups are the cyclic group of order 3 ($C_3$), the cyclic group of order 4 ($C_4$), the Klein four-group ($C_2 \\times C_2$), and the symmetric group on three elements ($S_3$).\n\nA subset $S$ of a group $G$ is called \"product-free\" if for all $x, y, z \\in S$, the relation $xy=z$ does not hold. Such a set is \"maximal by inclusion\" if it is not properly contained within any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups possessing such sets of size 2 was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work provides a complete list of these groups and the specific product-free sets.\n\nThe groups and their corresponding maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are as follows:\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$:** For $C_3 = \\{e, a, a^2\\}$, the set $\\{a, a^2\\}$ is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$:** For $C_4 = \\{e, a, a^2, a^3\\}$, the set $\\{a, a^3\\}$ is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n*   **The Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$:** For $C_2 \\times C_2 = \\{e, a, b, ab\\}$, the set $\\{a, b\\}$ is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n*   **The symmetric group of order 6, $S_3$:** For $S_3$, which can be represented as the group of permutations of three elements, any set consisting of two distinct elements of order 2 is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. For instance, if $S_3$ is generated by a rotation $r$ of order 3 and a reflection $s$ of order 2, then a set like $\\{s, sr\\}$ is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nThese four groups are the only finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
