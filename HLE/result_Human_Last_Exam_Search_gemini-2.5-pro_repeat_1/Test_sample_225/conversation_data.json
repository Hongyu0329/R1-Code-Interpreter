    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined by a known formula when the frequencies 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n\nFor the curve given by (cos(9t), sin(5t)), we have a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nThe general conditions for the number of self-intersections depend on the parity of 'a' and 'b' and whether they are coprime.\n*   **Frequencies:** a = 9 and b = 5.\n*   **Parity:** Both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers.\n*   **Coprime:** The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)) where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the given values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
