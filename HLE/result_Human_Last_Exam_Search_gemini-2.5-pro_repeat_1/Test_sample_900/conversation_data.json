    "Svetlana Gileva performed three *pas de Balanchine* steps in the Jete Woman solo of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nA video of the solo from a performance on November 9, 2015, shows Gileva executing the specific step, a variation on a *pas de bourr√©e* where the back foot pokes out rather than crossing over, in a quick succession of three.\n\nThe role is officially titled the \"Jete Woman\" within the ballet. The ballet itself, choreographed by William Forsythe in 1987, is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet techniques and its athletic, off-balance style.\n\n<<<3>>>"
