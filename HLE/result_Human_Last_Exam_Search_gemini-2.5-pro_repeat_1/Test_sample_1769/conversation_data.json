    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **swester**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" comes from a mix of the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir*. The \"i\" vowel in the modern word is a direct result of the Scandinavian influence. Without this interaction, the word would have evolved naturally from its original Anglo-Saxon form.\n\nThe Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor*, with variations such as *swuster* and *sweoster*. The first syllable contained a short \"eo\" diphthong, a vowel sound that glided from \"e\" to \"o\". During the evolution from Old to Middle English, short diphthongs like this commonly simplified into a single vowel. The \"eo\" sound, in particular, typically became \"e\".\n\nThis phonological change would have transformed *sweostor* into the Middle English *swester*. This form is consistent with a number of its Germanic cousins, such as Old Saxon and Old High German *swester*, and the Modern German *Schwester*. From Middle English, *swester* would likely have been carried into Modern English with its spelling and basic pronunciation intact, similar to the development of other familial terms.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
