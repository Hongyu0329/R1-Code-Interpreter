    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the method of row reduction on the compound matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2. The resulting non-zero matrix block after reduction will be a GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s² + s, -s; -s² - 1, s²]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the compound matrix M.**\nWe stack P1 on top of P2 to form a 4x2 matrix M:\nM =\n[ s² + s,  -s   ]  (R1)\n[ -s² - 1, s²   ]  (R2)\n[ s,       0    ]  (R3)\n[ -s - 1,  1    ]  (R4)\n\n**Step 2: Apply elementary row operations to simplify the matrix.**\nThe goal is to introduce zero rows by using polynomial multiples of other rows. The set of common right divisors is invariant under these operations.\n\n1.  Replace R1 with R1 + s*R4:\n    R1' = [s² + s + s(-s - 1), -s + s(1)] = [s² + s - s² - s, 0] =\n2.  Replace R2 with R2 + s²*R4:\n    R2' = [-s² - 1 + s²(-s - 1), s² + s²(1)] = [-s² - 1 - s³ - s², 2s²] = [-s³ - 2s² - 1, 2s²]\n\nThis path seems to create more complex polynomials. Let's try a different sequence of operations which is generally more systematic. We will use the rows with lower degree polynomials to simplify the rows with higher degree polynomials.\n\nLet's start again with the original matrix M:\nM =\n[ s² + s,  -s   ]  (R1)\n[ -s² - 1, s²   ]  (R2)\n[ s,       0    ]  (R3)\n[ -s - 1,  1    ]  (R4)\n\n1.  Replace R1 with R1 - (s+1)*R3:\n    R1' = [s² + s - (s+1)s, -s - (s+1)0] = [s² + s - s² - s, -s] = [0, -s]\n2.  Replace R2 with R2 + s*R3:\n    R2' = [-s² - 1 + s*s, s² + s*0] = [-1, s²]\n3.  Replace R4 with R4 + R3:\n    R4' = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\nThe matrix is now equivalent to:\nM' =\n[ 0,  -s  ]\n[ -1, s²  ]\n[ s,  0   ]\n[ -1, 1   ]\n\nReorder the rows for easier computation (this does not change the GCRD):\nM'' =\n[ -1, s²  ]\n[ -1, 1   ]\n[ s,  0   ]\n[ 0,  -s  ]\n\n1.  Replace R2 with R2 - R1:\n    R2' = [-1 - (-1), 1 - s²] = [0, 1 - s²]\n2.  Replace R1 with -1*R1:\n    R1' = [1, -s²]\n3.  Replace R3 with R3 + s*R1':\n    R3' = [s + s(1), 0 + s(-s²)] = [s+s, -s³] Wait, the operation should use the original R1. Let's stick to the transformed matrix M''.\n    R3' = [s, 0] + s*[-1, s²] = [s-s, s³] = [0, s³]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM''' =\n[ 1, -s² ] (from -R1 of M'')\n[ 0, 1-s²] (from (R2-R1) of M'')\n[ 0, s³  ] (from (R3+sR1) of M'')\n[ 0, -s  ] (from R4 of M'')\n\nNow we focus on the last three rows, which have a zero in the first column. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor of the polynomials 1-s², s³, and -s.\nThe GCD of these polynomials is gcd(1-s², s³, -s) = gcd(1-s², s).\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials: 1-s² = (-s) * s + 1. The remainder is 1, so the gcd is 1.\nThis implies that through elementary row operations, we can obtain a row. Let's show this:\n\n4.  Take the current last three rows: [0, 1-s²], [0, s³], [0, -s].\n5.  Add s times the last row to the second row:\n    [0, 1-s²]\n    [0, s³ + s(-s)] = [0, s³ - s²]\n    [0, -s]\nThis is not leading to a simple '1'. Let's use the property gcd(a,b) = gcd(a, b+q*a).\ngcd(1-s², s) = 1. We can write 1 = 1*(1-s²) + s*(s).\nSo, let's perform the corresponding row operations on M'''. Let the rows of M''' be r1, r2, r3, r4.\n    New R2 = 1*r2 + s*r4 = [0, 1-s²] + s*[0, -s] = [0, 1-s²+s(-s)] = [0, 1-s²-s²] = [0, 1-2s²]. This is not right.\n    The operation is: 1 = (1) * (1-s^2) + (s) * (s).\n    So, New Row = 1 * (Row with 1-s^2) + s * (Row with s). The row with 's' is R4, but it is -s.\n    So, 1 = (1)*(1-s²) - s*(-s).\n    New Row = 1*r2 - s*r4 = [0, 1-s²] - s*[0, -s] = [0, 1-s²+s²] =.\n\nSo, the matrix M''' is row-equivalent to:\nM'''' =\n[ 1, -s² ]\n[ 0, 1   ]\n[ 0, s³  ]\n[ 0, -s  ]\n\nNow, use the row to eliminate the other elements in the second column:\n1.  Replace R1 with R1 + s²*R2:\n    R1' = [1, -s² + s²(1)] =\n2.  Replace R3 with R3 - s³*R2:\n    R3' = [0, s³ - s³(1)] =\n3.  Replace R4 with R4 + s*R2:\n    R4' = [0, -s + s(1)] =\n\nThe final matrix is equivalent to:\n[ 1, 0 ]\n[ 0, 1 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n\nThe non-zero part of this matrix is the GCRD.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\nG = [1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nThis means that the matrices P1 and P2 are relatively right prime.\n\n"
