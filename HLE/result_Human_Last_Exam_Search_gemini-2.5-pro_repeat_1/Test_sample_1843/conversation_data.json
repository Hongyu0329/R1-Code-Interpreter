    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow a systematic approach based on the properties of these characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 360 \\times 100 + 36 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 + 36$ is not right.\n$N = 36036 = 4 \\times 9009 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 1001 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\nThe prime power factors of $N$ are $4, 9, 7, 11, \\text{ and } 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters, each corresponding to a prime power factor of $N$. Let $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_k$ is a primitive character with conductor $k$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $o_k$ be the order of $\\chi_k$. We require:\n$\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThis single condition implies two sub-conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $o_k$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, keeping in mind that their order must divide 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice. So, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$, and its order is $o_4 = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The characters that are not primitive are those induced from characters modulo 3. These have orders 1 and 2. The primitive characters are those with orders that are not divisors of $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders for characters in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. Thus, the primitive characters modulo 9 have orders 3 and 6. Both of these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_9$. The order $o_9$ will be either 3 or 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The possible orders for primitive (non-principal) characters are 2, 5, and 10. For the lcm to be 6, the order must divide 6. Only the order 2 qualifies.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    This gives **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$, and its order is $o_{11} = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The possible orders for primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We only consider orders that divide 6, which are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Choices and Verifying the Order\nWe have determined the number of valid choices for each component character. The total number of combinations is the product of these numbers:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that for every one of these 100 combinations, the resulting character has an order of exactly 6.\n*   The order of any chosen $\\chi_4$ is 2. This ensures the lcm of the orders is divisible by 2.\n*   The order of any chosen $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6. This ensures the lcm of the orders is divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. As we have already constrained the individual orders to be divisors of 6, their lcm cannot be greater than 6. Therefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for any possible combination.\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the total number of combinations.\n\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
