    "### Mount Athos Stands as the Tallest Historical Peak in the Iliad After Mount Olympus\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the highest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's epic poem, the *Iliad*, is Mount Athos, with a summit reaching 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). While Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the gods, is the highest mountain in Greece at 2,917 meters (9,570 feet), several other terrestrial peaks play a role in the epic narrative.\n\nThe *Iliad* makes reference to a number of mountains that can be identified with actual locations. Among the most prominent, after Olympus, are:\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on the peninsula of the same name in northeastern Greece, it is mentioned by Homer. Today, it is a significant center of Eastern Orthodox monasticism.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Situated near the ancient city of Troy in modern-day Turkey, this mountain, with an elevation of 1,770 meters (5,820 feet), served as a vantage point for the gods to witness the Trojan War. Zeus, in particular, is noted to have observed the conflict from its peak, Gargarus. It is distinct from the taller Mount Ida on the island of Crete.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Found in Thessaly, mainland Greece, Mount Pelion has an elevation of 1,624 meters. In mythology, it was the home of the centaur Chiron, who crafted the great spear of Achilles from its ash trees.\n*   **Mount Saos (Fengari):** This is the highest point on the island of Samothrace, rising to 1,611 meters. From its summit, the god Poseidon is said to have watched the unfolding of the Trojan War.\n\nThe island of Imbros, located between Tenedos and Samothrace, is also mentioned in the *Iliad* as a place significant to the gods, particularly Poseidon, but it does not feature a prominent named mountain of comparable height.\n\nComparing the elevations of these historical mountains mentioned in the epic, Mount Athos emerges as the tallest among them, second only to the legendary Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
