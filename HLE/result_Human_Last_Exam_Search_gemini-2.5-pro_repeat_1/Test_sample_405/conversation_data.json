    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white (which can also appear yellow), red, black, and violet.\n\nPhosphorus is known for existing in several different physical forms, known as allotropes, each with unique properties and appearances. The most common and well-established of these allotropes are distinguished by their characteristic colors.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus**: This is a translucent, waxy solid. Due to the presence of impurities or exposure to light, which causes a slow conversion to red phosphorus, it often has a yellowish appearance. It is highly reactive and can ignite spontaneously in the air.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus**: This allotrope is more stable than white phosphorus and has a color that can range from a deep red to a reddish-violet or dark red-purple. It is commonly used on the striking surface of safety matchboxes.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus**: As the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus, black phosphorus is similar in appearance to graphite. It is black or grey with a metallic luster and is a conductor of electricity.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus**: Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is crystalline and can appear as red-purple or violet crystals. Descriptions of its color also include brown transparent plates or having a steely blue luster. When finely ground, it may look red.\n\nWhile other allotropes such as blue phosphorus have been synthesized, they are typically produced as monolayers, and their observation as a distinct bulk material color is less common. Therefore, the number of distinct, commonly observed colors of pure phosphorus allotropes is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
