    "There are exactly **13** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA 2015 paper by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart, titled \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" proved that any finite group containing such a set must have an order of at most 24. This proof confirmed that the previously known list of such groups was complete.\n\nThe term \"maximal by inclusion product-free set\" is equivalent to the term \"locally maximal product-free set\" used in the research literature. A set *S* within a group *G* is product-free if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. It is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe 13 finite groups are:\n*   **C₅:** The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **C₆:** The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **D₆:** The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃).\n*   **C₇:** The cyclic group of order 7.\n*   **C₈:** The cyclic group of order 8.\n*   **Q₈:** The quaternion group.\n*   **C₉:** The cyclic group of order 9.\n*   **C₁₀:** The cyclic group of order 10.\n*   **D₁₀:** The dihedral group of order 10.\n*   **A₄:** The alternating group on 4 elements.\n*   **C₁₂:** The cyclic group of order 12.\n*   **D₁₂:** The dihedral group of order 12.\n*   **SL(2,3):** The special linear group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the field with 3 elements.\n\nThis complete list is presented in the research that finalized the classification of these groups.\n\n<<<13>>>"
