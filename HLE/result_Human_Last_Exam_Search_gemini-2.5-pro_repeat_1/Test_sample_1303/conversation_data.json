    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 is a small molecule with the molecular formula C24H29N5O3. To identify other small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions, it is necessary to first determine the protein target of CHEMBL4803817. The likely target is the serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim-1. Pim-1 kinase is a critical enzyme involved in cell growth, survival, and apoptosis, making it an important target for anti-tumor drugs.\n\nNumerous small molecules have been developed to interact with Pim-1 kinase, primarily as inhibitors. These molecules bind to the protein, modulating its activity.\n\n**Small molecules that interact with Pim-1 kinase include:**\n\n*   **AZD1208:** A potent, orally available pan-Pim kinase inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.4 nM for Pim-1. It is considered a next-generation Pim kinase inhibitor that can induce autophagy, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.\n*   **SGI-1776:** A first-generation, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Pim-1 with an IC50 of 7 nM. It is 50-fold selective for Pim-1 over Pim-2 and also shows activity against Flt3 and haspin.\n*   **PIM447 (LGH447):** A novel and potent pan-PIM kinase inhibitor with a Ki of 6 pM for PIM1.\n*   **TP-3654:** A second-generation PIM inhibitor that targets all isoforms of Pim kinase but has a reduced effect on other proteins like FLT3, which was an issue with earlier inhibitors.\n*   **CX-6258 HCl:** A potent, orally effective pan-Pim kinase inhibitor with an IC50 of 5 nM for Pim-1.\n*   **SMI-4a:** A potent inhibitor of Pim-1 with an IC50 of 17 nM and is modestly potent towards Pim-2.\n*   **Hispidulin:** A natural ingredient found in some traditional Chinese medicinal herbs that inhibits the oncogenic protein kinase Pim-1 with an IC50 of 2.71 Î¼M.\n*   **TCS PIM-1 1:** A potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitor for Pim-1 kinase with an IC50 of 50 nM.\n*   **SMI-16a:** A selective Pim kinase inhibitor with an IC50 of 150 nM for Pim-1.\n*   **Pim-1/2 kinase inhibitor 1:** An orally active inhibitor that blocks the ability of Pim kinases to phosphorylate peptides.\n\nThese small molecules represent various chemical scaffolds that achieve their therapeutic potential by forming protein-ligand interactions with the Pim-1 kinase enzyme.\n\n<<<The chemical with ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817 is a small molecule that likely interacts with the protein Pim-1 kinase. Other small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with Pim-1 kinase include AZD1208, SGI-1776, PIM447 (LGH447), TP-3654, CX-6258 HCl, SMI-4a, Hispidulin, TCS PIM-1 1, and SMI-16a. These molecules primarily act as inhibitors of the kinase.>>>"
