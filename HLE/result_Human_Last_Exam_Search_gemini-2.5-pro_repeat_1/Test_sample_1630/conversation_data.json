    "Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points of this composite function are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n### Degree of the Composite Polynomial\n\nThe degree of a composite polynomial $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. In this case, the degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is therefore a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Thus, $f(g(x)) = x$ can have at most 9 real solutions. This means the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n### The Constraint of Positive Derivatives\n\nThe problem states that the derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nThe derivative of the composite function is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, it follows that $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means that $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nA strictly increasing function can still intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times. For a degree 9 polynomial, these intersections correspond to the fixed points. For $h(x) = x$ to have 9 distinct solutions, the graph of $y=h(x)$ must \"wiggle\" and cross the line $y=x$ nine times.\n\n### Existence of 9 Fixed Points\n\nTo determine if 9 fixed points are achievable, we can analyze the derivative of the function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. By Rolle's Theorem, if $H(x)$ has 9 real roots, then its derivative, $H'(x)$, must have at least 8 real roots.\n\nThe derivative is $H'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   $f'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2).\n*   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial (degree 3).\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2).\n*   Therefore, $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. An 8th-degree polynomial can have up to 8 real roots. This means it is theoretically possible for $H(x)$ to have 9 real roots.\n\nFor this to occur, the 8 roots of $H'(x)=0$ must be real and distinct, and the values of $H(x)$ at these critical points must alternate in sign. While constructing such polynomials $f$ and $g$ explicitly is complex, the existence of such polynomials is supported by the theory of polynomial composition. The constraints that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing ensure that the composite function $h(x)$ is also strictly increasing, but this does not limit its capacity to intersect the line $y=x$ up to the maximum number of times allowed by its degree.\n\nPrevious mathematical results have shown that for polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degrees $m$ and $n$ respectively, the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is $mn$, provided $m$ or $n$ is odd. In this case, with $m=n=3$, the maximum is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The additional condition of positive derivatives does not reduce this maximum.\n\n<<<9>>>"
