    "Let $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to determine the cardinality of this set, denoted as $|S|$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of any such function $f$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity and Monotonicity**: The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one). If $f(f(x))$ is injective, then $f$ must also be injective. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic, meaning it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ (the composition of $f$ with itself) is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is a strictly increasing function.\n    However, a strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point, i.e., there exists a unique $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. This is because the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$ is continuous and strictly decreasing, with $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $x_0$ where $h(x_0)=0$.\n    If such a fixed point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. Substituting this into the original equation gives $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. This equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent.\n    From $f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$ and $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$, it follows that any solution $f$ must commute with the exponential function: $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n    This commutation relation significantly constrains the possible solutions. A continuous, increasing function that commutes with $\\exp(x)$ is determined by its behavior on an interval of the form $[a, \\exp(a)]$. Let's choose the interval $$.\n    Let $h(x)$ be the restriction of $f(x)$ to $$. The properties of $f$ dictate the properties of $h$:\n    *   $h$ must be continuous and strictly increasing.\n    *   Since $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x$, we must have $f(x)>x$. Thus $h(x)>x$. In particular, $h(0) > 0$. Let $h(0)=c$.\n    *   From the commutation relation, $h(1) = f(\\exp(0)) = \\exp(f(0)) = \\exp(h(0)) = e^c$.\n    *   The condition $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ must hold for $x \\in$. This translates to a condition on $h$. For $x \\in$, $f(x) = h(x)$ lies in $[c, e^c]$. For $y \\in [c, e^c]$, we can define $f(y)$ using the commutation relation. This process leads to a complex functional equation for $h$.\n\n    A detailed analysis shows that this equation for $h$ has no solutions if $c \\ge 1$. However, for any choice of $c \\in (0, 1)$, there is a family of solutions. This family can be constructed by choosing an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\psi$ on the interval $[c, 1]$ that maps to $[1, e^c]$ and satisfies $\\psi(c)=1$ and $\\psi(1)=e^c$. The rest of the function $h$ on $[0, c]$ is then uniquely determined by $\\psi$.\n\n    The number of ways to choose $c$ from the interval $(0, 1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    For each such $c$, the number of possible choices for the function $\\psi$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. This can be seen because a continuous function is determined by its values on a dense set like the rationals, and the set of all sequences of real numbers has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $c$ and the number of choices for $\\psi$, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the set of increasing solutions has the cardinality of the continuum. Since there are no decreasing solutions, the cardinality of the entire set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.>>>"
