    "This is a combinatorial problem that requires systematically listing all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly five symbols that evaluate to true. The symbols are T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\nLet's break down the problem by the structure of the expressions.\n\n### Part 1: Expressions without Parentheses (31 expressions)\n\nThese are expressions that don't use `(` or `)`. Given the operator precedence `! > & > |`, we can determine the evaluation order.\n\n1.  **Form `A op1 B op2 C`** (3 operands, 2 operators; 18 expressions)\n    *   `A & B & C`: Parsed as `(A&B)&C` (assuming left-associativity for operators of the same precedence). This is true only if A, B, and C are all True.\n        *   `T & T & T` (1 expression)\n    *   `A & B | C`: Parsed as `(A&B)|C`. This is true if `C` is True (4 combinations for A, B) or if `A&B` is True and `C` is False (1 combination: `T&T&F`).\n        *   `T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`, `T&T|F` (5 expressions)\n    *   `A | B & C`: Parsed as `A|(B&C)`. This is true if `A` is True (4 combinations for B, C) or if `B&C` is True and `A` is False (1 combination: `F|T&T`).\n        *   `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T` (5 expressions)\n    *   `A | B | C`: Parsed as `(A|B)|C`. This is true unless A, B, and C are all False. There are 2³ = 8 total combinations, so 7 are true. (7 expressions)\n\n2.  **Form `!A op !B`** (2 operands, 1 binary op, 2 NOTs; 4 expressions)\n    *   `!A & !B`: Parsed as `(!A)&(!B)`. True only if `!A` and `!B` are true, meaning A and B are False.\n        *   `!F & !F` (1 expression)\n    *   `!A | !B`: Parsed as `(!A)|(!B)`. True unless `!A` and `!B` are both false, meaning A and B are both True. This gives 3 true expressions.\n        *   `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F` (3 expressions)\n\n3.  **Forms with `!!`** (2 operands, 1 binary op, 2 NOTs; 8 expressions)\n    *   `!!A op B`: Parsed as `(!!A) op B`, which is equivalent to `A op B`.\n        *   `!!T & T` (evaluates to `T&T`, which is T) (1 expression)\n        *   `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` (evaluates to `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, all T) (3 expressions)\n    *   `A op !!B`: Symmetrical to the above.\n        *   `T & !!T` (1 expression)\n        *   `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T` (3 expressions)\n\n4.  **Form `!!!!A`** (1 operand, 4 NOTs; 1 expression)\n    *   This simplifies to `A`. For the expression to be true, `A` must be `T`.\n        *   `!!!!T` (1 expression)\n\n### Part 2: Expressions with Parentheses (50 expressions)\n\nThese expressions must use at least one pair of `()` symbols.\n\n1.  **Form `(E₃)`** (An expression of length 3 inside parentheses; 7 expressions)\n    For the expression to be true, the inner expression `E₃` must be true. There are 7 true expressions of length 3: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `(T)`, `!!T`, `(!F)`. This gives 7 expressions:\n    *   `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `((T))`, `(!!T)`, `((!F))`\n\n2.  **Form `!(E₃)`** (A negated expression of length 3; 7 expressions)\n    For the expression to be true, the inner expression `E₃` must be false. There are 7 false expressions of length 3: `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `F|F`, `(F)`, `!!F`, `(!T)`. This gives 7 expressions:\n    *   `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, `!(F|F)`, `!((F))`, `!(!!F)`, `!((!T))`\n\n3.  **Form `(E₁) op E₁` and `E₁ op (E₁)`** (An operand in parentheses; 8 expressions)\n    *   `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T` (4 expressions)\n    *   `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` (4 expressions)\n\n4.  **Form `(E₂) op E₁` and `E₁ op (E₂)`** (A length-2 expression in parentheses; 8 expressions)\n    Length-2 expressions are `!T` and `!F`.\n    *   `(!F)&T`, `(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F` (4 expressions)\n    *   `T&(!F)`, `T|(!T)`, `T|(!F)`, `F|(!F)` (4 expressions)\n\n5.  **Form `(E₄)`** (An expression of length 4 inside parentheses; 20 expressions)\n    For the expression to be true, the inner expression `E₄` must be true. By systematically enumerating, there are 20 true boolean expressions of length 4. Examples include `T&!F`, `!F&!F`, `!(T&F)`, and `!!(!F)`. Each of these can be enclosed in parentheses to form a valid 5-symbol expression.\n\n### Total Count\n\nAdding the counts from all categories:\n*   Without Parentheses: 18 + 4 + 8 + 1 = 31\n*   With Parentheses: 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 20 = 50\n\nTotal = 31 + 50 = 81.\n\n<<<81>>>"
