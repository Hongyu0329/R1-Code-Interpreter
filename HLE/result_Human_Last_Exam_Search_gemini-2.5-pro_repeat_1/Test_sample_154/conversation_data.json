    "There are **8** simple non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA graph is **2-vertex-connected** (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any \"articulation points\" or \"cut vertices\". For a simple graph with 5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must be connected and every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices is 34, of which 21 are connected. By examining each of these 21 connected graphs for the presence of a cut vertex, we can identify the ones that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nThe 8 graphs can be categorized by their number of edges (m):\n\n*   **m = 5:** There is only one such graph, the **5-cycle (C5)**. Removing any vertex leaves a connected path of four vertices.\n*   **m = 6:** There are two such graphs:\n    *   The **House graph**, which is a square with a triangle on top, sharing an edge.\n    *   The **5-cycle with one chord**.\n*   **m = 7:** There is one such graph. This graph can be constructed by taking the complete graph K5 and removing the three edges of a path of length 3 (P4).\n*   **m = 8:** There are two such graphs:\n    *   The **Wheel graph (W5)**, which consists of a central vertex connected to the four vertices of a cycle.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed.\n*   **m = 9:** There is one such graph, which is the **complete graph K5 with one edge removed**.\n*   **m = 10:** There is one such graph, the **complete graph K5**.\n\nAny connected graph with 5 vertices and fewer than 5 edges will be a tree, and all trees with more than two vertices have cut vertices, so they are not 2-vertex-connected. All graphs with 7 or more edges, except for one specific case with 7 edges (the complement of a triangle plus two isolated vertices), are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n<<<8>>>"
