Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions ready for you. I see you picked up some Excedrin and mentioned you had a headache that you thought might be related to your recent cruise. It's good that the Excedrin helped. While a headache after travel can sometimes be due to a condition known as Mal de Debarquement syndrome, it's also important to be aware that headache is a potential side effect of all three of the medications you are taking.

**Headaches and Your Medications**

*   Both **Atorvastatin** and **Fluoxetine** can cause headaches, especially when you first start taking them. For many people, this side effect improves or goes away after the first week or two as your body gets used to the medicine.
*   Headache is also a very common side effect of birth control pills like **Junel Fe**. Sometimes, hormonal contraceptives can make existing migraines worse or cause new ones. It is important to let your doctor know if your headaches are new or have become more severe since starting this medication. Do you have a history of migraine headaches? If you have migraines with aura, this medication is generally not recommended.

**Important Information About Excedrin and Your Prescriptions**

*   While Excedrin was effective for your headache, it contains aspirin. Your antidepressant, **Fluoxetine**, can increase the risk of bleeding, and taking it with aspirin can enhance this effect. You should be mindful of any unusual bruising or bleeding. Occasional use is likely okay, but if you find you need it frequently, you should discuss it with your doctor.
*   It's also worth knowing that **Atorvastatin** can increase the level of hormones from your **Junel Fe** birth control, which could potentially increase the risk of its side effects.

**Recommendations**

1.  **Monitor Your Headaches:** Keep track of how often your headaches occur and how severe they are. If they continue for more than a week, get worse, or are severe, you should contact your doctor.
2.  **Stay Hydrated:** Dehydration can contribute to headaches, so be sure to drink plenty of fluids.
3.  **Watch for Other Side Effects:**
    *   With **Atorvastatin**, contact your doctor if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, as this can be a sign of a rare but serious side effect. Also, you should avoid drinking large quantities of grapefruit juice.
    *   With **Fluoxetine**, be aware of any significant changes in your mood or any of the other serious side effects, and let your doctor know if they occur.
    *   With **Junel Fe**, be aware of the signs of a blood clot, which are rare but serious. These include sudden severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or pain and swelling in one leg.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions.
