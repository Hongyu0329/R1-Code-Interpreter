    "By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space. A continuum is called nondegenerate if it consists of more than one point. A key concept for this problem is the **composant** of a point within a continuum. The composant of a point *x* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *y* in *X* for which there exists a proper subcontinuum (a subcontinuum not equal to *X*) that contains both *x* and *y*. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of composants in the product space *X* × *Y*, where *X* and *Y* are two nondegenerate continua. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\nTo determine the number of composants of the product space, we consider two cases:\n\n1.  **At least one continuum is decomposable:** A continuum is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. If a continuum is decomposable, it has exactly one composant. If either *X* or *Y* is decomposable, their product *X* × *Y* is also decomposable and, therefore, has only one composant. This represents the minimum possible number, not the maximum.\n\n2.  **Both continua are indecomposable:** To achieve a number of composants greater than one, both *X* and *Y* must be indecomposable. A continuum is indecomposable if it is not the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A crucial result in this context is a theorem by H. Cook, which states that for two indecomposable continua *X* and *Y*, the composants of their product *X* × *Y* are precisely the Cartesian products *C* × *D*, where *C* is a composant of *X* and *D* is a composant of *Y*.\n\nThis theorem implies that the number of composants of *X* × *Y* is the product of the number of composants of *X* and the number of composants of *Y*. To maximize this product, we need to find the maximum number of composants that a nondegenerate continuum can possess.\n\nIt is a known result in topology that an indecomposable continuum can have uncountably many composants. Specifically, there are continua that have **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, which is the size of the set of real numbers, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>) composants. Examples of such continua include:\n*   The pseudo-arc.\n*   Knaster continua (also known as buckethandle continua).\n*   Certain solenoids.\n\nSince a continuum is a separable metric space, it cannot be partitioned into more than **c** non-empty sets. Thus, **c** is the maximum possible number of composants.\n\nBy selecting *X* and *Y* to be two nondegenerate continua each having **c** composants (for instance, two Knaster continua), the number of composants in their product *X* × *Y* will be:\n\nNumber of composants = (Number of composants of *X*) × (Number of composants of *Y*) = **c** × **c**\n\nBy the laws of cardinal arithmetic, **c** × **c** = **c**. Therefore, the product space *X* × *Y* will also have **c** composants.\n\n<<<c>>>"
