    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the concepts of slice modules, tilting modules, and $\\tau$-tilting modules (in the strict sense) coincide. This is because $A$ is a hereditary algebra. A strict $\\tau$-tilting module $T$ must be $\\tau$-rigid and have a number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands equal to the number of simple $A$-modules, which is 3. For hereditary algebras, these conditions are equivalent to the definition of a tilting module, and it is a classical result that tilting modules over hereditary algebras correspond to slices in the Auslander-Reiten quiver. Therefore, every strict $\\tau$-tilting module is a slice module.\n\nThis suggests the question uses the term \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" in the broader sense of a **support $\\tau$-tilting module**, a concept introduced by Adachi, Iyama, and Reiten. A module $M$ is support $\\tau$-tilting if it forms a pair $(M, P)$ with an indecomposable projective module $P$ satisfying certain conditions, including that the number of indecomposable summands of $M$ plus the number of indecomposable summands of $P$ equals the number of simple modules (3 in this case).\n\nUnder this interpretation, a slice module is a support $\\tau$-tilting module where the projective part $P$ is zero, meaning the module part has 3 summands. We are looking for a support $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module, which means its module part $M$ must have fewer than 3 summands. The condition of uniqueness points to a property that only one of these modules holds.\n\nLet's analyze the support $\\tau$-tilting modules for $A$ based on the number of non-projective summands, denoted by $|M|$:\n*   **$|M| = 3$**: These are the five classical tilting modules, which are also the slice modules.\n*   **$|M| = 2$**: There are multiple support $\\tau$-tilting modules with two summands. For instance, the module $S_1 \\oplus M_{12}$ (where $S_i$ is the simple module at vertex $i$ and $M_{12}$ is the indecomposable module with dimension vector (1,1,0)) is one such module.\n*   **$|M| = 1$**: We seek an indecomposable module $M$ for which there exists a projective module $P$ with $|P|=2$ such that $(M, P)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair. The condition $\\text{Hom}(M, P)=0$ must be satisfied.\n    *   Let $S_1$ be the simple module at vertex 1. The indecomposable projective modules are $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$. We have $\\text{Hom}(S_1, P_2) = 0$ and $\\text{Hom}(S_1, P_3) = 0$. Thus, $(S_1, P_2 \\oplus P_3)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair.\n    *   No other single indecomposable module $M$ satisfies the condition $\\text{Hom}(M, P)=0$ for a projective $P$ with two summands. Therefore, $S_1$ is the unique support $\\tau$-tilting module with exactly one summand.\n*   **$|M| = 0$**: This corresponds to the zero module, forming the pair $(0, P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3)$.\n\nBoth the zero module and $S_1$ are unique in terms of their number of summands. However, in representation theory, questions about modules typically refer to non-zero modules unless otherwise specified. The simple module $S_1$ is therefore the unique non-trivial support $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice, distinguished by its number of indecomposable summands.\n\n<<<The simple module $S_1$ at vertex 1.>>>"
