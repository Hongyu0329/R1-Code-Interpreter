    "### No Historical Saints Named in Milton's *Paradise Lost*\n\nJohn Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* does not mention any historical, canonized saints by name. The term \"saints\" appears in the text, but it is used in a general biblical sense to refer to the righteous and blessed spirits in Heaven, rather than specific individuals recognized as saints by the Catholic or Orthodox churches.\n\nWhile the poem features prominent biblical figures and angelic beings such as the Archangels Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel, none of these are historical personages who lived on Earth and were later canonized for their holiness. In Christian tradition, Michael is often referred to as \"Saint Michael,\" but his origin is as a celestial being, not a historical human.\n\nThe character lists and scholarly analyses of *Paradise Lost* confirm the absence of any named historical saints. The poem's characters are primarily drawn from the Bible and classical mythology, including Adam, Eve, God, the Son of God, and a host of angels and demons.\n\nMilton's own religious convictions as a Puritan shed light on this absence. Puritan theology was notably critical of the veneration of saints as practiced by the Catholic Church, a practice that they viewed as a form of idolatry. It is therefore consistent with Milton's beliefs that he would avoid including such figures in his magnum opus. One analysis suggests that Milton may have even been criticizing the practice of praying to and worshiping saints through his depiction of the fallen angels being named after pagan gods.\n\nIn Book III of the poem, Milton does refer to \"translated saints,\" which is an allusion to biblical figures like Enoch and Elijah who, according to scripture, were taken directly to Heaven without dying. However, these are not saints in the traditional, post-biblical, canonized sense.\n\nIn summary, a thorough examination of the text of *Paradise Lost* and the scholarly consensus surrounding it reveals that no historical saints are named within the poem.\n\n<<<0>>>"
