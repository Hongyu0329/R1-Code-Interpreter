    "The Google search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n and describe Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$. This is a key theorem in graph coloring.\n\n directly addresses the question for a graph $K_n - e$ (a complete graph with one edge removed), stating its chromatic number is $n-1$.\n\nMy constructed example, $G = K_{12345} - e$, has $\\Delta(G) = 12344$. Since it's not a complete graph or an odd cycle, Brooks' Theorem implies $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) = 12344$. My analysis showed that $\\chi(G) = 12344$, which is consistent.\n\nMy argument that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices has $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$ is also sound and is a standard result. Since there exists at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices, they can be assigned the same color. This reduces the problem to coloring $n-1$ items (the pair and the other $n-2$ vertices), which can be done with at most $n-1$ colors.\n\nSo, the logic holds.\n1. Any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not the complete graph can be colored with at most $12344$ colors.\n2. The graph $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed is an example of a graph that requires $12344$ colors.\n3. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $12344$.\n\nThe final answer is 12344. I am ready to write the final response.\n\nFinal check of the question to ensure no misinterpretation.\n\"Let $G$ be graph with $12345$ vertices and maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ other than the complete graph. What is the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of $G$ properly?\"\nThe wording \"maximum number of colours that we need\" means \"what is the maximum possible chromatic number for such a graph G?\". My interpretation is correct. The mention of $\\Delta(G)$ is just part of the description of a graph, but the crucial property is that $G$ is not the complete graph.\n\nThe solution seems very straightforward now. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by standard graph theory results.\n\nI will structure my answer by first establishing the upper bound and then showing that this upper bound is achievable.\n\nUpper bound:\nLet $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Because they are not adjacent, we can assign them the same color in a proper coloring. All other $n-2$ vertices can then be colored. In the most trivial upper bound, we can assign a new distinct color to each of the remaining $n-2$ vertices. This leads to a coloring with $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Thus, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$. For $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nAchievability of the bound:\nConsider the graph $G^*$ created by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge $\\{u, v\\}$.\nTo color this graph, we must show that it requires $12344$ colors.\nIn $G^*$, consider the set of vertices $V' = V \\setminus \\{v\\}$. The subgraph induced by $V'$ is a complete graph $K_{12344}$ because all vertices in $V'$ were fully connected in $K_{12345}$ and removing the edge $\\{u, v\\}$ (where $u \\in V'$) does not remove any edges within $V'$.\nA clique of size $12344$ (the subgraph $K_{12344}$) requires $12344$ distinct colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of $G^*$ is at least $12344$.\nSince we have already established that any non-complete graph on 12345 vertices can be colored with at most 12344 colors, we have $\\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$.\nCombining these, $\\chi(G^*) = 12344$.\n\nSo the maximum is indeed 12344.\nThe response can be written now.\nNo need for further search.\nThe answer is an integer.\nI will return it in the requested format.\n<<<12344>>>Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The question asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of $G$, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, provided $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n\n### Upper Bound on the Number of Colors\n\nIf a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is not a complete graph, it means there is at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. In a proper vertex coloring, non-adjacent vertices can be assigned the same color.\n\nWe can devise a coloring strategy based on this fact. We can assign the same color to vertices $u$ and $v$. The remaining $n-2$ vertices can be colored using at most $n-2$ additional colors (in the worst case, one new color for each vertex). This gives a total of at most $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices is at most $n-1$.\n\nFor a graph with $n=12345$ vertices, this means the chromatic number is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n### Existence of a Graph Requiring This Number of Colors\n\nNow, we need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. Consider a graph $G^*$ constructed by taking the complete graph on 12345 vertices, $K_{12345}$, and removing a single edge between two vertices, say $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n\nThis graph $G^*$ is not a complete graph. Let's determine its chromatic number.\nConsider the set of $12344$ vertices $\\{v_2, v_3, \\dots, v_{12345}\\}$. In the original complete graph $K_{12345}$, these vertices form a clique of size 12344. Removing the edge $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ does not affect any edges between vertices in this set. Thus, the subgraph induced by $\\{v_2, v_3, \\dots, v_{12345}\\}$ is a complete graph $K_{12344}$.\n\nA clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring. Therefore, to color the $K_{12344}$ subgraph within $G^*$, we need at least 12344 colors. This establishes a lower bound for the chromatic number of $G^*$: $\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have shown:\n1.  Any graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most 12344 colors.\n2.  There exists such a graph (namely, $K_{12345}$ with one edge removed) that requires at least 12344 colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344. This result is also consistent with Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. For our example graph $G^* = K_{12345}-e$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G^*) = 12344$, so Brooks' theorem implies $\\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
