    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding root systems, which can be either irreducible or reducible. The rank of a Weyl group is equal to the rank of its root system, which corresponds to the number of vertices in the associated Dynkin diagram. A root system is irreducible if its Dynkin diagram is connected, and reducible if it is a direct sum of irreducible root systems. The Weyl group of a direct sum of root systems is the direct product of the corresponding Weyl groups.\n\nTo find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must identify all possible irreducible and reducible root systems of rank 4.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible root systems are classified into the infinite families A<sub>n</sub>, B<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>n</sub> and the exceptional root systems G<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub>. The subscript 'n' denotes the rank of the root system. For rank 4, the irreducible root systems are:\n*   **A<sub>4</sub>**: The Weyl group W(A<sub>4</sub>) is the symmetric group S<sub>5</sub>.\n*   **B<sub>4</sub>**: The Weyl group W(B<sub>4</sub>) is the hyperoctahedral group of rank 4.\n*   **C<sub>4</sub>**: The Weyl group W(C<sub>4</sub>) is isomorphic to W(B<sub>4</sub>).\n*   **D<sub>4</sub>**: The Weyl group W(D<sub>4</sub>) is a subgroup of W(B<sub>4</sub>) of index 2.\n*   **F<sub>4</sub>**: An exceptional Weyl group of rank 4.\n\nFrom this list, we have four non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4: W(A<sub>4</sub>), W(B<sub>4</sub>), W(D<sub>4</sub>), and W(F<sub>4</sub>).\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible root systems of rank 4 are formed by direct sums of lower-rank irreducible root systems where the ranks sum to 4. We consider the partitions of 4:\n\n*   **3 + 1**: This gives rise to the root systems A<sub>3</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> (since W(C<sub>3</sub>) is isomorphic to W(B<sub>3</sub>)). The corresponding Weyl groups are W(A<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) and W(B<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>).\n*   **2 + 2**: This partition can be formed by A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> × B<sub>2</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub> × B<sub>2</sub> (since W(C<sub>2</sub>) is isomorphic to W(B<sub>2</sub>)). The Weyl groups are W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>2</sub>), W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>), and W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>).\n*   **2 + 1 + 1**: This corresponds to the root systems A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub>. The Weyl groups are W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) and W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>).\n*   **1 + 1 + 1 + 1**: This corresponds to the root system A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub>, with the Weyl group W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>).\n\nBy calculating the orders of these groups, we can confirm they are non-isomorphic (with one exception that requires further analysis):\n*   W(A<sub>4</sub>): |S<sub>5</sub>| = 120\n*   W(B<sub>4</sub>): 2<sup>4</sup> * 4! = 384\n*   W(D<sub>4</sub>): 2<sup>3</sup> * 4! = 192\n*   W(F<sub>4</sub>): 1152\n*   W(A<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>): |S<sub>4</sub> × S<sub>2</sub>| = 24 × 2 = 48\n*   W(B<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>): (2<sup>3</sup> * 3!) × 2 = 96\n*   W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>2</sub>): |S<sub>3</sub> × S<sub>3</sub>| = 6 × 6 = 36\n*   W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>): |S<sub>3</sub> × D<sub>8</sub>| = 6 × 8 = 48\n*   W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>): |D<sub>8</sub> × D<sub>8</sub>| = 8 × 8 = 64\n*   W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>): |S<sub>3</sub> × S<sub>2</sub> × S<sub>2</sub>| = 6 × 2 × 2 = 24\n*   W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>): |D<sub>8</sub> × S<sub>2</sub> × S<sub>2</sub>| = 8 × 2 × 2 = 32\n*   W(A<sub>1</sub>)<sup>4</sup>: |S<sub>2</sub>|<sup>4</sup> = 16\n\nThe groups W(A<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) and W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>) both have order 48. However, they are not isomorphic as W(A<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) ≅ S<sub>4</sub> × C<sub>2</sub> has 19 elements of order 2, while W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>) ≅ S<sub>3</sub> × D<sub>8</sub> has 23 elements of order 2.\n\nIn total, there are 4 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups and 8 non-isomorphic reducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe list of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is:\n1.  W(A<sub>4</sub>)\n2.  W(B<sub>4</sub>)\n3.  W(D<sub>4</sub>)\n4.  W(F<sub>4</sub>)\n5.  W(A<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>)\n6.  W(B<sub>3</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>)\n7.  W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>2</sub>)\n8.  W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>)\n9.  W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(B<sub>2</sub>)\n10. W(A<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>)\n11. W(B<sub>2</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>)\n12. W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>) × W(A<sub>1</sub>)\n\nTherefore, there are 12 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<12>>>"
