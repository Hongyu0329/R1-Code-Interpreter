    "The Hopf charge, also known as the Hopf invariant, is a topological property of a vector field. The vector field provided describes a configuration known as a toroidal hopfion. The Hopf charge for such a configuration can be determined by examining its winding numbers.\n\nThe given vector field is:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis structure is characterized by two principal directions of winding: toroidal and poloidal. The Hopf charge `Q` is the product of the winding numbers in these two directions, `Q = n_t * n_p`.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding Number (`n_t`)**: This number describes how the vector field wraps around the central (z) axis. The angle `f` corresponds to the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates (`phi`). The terms `cos(f)` and `sin(f)` in the vector field definition show that as one moves around the z-axis (a toroidal path), the vector `(nx, ny)` completes one full rotation. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is `n_t = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (`n_p`)**: This number relates to the winding of the field in any plane that contains the z-axis (a poloidal plane). The angle `G` controls this aspect. At the core of the hopfion, which is a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the `z=0` plane, `r2 = 0` and thus `G = pi`. At an infinite distance from this core, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to become 0. As one traverses a path from the core to infinity in a poloidal plane, the angle `G` sweeps from `pi` to `0`. This full sweep corresponds to a poloidal winding number of `n_p = 1`.\n\nThe total Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\n`Q = n_t * n_p = 1 * 1 = 1`\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1. This is characteristic of the simplest stable toroidal hopfion.\n\nThe Whitehead integral formula provides a formal method to calculate the Hopf charge. However, its direct application to this specific field is complex due to a singularity along the z-axis where the angle `f = atan2(y,x)` is not well-defined, which can lead to a misleading result if not handled carefully. The interpretation based on winding numbers is more direct for this known configuration.\n\n<<<1>>>"
