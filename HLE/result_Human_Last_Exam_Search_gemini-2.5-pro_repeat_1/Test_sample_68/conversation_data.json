    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of the figure-eight knot has 5 elements.\n\nIn knot theory, the \"coloring\" of a knot is formally described by an algebraic structure known as a quandle. The number of elements in the quandle corresponds to the number of colors used. A knot is said to be *n*-colorable if its arcs can be colored with *n* colors while adhering to a specific rule at each crossing: twice the color of the over-arc must be equal to the sum of the colors of the two under-arcs, modulo *n*.\n\nA fundamental result in knot theory states that a knot can be colored with *n* colors (where *n* is a prime number) if and only if *n* divides the determinant of the knot.\n\nThe figure-eight knot, also known as knot 4_1, has a determinant of 5. Because the determinant is 5, the figure-eight knot is 5-colorable. It is not tricolorable (3-colorable) since 3 does not divide 5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime number of colors with which the figure-eight knot can be non-trivially colored is 5. The corresponding algebraic structure, the dihedral quandle of order 5 (Râ‚…), contains 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
