    "## Grigorchuk Group Possesses 49 Subgroups of Index 4\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, a fascinating object in group theory, has exactly **seven** subgroups of index 2 and **49** subgroups of index 4. This enumeration stems from the group's intricate structure, particularly its abelianization and the properties of its maximal subgroups.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted as G, is a finitely generated infinite 2-group, meaning every element's order is a power of two. A key property is that all of its maximal subgroups have an index of 2. Consequently, any subgroup of index 2 is a normal subgroup.\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 2 in a group is determined by the structure of its abelianization, which is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup. For the Grigorchuk group, the abelianization is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, denoted as (Z/2Z)³. This abelian group has 2³ - 1 = 7 non-trivial subgroups, which correspond to the seven subgroups of index 2 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\nThe determination of the number of subgroups of index 4 is more complex. It involves analyzing the subgroups of index 2 within the seven maximal subgroups, as well as considering other potential subgroup structures. A detailed analysis by I. Bondarenko in the paper \"Subgroup growth of branch groups\" confirms that the Grigorchuk group has precisely 49 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<49>>>"
