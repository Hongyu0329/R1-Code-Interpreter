    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, so their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero. Let's denote $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n\nAnd the normalization condition remains:\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nLet's solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_{2} = 0.008 P_{3} \\implies P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n$0.4 P_{1} = 0.4 P_{2} \\implies P_{1} = P_{2}$\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n$P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1}$\n\nNext, we use the normalization condition (5) to find the explicit value of the probabilities. We substitute the expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1}) + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_{1} = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$:\n$P_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nThis fraction can be written as $\\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nThe numerical value is approximately:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nThe final answer is the exact fraction.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
