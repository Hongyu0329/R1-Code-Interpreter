    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration on their caps or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors. For instance, the striking *Lactarius indigo* is a vibrant blue mushroom, but it produces a yellow to cream-colored spore print. Similarly, the beautiful blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* from New Zealand has a reddish-pink spore print.\n\nOther mushrooms, such as the *Stropharia caerulea* (blue roundhead), have a purple-brown spore print. Some mushrooms are also known for their blue-bruising reaction, where the flesh turns blue when handled or damaged, but this is not related to their spore color. An example of this is *Psilocybe cyanescens*, which has a purple-brown to purple-gray spore print.\n\nIn general, mushroom spore prints are typically found in shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple, and black. Green spore prints are also known, most notably from the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*. However, a distinctly blue spore print has not been documented in any known mushroom genus.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
