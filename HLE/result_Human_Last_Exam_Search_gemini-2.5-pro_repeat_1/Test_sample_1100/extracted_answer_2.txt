The new diet, which tastes like a bean salad (a food that is typically salty and savory), is important because it is a manifestation of a powerful salt craving. This craving is a cardinal symptom of secondary adrenal insufficiency, a life-threatening condition caused by Sheehan's syndrome in this patient. Her body is compelling her to consume salt to replace what is being lost, in an effort to correct a dangerous electrolyte imbalance that could otherwise lead to adrenal crisis, a medical emergency characterized by low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and potentially death. Therefore, the diet is a crucial clue to the underlying diagnosis of hypopituitarism and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
