    "The user wants to find the number of isomers formed in a specific chemical reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the reactants and the most likely reaction product.** The reaction involves a ruthenium complex `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` and a ligand `L = 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole`. The most probable reaction is the substitution of the two chloride ions (`Cl-`) by the new ligand `L` to form a new complex cation `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n2.  **Determine the nature of the ligand `L`.** The ligand `L` has two `(2-pyridyl)thiazole` units. While the entire ligand is large and can act as a bridge between two metals, in a reaction with a single `Ru` complex it will most likely act as a chelating ligand. The most stable chelate ring it can form is a 5-membered ring by coordinating through a pyridyl nitrogen and the adjacent thiazole nitrogen. Since the pyridyl and thiazole ends are chemically different, the ligand acts as an **asymmetric bidentate** ligand. Let's denote it as `(B-C)`.\n3.  **Identify the class of the product complex.** The starting `bpy` (bipyridine) ligand is a **symmetric bidentate** ligand, denoted as `(A-A)`. The product complex is therefore `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`, which has the general formula `[M(A-A)2(B-C)]`.\n4.  **Count the stereoisomers for a `[M(A-A)2(B-C)]` complex.** For an octahedral tris(chelate) complex of this type, there are three distinct geometric arrangements (diastereomers).\n5.  **Check for chirality.** All three of these geometric isomers are chiral (they lack an improper axis of rotation), meaning each one exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers (the Δ and Λ forms).\n6.  **Calculate the total number of isomers.** The total number of isomers is the number of geometric isomers multiplied by 2 (for the enantiomeric pairs). The final result will be printed by a simple python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of isomers for the given coordination complex reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the reactants and the expected product.\n    reactant1 = \"cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]\"\n    ligand_L_name = \"2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole\"\n    product_formula = \"[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Reaction Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The reaction is between {reactant1} and the ligand {ligand_L_name}.\")\n    print(\"The most likely reaction is the substitution of the two labile Cl- ligands by the incoming ligand L.\")\n    print(f\"The resulting product is a complex ion with the formula {product_formula}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the ligand coordination.\n    # bpy (bipyridine) is a classic symmetric bidentate ligand (A-A type).\n    # The ligand L (2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole) can act as a bidentate ligand\n    # by coordinating through one pyridyl nitrogen and one adjacent thiazole nitrogen.\n    # This forms a stable 5-membered chelate ring.\n    # Since the two nitrogen donor atoms (one from pyridine, one from thiazole) are different,\n    # the ligand acts as an asymmetric bidentate ligand (B-C type).\n    print(\"Step 2: Ligand Type Identification\")\n    print(\"The ligand bipyridine (bpy) is a symmetric bidentate ligand (donors A-A).\")\n    print(f\"The ligand {ligand_L_name} (L) most likely acts as an asymmetric bidentate ligand (donors B-C).\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Classify the complex and count isomers.\n    # The product [Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+ has the general formula [M(A-A)2(B-C)].\n    # For an octahedral complex of this type, there are three possible geometric isomers (diastereomers).\n    num_geometric_isomers = 3\n    print(\"Step 3: Isomer Counting\")\n    print(f\"The product complex has the general formula [M(A-A)2(B-C)].\")\n    print(f\"This type of complex has {num_geometric_isomers} distinct geometric isomers.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Check for chirality.\n    # Each of these three geometric isomers is chiral.
