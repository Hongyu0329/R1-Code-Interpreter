    "This is a problem in algebraic topology. I will calculate the connectivity of the source and target spaces and then use the definition of connectivity of a map to find the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Spaces**: Let the source space be $S = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space be $T = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Note that the smash product of spheres $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, so we can write $T = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n2.  **Calculate the Connectivity of the Source Space S**:\n    *   The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted $\\text{conn}(X)$, is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n    *   I will first find the connectivity of the loop spaces $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$. The homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n    *   Next, I will use the formula for the connectivity of a smash product: $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) = \\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$.\n    *   Finally, I'll use the fact that the suspension operator $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by one: $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma X) = \\text{conn}(X) + 1$.\n3.  **Calculate the Connectivity of the Target Space T**:\n    *   I will find the connectivity of $T = \\Omega S^{10}$ using the relation $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n4.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Map f**:\n    *   A map $f: S \\to T$ is defined to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_* : \\pi_i(S) \\to \\pi_i(T)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n    *   I will compare the homotopy groups of $S$ and $T$ degree by degree to find the connectivity of $f$.\n\nNow I will execute the plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the source S and target T.\")\n    source_str = \"S = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6)\"\n    target_str = \"T = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6) = Omega S^10\"\n    print(f\"Source: {source_str}\")\n    print(f\"Target: {target_str}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the source space S.\")\n    # For Omega S^n, pi_i(Omega S^n) = pi_{i+1}(S^n).\n    # pi_i(S^n) = 0 for i < n.
