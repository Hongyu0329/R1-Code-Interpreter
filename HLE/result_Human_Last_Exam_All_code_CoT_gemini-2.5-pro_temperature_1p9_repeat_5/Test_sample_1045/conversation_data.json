    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Analyze the 6-31G basis set for each atom type:**\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** A heavy (non-hydrogen) atom in the 6-31G basis set has its orbitals described as follows:\n        *   **Core (1s):** Represented by 1 contracted function (made from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** Split into two parts. An inner part described by 1 s-function and 3 p-functions (total 4), and an outer part also described by 1 s-function and 3 p-functions (total 4).\n        *   Total functions per Carbon = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9**.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It has no core electrons. The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts:\n        *   An inner part represented by 1 contracted function (from 3 primitives).\n        *   An outer part represented by 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total functions per Hydrogen = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2**.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n    *   Total = (7 C atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 H atoms × 2 functions/H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 core function + 4 inner valence functions + 4 outer valence functions = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen: 1 inner valence function + 1 outer valence function = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_funcs_from_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_funcs_from_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_from_carbon + total_funcs_from_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final equation with each number explicitly shown\nprint(\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} functions) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} functions)\")\nprint(f\"This gives the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_carbon_atoms} * {funcs_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen_atoms} * {funcs_per_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
