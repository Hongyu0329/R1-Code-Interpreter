    "Here is a plan to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source:** The current Modern English word \"sister\" is a loanword. We will identify its origin, which is Old Norse.\n2.  **Find the Native Word:** We will find the original, native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\" that was displaced by the Norse term. This word is *sweoster*.\n3.  **Trace Linguistic Evolution:** We will analyze the predictable sound changes that transformed other Old English words into their modern equivalents (e.g., *brōþor* to *brother*).\n4.  **Apply to Native Word:** By applying these same phonetic evolution rules to *sweoster*, we can deduce its likely Modern English form.\n5.  **Construct Python Script:** The script will print out this historical and linguistic explanation, including the specific time frame mentioned (7th to 12th centuries) and the hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the linguistic history of the word \"sister\" and\n    determines what it would have become without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    start_century = 7\n    end_century = 12\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_modern_english = \"sister\"\n    original_old_english = \"sweoster\"\n    hypothetical_modern_english = \"swester\"\n\n    print(\"--- The Linguistic History of 'Sister' ---\")\n    print(f\"1. The modern English word '{current_modern_english}' is derived from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. This word was introduced into the language during the period of Norse (Viking) raids and settlement, primarily between the {start_century}th and {end_century}th centuries.\")\n    print(f\"3. Before this influence, the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{original_old_english}'.\")\n    print(f\"4. If the Norse word had not replaced it, '{original_old_english}' would have undergone natural phonetic changes, much like 'brōþor' evolved into 'brother'.\")\n    print(f\"5. Following these linguistic rules, '{original_old_english}' would most likely have become '{hypothetical_modern_english}' in Modern English.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, without the Norse influence between the {start_century}th and {end_century}th centuries, the Modern English word for 'sister' would likely be '{hypothetical_modern_english}'.\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
