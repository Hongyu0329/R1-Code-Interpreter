Here is the step-by-step reasoning for determining the underlying cause:

1.  **Analyze the Patient's Initial Presentation:**
    *   The patient is a 59-year-old man.
    *   His symptoms before the new prescription were agitation, difficulty sleeping, increased sexual activity, and careless spending.
    *   This combination of symptoms is a classic presentation of a manic episode, which is a component of Bipolar Disorder.
    *   This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's family history of mood disorders.

2.  **Evaluate the Intervention and Subsequent Events:**
    *   The patient was prescribed a medication to treat this manic episode. Lithium is a first-line mood stabilizer used for this purpose.
    *   Sometime *after* starting this new medication, the patient developed a new symptom: decreased interest in sex (sexual dysfunction).

3.  **Assess the Answer Choices:**
    *   **Choices B, C, D, E (Heavy Metal Toxicity):** While the patient's 30-year work history in metal smelting suggests a risk for heavy metal exposure, these options are unlikely to be the primary cause. They do not explain the initial manic episode with *hypersexuality*. The sexual dysfunction only appeared after the mania was treated.
    *   **Choice A (Lithium induced hypothyroidism):** This option provides the most complete explanation for the entire sequence of events.
        *   **Event 1 (Mania):** The patient has a manic episode.
        *   **Event 2 (Treatment):** The patient is likely prescribed Lithium.
        *   **Event 3 (Side Effect):** A well-known side effect of Lithium is causing hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
        *   **Event 4 (Symptom):** Hypothyroidism is a well-known cause of decreased libido and sexual dysfunction.

4.  **Conclusion:** The most logical causal chain is that the treatment for the patient's mood disorder (Lithium) led to a medical condition (hypothyroidism) that directly caused the new symptom of sexual dysfunction. Therefore, 'Lithium induced hypothyroidism' is the root cause connecting the series of events.
