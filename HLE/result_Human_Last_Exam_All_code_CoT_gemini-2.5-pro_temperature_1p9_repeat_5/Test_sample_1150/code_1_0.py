# Lojban term to analyze
lojban_term = "rusybavlamdei"

# Step 1: Deconstruct the term into its likely components (rafsi).
# rusy- -> from 'grusko' (gray)
# bavla- -> from 'bavla' (future)
# -mdei -> This is irregular, but the root is clearly 'dei'.
# 'dei' as a gismu has the following place structure:
# dei(x1, x2, x3): x1 is the number of full days for event x2, by day standard x3.

# Step 2: The provided options don't match this structure directly.
# Consider the 'se' transformation, which swaps the first two arguments.
# Place structure of 'se dei':
# se_dei(x1, x2, x3): x1 is the event for which x2 is the number of full days, by day standard x3.
# The modifiers 'rusy-' (gray) and 'bavla-' (future) would apply to the new x1, the event.

# Step 3: Identify the interpretation of the second (x2) and third (x3) arguments
# for the term 'rusybavlamdei', assuming it functions like 'se dei'.
argument_x2_role = "the number of full days corresponding to event x1"
argument_x3_role = "the 'day standard'"

# Step 4: Compare this with the provided answer choices.
# Option E is: "x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard'"
# This is a direct match with our derived interpretation.

# Let's formulate the final answer based on this reasoning.
option_E_text = "x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard'"
