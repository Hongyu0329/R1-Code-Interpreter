    "The task is to describe the functional dependence of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) on single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) within the Feynman path integral formalism and to provide a Python script that illustrates this relationship.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Concept:** The bare Green's function, often called the non-interacting propagator, describes how a particle moves in the absence of interactions. In the path integral formalism, it arises as the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the action.\n2.  **State the Formula:** The relationship is most transparent in frequency-momentum space. The Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a particle with momentum $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ depends on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ as:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n    Here, $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal that correctly positions the poles of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane to ensure causality. This specific form corresponds to the time-ordered (Feynman) propagator.\n3.  **Develop Python Code:** Create a Python script that defines symbolic values for $\\epsilon_k$ and $\\omega$. The script will then print the formula, substituting the chosen values to demonstrate the structure of the equation. This makes the abstract relationship concrete. The final output will be the formatted equation string.\n\n```python\ndef print_bare_greens_function(epsilon_k, omega):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the functional form of the bare Green's function G_0\n    for a given single-particle energy epsilon_k and frequency omega.\n\n    In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega)\n    is derived from the non-interacting action. It represents the propagator of a\n    free particle and is given by the inverse of the operator in the quadratic\n    part of the action in frequency-momentum space.\n\n    Args:\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        omega (float): The frequency.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0(k, omega) is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy, epsilon_k, as its inverse.\")\n    print(\"The general formula for the time-ordered propagator is:\")\n    print(\"  G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere 'delta' is a positive infinitesimal ensuring correct causal structure.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Illustrate the formula with the provided numerical values\n    print(f\"For a single-particle energy epsilon_k = {epsilon_k} and frequency omega = {omega}, the expression is:\")\n    \n    # Construct and print the final equation string\n    # This shows the structure with the specific numbers.\n    print(f\"\\n  G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*delta)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example values for a single-particle state\n    # These could be any physically relevant numbers, e.g., in units of eV.\n    example_epsilon_k = 2.5\n    example_omega = 3.1\n    \n    print_bare_greens_function(example_epsilon_k, example_omega)\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is an inverse relationship: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.>>>"
