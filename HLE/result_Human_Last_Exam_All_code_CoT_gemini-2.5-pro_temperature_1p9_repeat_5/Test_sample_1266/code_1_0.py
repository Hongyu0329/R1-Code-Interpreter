    # --- Step 1: Analyze the effect of (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal (HNEy) on ALDH ---
    # HNEy is a reactive aldehyde. Cells respond to such toxins by increasing the
    # expression of detoxifying enzymes like Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH).
    aldh_change = "increase"
    print(f"1. Effect on ALDH from HNEy: {aldh_change}")

    # --- Step 2: Compare the effect of HNEy with 4-octyl-itaconate (4-OI) ---
    # Both HNEy and 4-OI activate the Nrf2 pathway, which controls ALDH expression.
    # 4-OI is known as a very potent and specific activator of the Nrf2 pathway.
    # Therefore, the increase in ALDH is expected to be more significant with 4-OI.
    comparison_with_4OI = "more"
    print(f"2. Comparison with 4-OI: The change will be {comparison_with_4OI}")

    # --- Step 3: Identify the key protein involved ---
    # The Nrf2 pathway is primarily regulated by the sensor protein Keap1.
    # Keap1 binds Nrf2 for degradation under normal conditions. Activators like
    # HNEy and 4-OI inhibit Keap1, allowing Nrf2 to activate gene expression.
    # JAK1 is part of a different pathway (JAK-STAT signaling).
    involved_protein = "Keap1"
    print(f"3. Key protein involved: {involved_protein}")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("\nConclusion: The amount of ALDH will increase, the change with 4-OI will be more, and the protein involved is Keap1.")
