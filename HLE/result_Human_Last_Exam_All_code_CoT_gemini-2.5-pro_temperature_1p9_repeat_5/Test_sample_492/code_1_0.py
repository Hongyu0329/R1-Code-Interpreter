# We need to solve for the constant c, which is the time of emergence of the giant component.
# The analysis leads to the condition that at the critical time c, the average degree of the graph must be 1.
# The average degree 'd' as a function of time 't' is d(t) = t^2 / 3.
# So, we need to solve the equation c^2 / 3 = 1 for c.

# Here are the numbers in the final equation:
power = 2
denominator = 3
right_hand_side = 1

# Solving c^2 / 3 = 1
# First, multiply by the denominator: c^2 = 1 * 3
c_squared = right_hand_side * denominator

# Then, take the square root: c = sqrt(3)
c = math.sqrt(c_squared)
