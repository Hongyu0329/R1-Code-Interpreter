    "This problem requires us to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in the given molecule, as this corresponds to the number of peaks in its 1H NMR spectrum. We can solve this by analyzing the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring, which is substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions with identical, large chiral groups. This arrangement gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton signals from the central core and one of the arms.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The central mesitylene core has three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. These are all equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   Signals from core methyls: 1\n\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linking Group:** Each substituent arm is connected to the central ring by a methylene (`-CH2-`) group. This `-CH2-` group is bonded to a chiral center (the camphor-derived substituent). Protons of a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Signals from the linking `-CH2-`: 2\n\n4.  **Count Signals from one Substituent Arm:** We will analyze one `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` group. This is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system. In such a system, most protons are in unique chemical environments unless made equivalent by a local symmetry element, which is absent here.\n    *   **Methyl groups:** There are three methyl groups. They are all structurally non-equivalent (one bridgehead methyl, two diastereotopic geminal methyls). This gives **3 signals**.\n    *   **Pyrazole proton:** There is a single proton on the five-membered heterocyclic ring. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   **Saturated skeleton protons:** The remaining part of the camphor-like skeleton has one proton on a bridgehead (`CH`) and two methylene groups (`-CH2-`).\n        *   The bridgehead `CH` proton is unique: **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons in the first `CH2` group are diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   The two protons in the second `CH2` group are also diastereotopic: **2 signals**.\n        *   Total from the skeleton C-H protons = 1 + 2 + 2 = **5 signals**.\n\n5.  **Sum the Signals:** We add the counts from each part to find the total number of signals.\n    *   Total = (Core) + (Linker) + (Substituent Me's) + (Pyrazole CH) + (Skeleton CHs)\n    *   Total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 12\n\n```python\n# Step-by-step calculation of the number of 1H NMR signals.\n\n# 1.
