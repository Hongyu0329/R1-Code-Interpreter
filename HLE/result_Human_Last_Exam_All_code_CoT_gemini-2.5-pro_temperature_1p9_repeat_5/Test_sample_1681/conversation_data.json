    "An equilibrium in a game is a state where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the only equilibrium is for both players to Defect, resulting in a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1).\n\nWhen the game is played in a quantum setting using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein protocol, players' strategies are expanded from simple choices to quantum operations (unitary matrices), and their initial states can be entangled. By setting the entanglement to its maximum level (entanglement parameter γ = π/2), we create a new game structure.\n\nIn this quantum version, a new strategy, 'Q' (represented by the Pauli Z-gate multiplied by `i`), becomes available. Analyzing the game with the strategies {Cooperate (C), Defect (D), Quantum (Q)}, we find a new Nash Equilibrium: (Q, Q). At this equilibrium point, both players apply the 'Q' strategy.\n\nThe result of the (Q, Q) strategy is that both players are forced into the Cooperative outcome with certainty. This yields the payoff of (5, 5). Crucially, if either player unilaterally decides to switch to a different strategy (like C or D), their own payoff will decrease. For example, deviating from (Q, Q) to (D, Q) results in a payoff of (0, 7), which is worse for the deviating player (payoff drops from 5 to 0). Because no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone, (Q, Q) is a stable equilibrium.\n\nThis (Q, Q) equilibrium point successfully resolves the prisoner's dilemma, as it leads to the Pareto optimal outcome (5, 5), which is much better than the classical equilibrium of (1, 1).\n\nThe following python code calculates the payoff for the (Q, Q) equilibrium in the maximally entangled quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the payoff for the equilibrium point in a\n    quantum Prisoner's Dilemma with a specific payoff matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff matrix values from the problem description\n    # (Cooperate, Cooperate): (R, R) -> (5, 5)\n    # (Cooperate, Defect):   (S, T) -> (0, 7)\n    # (Defect, Cooperate):   (T, S) -> (7, 0)\n    # (Defect, Defect):      (P, P) -> (1, 1)\n    R = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\n    S = 0  # Sucker's payoff\n    T = 7  # Temptation to defect\n    P = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n\n    # --- Quantum Game Setup ---\n    # For an optimal outcome, we use maximum entanglement.\n    gamma = np.pi / 2\n\n    # The initial state for the game is |CC>\n    initial_state_vector = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0])\n\n    # The entangling operator J and its conjugate transpose J_dag\n    I = np.identity(2)\n    sigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n    J = np.cos(gamma / 2) * np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.sin(gamma / 2) * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x)\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n\n    # The available strategies for the players\n    # C (Cooperate), D (Defect), and Q (Quantum)\n    U_Q = np.array([[1j, 0], [0, -1j]])  # The Quantum strategy that forms the new equilibrium\n\n    # The equilibrium point is where both players choose the Quantum strategy 'Q'\n    U_Alice = U_Q\n    U_Bob = U_Q\n\n    # --- Calculation Steps ---\n    # 1.
