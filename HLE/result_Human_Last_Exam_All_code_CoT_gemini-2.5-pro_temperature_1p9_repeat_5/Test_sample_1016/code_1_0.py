    Calculates the number of iterations for the Schwarz method on the 1D wave equation.

    The convergence for the wave equation with absorbing boundary conditions is not
    asymptotic but occurs in a finite number of steps. Each iteration allows information
    to be passed across the overlap region, effectively extending the time for which
    the solution is correct.
