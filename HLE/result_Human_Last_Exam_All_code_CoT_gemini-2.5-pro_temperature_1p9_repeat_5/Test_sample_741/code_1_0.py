print("The problem asks for the largest x value for which the summation converges to 0.")
print("The summation S(x) is given by:")

print("\nStep 1: Identify the mathematical function.")
print("Using the Gamma function (where n! = Î“(n+1)), the sum is equivalent to the series for the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I_v(z):")
print("S(x) = I_{x-1}(2)")

# --- Numerical Solution ---

# Define the function for which we want to find the root.
# We are looking for v such that I_v(2) = 0.
def bessel_function_equation(v):
    return sp.iv(v, 2)

# Based on properties of the Bessel function, the largest root of I_v(2) is negative.
# We provide an initial guess for the root-finding algorithm. A value between -2 and -3 is appropriate.
initial_guess_v = -2.2

# Use a numerical solver (fsolve) to find the root v.
v_root = opt.fsolve(bessel_function_equation, initial_guess_v)[0]

# --- Final Calculation and Output ---

# The relationship is v = x - 1, so we calculate x.
x_value = v_root + 1

# Print the final answer formatted to three decimal places.
