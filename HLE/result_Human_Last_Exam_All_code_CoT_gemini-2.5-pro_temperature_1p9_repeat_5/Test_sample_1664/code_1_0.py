    The phrase 'strange tarnished logic of their discipline' refers to the process and outcome of preserving the moths as specimens.

    1.  'Discipline': This points to the scientific discipline of collecting insects. It's a structured, logical practice.
    2.  'Logic': The reasoning behind this discipline is to preserve the moths for study and display.
    3.  'Tarnished': This is the key word. The process is flawed. Like silver that tarnishes, the preserved moth is not perfect; it degrades over time into "eyes and dust." The logic itself is imperfect because the act of preserving the creature's form destroys its life and leads to decay.
    4.  'Strange': The entire endeavor is unnaturalâ€”capturing a living thing and pinning it behind glass is an odd way to appreciate it.

    Therefore, the phrase poetically describes how the scientific process of specimen preservation, while logical in its goal, is strange and ultimately leads to degradation and decay. This directly matches choice B.
