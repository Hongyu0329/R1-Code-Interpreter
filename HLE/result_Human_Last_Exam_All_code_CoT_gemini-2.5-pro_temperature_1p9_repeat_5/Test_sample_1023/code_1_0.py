    Calculates the multiplicative factor by which the morphospecies extinction rate
    is greater than the evolutionary species extinction rate based on the problem's assumptions.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Interpret the assumption "all the processes that affect them occur at the same rates"
        to mean that the fundamental "atomic" processes (True Extinction, Anagenesis,
        Budding Speciation, and Bifurcating Speciation) all occur at the same base rate, k.
    2.  Set this base rate k = 1 for simplicity (it will cancel out).
    3.  Define the extinction rate for an evolutionary species (mu_e), which is only affected by true extinction.
    4.  Define the extinction rate for a morphospecies (mu_m), which is affected by true extinction,
        anagenesis, and bifurcating speciation.
    5.  Calculate the ratio of mu_m to mu_e.
