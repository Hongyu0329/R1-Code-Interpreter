    # Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before 1991.
    # A map of countries is a planar graph. The Four-Color Theorem states that any
    # such graph can be colored with at most 4 colors. A complex continental map like Asia
    # requires the full 4 colors.

    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
    # The new map with additional countries and borders is also a planar graph.
    # The Four-Color Theorem still applies, so the chromatic number is at most 4.
    # Adding complexity does not reduce the chromatic number, so it remained 4.
