    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the equation:\n1.  First, I will convert each Roman numeral in the equation to a modern number.\n    *   `VIII` is 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n    *   `CCC` is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\n    *   `CCXCVII` is 100 + 100 + (100 - 10) + 5 + 1 + 1 = 200 + 90 + 7 = 297.\n2.  The equation in modern numbers is `8 / 300 - 297`.\n3.  Then, I will write a Python script to calculate the result of this equation.\n4.  The script will print the full equation with the numbers and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# First, we define the modern numbers corresponding to the Roman numerals.\nnum1 = 8  # This is VIII\nnum2 = 300 # This is CCC\nnum3 = 297 # This is CCXCVII\n\n# Next, we perform the calculation as per the equation.\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Finally, we print the equation in modern numbers along with the solution.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-296.9733333333333>>>"
