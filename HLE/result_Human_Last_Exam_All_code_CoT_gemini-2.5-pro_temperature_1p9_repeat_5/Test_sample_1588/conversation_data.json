    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from Lie algebra theory. The BCH formula expresses `log(exp(X)exp(Y))` as a sum of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms of a specific order `n` form a basis for the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y).\n\nThe number of such basis elements, which corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients, is given by Witt's formula. For `k` generators and order `n`, the formula is:\n\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nHere, the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nOur task is to compute this for `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n\nMy plan is to execute the following steps within a Python script:\n1.  Set `n=10` and `k=2`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`. The divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (since 2 is prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (since 5 is prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n4.  Substitute these values into Witt's formula.\n5.  Calculate the sum and the final result.\n6.  Print the entire calculation step-by-step, showing how each number in the formula contributes to the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(1) = 1\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = 0\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            prime_factors += 1\n            temp_n //= d\n            if temp_n % d == 0:  # Check for squared factor\n                return 0\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1: # Remaining factor is prime\n        prime_factors += 1\n        \n    return -1 if prime_factors % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for n=10, k=2\n    using Witt's formula and prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Store parts of the equation for printing\n    formula_terms = []\n    evaluated_terms = []\n    numeric_values = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        exponent = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** exponent)\n        total_sum += term_value\n\n        # Build strings for each step of the equation\n        mu_str = f\"({mu_d})\" if mu_d < 0 else str(mu_d)\n        formula_terms.append(f\"{mu_str} * {k}^{exponent}\")\n        evaluated_terms.append(f\"{mu_str} * {k**exponent}\")\n        numeric_values.append(term_value)\n    \n    final_result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Assemble the calculation string (e.g., \"1024 - 32 - 4 + 2\")\n    sum_str = \"\"\n    for val in numeric_values:\n        if val >= 0 and sum_str:\n            sum_str += f\" + {val}\"\n        else:\n            sum_str += f\" {val}\"\n    sum_str = sum_str.strip()\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n}, L_{n}({k}), is calculated using Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(formula_terms) + \" )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(evaluated_terms) + \" )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( {sum_str} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {final_result}\")\n\ncalculate_bch_coeffs()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
