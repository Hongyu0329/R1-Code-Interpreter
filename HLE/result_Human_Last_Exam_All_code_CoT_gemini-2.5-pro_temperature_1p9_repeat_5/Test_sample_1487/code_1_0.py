# The problem asks for the value of the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# From the derivation, we found that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
#
# Substituting this into the expression gives:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# which simplifies to:
# (pi^2/6 - 1) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# = 1 + 10^15

# Let's calculate the final value.
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15

# The result is the sum of the two terms.
result = term1 + term2

# As requested, we print the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The simplified expression is {term1} + {term2}")
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
