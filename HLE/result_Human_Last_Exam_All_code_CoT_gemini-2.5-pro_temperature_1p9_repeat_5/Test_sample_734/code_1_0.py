        "1.  The Virgin Birth: As a miracle, it was not a violation of nature itself, but an act of God operating outside of the usual, known course of biological nature.\n"
        "2.  The Fall: He could describe the state of the world post-Fall (with death, toil, and decay for humanity) as a divinely ordained alteration of the 'customary' operations of nature that existed in the Garden of Eden."
