    "This is a historical/theological question rather than a coding task, but I will provide the answer inside a Python code block as requested.\n\nMy plan is to identify the theologian who best fits the description. The key elements are:\n1.  A Christian theologian.\n2.  The *first* to develop specialized terminology.\n3.  The terminology must be able to describe changes in the \"laws of nature.\"\n4.  It must be applicable to two specific events: the virgin birth of Jesus (a miracle that supersedes normal biology) and the Fall of Man (which introduced systemic changes like death and decay into the world).\n\nThe theologian who most foundationally addresses this is Augustine of Hippo. He argued that what we call \"laws of nature\" are simply the ordinary and regular way God has chosen to order the world. Miracles are not \"against nature\" in an absolute sense, because nature's ultimate reality is defined by God's will. Instead, a miracle is contrary to nature *as we know it* (in Latin, *contra notam nobis naturam*). This specialized terminology allows him to explain a unique event like the virgin birth. It also provides a framework for understanding the Fall, where God could alter the regular course of nature for humanity as a consequence of sin, changing the \"laws\" from incorruptibility to corruptibility and death.\n\nI will now provide this answer formatted within a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef provide_theological_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the theologian who developed terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The Christian theologian who first developed a sophisticated and influential framework with specialized terminology \"\n        \"to describe changes in the laws of nature is Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\\n\\n\"\n        \"Augustine argued that what we perceive as 'natural law' is merely the customary and consistent way God governs the universe. \"\n        \"He distinguished between an act that is 'against nature' (contra naturam) in an absolute sense, which he considered impossible \"\n        \"as God is the author of nature, and an act that is 'against nature as it is known to us' (contra notam nobis naturam).\\n\\n\"\n        \"This terminology allowed him to explain:\\n\"\n        \"1.  The Virgin Birth: As a miracle, it was not a violation of nature itself, but an act of God operating outside of the usual, known course of biological nature.\\n\"\n        \"2.  The Fall: He could describe the state of the world post-Fall (with death, toil, and decay for humanity) as a divinely ordained alteration of the 'customary' operations of nature that existed in the Garden of Eden.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\nThe theologian is: \" + theologian_name)\n\nprovide_theological_answer()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
