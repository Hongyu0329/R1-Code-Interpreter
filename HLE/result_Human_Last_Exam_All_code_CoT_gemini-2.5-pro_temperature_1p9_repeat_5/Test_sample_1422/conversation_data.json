    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory (specifically, a $\\phi^4$ theory, which is the simplest case), we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key relationships for a Feynman diagram:\n    *   The formula for the number of loops (L): `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal propagators and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   The vertex rule: For a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has exactly 4 lines connected to it. These lines can be either internal or external. If `E` is the number of external lines, the total number of line-ends is given by `4 * V`, which must equal `2 * I + E` (since each internal line connects two vertices and each external line connects to one).\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** We will algebraically manipulate these two equations to find an expression for the number of vertices, `V`, in terms of the number of loops, `L`, and external lines, `E`.\n\n3.  **Minimize the number of vertices:** We are given that `L=2`. The derived formula will show that `V` depends on `E`. To find the minimum `V`, we must find the minimum possible value for `E`. The smallest number of external lines a diagram can have is zero (`E=0`), which corresponds to a \"vacuum diagram\".\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** By substituting `L=2` and the minimum `E=0` into our formula, we can calculate the minimum number of vertices.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and prints the derivation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory (phi^4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We start with two fundamental formulas for a phi^4 theory:\n    # 1.
