def solve_violin_puzzle():
    """
    This function determines the mapping between violin playing variations and parameter groups,
    and identifies the direction of change for a specific parameter.

    The mapping is as follows:
    1. sul ponticello -> group ii (changes harmonic content)
    2. bridge mute -> group iii (changes primary body resonance)
    3. helium-filled room -> group iv (changes air-cavity/secondary resonances)
    4. E string -> group i (changes fundamental string frequency)

    For the bridge mute, adding mass to the bridge lowers the main resonant frequency (f1),
    so the direction of change is "down".
