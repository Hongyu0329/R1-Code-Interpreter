    "This is a fascinating linguistic challenge. To solve this, I will identify two languages that are geographically and culturally distant within Asia (or with clear Asian origins) to satisfy the \"no direct contact\" clause. The key is finding a coincidental phonetic similarity for \"broom,\" as the words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across unrelated languages (known as nursery words).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Select Candidate Languages:** I will choose Persian (Farsi), an Indo-European language from West Asia, and Malagasy, an Austronesian language spoken in Madagascar. The Malagasy people's ancestors migrated from Southeast Asia (Borneo), so their cultural roots are Asian, and they have had no direct historical contact with Persian culture.\n2.  **Compare the Words:** I will compare the colloquial or common words for \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad\" in both languages.\n    *   **Broom:** This is the most challenging word. I've found a remarkable coincidental similarity between Persian `jâru` and Malagasy `tsarò`.\n    *   **Mom/Dad:** I'll use the common nursery words, which are `mâmân`/`bâbâ` in Persian and `mama`/`dada` in Malagasy.\n3.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will print out this explanation and the word comparisons clearly, fulfilling the user's request to show the comparison for each word. The final answer will be enclosed in `<<<...>>>`.\n\n```python\ndef find_similar_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints information about two languages from two\n    cultures in Asia with no direct contact, where the words for \"broom\", \"mom\",\n    and \"dad\" are nearly identical or highly similar.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The two languages selected are Persian (Farsi) and Malagasy.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"1.
