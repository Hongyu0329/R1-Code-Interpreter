        "1. IL-15 Promotes Memory T Cell Phenotypes:\n"
        "   Interleukin-15 is a key cytokine for the survival and proliferation of memory T cells. "
        "   Unlike other cytokines such as IL-2, which can push T cells towards a terminally differentiated "
        "   effector state, IL-15 preferentially supports the development of less-differentiated, "
        "   long-lived memory phenotypes (e.g., central memory and stem cell memory T cells)."
    )

    principle_2 = (
        "2. Memory Phenotypes Lead to Better Persistence:\n"
        "   CAR T cells with a memory-like phenotype, as fostered by IL-15, exhibit "
        "   superior persistence and proliferative capacity after they are infused into a patient. "
        "   This means they can survive longer and expand more robustly when they encounter tumor cells."
    )

    principle_3 = (
        "3. Persistence Drives Sustained Function:\n"
        "   A larger, more persistent population of CAR T cells can mount a more durable anti-tumor attack. "
        "   Cytokine release is a primary function of these cells. While a terminally differentiated cell might release "
        "   a strong initial burst of cytokines, its limited lifespan curtails its long-term impact. The memory-like "
        "   cells grown with IL-15 can continuously proliferate and release cytokines over a longer period."

        "interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit **enhanced and more sustained cytokine release** "
        "(e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) upon repeated antigen stimulation. This is a direct consequence "
        "of the superior in vivo persistence and expansion of the IL-15-conditioned memory-like cells."
