# The problem asks for the smallest value 'z' such that for every positive
# semidefinite matrix A with unit diagonal, there exists a 'nice' matrix B
# and a positive semidefinite matrix C such that A = zB - C.
# This smallest value 'z' is a famous mathematical constant known as the
# (real) Grothendieck constant, K_G.

# The exact value of K_G is unknown. However, we can calculate related quantities
# to understand its properties and value.

# For matrices of size n=2, the constant K_G(2) is known to be exactly pi/2.
# Since the property must hold for all n, z must be at least K_G(n) for all n.
# Thus, z >= K_G = sup_n(K_G(n)). This means z cannot be pi/2, as K_G > pi/2.
k_g_2 = np.pi / 2

# The best known lower bound for K_G was found by Jean-Louis Krivine.
# The upper bounds are very close to this lower bound.
krivine_lower_bound = np.pi / (2 * np.log(1 + np.sqrt(2)))
