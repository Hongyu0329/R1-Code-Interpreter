    # --- Step 1: Analyze the clinical scenario and evaluate each option ---

    # Option I: Counsel patient on stopping cannabis.
    # Evaluation: HIGH PRIORITY. Heavy cannabis use can worsen anxiety and insomnia,
    # confounding the clinical picture and rendering other treatments ineffective.
    # This must be addressed immediately.
    option_I_priority = "High"

    # Option II: Ask patient to request admission to the hospital for detox.
    # Evaluation: LOW PRIORITY. This is an overly aggressive and premature step.
    # Medication management can be addressed outpatient unless there's an acute safety crisis.
    option_II_priority = "Low"

    # Option III: Order a urine drug test.
    # Evaluation: HIGH PRIORITY. Essential for objective data collection, confirming
    # substance use, and for safety assessment before considering any new prescriptions,
    # especially the requested stimulants.
    option_III_priority = "High"

    # Option IV: Prescribe melatonin for insomnia.
    # Evaluation: REASONABLE THIRD PRIORITY. Insomnia is a chief complaint. While
    # likely caused by cannabis, providing a safe, low-risk, non-addictive treatment
    # like melatonin offers immediate symptomatic help and builds therapeutic rapport.
    option_IV_priority = "Medium (Third Highest)"

    # Option V: Discontinue acamprosate and increase dosage of naltrexone for AUD.
    # Evaluation: INADVISABLE. The patient's AUD is in remission. There is no
    # clinical rationale to change a working treatment regimen.
    option_V_priority = "Inadvisable"

    # Option VI: Start atomoxetine.
    # Evaluation: INVALID. The case states the patient is already on atomoxetine 80 mg qD.
    option_VI_priority = "Invalid"

    # --- Step 2: Synthesize the findings ---
    print("Clinical Reasoning:")
    print("1. The patient's heavy cannabis use is a primary driver of his symptoms (anxiety, insomnia) and must be addressed. Therefore, Option I is a priority.")
    print("2. A urine drug screen is essential for objective data and safety before making any medication changes, especially when considering a request for stimulants. Therefore, Option III is a priority.")
    print("3. Options II, V, and VI are inappropriate or invalid. Option IV (melatonin) is a safe, low-risk intervention that directly addresses the patient's chief complaint of insomnia while the underlying causes are managed. This makes it the best third option.")

    # --- Step 3: Identify the prioritized options and the final answer ---
    final_priorities = ["I", "III", "IV"]
    final_answer_choice = "L"
