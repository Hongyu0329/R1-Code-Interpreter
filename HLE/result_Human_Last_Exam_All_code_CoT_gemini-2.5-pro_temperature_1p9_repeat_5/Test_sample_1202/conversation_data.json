    "My plan is to analyze the provided multiple-choice question about the fates of duplicated genes. I will write a Python script that evaluates each answer choice based on established principles of evolutionary genetics. The script will explain why some mechanisms are incorrect and then compare the two most plausible options: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization. Based on the reasoning that a passive mechanism for retaining both gene copies is more probable than one requiring a rare beneficial mutation, the script will identify the most likely mechanism.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    and selects the most likely option from the provided choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Analyzing the answer choices:\\n\")\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect. Gene conversion is a process that tends to homogenize duplicated sequences, making them more similar. This works against divergence.\",\n        'B': \"Incorrect. Pseudogenization is the process where one gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a fate of gene duplication, but it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention*.\",\n        'C': \"Plausible. Neofunctionalization is a key model where one gene copy retains the original function, while the other acquires mutations that give it a completely new function. This leads to both retention and divergence.\",\n        'D': \"Plausible. Subfunctionalization is a key model where the ancestral gene had multiple functions, and after duplication, each copy specializes by taking on a subset of these original functions. This necessitates the retention of both copies and allows them to diverge as they optimize for their specific sub-role.\",\n        'E': \"Incorrect.
