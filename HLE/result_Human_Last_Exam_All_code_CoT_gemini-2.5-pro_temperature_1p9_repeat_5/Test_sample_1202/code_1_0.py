        'B': "Incorrect. Pseudogenization is the process where one gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a fate of gene duplication, but it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention*.",
        'C': "Plausible. Neofunctionalization is a key model where one gene copy retains the original function, while the other acquires mutations that give it a completely new function. This leads to both retention and divergence.",
        'D': "Plausible. Subfunctionalization is a key model where the ancestral gene had multiple functions, and after duplication, each copy specializes by taking on a subset of these original functions. This necessitates the retention of both copies and allows them to diverge as they optimize for their specific sub-role.",
        'E': "Incorrect. Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention within a genome."

    print("Subfunctionalization provides a powerful explanation for how both gene copies can be preserved through passive, neutral processes (i.e., each copy loses a different sub-function). This is often considered a more probable starting point than Neofunctionalization, which requires the relatively rare event of a new, beneficial function arising before one copy is lost to pseudogenization.")
