    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need a chemical formula for a standard nanocar. A commonly used simplified, hypothetical model for a nanocar has 44 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen atoms in the original molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nTherefore, the process is a simple 1-to-1 replacement:\n1.  Start with the number of hydrogen atoms in the hypothetical nanocar (44).\n2.  Replace each hydrogen atom (H) with a fluorine atom (F).\n3.  The total number of fluorine atoms will be the same as the original number of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this simple calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a common, hypothetical nanocar model.\n    num_hydrogen_atoms = 44\n    print(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in the base nanocar is assumed to be: {num_hydrogen_atoms}\")\n\n    # Step 2: In a \"perfluoro\" compound, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    # This means the number of fluorine atoms equals the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the final result clearly showing the numbers.\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar is: {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms()\n```\n<<<44>>>"
