    "The user is asking for the common name of a specific mathematical transformation used in nuclear criticality studies. This transformation is the double Fourier transform, applied to both space and time, of the generalized pair correlation function. This transformed function is a fundamental quantity in the field of nuclear reactor noise analysis.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that does the following:\n1.  States the common name for the requested function.\n2.  Presents the general mathematical definition of the function as a Fourier transform.\n3.  Shows a more specific formula for the function based on a simplified physical model (one-group diffusion theory), as this is often how it's represented in practical applications.\n4.  Substitutes some example numerical values into this formula to satisfy the prompt's requirement of outputting the numbers in the final equation.\n\nThis approach will directly answer the user's question while adhering to all the specified formatting constraints, including the use of a Python code block and the printing of a final equation with numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef present_npsd_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and defines the Neutron Power Spectral Density (NPSD).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Present the general mathematical definition.\n    print(\"The general definition relates the NPSD, S(k, ω), to the pair correlation function, G(r, t), via a double Fourier transform:\")\n    print(\"S(k, ω) = Integral[ G(r, t) * exp(-i*(k·r - ω*t)) ] d³r dt\")\n    print(\"where 'k' is the wave vector (the spatial frequency) and 'ω' is the angular frequency.\\n\")\n\n    # 3. Present a specific formula from a simplified model.\n    print(\"In practical applications, a specific physical model is used to derive a concrete form for the NPSD.\")\n    print(\"For a simple one-group diffusion model without delayed neutrons, the NPSD has a Lorentzian shape in frequency:\")\n    print(\"S(k, ω) = A / [ (α + D*k²)² + ω² ]\\n\")\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\" - A is a constant related to the fission rate and detector properties.\")\n    print(\" - α (alpha) is the prompt neutron decay constant (Rossi-alpha).\")\n    print(\" - D is the neutron diffusion coefficient.\")\n    print(\" - k is the magnitude of the wave vector and ω is the angular frequency.\\n\")\n    \n    # 4.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
