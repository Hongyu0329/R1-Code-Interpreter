    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor:\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script that implements an efficient prime factorization algorithm. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will handle division by 2 separately to simplify the main loop.\n3.  Then, I will iterate through odd numbers (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining number `n`.\n4.  For each `d`, I will check if it divides `n`. If it does, I'll add `d` to a list of factors and divide `n` by `d` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible. This ensures we factor out all occurrences of `d`.\n5.  After the loop, if there's a remaining value of `n` greater than 1, this remaining value is also a prime factor (this happens when the largest prime factor is greater than the initial square root of the number).\n6.  Finally, the script will print the factorization in an equation format and identify the largest number from the list of prime factors, which is our answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\ndef find_prime_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime factor of a given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle division by 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle division by odd numbers\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the number\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        # If d divides n, find all occurrences of this factor\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n //= d\n        d += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 1, the remaining n is a prime factor\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the full factorization equation\n    if not factors: # This happens if original_n was 1 or 0\n        print(f\"The number {original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n        return\n\n    equation = f\"{original_n} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # The largest prime factor will be the maximum value in the list\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}.\")\n    \n    # This return is for capturing the final answer, though it is printed above\n    return largest_prime\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_prime_factors()\n```\n<<<3433>>>"
