    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau Link, we will follow a step-by-step plan based on interpreting the geometric setup and the nature of the invariant.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the defining parameters**: The Calabi-Yau object is a hypersurface in a weighted projective space. Its topological invariants typically depend on the weights of the space and the degree of the defining polynomial.\n    *   Weights: `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`\n    *   The Calabi-Yau condition implies that the degree `d` of the defining polynomial is the sum of the weights: `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n\n2.  **Address the polynomial**: The provided polynomial is `$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$`. We must check if it is quasi-homogeneous of degree 225. A quick check reveals that while most monomial terms have a weighted degree of 225, the term `$z_1^4z_2^3z_3$` has a degree of `$4*22 + 3*29 + 49 = 224$`. This indicates a likely typo in the problem statement. However, for a generic polynomial, topological invariants like the one requested do not depend on the specific coefficients but only on the weights and the degree. We will therefore proceed assuming a generic quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree 225.\n\n3.  **Interpret the \"Crawley-Nordström invariant\"**: While the formal definition from the research literature is exceedingly complex, the term \"Calabi-Yau Link\" suggests we are dealing with the link of the singularity at the origin of the affine cone over the projective hypersurface. A key topological invariant of such a link is its **Milnor number**, denoted by `μ`. This number measures the topological complexity of the singularity. Given the context, it's highly plausible that this is the requested invariant.\n\n4.  **State the formula**: For an isolated weighted homogeneous singularity defined by a polynomial of degree `d` with weights `w_1, ..., w_5`, the Milnor number `μ` is given by the formula:\n    `μ = (d/w_1 - 1) * (d/w_2 - 1) * (d/w_3 - 1) * (d/w_4 - 1) * (d/w_5 - 1)`\n\n5.  **Implement the calculation**: We will write a Python script to compute this value using the given weights and degree. The script will calculate each term in the product and then find the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant, interpreted as the Milnor number,\n    for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    degree = sum(weights)\n    \n    # Check if the sum of weights is indeed 225\n    # print(f\"Weights: {weights}\")\n    # print(f\"Degree d = sum of weights = {degree}\")\n\n    factors = []\n    numerators = []\n    denominators = []\n    \n    for w in weights:\n        # Calculate each term (d/w - 1) which is (d-w)/w\n        num = degree - w\n        den = w\n        factors.append(num / den)\n        numerators.append(num)\n        denominators.append(den)\n    \n    # Calculate the product of the factors for the final result\n    result = 1\n    for f in factors:\n        result *= f\n    \n    # The result should be an integer, so we round it to avoid float inaccuracies\n    final_result = round(result)\n\n    # Building the equation string\n    # (d/w_1-1) * (d/w_2-1) * ...\n    # which is (d-w_1)/w_1 * (d-w_2)/w_2 * ...\n    equation_parts = []\n    for i in range(len(weights)):\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({numerators[i]}/{denominators[i]})\")\n        \n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The invariant is calculated by the formula μ = ∏(d/w_i - 1):\")\n    print(f\"μ = {equation_str}\")\n\n    term_values = [f\"{n/d:.4f}\" for n,d in zip(numerators, denominators)]\n    term_values_str = \" * \".join(term_values)\n\n    print(f\"μ = {term_values_str}\")\n    print(f\"μ = {final_result}\")\n\ncalculate_invariant()\n```\n<<<1568>>>"
