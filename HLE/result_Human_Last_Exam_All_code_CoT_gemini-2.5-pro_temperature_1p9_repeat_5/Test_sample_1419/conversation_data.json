    "The problem asks for the leading order expression of the fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions ($d=4-\\epsilon$). This is a central result in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory, found using the Renormalization Group (RG).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Beta Function**: The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, $\\beta(u)$, which describes how the coupling constant $u$ changes with the energy scale. The fixed points are the values of the coupling, $u^*$, where the theory becomes scale-invariant, meaning $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n2.  **$\\phi^4$ Theory Beta Function**: For the Lagrangian density term $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\frac{u}{4!} \\phi^4$, the one-loop beta function in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is well-known:\n    $\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n    The first term, $-\\epsilon u$, comes from the engineering (classical) scaling of the coupling constant. The second term, $\\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$, arises from quantum corrections at the one-loop level.\n3.  **Solving for the Fixed Point**: We will set the beta function to zero to find the fixed point(s):\n    $-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will use Python with the `sympy` library to symbolically solve this equation for $u^*$. The code will print out the equation with all the numerical components, find the two solutions (the trivial Gaussian fixed point and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point), and display the final expression for the non-trivial fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the leading order expression for the fixed point\n    coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for the coupling and epsilon\n    u = sympy.Symbol('u^*')\n    epsilon = sympy.Symbol('epsilon')\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    print(\"The fixed point coupling u^* in phi^4 theory is determined by the condition that the beta function is zero: beta(u^*) = 0.\")\n    print(f\"In d = 4 - epsilon dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling u in L_int = (u/4!)*phi^4 is:\")\n    print(f\"beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi^2)) * u^2\\n\")\n\n    # Define the coefficients from the beta function equation beta(u*) = 0\n    # Equation: -epsilon*u + (c_num / (c_den * pi**2)) * u**2 = 0\n    c_num = 3\n    c_den = 16\n    \n    # Define the equation using sympy\n    equation = -epsilon * u + (c_num / (c_den * pi**2)) * u**2\n    \n    print(\"Setting beta(u^*) = 0 gives the equation:\")\n    print(f\"   - {epsilon} * {u} + ({c_num} / ({c_den} * pi^2)) * {u}^2 = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nWe can factor out u^*:\")\n    print(f\"   {u} * (-{epsilon} + ({c_num} / ({c_den} * pi^2)) * {u}) = 0\")\n\n    # Solve the equation for u\n    solutions = sympy.solve(equation, u)\n\n    # The solutions will be a list containing 0 and the non-trivial solution.\n    trivial_solution = solutions[0]\n    non_trivial_solution = solutions[1]\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis equation has two fixed point solutions:\")\n    print(f\"1.
