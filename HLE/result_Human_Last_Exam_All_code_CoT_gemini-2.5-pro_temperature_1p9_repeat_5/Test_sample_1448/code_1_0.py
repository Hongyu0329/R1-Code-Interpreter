print("The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is a fundamental equation in quantum many-body theory that describes the interaction of a pair of particles.")
print("It can be expressed as an integral equation that determines the full two-particle scattering properties from a fundamental interaction term.")
print("\nThe core components of this relationship are:")
print("1. The Interaction Kernel: This is the input to the equation. It is formally defined as the sum of all two-particle-irreducible diagrams, representing the elementary interaction processes between the pair.")
print("2. The Scattering Amplitude: This is the output of the equation. It describes the complete result of the two-particle interaction, summing up all possible interaction pathways. The poles of the scattering amplitude correspond to the energies of bound states of the two particles.")
print("\nThus, the BSE provides a direct correspondence, allowing one to compute the 'Scattering amplitude' from the 'Interaction kernel'.")
