# Step 1: Codify knowledge about ballet school techniques.
# We will represent the typical pirouette preparation from fourth position for each school.
# The question specifies "arms in an anlongé position with bent knees."
# This can be interpreted in a few ways:
#  - 'rounded': The classic preparation with rounded arms (not anlongé).
#  - 'dynamic_sweep': A sweeping motion through an anlongé position to gather momentum.
#  - 'static_hold': A more held, lunge-like position with anlongé arms.
# Both 'dynamic_sweep' and 'static_hold' match the anlongé criterion.
school_styles = {
    'Paris Opera Ballet School': 'rounded',
    'The Royal Ballet School': 'dynamic_sweep',
    'School of American Ballet': 'static_hold',
    'La Scala': 'rounded',
    'Vaganova Academy': 'dynamic_sweep'
}

# Step 2: Define the answer choices as pairs of schools.
answer_choices = {
    'A': ('Paris Opera Ballet School', 'The Royal Ballet School'),
    'B': ('Paris Opera Ballet School', 'School of American Ballet'),
    'C': ('La Scala', 'The Vaganova Academy'),
    'D': ('The Royal Ballet School', 'The Vaganova Academy'),
    'E': ('The Royal Ballet School', 'School of American Ballet')
}
