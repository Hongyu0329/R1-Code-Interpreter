# Step 1: Analyze the ligand
# The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
# The 'Di' prefix indicates two identical coordinating arms.
# Each arm is a '(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol' unit, which is a bidentate N,N-donor.
# It donates one Nitrogen from the pyridine ring and one Nitrogen from the pyrazole ring.
num_arms = 2
n_donors_per_arm = 2
total_n_donors = num_arms * n_donors_per_arm
print(f"The ligand provides a total of {total_n_donors} Nitrogen (N) donor atoms.")

# Step 2: Analyze the metal salt
# The metal salt is ZnBr2.
# This provides a central Zn(II) ion and two Bromide (Br-) ions.
# The bromide ions are also potential coordinating ligands.
num_br_donors = 2
print(f"The salt provides {num_br_donors} Bromide (Br) donor atoms.")

# Step 3: Determine the coordination in the final product
# A 1:1 reaction combines the tetradentate (4-donor) ligand and the ZnBr2.
# The most stable product will involve the N4 ligand and the two Br- ions coordinating to the Zn(II) center.
# This forms a 6-coordinate complex.
# The solvent (methanol) is a weak ligand and is unlikely to be part of the final isolated complex.
print("The final complex will have the four Nitrogen atoms and the two Bromide atoms coordinated to the Zinc center.")

# Step 4: List the coordinated atoms
print("The list of atoms coordinated to the Zn center is: Br, Br, N, N, N, N")

# Step 5: Match with the provided options
# Option B is Br, Br, N, N, N, N
print("This corresponds to answer choice B.")
