    explanation = """
The function `def_superfast` describes a non-computable number. This means no program or algorithm can be written that will reliably compute the correct output. There are two primary reasons for this:

1. The Halting Problem
   To calculate `Huge_int`, a program would have to inspect every Python program with source code shorter than 10000 characters. For each candidate program, it must determine if it finishes its execution (halts) and returns an integer. However, it is a proven fact in computer science that a general program capable of determining whether any arbitrary program will halt or run forever cannot exist. This is known as the Halting Problem. Since `def_superfast` requires solving the Halting Problem, it is non-computable.

2. A Logical Self-Referential Paradox
   Even if the Halting Problem were solvable, the function's definition creates a direct logical contradiction, similar to the Berry Paradox ("the smallest positive integer not definable in fewer than twelve words").

   - Assume a program `P` exists that correctly computes `R = def_superfast(10000)`.
   - The definition states that `R = Huge_int + 1`.
   - Now, consider the program `P` itself. `P` is a program that returns an integer. Let's assume we can write the source code of `P` to be shorter than 10000 symbols.
   - If `len(source_code(P)) < 10000`, then `P` is one of the very programs being analyzed to find `Huge_int`.
   - Therefore, the number `P` returns (`R`) must be less than or equal to the maximum possible return value, `Huge_int`. This means `R <= Huge_int`.
   - This leads to a contradiction: The result `R` cannot simultaneously be equal to `Huge_int + 1` and be less than or equal to `Huge_int`.

Conclusion: The assumption that program `P` can exist must be false.

---
The final equation described in the pseudo-code is:

def_superfast(10000) = Huge_int + 1

As `Huge_int` is non-computable, we cannot represent it as a number. However, following the instruction to output each number in the final equation, the only computable number present is '1'.
