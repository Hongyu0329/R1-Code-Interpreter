    "My plan is to first pinpoint the exact verses (abyat) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', where the names of the 25 mentioned prophets are listed. By consulting a standard version of the poem, I will determine the starting and ending line numbers of this specific section. Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these two numbers in variables and prints a clear, descriptive sentence indicating the range.\n\n```python\n# The Creed of the Laymen ('Aqeedat al-'Awaam) is a 57-bayt (line) poem.\n# This script identifies the specific range of abyat (lines) that list the names\n# of the 25 prophets one is required to know.\n\n# According to the standard numbering of the poem, the introduction to the list\n# of prophets is in bayt 24. The names themselves begin on the next line.\nstart_bayt = 25\n\n# The list of names is completed over the course of four abyat (lines).\n# Bayt 25: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim\n# Bayt 26: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub\n# Bayt 27: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman\n# Bayt 28: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, Taha (Muhammad)\nend_bayt = 28\n\n# The final print statement will clearly state the range as requested.\nprint(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\n```\n<<<25 to 28>>>"
