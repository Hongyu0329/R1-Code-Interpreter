# The task is to re-rank two documents for two questions and select the best choice.

# Analysis for Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Document 1 states the change happened "at a few months old".
# Document 2 states the change happened "As they reached puberty".
# The phrase "a few months old" is a better description of a "baby" than "puberty".
# Therefore, Document 1 is more relevant for Question 1.
q1_rank = 1

# Analysis for Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both Document 1 and Document 2 contain the identical key sentence: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# Since the information is identical, they are equally relevant for Question 2.
# As Document 1 is superior for Q1 and equally relevant for Q2, it is the better overall document.
# Thus, we select Document 1 for Question 2 as well.
q2_rank = 1

# The combined ranking is "1-1".
# This corresponds to answer choice A.
final_answer = 'A'

# The instruction "you still need to output each number in the final equation!" seems to be
# a leftover from a different problem template. There is no equation here.
# For clarity in the output, I will print the determined ranks and the final choice.
# The ranking for Question 1 is 1.
# The ranking for Question 2 is 1.
# The final choice is A, which represents the ranking "1-1".
