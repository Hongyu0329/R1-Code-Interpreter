    Calculates the critical exponent nu for a G4-theoretical framework.

    This calculation is based on the following assumptions:
    1. "G4" refers to the O(4) universality class, so the number of order
       parameter components, N, is 4.
    2. The spatial dimension, d, is 3.
    3. The method used is the first-order Wilson-Fisher epsilon expansion,
       where epsilon = 4 - d = 1.

    The formula for the exponent nu is:
    nu = 1/2 + (N + 2) / (4 * (N + 8)^2) * epsilon
