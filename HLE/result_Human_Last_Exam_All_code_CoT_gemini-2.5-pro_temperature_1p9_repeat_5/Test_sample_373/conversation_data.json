    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph:** I will first characterize the barbell graph with 10 nodes. This means it consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which we call the bottleneck or bridge.\n2.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The probability of sampling an edge depends on the degrees of the nodes it connects. I will calculate the degree for the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Each of these nodes is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique and to 1 node via the bridge.\n3.  **Understand the Sampling Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    a. Pick a node `i` uniformly at random from all `N` nodes (Probability = `1/N`).\n    b. Pick a neighbor `j` of `i` uniformly at random (Probability = `1/degree(i)`).\n    The probability of sampling a specific directed edge `(i, j)` is `(1/N) * (1/degree(i))`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The undirected bottleneck edge `{u, v}` can be sampled in two ways: by picking node `u` first and then `v`, or by picking `v` first and then `u`. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n5.  **Code and Final Answer:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations, print out the final equation and the resulting probability.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress creation of __pycache__\nsys.dont_write_bytecode = True\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights using randomized\n    uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Calculate Node Degrees\n    # The degree of a node at the end of the bottleneck edge ('u' or 'v') is\n    # the sum of its connections within its clique (m-1) and the bridge connection (1).\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (m - 1) + 1\n\n    # 3. & 4. Calculate the Probability\n    # The probability of sampling an undirected edge {u, v} is the sum of probabilities\n    # of sampling the directed edge (u, v) and the directed edge (v, u).\n    # P({u,v}) = P(picking u) * P(picking v | u) + P(picking v) * P(picking u | v)\n    # P({u,v}) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(v))\n\n    prob_u_then_v = (1/N) * (1/degree_bottleneck_node)\n    prob_v_then_u = (1/N) * (1/degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n    total_prob = prob_u_then_v + prob_v_then_u\n\n    # 5.
