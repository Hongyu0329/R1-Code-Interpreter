    print("What is the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum?")
    print("\nLet's break down the definitions:")
    print("1. Continuum: A compact, connected metric space (e.g., a line segment, a disk).")
    print("2. Decomposable: A continuum that is the union of two of its proper subcontinua.")
    print("3. Proper Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum that isn't the whole space.")
    print("4. Regular Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum S that equals the closure of its interior, i.e., S = closure(interior(S)).\n")

    # --- Step 1: Proving the Lower Bound is 2 ---
    print("### Step 1: The cardinality must be at least 2 ###")
    print("We can prove that the number cannot be 0 or 1. The argument relies on two facts from continuum theory:")
    print("  a) Any nondegenerate decomposable continuum has at least two 'non-cut points' (points whose removal doesn't disconnect the space). Let's call two such points p and q.")
    print("  b) Decomposable continua are 'aposyndetic'. This means for any two points like p and q, you can find a subcontinuum that contains p in its interior but doesn't contain q.")
    print("\nBased on these facts:")
    print("- We can find a subcontinuum K_p such that p is in its interior, but q is not.")
    print("- From this, we construct a regular proper subcontinuum R_p = closure(interior(K_p)). R_p contains p but not q.")
    print("- Symmetrically, we can find a regular proper subcontinuum R_q that contains q but not p.")
    print("- Since R_p contains p and R_q does not, they must be different sets (R_p != R_q).")
    print("This proves that there must be at least TWO distinct regular proper subcontinua.\n")

    # --- Step 2: Proving the Upper Bound is 2 ---
    print("### Step 2: A cardinality of 2 is possible ###")
    print("To show the minimum is exactly 2, we need an example of a continuum that achieves this number.")
    print("Consider a space X created by taking two *indecomposable* continua, K1 and K2, and joining them at a single point, p. (An indecomposable continuum is one where every proper subcontinuum has an empty interior).")
    print("\nLet's analyze the regular proper subcontinua of this space X = K1 U K2:")
    print("- K1 is a proper subcontinuum of X. Its interior in X is K1 \\ {p}, and the closure of this is K1. So, K1 itself is a regular proper subcontinuum.")
    print("- Likewise, K2 is a regular proper subcontinuum.")
    print("- It can be shown that any other proper subcontinuum of X will have an empty interior. This is because it would be built from proper subcontinua of K1 and/or K2, which have empty interiors in their respective spaces.")
    print("- A subcontinuum with an empty interior cannot be regular.")
    print("Therefore, this constructed space has exactly TWO regular proper subcontinua: K1 and K2.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("The number of regular proper subcontinua must be at least 2, and we have constructed an example where it is exactly 2.")
