    print(f"- [A, E] {options['A']} and {options['E']}: These are types of cracking. While cracks can be weld-repaired, the term 'build-up of layers' is most descriptive for restoring a worn surface or edge, not just filling a narrow crack.")
    print(f"- [B, C] {options['B']} and {options['C']}: Both of these involve a loss of material. FOD causes nicks and gouges, while tip rub causes the blade tip to be worn down. Both are excellent candidates for a build-up welding repair.\n")

    print("Step 3: Determine the 'main' source of damage for this repair.")
    print("Blade tip rub is a predictable and routine wear mechanism resulting from tight operating clearances essential for engine efficiency.")
    print("Repairing worn tips by welding material back on is a very common, standard MRO procedure, perfectly matching the 'build-up' description.")
