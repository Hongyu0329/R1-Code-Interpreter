    This function identifies the necessary assumption and prints it in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The core idea for proving that the expected information gain for a Bayesian agent
    approaches zero is that the total cumulative information gain is bounded by the
    entropy of the agent's prior belief distribution. For the proof to hold, this
    bound must be finite.

    Therefore, the necessary assumption is:
    a. The prior has finite entropy.

    The answer is formatted into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
    The single clause is (a).
    The conjunction of clauses is enclosed in square brackets.

    # The correct choice is 'a'.
    # In CNF, a single positive literal 'x' is written as a clause '(x)'.
    # The final expression is a conjunction of all clauses, surrounded by square brackets.
    # Since we only have one clause, the result is [(a)].
