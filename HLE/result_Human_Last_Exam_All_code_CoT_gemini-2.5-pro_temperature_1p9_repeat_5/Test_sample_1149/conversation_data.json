    "To answer the question about the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*, I will rely on information from its scientific description, specifically the detailed 2002 paper on its cranial osteology by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott. The number of depressions is a recorded anatomical fact, not a result of a calculation.\n\nThe Python code below will store this number and present it. It will also display a simple equation to meet the output format requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_anatomical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess\n    of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the scientific paper \"Cranial osteology of the theropod dinosaur\n    # Irritator challengeri (Dinosauria: Spinosauridae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\"\n    # by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess houses two large foramina (depressions).\n    num_depressions = 2\n\n    # To satisfy the request for an equation, we can represent this number as a simple sum.\n    num1 = 1\n    num2 = 1\n    \n    print(f\"Based on the primary scientific literature, the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is {num_depressions}.\")\n    print(\"A simple equation to represent this is:\")\n    print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {num_depressions}\")\n\nsolve_anatomical_question()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
