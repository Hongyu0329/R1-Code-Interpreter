    "My plan is to first research the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies). Then, I will evaluate each of the multiple-choice options against this information. The correct answer will be the one that accurately reflects the known food sources. Finally, I will present this reasoning and the final conclusion within a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Research the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\n# Based on entomological knowledge, adult Raphidiopterans are primarily predatory.\n# They feed on a variety of small, soft-bodied arthropods, with aphids being a common prey.\n# In addition to being predatory, many adult snakefly species also supplement their diet by feeding on nectar and pollen.\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the given answer choices.\n# A. Nectar: This is a known food source for adult Raphidiopterans.\n# B. Māhoe pollen: While they do eat pollen, the specific plant is less important than the food type. Pollen is a known food source.\n# C. Fungus: This is not a recorded food source for adult snakeflies.\n# D. Karamū leaf tissue: Raphidiopterans are not herbivores and do not eat leaf tissue.\n# E. Totara Aphids: Aphids are a primary predatory food source for adult Raphidiopterans.\n\n# Step 3: Conclude the most accurate answer.\n# Both 'Nectar' (A) and 'Aphids' (E) are well-documented food sources for adult snakeflies.\n# Therefore, the option that combines both A and E is the most complete and correct answer.\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Raphidopteran Diet:\")\nprint(\"Choice A (Nectar) is a known food source.\")\nprint(\"Choice E (Totara Aphids) represents a known food source (aphids).\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the best answer choice is the one that includes both A and E.\")\nprint(\"Final Answer Choice: F\")\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
