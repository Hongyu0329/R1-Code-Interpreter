def select_neuromorphic_model():
    """
    Analyzes mathematical models and selects the optimal one for neuromorphic computing.

    This function identifies the best model by evaluating each against key principles of
    neuromorphic engineering:
    1. Continuous-Time Dynamics (Differential equations are preferred).
    2. Adaptive Thresholds (Reflecting biological fatigue and homeostasis).
    3. Comprehensive Plasticity (Including memory, pruning, and stochasticity).

    Model A is chosen as it is the only option that satisfies all criteria, featuring
    continuous-time updates, a sophisticated adaptive threshold, and the most
    comprehensive set of terms, including long-term memory traces and input relevance.

    The function then prints the equation for Model A with example numerical values
    for each component to provide a concrete illustration.

The optimal choice is Model A. It uniquely combines continuous-time dynamics, a biologically-plausible adaptive threshold, and comprehensive long-term memory terms.

Here is the equation for Model A with example numerical values for each coefficient:
