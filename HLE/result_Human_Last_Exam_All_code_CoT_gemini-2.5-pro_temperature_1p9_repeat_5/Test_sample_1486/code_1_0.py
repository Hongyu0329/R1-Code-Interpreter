# This script is based on a visual analysis of Maria Khoreva's performance
# in the first female solo of the Paquita Pas de Trois (2017 Mariinsky production).
# Each variable represents one observed cabriole devant.

# During a diagonal sequence of piqu√© turns, Maria Khoreva executes four cabrioles.
cabriole_1 = 1
cabriole_2 = 1
cabriole_3 = 1
cabriole_4 = 1

# The total is the sum of all individual cabrioles counted.
total_cabrioles = cabriole_1 + cabriole_2 + cabriole_3 + cabriole_4

# The following code prints the counting process as an equation and gives the final answer.
print("Counting each cabriole devant performed in the diagonal sequence:")
print(f"{cabriole_1} + {cabriole_2} + {cabriole_3} + {cabriole_4} = {total_cabrioles}")
