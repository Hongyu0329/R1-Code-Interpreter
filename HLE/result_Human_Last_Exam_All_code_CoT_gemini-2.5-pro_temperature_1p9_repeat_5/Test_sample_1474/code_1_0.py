    # Analysis for Option A
    print("\n[A] Aboriginal masks:")
    print("  - William Friedkin: 'The Exorcist' features an ancient Pazuzu statue from a dig in Iraq, which is Sumerian, not Aboriginal.")
    print("  - Fritz Lang: This is not a notable element in his major films like 'Metropolis' or 'M'.")
    print("  - Verdict: Unlikely to be the common link.")

    # Analysis for Option B
    print("\n[B] Magic wands:")
    print("  - This element does not fit the typical genre or style of either director (German Expressionism, crime noir, gritty realism, horror).")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Analysis for Option C
    print("\n[C] The first ever cyborgs on screen:")
    print("  - Fritz Lang: His film 'Metropolis' (1927) features the Maschinenmensch, one of cinema's first and most famous robots/androids.")
    print("  - William Friedkin: Cyborgs are not an element in his filmography.")
    print("  - Verdict: Does not appear in both directors' work.")

    # Analysis for Option D
    print("\n[D] Bugs:")
    print("  - William Friedkin: A key sequence in 'The Exorcist' (1973) involves a swarm of locusts in Iraq. He also directed 'Bug' (2006), a psychological horror film about a delusional infestation.")
    print("  - Fritz Lang: His early adventure serial was titled 'Die Spinnen' (1919), which translates to 'The Spiders'.")
    print("  - Verdict: Bugs and bug-like creatures (arachnids) serve as significant thematic elements of mystery, conspiracy, or evil in the works of both directors. This is a strong connection.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, 'Bugs' is the most accurate common element found in the oeuvres of both directors.")
