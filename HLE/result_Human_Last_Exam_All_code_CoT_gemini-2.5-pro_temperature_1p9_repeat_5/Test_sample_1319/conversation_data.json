    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Identify Mountains:** First, we'll compile a list of prominent mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the request. The key ones are Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Athos, Mount Pelion, and the mountain on Samothrace (Fengari).\n2.  **Find Elevations:** We'll look up the modern-day elevations (in meters) for each of these mountains.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** We'll compare these elevations to identify the tallest one.\n4.  **Code Execution:** The Python code will store these mountains and their heights in a dictionary, find the maximum height, and print the result along with the other contenders for comparison.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain_in_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary of historical mountains from the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus (2918m) is excluded as per the prompt.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Find the mountain with the maximum elevation.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(\"Comparing the heights of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\")\n    # This loop fulfills the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    # by showing all the data points being compared.\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest mountain among these is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_in_iliad()\n<<<Mount Athos>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
