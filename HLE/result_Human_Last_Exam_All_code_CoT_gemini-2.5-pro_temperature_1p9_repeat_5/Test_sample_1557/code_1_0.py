    This function evaluates the provided historical statements about the Duke of Wellington
    and identifies the correct ones based on established historical facts.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    1. Correct. Wellington's experience managing logistics in India with a mobile commissariat was
       instrumental in his design of the highly effective supply system in the Peninsular War.
       This continuity of principle is a well-established fact among historians.
    2. Incorrect. The claim that his intelligence methods were "never successfully implemented in
       European theaters" is false. He developed a formidable intelligence network in Spain and
       Portugal using local guerrillas and his own scouting officers.
    3. Incorrect. The British Army was not systematically reorganized in 1815 based on his Indian
       campaign model. The post-war army structure was a continuation of the Peninsular system,
       and its severe flaws were exposed later in the Crimean War.
    4. Incorrect. The statement contains factual errors. The Royal Military College at Sandhurst
       was founded well before 1829, and its curriculum was not significantly altered at that time
       to explicitly incorporate colonial warfare lessons in the way described.
    5. Incorrect. This claim is the opposite of the truth. The principles of managing logistics in
       difficult non-European terrain, which Wellington mastered in India, were highly relevant
       and influential in subsequent British colonial campaigns.
    6. Correct. The successful integration of local forces was a hallmark of Wellington's Indian
       campaigns. This strategy became a standard and essential practice for the expansion and
       maintenance of the British Empire, particularly in Africa and Asia.
    7. Incorrect. This is definitively false. Historians agree that Wellington's innovative approach
       to logistics in the Peninsular War was profoundly influenced by the lessons he learned tackling
       even greater challenges in India, not "entirely based on European military theory."
    8. Correct. The tactic of using fast-moving, self-sufficient "flying columns," honed against
       the Marathas in India, was adapted for the Peninsular War and was a key element in later
       colonial conflicts like the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826).
    9. Incorrect. The East India Company's Charter Act of 1813 was primarily driven by economic and
       political debates in Britain concerning free trade and the Company's monopoly. It was not a
       direct application of Wellington's military organizational principles.
    10. Incorrect. Wellington's methods of wartime civil administration—focused on establishing order,
        ensuring supply, and winning civilian cooperation—were first developed in Mysore and had a
        direct and significant bearing on his successful governance of liberated areas in the Peninsula.
