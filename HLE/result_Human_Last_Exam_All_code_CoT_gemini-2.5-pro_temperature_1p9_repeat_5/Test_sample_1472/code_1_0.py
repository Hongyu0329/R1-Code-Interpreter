    print("- Mirror Planes (σ): Absent.")
    print("  - A horizontal plane (σh) through the four S atoms is ruled out because the rest of the ligand (the -CH2-CH2- bridges and CH3 groups) is not planar and puckers out of this plane.")
    print("  - Vertical planes (σv) are also absent due to this puckering. The molecule cannot be divided into two perfect mirror-image halves.")
    print("- Proper Rotation Axis (Cn): Present.")
    print("  - There is a C2 rotation axis that passes through the copper atom and lies in the square plane, bisecting the angle between the two ligands.")
    print("  - Rotating the molecule 180 degrees around this axis swaps the positions of the two identical ligands, leaving the molecule unchanged.")
    print("  - No other rotation axes (like a C4 perpendicular to the plane) exist.")
