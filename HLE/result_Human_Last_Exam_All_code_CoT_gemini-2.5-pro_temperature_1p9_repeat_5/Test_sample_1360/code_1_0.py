# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the dominant factor determining the minimum time resolution needed to measure individual electron events.
# 2. "Individually measuring" events means we need to distinguish one decay event from the next. The main issue to avoid is "pile-up," where two separate, random events occur too close in time for the detector system to resolve them.
# 3. The rate at which these random decay events occur is given by the source activity.
# 4. We can calculate the average time interval between consecutive decays using this activity. This time interval represents the characteristic time of the process. The system's time resolution must be significantly smaller than this average interval.
# 5. Let's perform this calculation and show that the timescale set by the activity is the most relevant one compared to other factors like the electron's time-of-flight.

# Given activity of the Bi 207 source
activity_kBq = 1
# Convert activity to decays per second (Hz)
# 1 kBq = 1000 Bq = 1000 decays/second
activity_Hz = activity_kBq * 1000

# The average time interval (Δt) between two consecutive, random decays is the reciprocal of the decay rate (activity).
# This formula is derived from the properties of the Poisson process, which governs radioactive decay.
avg_time_interval_s = 1 / activity_Hz

# Convert the result to milliseconds for better intuition
avg_time_interval_ms = avg_time_interval_s * 1000

print(f"Given source activity: {activity_kBq} kBq")
print(f"This is equal to {activity_Hz} decays per second.")
print("\nThe average time interval (Δt) between individual decay events is calculated as:")
print(f"Δt = 1 / Activity")
print(f"Δt = 1 / {activity_Hz} s⁻¹")
print(f"Δt = {avg_time_interval_s} seconds")
print(f"Δt = {avg_time_interval_ms} milliseconds\n")
print("Conclusion:")
print("To individually measure electrons from separate decays, the detector system's time resolution must be significantly shorter than this average time of 1 ms.")
print("The other factors, like time-of-flight (~nanoseconds), are orders of magnitude smaller and relate to the timing of a single event, not the rate of all events.")
print("Therefore, the dominant factor that sets the rate of events, and thus the requirement for time resolution to avoid pile-up, is the source activity.")
