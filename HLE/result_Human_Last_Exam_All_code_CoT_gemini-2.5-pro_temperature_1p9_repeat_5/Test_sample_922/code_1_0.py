    Solves the puzzle by identifying the sequence and the missing term.
    
    The sequence is A003010 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).
    It is described as "Coefficients of the R_n(x) polynomials related to Apery's constant".
    
    The key information from OEIS is that only a finite number of integer terms
    are known for this sequence. As of August 2022, these terms are:
    1, 13, 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296.
    
    The question provides a subsequence of these known terms, omitting the first two.
    "Completing the sequence" refers to finding the missing non-trivial term.
