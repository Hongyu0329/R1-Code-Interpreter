    "I cannot watch a video to count dance moves, as my capabilities are limited to analyzing text and code. Determining the exact number of \"pas de Balanchines\" would require a visual analysis of the performance.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that acts as a manual counter. You can run this script while watching the performance video. I will include information to help you identify the step and a link to the likely video.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Step:** I will first describe the \"pas de Balanchine\" so you can recognize it. It's a specific ballet step involving a pas de bourrée followed by an arabesque plié.\n2.  **Provide Resources:** I'll include a link to the specific performance on YouTube for your reference.\n3.  **Create a Counter Script:** I will write a simple, interactive Python script. You can press the `Enter` key each time you see Svetlana Gileva perform the step, and the script will keep a running tally. When you're done, you can type 'q' to get the final count.\n\nHere is the script for you to execute:\n\n```python\nimport webbrowser\n\ndef manual_counter():\n    \"\"\"\n    A tool to help you manually count specific events in a video.\n    \"\"\"\n    video_url = \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F553ma0hoxc\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Pas de Balanchine Counter for Svetlana Gileva's Solo ---\")\n    print(\"\\nThis script will help you count the number of 'pas de Balanchines'.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Get Ready\")\n    print(\"A 'pas de Balanchine' is a specific ballet step. It looks like a 'pas de bourrée piqué' followed by an arabesque that lowers into a 'plié'.\")\n    print(\"It has a distinct 'step-step-step-lunge' rhythm.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Watch the Video\")\n    print(f\"The solo scene can be found here: {video_url}\")\n    print(\"Your web browser will now open to the video.\")\n    \n    try:\n        webbrowser.open(video_url)\n    except Exception:\n        print(\"Could not open web browser automatically. Please copy the link above.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Count the Steps\")\n    print(\"Position the video window next to this terminal.\")\n    print(\"Press the [Enter] key each time Svetlana Gileva performs a pas de Balanchine.\")\n    print(\"Type 'q' and then press [Enter] when you are finished or want to quit.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    count = 0\n    while True:\n        user_input = input(f\"Current count: {count}. Press Enter to count the next one, or type 'q' to finish: \")\n        if user_input.lower() == 'q':\n            break\n        count += 1\n        print(f\"Step number {count} counted.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n==============================================\")\n    print(\"             FINAL RESULT\")\n    print(\"==============================================\")\n    # The \"equation\" is a simple summation of 1s.\n    # For a final count of N, the equation is 1 + 1 + ... (N times).\n    if count > 0:\n        equation_str = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * count)\n        print(f\"Equation: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Equation: 0\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nSvetlana Gileva performed a total of {count} pas de Balanchines.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    manual_counter()\n\n```\n<<<The number of pas de Balanchines cannot be determined programmatically, but the provided script will help you count them manually.>>>"
