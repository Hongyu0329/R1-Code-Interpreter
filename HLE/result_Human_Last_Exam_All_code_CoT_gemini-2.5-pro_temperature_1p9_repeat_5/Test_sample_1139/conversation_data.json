    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Model and Symmetry:** The problem is about the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D, with `N=2` replicas.\n2.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For class D with N replicas, the target space of the sigma-model is the symmetric superspace `M = OSp(4N|4N) / (OSp(2N|2N) x OSp(2N|2N))`.\n3.  **Isolate the Bosonic Sector:** We are interested in the non-Grassman (bosonic) variables. The manifold for these variables is the bosonic part of `M`, which is given by `M_b = G_b / H_b`, where `G_b` and `H_b` are the maximal bosonic subgroups of the respective supergroups. This gives:\n    `M_b = (SO(4N) x Sp(4N)) / ((SO(2N) x Sp(2N)) x (SO(2N) x Sp(2N)))`\n    This manifold separates into two distinct symmetric spaces:\n    `M_b = (SO(4N) / (SO(2N) x SO(2N))) x (Sp(4N) / (Sp(2N) x Sp(2N)))`\n4.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The total number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of this bosonic manifold, `dim(M_b)`. This is the sum of the dimensions of the two factor spaces.\n    *   The dimension of the special orthogonal group `SO(n)` is `n(n-1)/2`.\n    *   The dimension of the compact symplectic group `Sp(2n)` (also denoted `USp(2n)`) is `n(2n+1)`.\n5.  **Compute the Final Number:** We will substitute `N=2` into the formulas, calculate the dimensions of the individual groups, then the dimensions of the two sectors, and finally sum them up to get the total number of variables.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_d_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    of class D with a specified number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    N_replicas = 2\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables required to parametrize\")\n    print(\"the sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with 2 replicas.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Problem parameters: Symmetry Class = D, Number of Replicas (N) = {N_replicas}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Theory ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the structure of the bosonic manifold.\")\n    print(\"For class D, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is the manifold:\")\n    print(\"  M_b = (SO(4N) / (SO(2N) x SO(2N))) x (Sp(4N) / (Sp(2N) x Sp(2N)))\")\n    print(\"The total number of variables is the dimension of this manifold.\")\n    print(\"dim(M_b) = dim(SO(4N)/(SO(2N)xSO(2N))) + dim(Sp(4N)/(Sp(2N)xSp(2N)))\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Helper functions for dimensions ---\n    def dim_so(n):\n        return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    def dim_sp(m):\n        # The group is Sp(m) = USp(m).
