    """
    This function provides the answer to the user's historical music trivia question.
    
    The steps to find the answer are:
    1.  The opera revived at La Scala in 1843 with Marietta Alboni was Rossini's 'Semiramide'.
    2.  The clue about Caruso is a likely inaccuracy, as he never performed this opera. The timeframe "more than 70 years" after the last major production points to a modern revival.
    3.  The Metropolitan Opera last staged 'Semiramide' in 1895 before reviving it in 1990.
    4.  This 1990 production in New York City is the one referenced.
    5.  The principal bass role in this production was sung by a specific artist.
