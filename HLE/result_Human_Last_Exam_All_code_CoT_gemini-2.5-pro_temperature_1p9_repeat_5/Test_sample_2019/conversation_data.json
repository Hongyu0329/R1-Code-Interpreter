    "My plan to solve this problem is to use a computational brute-force approach. Since the board size (5x5) and the number of queens (4) are small, we can systematically check every possible placement of the queens and count how many arrangements are valid.\n\nHere are the steps of the plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Board:** The 5x5 board consists of 25 distinct cells, which can be represented by coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4).\n\n2.  **Generate All Possible Placements:** I will first generate all possible ways to choose 4 distinct cells out of the 25 available cells. The total number of such combinations can be calculated using the binomial coefficient C(25, 4).\n\n3.  **Define Attack Rules for a Toroidal Board:** For any two queens placed at coordinates `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, they attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack:** On a toroidal board, diagonals wrap around the edges. This can be elegantly checked using modular arithmetic. An attack occurs if `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5` or `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`.\n\n4.  **Filter and Count Valid Placements:** I will iterate through every combination of 4 queen placements. For each combination, I'll check all pairs of queens to see if they attack each other based on the rules above. If no two queens in a placement attack each other, I will count it as a valid solution.\n\n5.  **Output the Final Answer:** The final count of all valid, non-attacking placements is the solution to the problem. The python code will print the numbers used in the calculation to provide a clear path to the answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport math\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5\n    toroidal chessboard by checking all possible combinations.\n    \"\"\"\n    BOARD_SIZE = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    def is_valid_placement(queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given placement of queens is valid on a toroidal board.\n        'queens' is a tuple of (row, col) coordinates.\n        The function checks all unique pairs of queens for attacks.\n        \"\"\"\n        for q1, q2 in itertools.combinations(queens, 2):\n            r1, c1 = q1\n            r2, c2 = q2\n\n            # Check for row or column attacks\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                return False\n\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks using modular arithmetic\n            if (r1 - c1) % BOARD_SIZE == (r2 - c2) % BOARD_SIZE:\n                return False\n            if (r1 + c1) % BOARD_SIZE == (r2 + c2) % BOARD_SIZE:\n                return False\n        \n        # If no attacks are found between any pair, the placement is valid\n        return True\n\n    # Define the problem's parameters\n    num_cells = BOARD_SIZE * BOARD_SIZE\n    \n    # Generate all cells as (row, col) tuples\n    all_cells = [(r, c) for r in range(BOARD_SIZE) for c in range(BOARD_SIZE)]\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of ways to choose NUM_QUEENS cells from all_cells\n    total_combinations = math.comb(num_cells, NUM_QUEENS)\n    \n    # Generate the iterator for all possible placements\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(all_cells, NUM_QUEENS)\n\n    # Count how many of the possible placements are valid\n    valid_solution_count = 0\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        if is_valid_placement(placement):\n            valid_solution_count += 1\n            \n    # Print the \"equation\" of the problem as requested\n    print(f\"Board size: {BOARD_SIZE}x{BOARD_SIZE}\")\n    print(f\"Number of queens to place: {NUM_QUEENS}\")\n    print(f\"Total combinations of placing {NUM_QUEENS} queens on {num_cells} cells is C({num_cells}, {NUM_QUEENS}) = {total_combinations}.\")\n    print(f\"After checking each combination for attacks, the number of valid, non-attacking placements is: {valid_solution_count}\")\n\n# Execute the solver function\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<100>>>"
