    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** We'll show that any graph with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors.\n2.  **Establish that the bound is tight:** We'll demonstrate the existence of a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. This proves that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value.\n3.  **Calculate the result:** We will apply this conclusion to the given number of vertices, $n=12345$.\n\n**Step 1: The Upper Bound**\nA complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. To color $K_n$, every vertex must receive a different color, so its chromatic number is $n$.\n\nThe problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring. We can devise a coloring scheme as follows:\n-   Assign color 1 to both vertex $u$ and vertex $v$.\n-   Assign a new, distinct color to each of the remaining $n-2$ vertices.\nThis results in a valid proper coloring using $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. Therefore, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of any non-complete graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is at most $n-1$.\n\n**Step 2: The Lower Bound (Achievability)**\nTo show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible chromatic number, we must show that there exists at least one non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that requires $n-1$ colors.\nConsider the graph formed by taking the complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge. Let's call this graph $G'$. This graph $G'$ is not complete by definition.\nThe graph $K_n$ has cliques of size $n$. Let the removed edge be between vertices $u$ and $v$. The graph $G'$ still contains a clique of size $n-1$ (for instance, the set of all vertices except $v$). A graph that contains a clique of size $k$ requires at least $k$ colors for a proper coloring. Since $G'$ contains a clique of size $n-1$, we have $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Calculation**\nFrom Step 1, we know $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$ for any non-complete graph $G$. From Step 2, we know there exists a non-complete graph $G'$ for which $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$.\nCombining these, the maximum possible chromatic number for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices is exactly $n-1$.\n\nFor this problem, $n = 12345$. The maximum number of colors needed is $n - 1$.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph\nn = 12345\n\n# According to graph theory, the maximum number of colors needed to properly\n# color a graph G with n vertices is n if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\n# If the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most n-1.\n# This upper bound is achieved by a graph constructed by removing a single edge\n# from the complete graph K_n. Such a graph contains a clique of size n-1,\n# and therefore requires at least n-1 colors.\n# Thus, the maximum number of colors is exactly n-1.\n\n# Calculate the maximum number of colors\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\n# Print the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"Since the graph is not complete, the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\")\nprint(f\"The final calculation is: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
