# The task is to identify the order in the coupling constant 'u' at which the
# critical exponent nu receives its first non-vanishing contribution beyond
# its mean-field value in the perturbative epsilon-expansion of phi^4 theory.

# Step 1: Recall the structure of the perturbative expansion.
# The exponent nu(u) is expressed as a power series around u=0.
# nu(u) = c_0 * u^0 + c_1 * u^1 + c_2 * u^2 + ...

# Step 2: Identify the leading term, c_0.
# This corresponds to the mean-field value of nu, which is 1/2.
# This is the value at the Gaussian fixed point (u=0).
c_0_numerator = 1
c_0_denominator = 2

# Step 3: Identify the first correction term.
# Renormalization Group (RG) calculations show that the one-loop contribution
# to nu is non-zero. This corresponds to the c_1 term in the series.
# The form of this term is c_1 * u^1.
# So, the order of the first correction is 1.
order_of_first_correction = 1

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The functional form up to the first correction is: nu = 1/2 + c_1 * u^1 + ...
print("In the perturbative expansion of the critical exponent nu in the coupling constant u:")
print("nu(u) = c_0 * u^0 + c_1 * u^1 + c_2 * u^2 + ...\n")

print(f"The constant term (mean-field value) is c_0 = {c_0_numerator}/{c_0_denominator}.")
print(f"The numbers in this constant term are: {c_0_numerator}, {c_0_denominator}\n")

print("The first non-vanishing contribution comes from the next term in the series, c_1 * u^1.")
print(f"The power of 'u' in this term defines the order of the contribution.")
print(f"The number representing this power is: {order_of_first_correction}\n")

print("The equation for nu(u) up to the first correction is:")
print(f"nu(u) = {c_0_numerator}/{c_0_denominator} + c_1 * u^{order_of_first_correction} + ...")

# The final answer is the order of this first correction.
final_answer = order_of_first_correction
print(f"\nConclusion: The specific order in 'u' at which nu acquires its initial non-vanishing contribution is {final_answer}.")
