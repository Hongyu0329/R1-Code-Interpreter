    "Here is a plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I need to deconstruct the musical terminology in your question.\n1.  **Tonic Chord**: This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first degree of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major. In A minor, the tonic is A minor.\n2.  **Minor Fifth Chord**: This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. This is a common and natural chord progression in minor keys. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic (i) is A minor. The fifth degree is E, and the minor fifth chord (v) would be E minor.\n\nMy task is to find a Beatles song that starts with this specific jump. I will search my database of Beatles music for a song in a minor key where the opening chords follow this `i â€“ v` (tonic to minor fifth) pattern.\n\nThe song that fits this description is \"Girl\" from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n*   The song is in the key of **C minor**.\n*   The tonic chord (i) is **C minor**.\n*   The fifth degree of C is G. The minor chord built on G is **G minor** (v).\n*   The opening acoustic guitar riff prominently features the chord change from C minor to G minor, perfectly matching the description.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a music theory clue\n    and prints the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Girl\"\n    album = \"Rubber Soul\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"C minor (the 'i' chord)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"G minor (the 'v' chord)\"\n\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"It appears on the album '{album}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Musical Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Tonic Chord: {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"Minor Fifth Chord: {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n    print(\"The song's distinctive opening guitar part establishes this i-v progression.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Girl>>>"
