    "To identify the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing:** This is a sound change rule in English where a long vowel in the third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable of a word becomes short. For this rule to have applied, a word must (a) have at least three syllables and (b) have originally had a long vowel in that position.\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:** I will examine each word against these criteria. This analysis requires historical and etymological information.\n    *   **southern**: two syllables (*south-ern*). The rule does not apply.\n    *   **derivative**: four syllables (*de-riv-a-tive*). The 'i' comes from a long vowel (compare with *derive*) and is shortened. The rule applied.\n    *   **serenity**: four syllables (*se-ren-i-ty*). The 'e' comes from a long vowel (compare with *serene*) and is shortened. The rule applied.\n    *   **pleasant**: two syllables (*pleas-ant*). The rule does not apply.\n    *   **gratitude**: three syllables (*grat-i-tude*). The 'a' comes from a long vowel (Latin *grātus*) and is shortened. The rule applied.\n    *   **shadow**: two syllables (*shad-ow*). The rule does not apply.\n3.  **Identify the Correct Answer:** Three words (*southern*, *pleasant*, *shadow*) did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing because they are not trisyllabic. However, the vowel in *shadow* was already short in Old English (*sceadu*), meaning it was never even a candidate for this type of shortening. The vowels in *southern* (from *sūþ*) and *pleasant* (from *please*) were long but were shortened by other rules. Therefore, *shadow* is the most definitive answer as it fails to meet the criteria on two counts: syllable count and original vowel length.\n\nI will use a Python script to formally lay out this data and logic to arrive at the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_non_laxed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \n    Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule that shortens a long vowel in the\n    antepenultimate (third-from-end) syllable of a word.\n    \n    For a word to have undergone trisyllabic laxing, it must:\n    1.
