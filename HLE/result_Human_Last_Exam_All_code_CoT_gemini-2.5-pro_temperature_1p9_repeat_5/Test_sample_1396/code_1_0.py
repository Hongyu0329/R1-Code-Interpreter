def solve_cake_cutting_bound():
    """
    Calculates a structural upper bound for the 4-agent envy-free cake-cutting problem.

    The problem asks for an upper bound O for a connected epsilon-envy-free
    allocation for 4 agents. While the algorithmic complexity is known to be
    O(log(1/epsilon)), the request for a specific numerical answer suggests
    a combinatorial interpretation.

    An allocation is envy-free if for every pair of agents (i, j), agent i does
    not value agent j's piece more than their own. For n agents, there are n choices
    for agent i and (n-1) choices for agent j, leading to n * (n-1) potential
    envy relationships that must be prevented. This value represents a structural
    complexity of the problem.
