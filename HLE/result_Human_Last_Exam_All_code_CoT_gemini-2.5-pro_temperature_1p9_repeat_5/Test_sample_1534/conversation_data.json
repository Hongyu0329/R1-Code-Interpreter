    "This is a neuroanatomical question. To answer it, I need to access biological knowledge about the dwarf cuttlefish brain structure. My plan is to first identify the relevant lobes based on my knowledge base and then present this information using a Python script as requested by the prompt format. The Python script will not compute the answer but will simply print the factual information in a clear and readable way.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    The information is based on established cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n    \"\"\"\n    palliovisceral_lobe_location = \"part of the posterior subesophageal mass\"\n    posteriorly_adjacent_regions = [\n        \"First-order giant fiber lobes\",\n        \"Second-order giant fiber lobes\",\n        \"Third-order giant fiber lobes\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the subesophageal mass in the cuttlefish brain.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are:\")\n    for region in posteriorly_adjacent_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the first, second, and third-order giant fiber lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
