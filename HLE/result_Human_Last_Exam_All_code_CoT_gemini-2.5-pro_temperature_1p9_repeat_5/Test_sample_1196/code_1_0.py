    explanation = """
    In a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), the goal is to find genetic variants (like SNPs) associated with a particular trait. The primary challenge in interpreting GWAS results is Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).

    1.  **What is Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)?** LD is the non-random association of alleles at different positions on a chromosome. In simple terms, SNPs that are physically close to each other tend to be inherited together as a block (an "LD block" or "haplotype").

    2.  **How does LD cause misleading associations?** If a specific SNP (let's call it the 'causal SNP') directly influences a trait, any other SNPs that are in high LD with it will also show a strong statistical association with that trait. The GWAS detects this statistical association, but it cannot easily distinguish between the true causal SNP and the many other non-causal SNPs that are just 'hitchhiking' along with it due to LD. The association signal for the non-causal SNP is therefore "misleading."

    3.  **Analyzing the options:**
        *   **A. Three SNPs tightly linked within a single LD block on one chromosome:** This is the quintessential example of the problem. "Tightly linked" implies a very high correlation between these three SNPs. If the true causal variant is within this block, all three of these SNPs will likely show a significant p-value. This makes it extremely difficult to pinpoint the actual causal variant from the GWAS data alone, creating a strong misleading signal for at least two of the SNPs (and possibly all three if the true cause is an unmeasured SNP in the block).
        *   **B. Two SNPs located at the extreme ends of an LD block:** LD tends to decay with distance, so SNPs at the extreme ends of a block might have weaker LD with each other and with a causal variant in the middle of the block. This can still be misleading but is a less potent example than A.
        *   **C. Two SNPs located on different chromosomes:** Alleles on different chromosomes assort independently (they are not in LD). Therefore, this scenario cannot cause a misleading association *due to LD*.
        *   **D. A single SNP located centrally within an LD block but next to a recombination hotspot:** This SNP can still be a proxy for a causal variant within its block. However, the presence of three *tightly linked* SNPs, as in option A, presents a greater challenge for interpretation than a single proxy SNP.
        *   **E. Three Tag SNPs predicting all alleles in an inherited haplotype:** This is also a very strong candidate. Tag SNPs are specifically chosen to be proxies for an entire haplotype region. An association with a tag SNP is almost certainly indirect. However, option A describes the underlying genetic reason (`tightly linked`) for the challenge in the most direct and impactful way. The problem is most severe when multiple tested variants are themselves very highly correlated.

    **Conclusion:**
    Option A describes the scenario that is most likely to provide a misleading association. The presence of multiple, *tightly linked* SNPs creates a single, strong association signal where it is statistically almost impossible to distinguish the effect of one SNP from the others, making any one of them a potentially misleading candidate for the true cause.
