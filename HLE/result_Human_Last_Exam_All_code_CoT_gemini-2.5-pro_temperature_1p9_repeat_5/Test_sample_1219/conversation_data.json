    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we cannot use standard floating-point arithmetic because the number 10^100 (a googol) is far too large and would cause a complete loss of precision.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Leverage Periodicity:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. We can reduce the enormously large number `10^100` to a small number by finding its remainder when divided by π.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic:** To perform the modulo operation `10^100 mod π`, we need a value for π with very high precision. The precision required is related to the number of digits in `10^100`. Since `10^100` has 101 digits, we need π to be accurate to well over 100 decimal places to get a precise remainder.\n3.  **Use Python's `decimal` Module:** Python's `decimal` module is designed for high-precision arithmetic. We will use it to define `10^100` and π, and then perform the calculation.\n4.  **Calculate the Tangent:** Once we have the small remainder, `r = 10^100 mod π`, we can calculate `tan(r)` using the `decimal` module's built-in `tan()` function.\n5.  **Extract Digits:** From the final result, we will extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# 1. Set the precision for decimal calculations.\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits. To get an accurate remainder\n# when dividing by pi, the precision must be greater than 101.\n# We set it to 125 for a safe margin.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 125\n\n# 2. Define a high-precision value of pi as a string.\n# This string contains pi to over 120 decimal places.\npi_str = \"3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132823066470938446\"\npi = decimal.Decimal(pi_str)\n\n# 3. Define the number x = 10^100 as a Decimal object.\nx = decimal.Decimal(10)**100\n\n# 4. Use the periodicity of tan: tan(x) = tan(x mod pi).\n# We calculate the argument r = x mod pi.\nargument = x % pi\n\n# 5. Calculate the tangent of the small remainder 'argument'.\nresult = argument.tan()\n\n# 6. Output the numbers involved in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation is based on the identity: tan(x) = tan(x mod pi)\")\nprint(f\"The argument (10^100 mod pi) is calculated to be: {argument}\")\nprint(f\"The final result for tan(10^100) is therefore tan({argument}), which equals: {result}\")\n\n# 7. Extract and print the first 3 digits after the comma.\n# To get the digits, we can take the absolute value of the result,\n# multiply by 1000, convert to an integer, and take the result modulo 1000.\nfirst_three_digits = int(abs(result) * 1000) % 1000\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<586>>>"
