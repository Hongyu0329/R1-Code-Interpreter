    "Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a photon gas using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are deeply related to large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Foundation in Large Deviation Theory:** The problem asks for a derivation based on Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the principle of maximum entropy. The equilibrium state of a system is the macroscopic configuration that has the largest number of corresponding microscopic states. Any other configuration is exponentially less likely for a large number of particles, which is the essence of a large deviation principle. We will find the equilibrium state by maximizing the system's entropy subject to its physical constraints.\n\n2.  **System and Statistics:** The system is a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like in a cavity) is that the number of photons is not conserved; it adjusts to maximize entropy.\n\n3.  **Entropy Maximization:** We will start with the statistical definition of entropy (`S = k_B * ln(Omega)`) for Bose-Einstein statistics. We will then maximize this entropy functional with respect to the number of particles at each energy level, subject to the single constraint of fixed total energy `E`. This will be done using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Distribution:** The maximization process yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, which gives the average number of photons occupying each energy state at thermal equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Calculating Mean Energy (E):** With the distribution function known, we can calculate the total mean energy `E` by summing (or integrating) the energy of all photons over all possible states. This requires using the density of states `g(e)` for photons in a three-dimensional volume. The resulting integral is a standard form whose solution gives the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy (`E ‚àù T^4`).\n\n6.  **Calculating Entropy (S):** We can find the equilibrium entropy `S` in two ways:\n    a. By substituting the derived equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula.\n    b. By using the fundamental thermodynamic relationship between entropy, energy, and free energy (`S = (E - F) / T`).\n    Both methods yield a result for entropy proportional to `T^3`.\n\n7.  **Final Output:** The Python script below will walk through these steps, printing out the key formulas and the final results for `E` and `S` in their complete form, highlighting all numerical constants as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef derive_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the derivation of equilibrium energy and entropy for a\n    photon gas using the principles of statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Derivation of Equilibrium Properties for a Photon Gas (Bose Case) ###\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: The Principle of Maximum Entropy ---\n    print(\"Step 1: The Principle of Maximum Entropy\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one that maximizes entropy (S).\")\n    print(\"This is the foundational concept, linking to large deviation theory: the equilibrium\")\n    print(\"state is the most probable one, and all other states are 'large deviations'.\")\n    print(\"For bosons, the entropy S is given by S = k_B * ln(Omega), where Omega is the\")\n    print(\"number of ways to distribute n_i particles into g_i states at energy level e_i:\")\n    print(\"S/k_B = sum_i [ (n_i + g_i)ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i*ln(n_i) - g_i*ln(g_i) ]\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Constraints and the Bose-Einstein Distribution ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Constraints and Equilibrium Distribution\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We maximize S subject to one constraint for a photon gas: fixed total energy.\")\n    print(\"Constraint: E = sum_i(n_i * e_i)\")\n    print(\"(Note: Photon number N is not conserved, so its chemical potential is zero.)\")\n    print(\"Using Lagrange multipliers, this maximization yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\")\n    print(\"This gives the mean occupation number <n_i> per state (g_i=1) at energy e_i.\")\n    print(\"Let beta = 1 / (k_B * T).\\n\")\n\n    print(\">>> The Bose-Einstein distribution for photons is:\")\n    print(\"    <n(e)> = 1 / (exp(beta * e) - 1)\")\n    print(\"    <n(e)> = 1 / (exp(e / (k_B * T)) - 1)\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 3: Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the Mean Energy (E)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The total energy E is the integral of energy 'e' times the number of photons\")\n    print(\"n(e) over all states.
