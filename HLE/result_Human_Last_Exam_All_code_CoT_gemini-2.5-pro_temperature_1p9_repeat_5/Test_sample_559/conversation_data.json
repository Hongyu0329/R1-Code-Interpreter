    "My plan to find the separatrix is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations in the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$. A separatrix is a curve that divides the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** First, we find the equilibrium points (where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$).\n    *   From $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    *   If we substitute $u=0$ into the $d'$ equation, we get $2d^2 = 0$, which means $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(d, u) = (0, 0)$.\n    *   If we substitute $u=1$ into the $d'$ equation, we get $2d^2+2d=0$, which implies $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Saddle Point:** By linearizing the system around these three equilibrium points, we can classify their stability. A stability analysis shows that $(0,1)$ is an unstable node (a source), $(0,0)$ is a non-hyperbolic (degenerate) point, and $(-1,1)$ is a saddle point. The separatrix we are looking for is an invariant manifold passing through this saddle point.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Phase Plane Equation:** To find the curves representing trajectories in the phase plane, we can write an ODE for $d$ as a function of $u$:\n    $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n\n5.  **Hypothesize a Solution and Solve Programmatically:** The equation for $\\frac{dd}{du}$ is a Riccati-type ODE, which can be difficult to solve in general. However, we can test for a simple polynomial solution. We will hypothesize that the separatrix is a quadratic curve of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. The Python code below will use the `sympy` library to find the coefficients $a, b, c$.\n    *   It substitutes the polynomial $d(u)$ into the differential equation.\n    *   This creates a new polynomial in $u$, which must be zero for all values of $u$. This is only possible if the coefficient of each power of $u$ is zero.\n    *   This condition provides a system of algebraic equations for the unknown coefficients $a, b, c$.\n    *   The code solves this system to find all possible quadratic solutions.\n    *   Finally, it checks which of these candidate solutions passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. This specific curve is the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the separatrix for the given system of ODEs by assuming a polynomial form\n    d(u) = a*u^2 + b*u + c, and solving for its coefficients using symbolic math.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    u = sympy.Symbol('u')\n    a, b, c = sympy.symbols('a b c')\n\n    # Define the hypothesized polynomial solution and its derivative\n    d_poly = a * u**2 + b * u + c\n    d_prime = sympy.diff(d_poly, u)\n\n    # The original ODE is: d'/u' = N/D, which we rewrite as D*d' - N = 0 to avoid fractions.\n    # d'(t) = 2*d**2 + (-3*u+5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    # u'(t) = u**2*(u-1) = u**3 - u**2\n    # So the phase plane ODE is: (u**3 - u**2)*d' = 2*d**2 + (5*u**2 - 3*u)*d + u**4 - u**3\n    \n    # Left hand side of the equation\n    lhs = (u**3 - u**2) * d_prime\n    # Right hand side of the equation\n    rhs = 2 * d_poly**2 + (5 * u**2 - 3 * u) * d_poly + u**4 - u**3\n\n    # We need to solve lhs - rhs = 0.\n    # Substitute the polynomial and simplify the expression.\n    equation = sympy.simplify(lhs - rhs)\n\n    # The 'equation' is a polynomial in u.
