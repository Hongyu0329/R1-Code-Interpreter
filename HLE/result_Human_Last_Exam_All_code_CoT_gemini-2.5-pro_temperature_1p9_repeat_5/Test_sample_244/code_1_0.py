    """
    Calculates the proportion of 7-crossing knots that are hyperbolic.
    
    In knot theory, knots are classified by their crossing number. For knots
    with 7 crossings, we refer to the standard knot table (Rolfsen table).
    
    A prime knot is hyperbolic if it is not a torus knot or a satellite knot.
    At 7 crossings, no knots are satellite knots, so we only need to identify
    the torus knots.

    # Step 1: Find the total number of knot types with 7 crossings.
    # From the Rolfsen knot table, there are 7 distinct prime knots
    # with 7 crossings: 7_1, 7_2, 7_3, 7_4, 7_5, 7_6, and 7_7.

    # A knot T(p,q) is a torus knot. A (p,q)-torus knot has crossing number
    # min((p-1)q, (q-1)p). For crossing number 7, we must have (p-1)q = 7
    # or (q-1)p = 7. Since 7 is prime, the only integer solution for p, q > 1
    # is {p, q} = {2, 7}. This corresponds to the (7,2)-torus knot.
    # This knot is listed as 7_1 in the knot table.

    print(f"Number of non-hyperbolic (torus) knots with 7 crossings: {non_hyperbolic_knots} (This is the 7_1 knot)")

    # Hyperbolic knots are the total knots minus the non-hyperbolic ones.
