    # 1. Deconstruct the question
    # The monarch who shifted the royal title from "King of the Franks" to "King of France" was Philip II Augustus.
    # This change from a personal to a territorial conception of power began around 1190.
    monarch = "Philip II Augustus"
    
    # The epithet "Augustus" was given to him by his chronicler, Rigord.
    biographer_who_gave_epithet = "Rigord"
    
    # The key years associated with Philip II's reign are his accession (1180), the start of the title change (1190), and his death (1223).
    
    # 2. Evaluate the options
    # A. 1190, Suetonius -> Wrong biographer. Suetonius wrote about Roman emperors.
    # B. 1250, Joinville -> Wrong monarch, year, and biographer. Joinville wrote about Louis IX.
    # C. 1223, Rigord -> Correct biographer. The year is the end of Philip II's reign, which "contained" the transformation. This is the most plausible option.
    # D. 1789, Voltaire -> Wrong era and author.
    # E. 1190, Baldwin -> Wrong biographer.
    
    # 3. Select the best answer
    # Option C is the strongest choice because it is the only one that correctly identifies the biographer, Rigord.
