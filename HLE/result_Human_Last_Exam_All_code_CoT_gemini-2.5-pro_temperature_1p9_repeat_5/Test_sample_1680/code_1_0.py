    # Case Details:
    # A 60-year-old patient presents with memory loss.
    # Key Symptoms:
    # 1. Forgets to feed himself, leading to weight loss.
    # 2. Disorientation to time (day, month, year).
    # 3. Confabulation: Creates a story about a "tapeworm" to explain his weight loss.
    # 4. Immediate recall is intact (can repeat 3 objects right away), but this does not test short-term memory (recalling after a delay).
    # Pertinent History: "No cirrhosis" rules out hepatic encephalopathy. No cardiac signs rule out cardiomyopathy.

    # Reasoning:
    # The collection of symptoms—forgetting recent events, disorientation, and confabulation—are classic indicators
    # of a significant impairment in the ability to form and retrieve new memories. This is the definition of a
    # short-term memory deficit.
    #
    # Evaluating other options:
    # - B. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: No cardiac symptoms are mentioned.
    # - C. Hepatic encephalopathy: Directly contradicted by the pertinent negative "no cirrhosis."
    # - D. Parasitic infection: The tapeworm is a confabulation (a symptom of memory loss), not a real diagnosis.
    # - E. ATP depletion: This is a biochemical mechanism, not a clinical category for this set of symptoms.

    # The most fitting answer is the one that describes the primary clinical problem.
