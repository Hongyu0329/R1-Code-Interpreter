    "To calculate the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, we will use the epsilon (ϵ) expansion near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the model**: The standard model for this type of universal behavior is the n-vector model. We will assume the Ising model, where the order parameter has a single component (`n=1`).\n2.  **Determine the upper critical dimension (`d_c`)**: For the n-vector model, `d_c = 4`.\n3.  **Define epsilon (`ϵ`)**: The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n4.  **Use the first-order formula**: The first-order expansion for the exponent α is given by the formula: `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n5.  **Calculate the value**: We will substitute `d=3` and `n=1` into the formulas to find the value of α.\n6.  **Generate Python code**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result. The output will show the formula with the numerical values plugged in for clarity.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for the calculation\nd = 3  # Spatial dimension\nn = 1  # Number of components of the order parameter (for the Ising model)\nd_c = 4 # Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\n\n# Calculate epsilon (ϵ)\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# Calculate the scaling exponent alpha (α) to first order in epsilon\n# The formula is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\nalpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# Print the explanation and the final result\nprint(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\")\nprint(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\nprint(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\nprint(f\"Number of order parameter components, n = {n} (Ising model)\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The expansion parameter epsilon (ϵ) is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The first-order formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator/denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The final calculated value for α is: {alpha}\")\nprint(f\"As a fraction, α = 1/6\")\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
