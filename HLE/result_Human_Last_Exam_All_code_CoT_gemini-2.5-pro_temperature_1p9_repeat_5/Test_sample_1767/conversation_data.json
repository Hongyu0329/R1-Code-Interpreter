    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems are brought together to form a larger system, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, provided the gap does not close during the process. In this case, two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C1 = 1 and C2 = 1 are connected. The junction formed by these two insulators can be treated as a single, larger system. The total Chern number of this junction is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nI will calculate this by adding the Chern number of the first insulator to the Chern number of the second insulator.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction (C_total) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers (C1 and C2).\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C1} + {C2}\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
