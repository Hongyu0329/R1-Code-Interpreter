    "My plan is to first research the primary sources and historical context of Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\". While the paper itself is notable for its lack of formal citations, I will investigate his other major work from the same year, his doctoral thesis, to find the direct intellectual influences he formally cited. This will identify the scientist whose work, originating from lectures, was foundational to Einstein's reasoning on statistical mechanics during this period. Finally, I will present this answer using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose lectures were cited\n    by Albert Einstein in his major works of 1905.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scientist whose lectures were a key cited influence on Einstein's 1905 work.\n    scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    # The specific work cited in his 1905 doctoral thesis.\n    cited_work = \"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie (Lectures on Gas Theory)\"\n\n    # While Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself has very few explicit citations,\n    # his closely related doctoral thesis, also completed in 1905, provides a clear answer.\n    # In his thesis, \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions,\" he directly cites the work\n    # of Ludwig Boltzmann, which was published as a book derived from his lectures.\n    # This work was a key foundation for Einstein's revolutionary papers on statistical mechanics.\n\n    print(f\"Albert Einstein's 1905 work, particularly his doctoral thesis, cited the lectures of: {scientist}\")\n    print(f\"The specific work cited was '{cited_work}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_cited_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
