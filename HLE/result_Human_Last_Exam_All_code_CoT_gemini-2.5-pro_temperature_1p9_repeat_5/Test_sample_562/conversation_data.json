    "The radical for the character 謄 is a subject of some debate among different dictionaries, but there is an officially recognized answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the character's visual components. The character 謄 clearly has the radical 月 (in this context, it's 'nikuzuki', a form of the 'meat' radical) on its left side.\n2.  Analyze the character's meaning and origin. The character means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is strongly related to 言 ('word' or 'speech'). Etymologically, the character is considered to belong to the 言 radical family.\n3.  Consult authoritative sources. Official sources in Japan, such as those used for the Kanji Kentei (Japan Kanji Aptitude Test), classify 謄 under the radical 言.\n4.  Determine the name of the radical. The radical 言, when it appears on the left side of a character (even if it's only historically and not visually in this case), is called 'gonben' (ごんべん).\n5.  Provide the Hepburn transcription of this name, \"Gonben\", in a simple Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the Hepburn transcription for the name of the radical in the character 謄.\n\n    The character 謄 visually contains the 月 ('nikuzuki') radical.\n    However, due to its meaning ('to transcribe') and etymology, it is\n    officially classified under the 言 ('word') radical.\n\n    The name for the 言 radical when used as the left-side component is\n    'gonben' (ごんべん). The Hepburn transcription is 'Gonben'.\n    \"\"\"\n    radical_of_tou = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_of_tou)\n\nget_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
