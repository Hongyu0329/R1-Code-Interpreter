    This function returns the Hepburn transcription for the name of the radical in the character 謄.

    The character 謄 visually contains the 月 ('nikuzuki') radical.
    However, due to its meaning ('to transcribe') and etymology, it is
    officially classified under the 言 ('word') radical.

    The name for the 言 radical when used as the left-side component is
    'gonben' (ごんべん). The Hepburn transcription is 'Gonben'.
