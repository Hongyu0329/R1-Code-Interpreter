    "This is a classic question in Fourier analysis. The answer is yes, if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\nMy plan to demonstrate this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain the key theoretical steps of the proof. The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform applied to Schwartz functions.\n2.  Then, I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically walk through the mathematical argument. The script will not compute a numerical answer but will instead illustrate the logical steps that lead to the conclusion, showing the key equations in symbolic form.\n3.  The script will start by defining the moments and the Fourier transform.\n4.  It will then derive the crucial relationship between the moments of the function $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin.\n5.  Using the given condition that all moments are zero, it will show that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin must be zero.\n6.  Finally, it will invoke the analyticity of the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function to conclude that the transform must be zero everywhere, and therefore the function itself must be zero.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import I, pi, oo, exp, pretty\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that if a Schwartz function has all zero moments,\n    it must be the zero function.
