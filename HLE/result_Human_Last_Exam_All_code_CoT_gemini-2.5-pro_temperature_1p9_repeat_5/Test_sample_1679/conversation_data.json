    "To find the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture that depicts a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisk Locations:** The two Luxor Obelisks are located in Luxor, Egypt, and in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. Therefore, the search will focus on Best Picture winners set in either of these locations.\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will create a dataset of Best Picture winners, organized chronologically by their award year.\n3.  **Identify Candidate Films:** I will create a separate list of films that are known to depict the Place de la Concorde in Paris, as this is a more common filming location in early Best Picture winners than Luxor.\n4.  **Cross-Reference Programmatically:** I will write a Python script that iterates through the chronological list of winners. For each winner, it will check if it is in the list of candidate films.\n5.  **Determine First Winner:** The script will stop and print the name of the first film that is found in both lists, which will be our answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    The primary candidate location for this is the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary of early Best Picture winners, mapping the award ceremony year to the film title.\n    # The data is ordered chronologically by the award ceremony.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1929: \"The Broadway Melody\",\n        1930: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\",\n        1931: \"Cimarron\",\n        1932: \"Grand Hotel\",\n        1934: \"Cavalcade\",\n        1935: \"It Happened One Night\",\n        1936: \"Mutiny on the Bounty\",\n        1937: \"The Great Ziegfeld\",\n        1938: \"The Life of Emile Zola\",\n        1939: \"You Can't Take It with You\",\n        1940: \"Gone with the Wind\",\n        1941: \"Rebecca\",\n        1942: \"How Green Was My Valley\",\n        1943: \"Mrs. Miniver\",\n        1944: \"Casablanca\",\n        1945: \"Going My Way\",\n        1946: \"The Lost Weekend\",\n        1947: \"The Best Years of Our Lives\",\n        1948: \"Gentleman's Agreement\",\n        1949: \"Hamlet\",\n        1950: \"All the King's Men\",\n        1951: \"All About Eve\",\n        1952: \"An American in Paris\",  # Set in Paris\n        1953: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\",\n        1954: \"From Here to Eternity\",\n        1955: \"On the Waterfront\",\n        1956: \"Marty\",\n        1957: \"Around the World in 80 Days\", # Also set in Paris\n    }\n\n    # A list of films known to prominently feature the Luxor Obelisk in Paris.\n    films_with_paris_obelisk = [\n        \"An American in Paris\",\n        \"Around the World in 80 Days\"\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate through the winners chronologically by sorting the award years.\n    for year in sorted(best_picture_winners.keys()):\n        winner_title = best_picture_winners[year]\n        \n        # Check if the winner is one of the films known to feature the obelisk.\n        if winner_title in films_with_paris_obelisk:\n            print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is: {winner_title}\")\n            return\n\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
