# --- Input Parameters ---
Eg = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E1s_resonance = 1.0  # 1s exciton resonance peak in eV
n = 3  # The principal quantum number for the target state

# Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (Eb_1s)
# The energy of the 1s exciton resonance is the band gap minus its binding energy.
# E_1s = E_g - E_b,1s  =>  E_b,1s = E_g - E_1s
Eb_1s = Eg - E1s_resonance
print(f"Step 1: Calculate the 1s exciton binding energy.")
print(f"E_b,1s = E_g - E_1s = {Eg} eV - {E1s_resonance} eV = {Eb_1s} eV\n")

# Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (Ry*) for the 2D system
# For a 2D system, the binding energy is given by E_b,n = Ry* / (n - 0.5)^2.
# For n=1, E_b,1s = Ry* / (1 - 0.5)^2 = Ry* / 0.25 = 4 * Ry*.
# Therefore, Ry* = E_b,1s / 4.
Ry_star = Eb_1s / 4.0
print(f"Step 2: Determine the effective Rydberg energy (Ry*).")
print(f"Ry* = E_b,1s / (1 - 0.5)^2 = {Eb_1s} eV / 0.25 = {Ry_star} eV\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n=3 (Eb_3s)
# We use the 2D formula again with n=3.
# E_b,3 = Ry* / (3 - 0.5)^2
denominator = (n - 0.5)**2
Eb_3s = Ry_star / denominator
print(f"Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy for n={n}.")
print(f"The equation is: E_b,3 = Ry* / (n - 0.5)^2")
print(f"E_b,3 = {Ry_star} eV / ({n} - 0.5)^2 = {Ry_star} eV / {denominator} = {Eb_3s:.3f} eV\n")

print(f"The final answer is the Rydberg energy for n = 3.")
