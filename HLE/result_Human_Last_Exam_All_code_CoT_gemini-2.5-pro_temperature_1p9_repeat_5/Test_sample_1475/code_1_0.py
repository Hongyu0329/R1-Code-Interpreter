    This function outlines the reasoning to find the smallest possible cardinality.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably many
    open dense subsets of the space P(X). Let the intersection be G.

    Let S_0 be an arbitrary element of P(X).
    We can choose the open dense sets G_n such that their intersection is exactly {S_0}.
    This is possible if the space P(X) is not a Baire space, allowing us to represent
    P(X) \ {S_0} as a countable union of nowhere-dense closed sets, F_n.
    Then we can define G_n = P(X) \ F_n.

    The intersection is:
    G = Intersect(G_n for n=1,2,...)
      = Intersect(P(X) \ F_n)
      = P(X) \ Union(F_n)
      = P(X) \ (P(X) \ {S_0})
      = {S_0}

    The cardinality of the resulting set {S_0} is 1.
    Since the cardinality of a non-empty set cannot be less than 1, this is the
    smallest possible cardinality.

    print(f"The cardinality of such a set is |{{S_0}}| = {smallest_cardinality}.")
    print(f"Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is {smallest_cardinality}.")
