    "This problem asks for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512. A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:**\n    The semidihedral group of order 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In general, a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has order $2^n$. For our case, $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$.\n    The group is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = e, s^2 = e, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n    Substituting $n=9$:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = e, s^2 = e, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n    The group has two types of elements:\n    a) Powers of $r$: $r^i$ for $i=0, \\dots, 255$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n    b) Elements of the form $sr^i$ for $i=0, \\dots, 255$.\n\n2.  **Count Cyclic Subgroups:**\n    We will find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups by considering subgroups generated by each type of element.\n\n3.  **Subgroups Generated by Powers of `r`:**\n    These are simply the subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted by $\\tau(m)$.\n    We need to calculate $\\tau(256)$. Since $256 = 2^8$, its divisors are $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^8$. There are $8+1=9$ such subgroups.\n\n4.  **Subgroups Generated by Elements `sr^i`:**\n    We need to determine the orders of these elements and how many distinct subgroups they generate.\n    The order of an element $g = sr^i$ depends on whether $i$ is even or odd.\n    *   **Case 1: `i` is even.** The order of $sr^i$ is 2. There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $i$ in the range $0, \\dots, 255$. Each of these 128 elements generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   **Case 2: `i` is odd.** The order of $sr^i$ is 4. There are $256/2 = 128$ odd values for $i$. A cyclic subgroup of order 4 has two generators. It can be shown that $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^{i+128} \\rangle$. Thus, the 128 elements of this type form $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n5.  **Check for Overlaps and Sum the Counts:**\n    The 9 subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$ are distinct from the subgroups generated by $sr^i$ because the latter contain elements outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$ (except for the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ which is counted in the 9). The subgroups generated by $sr^i$ for even $i$ (order 2) are distinct from those for odd $i$ (order 4).\n    Therefore, we can simply add the counts from each category.\n    *   Total subgroups = (subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$) + (subgroups from $sr^i$, $i$ even) + (subgroups from $sr^i$, $i$ odd)\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n    print(f\"Finding the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order {group_order}.\")\n\n    # For a semidihedral group of order 2^n, the order is 512, so 2^n = 512 => n = 9.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n    order_of_r = 2**(n - 1)\n    \n    # 1.
