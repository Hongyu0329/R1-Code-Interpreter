    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalences.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Minimal Grid Diagrams**: The trefoil knot (`3_1`) has a minimal grid number of `n=3`. A `3x3` grid diagram is defined by a pair of permutations `(\\sigma, \\pi)` from the symmetric group `S_3`. A diagram represents a knot (a single-component link) if the permutation `A = \\pi^{-1}\\sigma` is a single cycle of length 3.\n2.  **Distinguish Left-Hand vs. Right-Hand**: In `S_3`, there are two 3-cycles: `c_1 = (1 2 3)` and `c_2 = (1 3 2)`. By convention (e.g., writhe calculation or correspondence with the Alexander polynomial), one represents the right-hand trefoil and the other the left-hand trefoil. We will choose one, say `c_2 = (1 3 2)`, to represent the left-hand trefoil and find all 6 corresponding diagrams.\n3.  **Define Symmetries**: We need to understand how translations and rotations act on a grid diagram `(\\sigma, \\pi)`.\n    *   **Translation**: A cyclic shift of rows and columns.\n    *   **Rotation**: A rotation of the physical grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.\n4.  **Group into Equivalence Classes**: We will treat the 6 left-hand trefoil diagrams as nodes in a graph. We'll add an edge between two diagrams if one can be transformed into the other by a translation or a rotation. The number of unique diagrams is the number of connected components in this graph.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: Implement the permutation operations, generate the diagrams, apply the symmetries, and count the number of equivalence classes (connected components). The final output will be presented as a clear statement based on the code's findings.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Helper functions for permutations (0-indexed)\ndef perm_inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inv[val] = i\n    return tuple(inv)\n\ndef perm_compose(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p2)))\n\ndef generate_s3():\n    \"\"\"Generates all permutations in S3 as tuples.\"\"\"\n    import itertools\n    return list(itertools.permutations(range(3)))\n\ndef get_cycle_notation(p):\n    \"\"\"Helper to get cycle notation for pretty printing.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    unvisited = set(range(n))\n    cycles = []\n    while unvisited:\n        i = unvisited.pop()\n        cycle = [i]\n        j = p[i]\n        while j != i:\n            unvisited.remove(j)\n            cycle.append(j)\n            j = p[j]\n        cycles.append(tuple(c+1 for c in cycle))\n    return cycles\n\n# --- Main Logic ---\n\n# 1.
