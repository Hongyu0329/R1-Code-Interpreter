    # A. No special category - Incorrect. It is for formal occasions and high status.
    # B. Amanyanabo (sovereign) - The sovereign would wear it, but it's not exclusive to them.

    # D. Asawo (young men) - This attire is generally for elders and men of status, not young men.
    # E. Opu asawo (gentlemen) - While gentlemen may wear it, 'Alabo' is a more precise term for the formal status group strongly associated with this attire.
