    "This is an interesting question because it points to a common exception in crystallography rules. Here is a step-by-step plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms:** First, we must be clear on the definitions of optical activity, chirality, and polarity in the context of crystal symmetry.\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarized light. The strict requirement for optical activity is that the crystal's point group must not contain a center of inversion (ī) or a mirror plane (m).\n    *   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must contain at least one rotoinversion axis (ī, m, 3̄, 4̄, 6̄).\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique vector direction that is left unchanged by all symmetry operations.\n\n2.  **Identify the Conflict:** There's a widely taught rule-of-thumb that \"optical activity requires chirality\". However, your question asks for an **achiral** class that is optically active. This suggests we need to look for an exception based on the stricter definition.\n\n3.  **Apply the Strict Rule:** We need to find an achiral crystal class that does *not* have a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n    *   The rotoinversion axes 3̄ and 6̄ are problematic because a 3̄ axis implies a center of inversion (3̄ = 3 + ī), and a 6̄ axis implies a mirror plane (6̄ = 3/m). Crystal classes with these will not be optically active.\n    *   This leaves only the 4̄ (4-bar) rotoinversion axis. A point group whose only achiral element is a 4̄ axis does not contain a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Candidate:** The crystal class **4̄** (in Hermann-Mauguin notation, or S₄ in Schoenflies) is our sole candidate.\n    *   It is **achiral** because it possesses the 4̄ rotoinversion axis.\n    *   It is **optically active** because it lacks a center of inversion and a mirror plane.\n    *   It is **non-polar**, as it has no unique directional axis.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The crystal class **4̄** is the only one that meets all three of your conditions.\n\nThe following Python script will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_class():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and identifies the crystal class that is achiral, \n    non-polar, and exhibits optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the requirements for the crystal class:\")\n    print(\"1.
