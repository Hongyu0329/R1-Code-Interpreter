    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type**: The starting material is a secondary alkyl halide, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. It is treated with potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, bulky base. These conditions are characteristic of an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Recall the E2 Mechanism's Requirement**: The E2 reaction mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, Br) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar orientation. For cyclohexane rings, this means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down), a configuration known as trans-diaxial.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Starting Material's Conformation**:\n    *   The given stereochemistry, (1S,2R), means the bromine (at C1) and the methyl group (at C2) are *trans* to each other.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   The diequatorial conformer is significantly more stable and thus more populated. However, for the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) **must** be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Possible Elimination Pathways in the Reactive Conformation**: We must analyze the diaxial conformer where both the Bromine at C1 and the Methyl group at C2 are axial.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2**: In this conformation, the methyl group is axial. This means the other substituent on C2, the hydrogen atom, must be in the equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is **not** anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is impossible. The product that would have formed, 1-methylcyclohexene (the more substituted Zaitsev product), cannot be created.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6**: Carbon 6 has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product**:\n    *   Since the only available anti-periplanar β-hydrogen is on C6, the base (potassium tert-butoxide) will abstract this proton.\n    *   This leads exclusively to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   The methyl group at C2 remains in its position. Numbering the carbons of the alkene product starting from the double bond, the methyl group is on carbon 3.\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of the E2 elimination of\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Chemical Entities ---\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    # --- Analysis Steps ---\n    step_1 = \"The reaction is an E2 elimination due to the secondary alkyl halide and strong base.\"\n    \n    step_2 = \"E2 reactions require an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement between the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen.\"\n    \n    step_3 = f\"The substrate, {substrate}, is a trans-isomer.
