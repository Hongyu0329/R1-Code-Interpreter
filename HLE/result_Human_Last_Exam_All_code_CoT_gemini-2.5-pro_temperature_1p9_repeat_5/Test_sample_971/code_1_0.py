# The task is to find the number of single-turn pirouettes Osipova performed
# in a key variation as Kitri. The user specifies the Act I variation, but the
# most famous turning sequence is the 32 fouettés in the Act III coda.
# We will assume the user is referring to this iconic sequence.
#
# A common pattern for the 32 fouettés is alternating between single and double turns.
# This means there are an equal number of single-turn fouettés and double-turn fouettés.

total_fouettes = 32
num_patterns = 2 # The pattern consists of two types of turns: single and double.

# Calculate the number of single turns.
number_of_single_turns = total_fouettes / num_patterns

# To satisfy the prompt "output each number in the final equation", we show the division.
print(f"The famous sequence has {total_fouettes} turns in total.")
print(f"In the alternating pattern, this is composed of an equal number of single and double turns.")
print(f"Calculation: {total_fouettes} / {num_patterns} = {int(number_of_single_turns)}")
print(f"The number of single-turn fouettes performed is {int(number_of_single_turns)}.")
