    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the main, commonly cited allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Determine the characteristic color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  Count the number of distinct colors found.\n4.  Create a Python script that lists these colors, represents the count as a sum, and prints the final result.\n\nThe main allotropes are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** Appears as a white or yellowish waxy solid.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous polymer that is red in color.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's metallic phosphorus):** A crystalline form that is violet or purple.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable form, which is black and has a structure similar to graphite.\n\nCounting these gives us four distinct colors: white/yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    found in the common allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary mapping color categories to a count of 1 for summation\n    colors = {\n        \"White/Yellow\": 1,\n        \"Red\": 1,\n        \"Violet\": 1,\n        \"Black\": 1\n    }\n\n    # Get the list of numbers for the equation\n    equation_numbers = list(colors.values())\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of colors\n    total_colors = sum(equation_numbers)\n    \n    # Create the string for the equation\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, equation_numbers))\n\n    print(f\"The primary colors observed in pure phosphorus allotropes are White/Yellow, Red, Violet, and Black.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of distinct colors is calculated as: {equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
