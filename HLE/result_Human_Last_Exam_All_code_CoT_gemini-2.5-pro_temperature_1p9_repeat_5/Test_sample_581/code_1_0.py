# The problem is about a known value from the field of combinatorics, specifically regarding cap sets.
# A cap set is a collection of points in the vector space (Z/3Z)^n where no three points form a line.
# The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is denoted as r_3(n).

# The question asks for the best-known lower bound for r_3(8).
# Lower bounds are established by explicitly constructing large cap sets. These constructions
# can be very intricate. We rely on published mathematical research to find this value.

# Based on the work of Yves Edel and others in this field, we can find the best-known value.

dimension = 8
# The construction providing this bound is described in the paper "New lower bounds for r_q(n)" by Y. Edel (2012).
