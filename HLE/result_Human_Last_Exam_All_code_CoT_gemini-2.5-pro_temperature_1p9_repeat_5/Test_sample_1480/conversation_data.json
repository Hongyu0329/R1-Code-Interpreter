    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm, we need to combine the activation of the antecedent part of the rule with the membership value of the consequent part.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the inputs:**\n    *   The activation of the antecedent (the `IF` part) is `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This is also known as the rule's firing strength.\n    *   The membership value in the consequent (the `THEN` part) is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\n2.  **Choose the operation:**\n    *   A t-norm is used to model the logical `AND` operation in fuzzy logic. In fuzzy inference, the firing strength from the antecedent is combined with the consequent's membership function using a t-norm.\n    *   The most common and standard t-norm is the **minimum** operator. We will use `min(a, b)`.\n\n3.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   The resulting membership grade is calculated as `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`.\n    *   This will be `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n\n4.  **Generate Python code:**\n    *   The code will define the two input values, perform the `min` operation, and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the fuzzy rule inference\n# Firing strength of the rule's antecedent (IF part)\nantecedent_firing_strength = 0.7\n# Membership grade in the consequent set (THEN part)\nconsequent_membership_grade = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function.\n# This process determines the membership grade in the final output set for this rule.\n# The most widely used t-norm is the minimum operator.\nresult = min(antecedent_firing_strength, consequent_membership_grade)\n\n# Display the inputs, the operation, and the final result\nprint(\"Calculating the resulting membership grade using a t-norm (minimum operator).\")\nprint(f\"Antecedent Firing Strength, Phi_k(x'): {antecedent_firing_strength}\")\nprint(f\"Consequent Membership Grade, μG_k_j(y_j): {consequent_membership_grade}\")\nprint(\"\\nEquation:\")\nprint(f\"Result = min({antecedent_firing_strength}, {consequent_membership_grade})\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Result: {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
