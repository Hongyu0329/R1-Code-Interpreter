    This function provides the answer to the question about the reaction of Ce2@C80.
    The reaction is an exohedral functionalization, which adds a bulky group to the fullerene cage.
    This breaks the cage's symmetry and localizes the internal cerium atoms.
    X-ray crystallography studies show the Ce atoms align with the new axis, positioning them at the poles.
