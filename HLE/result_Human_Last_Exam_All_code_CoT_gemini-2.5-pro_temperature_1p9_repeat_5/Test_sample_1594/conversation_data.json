    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a knowledge-based question about geography and architecture. My plan is to use my internal knowledge about the satellite view of these two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy. I will then create a simple Python script that prints out the letter their buildings form.\n\n```python\ndef find_building_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle about the shape of the high school buildings in Pisa.\n    The two high schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, are\n    located adjacent to each other. When seen from an aerial or satellite view,\n    their combined physical layout distinctly forms a letter of the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The letter formed by the buildings.\n    letter = \"H\"\n\n    # There is no equation here, but to fulfill the request, we will print the letter.\n    print(f\"The letter formed by the two high school buildings when seen from above is: {letter}\")\n\nfind_building_shape()\n```\n<<<H>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
