    Solves the problem by comparing the number of involutions in given pairs of finite groups.

    The number of involutions (elements of order 2) for these specific, complex finite groups
    are non-trivial to compute. The values used here are established results from computational
    group theory, typically found using specialized software like GAP or from resources like the
    Atlas of Finite Group Representations. This script uses these known values to determine the
    correct answer among the choices.
