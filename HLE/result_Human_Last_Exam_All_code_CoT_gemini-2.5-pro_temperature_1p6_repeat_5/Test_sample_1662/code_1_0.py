    explanation = """
    The question asks to identify which pair of renowned ballet institutions uses an 'allongé' (extended/stretched) arm position with bent knees as a preparation for pirouettes starting from the fourth position. Let's analyze the major pedagogical styles:

    1.  **Vaganova (Russian) / La Scala (Italian)**: These schools traditionally use rounded arm positions for pirouette preparations, typically with one arm in first position and the other in second position. The arms are not 'allongé'.

    2.  **Royal Ballet School (English)**: This school's style is a hybrid but generally follows the Vaganova/Cecchetti tradition of using rounded arms for this specific preparation.

    3.  **Paris Opera Ballet School (French)**: The French school emphasizes elegance and long lines. Their preparation can feature a more extended, or 'allongé', quality in the arms compared to the Russian or Italian schools.

    4.  **School of American Ballet (Balanchine)**: The Balanchine method is famous for its distinct pirouette preparation from fourth position, which characteristically uses straight, 'allongé' arms to create a long, open, and dynamic line.

    Based on this analysis, the School of American Ballet definitively uses this technique, and the Paris Opera Ballet School is also known for a similar, elongated arm styling. Therefore, the pair that fits the description best is the Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
