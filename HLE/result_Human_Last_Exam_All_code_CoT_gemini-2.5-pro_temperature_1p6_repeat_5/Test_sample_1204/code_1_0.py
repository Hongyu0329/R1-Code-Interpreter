It can worsen anxiety, destabilize mood (especially with potential bipolar disorder), and severely disrupt sleep architecture, causing his insomnia. Addressing this is the most critical first step to allow for an accurate assessment of his underlying symptoms and medication effectiveness.\n")

It verifies self-report, screens for other undisclosed substances, and is a mandatory safety measure before considering any prescription of controlled substances like the stimulants he is requesting.\n")

    print("Reasoning: The patient is 'struggling mightily' with insomnia, a primary complaint. While his cannabis use is the likely cause, providing a safe, low-risk, non-addictive intervention like melatonin directly addresses his suffering. This demonstrates that his concerns are being heard and can strengthen the therapeutic alliance, which is crucial for the more difficult task of counseling him on cannabis cessation.
