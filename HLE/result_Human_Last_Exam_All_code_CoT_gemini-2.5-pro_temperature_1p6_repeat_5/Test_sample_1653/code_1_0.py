# The problem states that the asymptotic behavior of ln(h_k) is governed by
# the size of the set B_k and the exponents of k in the distances between
# the sets A_k and B_k.

# A_k = {(0,0), (0,k^3)}
# B_k is a set of 4 points, located at y-coordinates k^2 and k^2+1.
#
# For large k, the distance from any point in B_k to (0,0) scales as k^2.
# For large k, the distance from any point in B_k to (0,k^3) scales as k^3.
#
# The scaling exponents of the distances are therefore 2 and 3.
# The size of the set B_k is |B_k| = 4.

# The limiting value of ln(h_k) / ln(k) is given by a formula from the
# theory of potential and random walks, which states that the value is
# the size of the test set multiplied by the difference of the scaling exponents.
# The sign is determined by the specific setup of the conditional probability.
# In this context, it results in (exponent1 - exponent2).
