    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to find `a(10)`, which is the total count of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D grid (Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path on the grid that does not visit the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy:** A direct enumeration of all possible 10-step paths is the core of the problem. A recursive backtracking algorithm is a natural fit for this. To make the computation efficient, I will exploit the inherent symmetry of the square lattice.\n\n3.  **Exploit Symmetry:**\n    *   A walk can start at any point; by convention, we'll use the origin (0,0). The first step can go in 4 directions (e.g., up, down, left, right). Since the grid is symmetrical, the number of valid walks starting with any of these initial steps is the same. So, we can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., from (0,0) to (1,0)) and multiply the final result by 4.\n    *   We can extend this idea to the second step. After the first step to (1,0), the second step from there can either be \"straight\" (to (2,0)) or a \"turn\" (to (1,1) or (1,-1)). Again, by symmetry, the number of walks continuing from a right turn is identical to that from a left turn.\n    *   This leads to the formula: `a(N) = 4 * (C_straight + 2 * C_turn)`, where `N` is the total number of steps. Here, `C_straight` is the number of valid continuations of length `N-2` after an initial `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)` path, and `C_turn` is the number of valid continuations of length `N-2` after an initial `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)` path. For our problem, N=10, so we'll be counting paths of length 8.\n\n4.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   I will create a recursive function, `count_walks(steps_left, x, y, visited)`, which counts the number of valid walk continuations from a given position `(x, y)`.\n    *   `steps_left` will be the number of steps remaining in the walk.\n    *   `visited` will be a set containing the coordinates of points already on the current path, to enforce the \"self-avoiding\" constraint.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when `steps_left` becomes 0. This signifies that one complete valid path has been found, so the function returns 1.\n    *   The recursive step explores all valid (unvisited) neighbors, calls itself with `steps_left - 1`, and sums the results from these calls.\n    *   The main part of the script will invoke this recursive function to find `C_straight` and `C_turn` for 8-step walks and then use the symmetry formula to compute the final value for `a(10)`.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will print a clear explanation of the method, including the values for `C_straight` and `C_turn`, the formula used, and the final computed value for `a(10)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \n    This function uses a recursive backtracking algorithm optimized by exploiting the\n    symmetries of the square lattice to reduce the computation time.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def count_walks(steps_left, x, y, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks from a given state.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left: Number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            x: The current x-coordinate.\n            y: The current y-coordinate.\n            visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points on the path.\n\n        Returns:\n            The total number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        # Explore the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n        for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # If the next point has not been visited, proceed with the walk.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # Add the new point to the visited set for the recursive call.\n                visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n                total_walks += count_walks(steps_left - 1, next_x, next_y, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths from the current state.\n                visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n\n        return total_walks\n\n    N = 10\n\n    # The problem can be broken down using symmetry.\n    # A walk's first step can be in 4 directions.
