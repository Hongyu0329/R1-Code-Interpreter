def find_true_statements():
    """
    Analyzes a list of statements about probabilistic graphical models
    and identifies the true ones.

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    A: False. The junction tree is not always the most efficient method.
    B: False. The algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth; it's its main bottleneck.
    C: True. Junction tree nodes are cliques, and they work with joint distributions (potentials) over their variables.
    D: False. Based on the false premise that the algorithm is resilient to high treewidth.
    E: True. High treewidth leads to large cliques, making the algorithm's memory and computation requirements impractical.
    F: False. Same as D.
    G: True. The lack of resilience to high treewidth is because of the need to manage exponentially large joint distributions for the cliques.
    H: False. The complexity is exponential, not linear, with respect to the number of variables in the largest clique.
    I: True. The efficiency diminishes exponentially as the size of the largest clique grows linearly.
    J: False. Contradicts the known complexity.
    L: True. This is a correct statement of a key consequence of the running intersection property.

    The final set of true statements is {C, E, G, I, L}.
