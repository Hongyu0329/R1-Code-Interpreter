# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a compact,
# connected metric space X for which the n-th configuration space F_n(X) is
# disconnected for some n >= 2.

# Let's break down the properties of such a space X.

# Property 1: If a space X contains a simple closed curve (a subspace
# homeomorphic to a circle), one can always "guide" points along the curve
# to move past each other. This means any configuration of distinct points
# can be continuously transformed into any permutation of that configuration.
# A key result in topology states that if a sufficiently nice space X (like a
# Peano continuum) contains a simple closed curve, its configuration space F_n(X)
# is connected for all n.
# Therefore, for F_n(X) to be disconnected, X must not contain any simple closed curves.

# Property 2: A compact, connected, metric space that contains no simple closed
# curves is known as a dendroid. If we assume X is also locally connected (a common
# and reasonable assumption in this context), it is called a dendrite.
# Examples of dendrites are the closed interval [0,1], a Y-shaped space, an H-shaped space, etc.

# Property 3: We must now determine which of these dendrites have a disconnected
# configuration space.
#  - For the interval X = [0,1], the space F_n(X) is disconnected. The ordering of
#    the points (e.g., x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n) defines a component, and no path
#    can connect it to a different ordering (e.g., x_2 < x_1 < ... < x_n).
#  - For any dendrite that is NOT an arc (i.e., one that has a branch point,
#    like a Y-shape), a theorem by C.E. Burgess states that its configuration space
#    F_n(X) is connected. The extra arms provide the necessary room to maneuver
#    points around each other and connect all configurations.

# Conclusion: The combination of these properties implies that the only spaces X
# that satisfy the given conditions are those homeomorphic to the closed interval [0,1].
# All such spaces belong to the same homeomorphism class.

# Therefore, there is only one such distinct homeomorphism class.
