    "This is a mathematical question about topology. I will lay out the step-by-step proof. Since the request requires a code block, I will use a Python script to print the logical steps of the derivation.\n\nHere is the plan for the proof:\n1.  Analyze the properties of the dense open subset $U$. The given conditions imply that $U$ is a 1-dimensional metrizable manifold.\n2.  Prove that $U$ must be a separable space. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. This follows from $U$ being a locally separable metric space that is a subspace of the connected space $X$.\n3.  Show that if a dense subset $U$ of a space $X$ is separable, then $X$ itself is separable.\n4.  Finally, prove that any separable metric space $X$ must have a cardinality no greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$). This establishes an upper bound.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a step-by-step argument to find the upper bound on the cardinality of X.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the dense open subset U.\")\n    print(\"The problem states that U is an open subset of X and each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"This means U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"Since X is a metric space, U, as its subspace, is also a metrizable space.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Show that U is separable.\")\n    print(\"A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.\")\n    print(\"1. U is locally homeomorphic to R. Since R is separable, U is locally separable.\")\n    print(\"2. For a metric space, being locally separable means it is a topological sum (disjoint union) of separable open subspaces.\")\n    print(\"   So, we can write U = union(U_i) for a collection of disjoint open separable subspaces U_i.\")\n    print(\"3. Each U_i is open in U. Since U is open in X, each U_i is also open in X.\")\n    print(\"4. X is connected, so it cannot be written as the disjoint union of multiple non-empty open sets.\")\n    print(\"5. If there were more than one U_i, this would contradict the connectedness of X via the dense set U.\")\n    print(\"6. Therefore, U must consist of a single separable component.

Since X is a separable metric space, it is also 'second-countable', meaning it has a countable basis of open sets, let's call it B.\")\n    print(\"2. For any two distinct points x, y in X, since X is a metric (and thus Hausdorff) space, we can find disjoint open sets containing them.\")\n    print(\"3. This implies that the set of basis elements from B containing x is different from the set of basis elements from B containing y.\")\n    print(\"4.
