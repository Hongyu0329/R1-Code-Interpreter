A defect here creates a hole, leading to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, where abdominal contents move into the chest. This perfectly explains the lung density and respiratory distress.")
    print("  - C. Ventral foregut budding defect: This typically results in a tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition presents differently and does not typically cause a large mass in the lung field.")
