It does this by abstracting a proton from the more sterically accessible beta-carbon. In this case, the protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are more accessible than the protons on the internal methylene group (C2). The chiral center at C3 is destroyed.")

    print("The final product is achiral. A molecule is chiral if it contains at least one stereocenter (typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph), none of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral.")
