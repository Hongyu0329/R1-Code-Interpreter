# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection
# of countably many open dense subsets of P(X).

# The mathematical reasoning based on the Baire Category Theorem and properties
# of Polish spaces shows that the resulting set is a non-empty perfect Polish space.
# Any such space has the cardinality of the continuum.

# The cardinality of the continuum is expressed as 2 raised to the power of ℵ₀ (Aleph_0),
# where ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.
# The final equation for the cardinality is: Cardinality = 2 ** ℵ₀

# We use the sympy library to represent these transfinite numbers.
base = 2
aleph_0 = sympy.S.Aleph0

# The full expression for the cardinality.
cardinality_expression = base**aleph_0

# Outputting each number and symbol in the final equation as requested.
print("The final result is derived from an equation of the form: base ** exponent")
print(f"Base: {base}")
print(f"Exponent: {aleph_0} (Aleph_0, the cardinality of the natural numbers)")

# Print the final result
print(f"\nThe smallest possible cardinality is {cardinality_expression}.")
