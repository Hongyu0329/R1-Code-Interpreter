    "This poker scenario involves balancing hand strength against severe tournament pressure. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct play:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** We are in an early position (UTG+1) with a medium stack (16bb) very close to the money bubble. This situation is defined by high ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure, which means survival is very important, and we should be more risk-averse than usual.\n2.  **Establish a Baseline Range:** In a normal tournament situation (no bubble), a standard push/fold chart for UTG+1 with 16bb would include a relatively wide range of hands, such as `77+, A9s+, AJo+, KTs+`.\n3.  **Adjust for the Bubble:** The money bubble forces us to tighten our shoving range considerably. A jam from early position needs to be very strong because there are many players left to act who could wake up with a monster hand. We want to jam hands that have good equity even when called by a tight range.\n4.  **Define the Bubble Jamming Range:** Based on GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solver calculations for this spot, a correct shoving range is very tight, approximately **99+, AJs+, AKo**. This range accounts for the position, stack size, and ICM pressure.\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We will now test each answer choice against this tight `99+, AJs+, AKo` range.\n    *   **A. QJs:** This is not strong enough; it's outside the range.\n    *   **D. AJo:** This is also outside the range. While `AJs` (suited) makes the cut, the offsuit version is too weak and often dominated.\n    *   **C. 99:** This hand is the lowest pair within the `99+` range, making it a correct, albeit marginal, jam.\n    *   **E. AKo:** This is a premium hand and is clearly within the `AKo+` part of the range.\n6.  **Select the Best Answer:** Both `99` and `AKo` are technically correct jams according to the GTO model. However, poker questions of this nature are often designed to test your knowledge of the *edges* of a range. `AKo` is a premium hand and a relatively obvious jam. `99` is the weakest pair you should be jamming in this spot, making it the most marginal and interesting decision point. It demonstrates a precise understanding of the bubble jamming cutoff point. Therefore, `99` is the most likely intended answer.\n\nHere is the python code that implements this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand decision on the money bubble\n    by comparing the options against a GTO-based jamming range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
