# The user wants to identify the incorrect statement about St. Augustine's philosophy on "free will".
# Based on the analysis of each option:
# A is correct. There is a well-known scholarly parallel drawn between Augustine's later thoughts on predestination and Calvinism.
# B is incorrect. The "asymmetry" of Augustine's concept of freedom (free to sin, not free to be good without divine help) is fundamentally based on his doctrines of grace and predestination. A scholar like R. A. Markus could not have discussed the former while ignoring the latter.
# C is correct. Augustine's development of the concept of "voluntas" (will) as a part of the human psyche was influenced by classical philosophy, including Stoicism (Seneca).
# D is correct. It is a cornerstone of Augustinian thought that philosophy and theology are intertwined ("faith seeking understanding").
# E is correct. It is a plausible scholarly position for a historian like Etiene Gilson to distinguish Augustine's original concept of irresistible grace from the later, condemned Jansenist interpretation.
# F is correct. This accurately summarizes Augustine's dialogue with Evodius in "On the Free Choice of the Will," where he establishes human responsibility for sin.

# The incorrect statement is B.
# The final answer needs to be printed to the console.

print(f"""Explanation: The statement claims that historian R. A. Markus discussed the 'asymmetry' of Augustine's view on freedom while ignoring the concepts of predestination and grace. This is logically flawed. The very idea of 'asymmetrical freedom' in Augustine's later thought—that humans are free to choose sin but not free to choose good without divine intervention—is entirely dependent on his doctrines of grace and predestination. One cannot be discussed without the other, making this statement incorrect.""")

# The final output should just be the answer tag.
# No code needed for this task, the goal is to identify the incorrect statement from the text.
# The user asked for code, but this is a multiple choice question. A simple print of the answer is sufficient.
# I will print the answer directly as requested in the final instructions.
