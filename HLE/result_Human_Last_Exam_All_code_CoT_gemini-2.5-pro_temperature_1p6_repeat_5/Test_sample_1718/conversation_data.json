    "Of course. The number of independent components (or entries) of the Riemann tensor depends on the dimension of the manifold and any additional geometric structures it possesses. For a Kähler manifold, the presence of a compatible complex structure significantly reduces this number compared to a general Riemannian manifold of the same real dimension.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the formulas:** I will first state the two key formulas for calculating the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor:\n    *   For a general Riemannian manifold of real dimension `n`.\n    *   For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` (which has a real dimension of `n = 2m`).\n2.  **Create a Python Script:** I will provide a Python script that prompts the user to enter the complex dimension `m`.\n3.  **Calculate and Compare:** The script will then use the formulas to calculate the number of components for both the general Riemannian case and the specific Kähler case. This comparison clearly illustrates the constraints imposed by the Kähler structure.\n4.  **Display Detailed Steps:** As requested, the script's output will show the step-by-step calculation for each formula, plugging in the numbers to arrive at the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_riemann_components():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    for a general Riemannian manifold and a Kähler manifold, given a complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Prompt user for the complex dimension\n        m_str = input(\"Please enter the complex dimension (m) of the Kähler manifold: \")\n        m = int(m_str)\n        if m < 1:\n            print(\"Error: The dimension must be a positive integer.\")\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input.
