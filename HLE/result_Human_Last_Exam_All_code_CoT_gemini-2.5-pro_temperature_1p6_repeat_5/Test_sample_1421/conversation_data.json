    "The fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time path integral formalism describes the statistical mechanics of a system of fermions. It is expressed as a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\nHere is the plan to construct the formula and explain it:\n1.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):** Start with the general form of the path integral, which is an integral over all possible field configurations weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action.\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action (S):** The action `S` is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density `𝓛` over imaginary time `τ` (from 0 to `β = 1/k_B T`) and space `x`.\n3.  **Define the Lagrangian Density (𝓛):** The Lagrangian density describes the dynamics of the system. For fermions, it includes a kinetic term, a chemical potential term, and potentially an interaction term.\n4.  **Specify the Boundary Conditions:** A key feature of fermions in this formalism is that their fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction.\n5.  **Assemble the final formula:** Combine all components and present them in a clear, formatted way using a Python script.\n\nThis script will print the formula and an explanation of its terms.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Formula components\n    partition_function = \"Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])\"\n    action = \"S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  𝓛(ψ̄, ψ)\"\n    lagrangian = \"𝓛 = ψ̄(x, τ) * [ (∂/∂τ) + H₀ - μ ] * ψ(x, τ) + V[ψ̄, ψ]\"\n    boundary_condition = \"Boundary Condition: ψ(x, β) = -ψ(x, 0)\"\n\n    # Printing the formula\n    print(f\"    {partition_function}\\n\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"    S[ψ̄, ψ] is the Euclidean action, given by:\")\n    print(f\"        {action}\\n\")\n    print(f\"    𝓛 is the Euclidean Lagrangian density.
