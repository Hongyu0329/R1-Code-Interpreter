    "The theologian who first developed a sophisticated and specialized terminological framework to explain events that seem to alter the laws of nature, such as the virgin birth and the changes to the world after the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nHe used the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (or \"seminal reasons\"/\"causal principles\"). Augustine's theory proposed that God embedded these latent potentials within creation from the very beginning. From this perspective:\n\n*   **Miracles**, like the virgin birth, are not violations of nature's order but rather the activation by God of a potential that was always present in creation, just not part of its ordinary, observable course. It was an event contrary to the *known* course of nature, but not contrary to the deeper principles God had embedded within it.\n*   **The Fall** could be understood as causing a shift in which of these potentials were active. The pre-Fall world operated under one set of realized principles (e.g., without death or decay for humanity), while the post-Fall world operates under another, where the latent potentials for mortality, toil, and suffering became manifest. This constitutes a change in the \"laws of nature\" as they are experienced.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to maintain God's sovereignty and the integrity of His creation while explaining both unique divine acts and fundamental shifts in the state of the natural world.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
