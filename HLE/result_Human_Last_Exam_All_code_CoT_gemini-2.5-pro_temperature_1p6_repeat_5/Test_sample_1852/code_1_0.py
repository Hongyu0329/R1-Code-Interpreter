def solve_tower_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem about towers on ω₁.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The problem defines a 'tower' of length λ, which corresponds to a maximal antichain
        in a specific partial order related to P(ω₁). The set X is the set of regular
        cardinals λ for which such a tower exists.
    2.  Let t(ω₁) be the tower number for ω₁, the minimum length of such a tower.
        A fundamental ZFC theorem by Shelah states that t(κ) ≥ κ⁺ for any regular cardinal κ.
        For κ = ω₁, this means t(ω₁) ≥ (ω₁)⁺ = ω₂.
    3.  δ₂, the infimum of X, must be at least t(ω₁). So, δ₂ ≥ ω₂.
    4.  The length λ of any tower is bounded by the total number of subsets of ω₁, which is 2^|ω₁|.
        The problem assumes 2^ω₁ = ω₂. Thus, any λ in X must satisfy λ ≤ ω₂.
    5.  From δ₂ ≥ ω₂ and λ ≤ ω₂ for all λ ∈ X, we can conclude that X contains at most one element: ω₂.
    6.  The continuum hypothesis for ω₁ (2^ω₁ = ω₂), implies that the tower number t(ω₁) is exactly ω₂.
        Since ω₂ is a regular cardinal, a tower of length ω₂ exists, so ω₂ ∈ X.
    7.  This confirms that the set X is exactly {ω₂}.
    8.  Therefore, δ₁ = sup(X) = ω₂ and δ₂ = inf(X) = ω₂.
    9.  The final sum is δ₁ + δ₂, which in cardinal arithmetic is ω₂ + ω₂ = ω₂.
