    "The standard pitch accent for a word can be looked up in a Japanese pitch accent dictionary. For the word 「弟」(おとうと), the standard Tokyo dialect pitch accent is Heiban.\n\nHeiban (平板) means \"flat type\". The pitch starts low on the first mora (syllable) and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and any grammatical particles that follow it.\n\nFor 「弟」(おとうと - o-to-u-to):\n- お (o): Low\n- とう (tou): High\n- と (to): High\n\nThe pattern is Low-High-High-High.\n\nThe following Python code will print the word, its reading, its pitch accent pattern, and a representation of the pitch contour.\n\n```python\ndef print_pitch_accent_info(kanji, kana, pattern_name, pattern_code):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints information about a Japanese word's pitch accent.\n\n    Args:\n        kanji (str): The word in Kanji.\n        kana (str): The word in Hiragana.\n        pattern_name (str): The name of the pitch accent pattern (e.g., \"Heiban\").\n        pattern_code (str): A simple representation of the pitch (e.g., \"L-H-H-H\").\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Word: 「{kanji}」 ({kana})\")\n    print(f\"Standard Pitch Accent Pattern: {pattern_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means the pitch contour is as follows:\")\n\n    moras = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    pitches = pattern_code.split('-')\n\n    for i in range(len(moras)):\n        print(f\"Mora {i+1}「{moras[i]}」: {pitches[i]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nWhen followed by a particle like が, the particle also stays high:\")\n    print(\"お(L)とう(H)と(H)が(H)\")\n\n\n# Information for the word 「弟」\nword_kanji = \"弟\"\nword_kana = \"おとうと\"\naccent_pattern = \"Heiban (平板)\"\npitch_representation = \"L-H-H-H\" # L=Low, H=High\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nprint_pitch_accent_info(word_kanji, word_kana, accent_pattern, pitch_representation)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
