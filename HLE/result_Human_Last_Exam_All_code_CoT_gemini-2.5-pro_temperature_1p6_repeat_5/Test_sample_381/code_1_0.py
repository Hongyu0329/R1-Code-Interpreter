    Calculates the factor for the upper-bound of ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf.

    Based on the provided text, the problem is to find an upper bound for
    ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf expressed as a factor of sqrt(N). This can be derived
    by first bounding ||B * Q_{0, M}||_2. The condition beta > 0 implies stability,
    which suggests ||B * Q_{0, M}||_2 is bounded by a constant independent of N.
    Assuming this constant is 1, the corresponding factor for the infinity norm
    bound is also 1.
