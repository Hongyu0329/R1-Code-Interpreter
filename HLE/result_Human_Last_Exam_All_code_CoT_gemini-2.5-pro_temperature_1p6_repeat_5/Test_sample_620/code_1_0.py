    print("Problem Analysis:")
    print("1. The Product vs. Time plot is not linear, indicating a changing reaction rate.")
    print("2. The assay is chilled on ice before measurement.")
    print("3. The enzyme must be a dimer to be active (an 'obligate dimer').")

    print("\nHypothesis:")
    print("Low temperatures can cause some dimeric enzymes to dissociate into inactive monomers (a phenomenon called cold-induced dissociation).")
    print("Chilling the assay on ice likely causes the active enzyme dimers to fall apart.")
    print("When the reaction is started (at a warmer temperature), there is a lag phase as the monomers slowly re-form into active dimers. This causes the non-linear curve.")

    print("\nEvaluating the Options:")
    print("A. Increase temperature: This would directly counteract cold-induced dissociation, favoring the formation of the active dimer. This is the most logical step.")
    print("B. Decrease temperature: This would likely worsen the dissociation.")
    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: This might help shift the balance toward dimers but doesn't fix the root cause (temperature).")
    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: This would worsen the dissociation.")
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most direct troubleshooting step is to address the temperature. Eliminating the chilling step and running the assay at a higher, more optimal temperature should restore the linear phase.")
