# Let S = SNYWR. Since the value is not provided, we will use a sample value.
# Let's assume S = 90 for this example.
S = 90

# In triangle ABC, we are given:
# BC = S
# m<B = 30 degrees
# We need to find the number of integer values of AC for which there are
# two possible values for side length AB.

# This scenario is the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA).
# For two distinct triangles to be possible, the side opposite the given angle (AC)
# must be longer than the altitude from vertex C to side AB, and shorter
# than the other given side (BC).

# 1. Calculate the altitude 'h'.
# h = BC * sin(B) = S * sin(30)
# Since sin(30 degrees) = 0.5, h = S * 0.5.
h = S * 0.5

# 2. State the condition for AC.
# The condition is h < AC < BC.
# Substituting the values, we get the inequality for AC.
print(f"The problem is defined for a triangle with side BC = {S} and angle B = 30 degrees.")
print("For two possible triangles to exist, the length of side AC must satisfy the inequality:")
print(f"BC * sin(30) < AC < BC")
print(f"{S} * 0.5 < AC < {S}")
print(f"{h} < AC < {S}\n")

# 3. Count the number of integers for AC in this range.
# The lower bound (exclusive) for AC is h.
# The upper bound (exclusive) for AC is S.

# The smallest integer AC can be is the first integer greater than h.
min_ac = math.floor(h) + 1

# The largest integer AC can be is the last integer less than S.
max_ac = S - 1

print(f"The integer values for AC must be in the range from {min_ac} to {max_ac}.")

# 4. Calculate the total number of integer values.
# The number of integers in an inclusive range [min, max] is max - min + 1.
count = max_ac - min_ac + 1

print("\nThe final equation to find the number of integer values is:")
print(f"Count = max_ac - min_ac + 1")
print(f"Count = {max_ac} - {min_ac} + 1")
print(f"The total number of integer values for AC is: {count}")

print(f"\n<<< {count} >>>")
