    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Point Groups of Order 2:** In two dimensions, a point group of order 2 can be one of two types:\n    *   **2 (C₂):** A 180-degree rotational symmetry.\n    *   **m (Cₛ):** A reflectional symmetry across a line.\n\n2.  **List all 17 Wallpaper Groups:** I will create a data structure containing all 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point groups. The \"point group of a space group\" is found by considering the symmetry operations while ignoring the translational components. For example, a glide reflection becomes a simple reflection in the point group.\n\n3.  **Filter and Count:** I will then filter this list to find only those groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n\n4.  **Display the Result:** Finally, I will print the names of the identified groups and show the final count by summing them up.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups.
