    "This is a classic geography riddle. Here is my plan to solve it:\n1.  I will first break down the user's question into key constraints.\n    *   It's an island town.\n    *   It is extremely remote, specified as \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\".\n    *   The town is located on a bay.\n    *   This bay was created by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town and the bay/caldera share the same name.\n2.  I will evaluate famous remote islands against these constraints. The top candidates for extreme remoteness are usually Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Tristan da Cunha, and the Pitcairn Islands.\n3.  Tristan da Cunha's settlement is \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas\" and Pitcairn's is \"Adamstown\". Neither name suggests a link to a volcanic feature.\n4.  Easter Island's main town is \"Hanga Roa\". It sits on a bay, also named \"Hanga Roa\". Easter Island is a volcanic island, and its entire geography, including its bays, is the result of volcanic activity from its three main volcanoes (Terevaka, Poike, and Rano Kau). The massive Rano Kau caldera is a dominant feature that shapes the southwestern part of the island where the town is.\n5.  Thus, Hanga Roa fits all the clues: it's a town on a bay of the same name, on an extremely remote volcanic island shaped by its calderas.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes a unique geographical location.\n# Clues analysis:\n# 1. Island town, very remote (>500km from other inhabited islands): Points to places like Easter Island.\n# 2. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera: The location is on a volcanic island.\n# 3. Shares the town's name: The town, bay, and/or caldera have the same name.\n\n# Easter Island's capital is Hanga Roa.\n# It is located on a bay named Hanga Roa Bay.\n# Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.\n# The island itself is of volcanic origin, and its landscape, including the bay, was formed by volcanic processes and prominent calderas like Rano Kau.\n# This matches all the clues.\n\nthe_island_town = \"Hanga Roa\"\nprint(the_island_town)\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
