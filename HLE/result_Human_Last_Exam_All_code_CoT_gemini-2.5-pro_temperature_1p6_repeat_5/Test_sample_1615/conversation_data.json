    "This problem can be solved using a fundamental principle of graph coloring theory. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  First, I will establish the relationship between the number of vertices in a graph and its chromatic number (the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring).\n2.  A key theorem states that a graph with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$ if and only if it is a complete graph ($K_n$).\n3.  The problem specifies that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is *not* a complete graph. Based on the theorem, this means its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n4.  This gives an upper bound for the chromatic number: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n5.  To show that this is the maximum possible value, I will provide an example of a graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete but requires $n-1 = 12344$ colors. A graph consisting of a complete subgraph $K_{12344}$ and a single isolated vertex satisfies these conditions.\n6.  Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$. I will write a Python script to state this reasoning and compute the final value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # According to graph theory, a graph with n vertices requires n colors\n    # for a proper vertex coloring if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\n    # In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n    # The problem states that the graph G is NOT a complete graph.\n    # This implies that its chromatic number, chi(G), must be less than the number of vertices.\n    # So, chi(G) < 12345.\n    \n    # The maximum integer value less than 12345 is 12344.\n    # This means the maximum possible number of colors is at most 12344.\n    max_colors_upper_bound = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # We must confirm if this maximum is actually achievable.\n    # We can construct a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and\n    # requires 12344 colors. For example, consider a graph made of two components:\n    # 1. A complete graph K_12344 (12344 vertices, all connected to each other).\n    # 2. A single isolated vertex.\n    # This graph has 12345 vertices in total and is not complete (due to the isolated vertex).\n    # The K_12344 component requires 12344 colors. The isolated vertex can reuse any of these colors.\n    # Thus, the chromatic number of this graph is 12344.\n    \n    # Since the chromatic number cannot be greater than 12344, and we have found a\n    # graph for which it is exactly 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n    \n    final_answer = max_colors_upper_bound\n\n    print(\"The number of vertices is n = {}.\".format(num_vertices))\n    print(\"A graph requires n colors if and only if it is a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Since the graph is not complete, the number of colors must be less than n.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors is therefore n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The equation is: {} - 1 = {}\".format(num_vertices, final_answer))\n\nsolve_max_colors()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
