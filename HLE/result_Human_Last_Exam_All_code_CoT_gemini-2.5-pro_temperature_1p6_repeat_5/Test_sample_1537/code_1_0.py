    This function explains and provides the solution to the posed topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
    of an open subset of a specific type of topological group G.

    The key steps in solving this are:
    1.  Analyze the properties of G. The given property does not force G to be
        locally connected.
    2.  Construct a group G that satisfies the conditions but is not locally connected.
        An example is the vector space of real sequences with finite support,
        indexed by a set of size c (the cardinality of the continuum),
        with the L1-norm topology.
    3.  In this non-locally connected group, construct an open set V that has a
        large number of non-open components. This can be done by taking a
        disjoint union of "bad" neighborhoods around c distinct points.
    4.  This construction yields c non-open components.
    5.  The number of components cannot exceed the cardinality of the group, which is c.

    Therefore, the largest possible number is c, the cardinality of the continuum.

    # The symbol 'c' is used for the cardinality of the continuum.
    # It represents a transfinite number, the size of the set of real numbers.
    # We will represent it as a string.
    # There is no numerical equation to compute; the answer is derived from
    # a mathematical proof.
    answer = 'c (the cardinality of the continuum)'
