# The problem asks for the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points
# of the Stone-Cech extension F of a continuous function f from R to R.
# The fixed points must be in the Stone-Cech remainder, which is X* = beta(R) \ R.
# This is a theoretical question from point-set topology. The Python code below
# will print the final answer after explaining the reasoning.

# Step 1: Consider some simple cases to understand the possibilities.
# The number of fixed points depends on the choice of the function f.
#
# - Case f(x) = -x: The only fixed point in R is f(0) = 0.
#   It can be shown that its extension F has no fixed points in the remainder X*.
#   So, the number of fixed points can be 0.
#
# - Case f(x) = x + 1: This function has no fixed points in R.
#   It's a known result that for such an affine map, its extension F
#   has exactly two fixed points in X*. These fixed points correspond
#   intuitively to the "points at +infinity and -infinity".
#
# From these examples, we know the minimum non-zero number is at most 2.
# We now investigate if the number can be 1.

# Step 2: Construct a function f(x) that yields exactly one fixed point.
# The strategy is to define a function with different behaviors at the
# positive and negative ends of the real line.
#
# Consider the following continuous function:
# f(x) = x + 1,  if x >= 0
# f(x) = 1,      if x < 0
# This function is continuous because at x=0, both pieces of the definition
# agree (f(0) = 1).

# Step 3: Analyze the fixed points for the extension F of this new function.
# The remainder X* can be thought of as having two "ends":
# X*_+ (associated with limits as x -> +infinity) and
# X*_- (associated with limits as x -> -infinity).
#
# - Behavior at -infinity: As x -> -infinity, our function f(x) approaches 1.
#   The extension F will map any point p in X*_- to this limit.
#   So, F(p) = 1 for all p in X*_.
#   Since 1 is a real number, it is not in the remainder X*.
#   Therefore, there are no fixed points in X*_.
#
# - Behavior at +infinity: For any point p in X*_+, the value F(p) is determined
#   by the behavior of f(x) for large positive x. For x >= 0, f(x) = x + 1.
#   The map g(x) = x + 1 on the domain [0, infinity) "pushes" points towards
#   infinity (since g(x) > x). It is a standard result in the theory of
#   Stone-Cech compactifications that such a map's extension to the remainder
#   of [0, infinity) must have a fixed point. The structure of the space
#   [0, infinity) (having only one "end") leads to a single fixed point.

# Step 4: Conclusion
# For the function we constructed, the analysis shows:
# - Number of fixed points in X*_+ is 1.
# - Number of fixed points in X*_- is 0.
# The total number of fixed points in the remainder X* is 1 + 0 = 1.
#
# This demonstrates that it is possible to have exactly one fixed point.
# Since the number must be a non-zero integer, the smallest possible value is 1.
