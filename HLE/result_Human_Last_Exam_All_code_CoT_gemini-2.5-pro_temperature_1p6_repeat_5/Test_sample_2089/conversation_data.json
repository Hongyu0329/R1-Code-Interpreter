    "My plan is to first identify the film based on the specific scene described by the user. The scene where a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is from the 2006 Oscar-nominated film *Babel*.\n\nIn the film, the Moroccan guide Hassan, who was gifted the rifle at the center of the plot, attempts to flee from the police. As he gets on a bus, he says \"Shukran\" (Arabic for \"Thank you\") to the driver. This action draws the attention of the police, who spot him and subsequently shoot him.\n\nI will use a simple Python script to print the name of the film.\n\n```python\n# Identify the film based on the described scene.\n# The scene is from the movie \"Babel\" (2006).\n# A character, Hassan, says \"Shukran\" (\"Thank you\") as he boards a bus,\n# which leads to him being spotted by police and sealing his fate.\nfilm_title = \"Babel\"\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The film in which a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is: {film_title}\")\n```\n<<<Babel>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
