    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (photons), which obey Bose-Einstein statistics. The core principle, formalized by theorems in large deviation theory like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, is that the equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the macroscopic configuration that has the maximum number of associated microscopic states, i.e., the state of maximum entropy, subject to physical constraints.\n\nHere is the plan to derive these values:\n1.  **Start with the Entropy Formula:** For a system of bosons, the entropy `S` is related to the number of ways `W` to distribute `n_i` particles into `g_i` degenerate states for each energy level `ε_i`. Using Stirling's approximation, the entropy is given by `S/k_B ≈ Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i)ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - g_i ln(g_i) ]`.\n2.  **Apply Constraints:** We need to maximize this entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total average energy `U = Σ_i n_i ε_i`. For photons, the total number of particles is not conserved, so we do not have a constraint on `N = Σ_i n_i`.\n3.  **Use Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize `S` using the method of Lagrange multipliers, introducing a multiplier `β` for the energy constraint.\n4.  **Derive Equilibrium Values:** Solving this optimization problem yields the equilibrium distribution for the number of photons `<n_i>` at each energy level. This is the Bose-Einstein distribution.\n5.  **Calculate Mean Energy and Entropy:** With the equilibrium `<n_i>` known, we can formulate the expressions for the total mean energy `<U>` and the total entropy `S`.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the step-by-step derivation and the final formulas for these equilibrium values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for a photon gas based on\n    the principle of maximum entropy from statistical mechanics, which is\n    rigorously described by large deviation theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Equilibrium Values for Bose-Einstein Gas (Photons) ###\")\n    print(\"\\n--- 1.
