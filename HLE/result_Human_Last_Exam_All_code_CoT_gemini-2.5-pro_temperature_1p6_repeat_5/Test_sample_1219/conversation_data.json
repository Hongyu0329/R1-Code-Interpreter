    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with high precision because 10^100 is an extremely large number.\n\n### My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Handle Periodicity**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. So, the first step is to calculate the value of `10^100 mod π`.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: `10^100` is a number with 101 digits. Standard floating-point arithmetic is not sufficient. I will use Python's `decimal` library, which is designed for high-precision calculations.\n3.  **High-Precision π**: The calculation requires a value of π with a precision significantly higher than the number of digits in `10^100`. I will use a pre-computed value of π with sufficient digits.\n4.  **Calculate tan(y)**: The `decimal` library does not have a built-in tangent function. I will implement `tan(y)` by calculating `sin(y) / cos(y)` using their Taylor series expansions. This allows for computing the value to any desired precision.\n5.  **Normalize the Argument**: Taylor series converge faster and are more numerically stable for smaller inputs. The value `y = 10^100 mod π` will be in the range `[0, π)`. I will normalize it to the range `(-π/2, π/2]` to ensure the stability of the calculation.\n6.  **Extract and Print**: After computing the final value, I will print it in the format `tan(10**100) = <value>` and then extract and display the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef get_pi(prec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns pi as a decimal.Decimal object with the specified precision.\n    A long string of pi is used to ensure high precision.\n    \"\"\"\n    pi_str = \"3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214808651328230664709384460955058223172535940812848111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196\"\n    return decimal.Decimal(pi_str[:prec+2])\n\ndef sin_taylor(x, prec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes sin(x) using the Taylor series expansion with a given precision.\n    \"\"\"\n    with decimal.localcontext() as ctx:\n        ctx.prec = prec\n        i, last_sum, s = 1, 0, x\n        term = x\n        while s != last_sum:\n            last_sum = s\n            i += 2\n            term *= -x * x / (i * (i - 1))\n            s += term\n    return s\n\ndef cos_taylor(x, prec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes cos(x) using the Taylor series expansion with a given precision.\n    \"\"\"\n    with decimal.localcontext() as ctx:\n        ctx.prec = prec\n        i, last_sum, s = 0, 0, decimal.Decimal(1)\n        term = decimal.Decimal(1)\n        while s != last_sum:\n            last_sum = s\n            i += 2\n            term *= -x * x / (i * (i - 1))\n            s += term\n    return s\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to calculate tan(10^100) and find the first 3 digits after the comma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
