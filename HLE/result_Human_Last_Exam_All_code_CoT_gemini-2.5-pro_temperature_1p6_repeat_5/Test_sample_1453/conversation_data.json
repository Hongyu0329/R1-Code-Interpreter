    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we need to identify its coiled-coil pattern and analyze the amino acids that form the hydrophobic core. The oligomeric state is primarily dictated by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing efficiency of residues at specific positions within a repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** The residues at the `a` and `d` positions of the heptad repeat are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form the core of the coiled-coil. I will write a Python script to test all 7 possible alignments (frames) of the heptad repeat against the given sequence.\n2.  **Score Each Frame:** For each frame, the script will identify the residues at the `a` and `d` positions and calculate a total hydrophobicity score for this core. The frame with the highest score is the most likely correct alignment.\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the best frame is identified, we will analyze the specific amino acids found at the `a` and `d` positions. There are well-established rules based on packing efficiency:\n    *   **Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`**: Strongly promotes **trimers**.\n    *   **Leucine (L) at `a` and Isoleucine (I) at `d`**: Promotes **dimers**.\n    *   **Alanine (A) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`**: A classic \"leucine zipper\" pattern that promotes **dimers**.\n4.  **Predict the Oligomeric State:** Based on the pattern found, the script will predict the final oligomeric state and explain the reasoning.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale for scoring\n    hydrophobicity = { 'A': 1.8, 'C': 2.5, 'D': -3.5, 'E': -3.5, 'F': 2.8,\n                       'G': -0.4, 'H': -3.2, 'I': 4.5, 'K': -3.9, 'L': 3.8,\n                       'M': 1.9, 'N': -3.5, 'P': -1.6, 'Q': -3.5, 'R': -4.5,\n                       'S': -0.8, 'T': -0.7, 'V': 4.2, 'W': -0.9, 'Y': -1.3 }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the most likely heptad repeat ('abcdefg') alignment.\")\n    print(\"This is done by finding the frame that maximizes the hydrophobicity of the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\\n\")\n\n    best_offset = -1\n    max_score = -sys.maxsize\n    best_a = []\n    best_d = []\n    \n    # Test all 7 possible offsets for the heptad repeat\n    for offset in range(7):\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        current_score = 0.0\n        \n        for i, aa in enumerate(sequence):\n            # register 'a' is index 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'g' is 6\n            register_index = (i + offset) % 7\n            \n            if register_index == 0:  # 'a' position\n                a_residues.append(aa)\n                current_score += hydrophobicity.get(aa, 0)\n            elif register_index == 3:  # 'd' position\n                d_residues.append(aa)\n                current_score += hydrophobicity.get(aa, 0)\n        \n        if current_score > max_score:\n            max_score = current_score\n            best_offset = offset\n            best_a = a_residues\n            best_d = d_residues\n            \n    heptad_map = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']\n    start_register = heptad_map[(0 + best_offset) % 7]\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Best alignment found.\")\n    print(f\"The best alignment starts with the first residue ('G') in the '{start_register}' position.\")\n    print(f\"This alignment yields a maximum core hydrophobicity score of {max_score:.1f}.\")\n    print(\"The identified core residues are:\")\n    print(f\"  'a' positions: {best_a}\")\n    print(f\"  'd' positions: {best_d}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze the pattern and predict\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing core composition to predict oligomeric state.\")\n    oligomeric_state = \"Unknown\"\n    reasoning = \"The pattern does not match common motifs.\"\n\n    # Convert to sets for easier comparison, ignoring potential outliers at ends\n    a_set = set(best_a[:4])\n    d_set = set(best_d[:4])\n    \n    if a_set == {'L'} and d_set == {'I'}:\n        oligomeric_state = 2\n        reasoning = (\"This pattern, with Leucine (L) at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' positions, \"\n                     \"promotes a dimeric coiled-coil.
