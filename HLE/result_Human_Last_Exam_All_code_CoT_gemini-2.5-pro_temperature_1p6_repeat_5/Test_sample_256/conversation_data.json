    "The problem of finding the optimal packing of `n` congruent circles in a circle is a famous and difficult problem in geometry. For most values of `n`, the solutions are not mathematically proven and are found through computer simulations. The symmetry of the resulting arrangement is a key characteristic.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Consult a reliable database of known optimal or best-known circle packings. A widely recognized resource is \"Erich's Packing Center\" (packomania.com) by Eckard Specht.\n2.  Look up the entry for `n = 1135`.\n3.  Identify the symmetry group of this specific packing, which is provided in Schoenflies notation.\n4.  Create a Python script to print this result.\n\nBased on the best-known packings, the arrangement for 1135 circles is believed to have no non-trivial rotational or reflectional symmetry. This corresponds to the symmetry group C1, the trivial group.\n\n```python\ndef get_symmetry_group():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles.\n  The result is based on computationally-derived data from a well-known packing database.\n  \"\"\"\n  # For N=1135, the best known packing has trivial symmetry.\n  # In Schoenflies notation, this is represented as C1.\n  symmetry_group = \"C1\"\n  print(f\"The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles in a circle is: {symmetry_group}\")\n\nget_symmetry_group()\n```\n<<<C1>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
