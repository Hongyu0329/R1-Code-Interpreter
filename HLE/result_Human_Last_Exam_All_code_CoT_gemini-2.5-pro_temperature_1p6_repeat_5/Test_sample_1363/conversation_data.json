    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the answer.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the question and the available choices.\n2.  Embed the logical reasoning directly into the script as a documented explanation. The reasoning compares the fundamental techniques of the \"swing\" dances (like Waltz and Foxtrot) with the unique technique of the European Tango.\n3.  The script will analyze this reasoning to identify the correct choice where overturning a turn violates the core technique.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the fundamental techniques of standard ballroom dances\n    to answer a specific question about turning mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # Technical Analysis:\n    # In dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique is based on 'swing', 'sway', 'rise and fall',\n    # and continuous, flowing movement. This \"swing\" technique allows for momentum to be carried through figures,\n    # which makes it possible, and often desirable in choreography, to 'overturn' a turn (i.e., rotate more than the\n    # textbook amount).\n    #\n    # The European Tango, however, is unique. Its technique is characterized by:\n    # 1. No Rise and Fall: The dance is kept on a level plane.\n    # 2. No Sway: Body inclination is not used in the same way as swing dances.\n    # 3. Staccato Action: Movements are sharp and clipped, not flowing.\n    # 4. Specific Footwork: Turns are executed with precise foot placements and swivels, often with feet closing,\n    #    rather than a continuous swing.\n    #\n    # Given these principles, attempting to add extra rotation to a standard Tango Reverse Turn would require\n    # introducing swing and continuous momentum, which are fundamentally against the dance's core technique.\n    # Therefore, overturning the turn is not possible without disregarding the defining technique of Tango.\n\n    correct_answer = 'C'\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on technical analysis of the standard ballroom dances:\")\n    print(\"The European Tango's staccato nature and lack of swing and sway make it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating its core technique.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is therefore '{correct_answer}'.\")\n\nsolve_dance_technique_question()\n\n# Final Answer\nsys.stdout.write(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
