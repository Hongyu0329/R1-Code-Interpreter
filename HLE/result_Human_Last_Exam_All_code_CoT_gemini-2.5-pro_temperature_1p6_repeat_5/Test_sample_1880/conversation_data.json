    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. If the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The formula for the discriminant of a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$ is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: The reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides more information. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, a standard resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. If this cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is either $S_4$ or $A_4$. If it's reducible, the group is a smaller subgroup like $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between Final Candidates**: Based on the results from the previous steps, we will have a few candidate groups. The final step involves a specific test to distinguish between them. For instance, if the candidates are the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), the test is to check if the original polynomial $P(x)$ becomes reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below to calculate the values and arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef solve_cubic_rational_roots(c, b, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds integer roots of a monic cubic y^3 + ay^2 + by + c = 0.\n    Uses the Rational Root Theorem on the constant term c.\n    \"\"\"\n    if c == 0:\n        return [0]\n    \n    roots = []\n    # Test divisors of the constant term c\n    for r in range(1, abs(c) + 1):\n        if c % r == 0:\n            # Test positive divisor\n            if r**3 + a * r**2 + b * r + c == 0:\n                roots.append(r)\n            # Test negative divisor\n            neg_r = -r\n            if neg_r**3 + a * neg_r**2 + b * neg_r + c == 0:\n                roots.append(neg_r)\n    return list(set(roots))\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial P(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check Irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Checking irreducibility over Q.\")\n    prime = 2\n    print(f\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = {prime}.\")\n    print(\"The polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14 is irreducible because:\")\n    print(f\"  - {prime} does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(f\"  - {prime} divides the other coefficients 0, 0, 8, 14.\")\n    print(f\"  - {prime}^2 = 4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"This implies the Galois group G is a transitive subgroup of S_4.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the discriminant Δ.\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the discriminant is Δ = -27 * p^4 + 256 * q^3.\")\n    p4 = p**4\n    q3 = q**3\n    discriminant = -27 * p4 + 256 * q3\n    print(f\"Substituting p = {p} and q = {q}:\")\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * ({p}^4) + 256 * ({q}^3)\")\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * {p4} + 256 * {q3}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {-27 * p4} + {256 * q3} = {discriminant}\")\n\n    if is_perfect_square(discriminant):\n        print(f\"Δ = {discriminant} is a perfect square, so G is a subgroup of A_4.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Δ = {discriminant} is not a perfect square, so G is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups are S_4, D_4, or C_4.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\n    print(\"Step 3: Forming the resolvent cubic R(y).\")\n    print(\"The formula for the resolvent cubic is R(y) = y^3 - 4*q*y - p^2.\")\n    res_b = -4 * q\n    res_c = -(p**2)\n    print(f\"Substituting p = {p} and q = {q}:\")\n    print(f\"R(y) = y^3 - 4*({q})*y - ({p}^2)\")\n    print(f\"R(y) = y^3 + {res_b}y + {res_c}\")\n\n    rational_roots = solve_cubic_rational_roots(res_c, res_b, 0)\n    \n    if not rational_roots:\n        print(\"R(y) is irreducible over Q, so G would be S_4 or A_4.\")\n        order = 24 if not is_perfect_square(discriminant) else 12\n    else:\n        print(f\"R(y) is reducible over Q with rational root y = {rational_roots[0]}.\")\n        print(\"This eliminates S_4 and A_4.
