    # Step 1: Define problem constants as Fractions, simulating the 'frac' type.
    # Given values:
    # v = 5 m/s, d = 300 m, a = 60 degrees. Assume g = 9.8 m/s^2.
    distance = Fraction(300)
    lion_v = Fraction(5)
    g = Fraction(98, 10)  # g = 9.8

    # The Wuxing architecture lacks trig functions. We must use a rational
    # approximation for sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2 ~= 0.866.
    # We use a precise enough fraction to get an accurate result.
    sin_60 = Fraction(866, 1000)

    # From the projectile motion equations, we get the quadratic:
    # A*u^2 + B*u + C = 0
    # where a=60 degrees, v=5, d=300, g=9.8

    # Step 2: Calculate the coefficients A, B, and C as Fractions.
    # A = sin(2*a) = sin(120) = sin(60)
    A = sin_60
    # B = 2 * v * sin(a)
    B = 2 * lion_v * sin_60
    # C = -d * g
    C = -1 * distance * g

    # Step 3: Solve for 'u' using Newton's method.
    # The standard quadratic formula is disallowed due to its use of sqrt.
    # f(u) = A*u^2 + B*u + C
    # f'(u) = 2*A*u + B
    # u_new = u_old - f(u) / f'(u)

    # Make an initial guess for u. A rough physical estimate suggests u ~ 50-60 m/s.
    u = Fraction(50)

            break  # Avoid division by zero
        u = u - f_u / df_u

    # Step 4: Calculate memory usage 'z'.
    # A 'frac' variable uses 6D. We need to store 8 main variables
    # (g, distance, lion_v, sin_60, A, B, C, u).
