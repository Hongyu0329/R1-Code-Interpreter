# The number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m] is equivalent to the
# number of order-preserving maps from [n] to [m].
# This is a classic combinatorial problem whose solution is given by the
# binomial coefficient C(m + n + 1, n + 1).

k = m + n + 1
r = n + 1

# Calculate the binomial coefficient
result = math.comb(k, r)

# Print the final result including the formula with the numbers substituted.
