def solve_scattering_problem():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The core insight is that the property of being "nontrivially coupled" is equivalent
    for the potential V(r), the S-matrix S(E), and the Jost matrix F(E).
    Let n.t.c. be an abbreviation for "nontrivially coupled".

    The analysis leads to the following logical equivalences:
    V(r) is n.t.c. <==> S(E) is n.t.c.
    S(E) is n.t.c. <==> F(E) is n.t.c.
    Therefore: V(r) n.t.c. <==> S(E) n.t.c. <==> F(E) n.t.c.

    We now evaluate each statement based on these equivalences:

    1. S(E) n.t.c. ==> V(r) n.t.c.
       This is true by the equivalence.

    2. S(E) diagonal ==> V(r) diagonal
       "Diagonal" means "not nontrivially coupled". So this statement is
       S(E) not n.t.c. ==> V(r) not n.t.c. This is true by the equivalence.

    3. V(r) n.t.c. ==> F(E) n.t.c.
       This is true by the equivalence.

    4. F(E) n.t.c. ==> S(E) n.t.c.
       This is true by the equivalence.

    5. EXISTS V(r) n.t.c. WITH F(E) diagonal
       This means "V(r) is n.t.c." AND "F(E) is not n.t.c.", which contradicts
       the established equivalence. This statement is false.

    The correct statements are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
