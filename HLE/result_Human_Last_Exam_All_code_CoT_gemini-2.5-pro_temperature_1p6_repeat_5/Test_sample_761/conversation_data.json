    "My plan is to provide a Python script that, when executed, will print a detailed textual explanation answering your question. This approach directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a code-based solution to the task.\n\nThe script will methodically compare polysaccharides and polynucleotides based on three key structural features:\n1.  **Monomer Units:** What are the repeating building blocks of each polymer?\n2.  **Chemical Linkages:** What type of covalent bond joins the monomers together?\n3.  **Atomic Composition & Backbone:** What atoms are present, and what is the structure of the polymer's backbone?\n\nBy printing the comparison of these features, the script will demonstrate that the two molecules are fundamentally different in structure.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints an explanation of why polynucleotides are not,\n    structurally, polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"No, homopolynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.\")\n    print(\"They are fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules. Here's a structural comparison:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1. Monomer (Repeating Unit):\")\n    print(\"   - Polysaccharide Monomer: Monosaccharide (e.g., glucose). This is a simple sugar molecule.\")\n    print(\"   - Homopolynucleotide Monomer: Nucleotide. This is a more complex unit made of three parts: a sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\")\n    print(\"   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"2. Linkage (Bond between Monomers):\")\n    print(\"   - Polysaccharides are linked by: Glycosidic Bonds, which form between the hydroxyl groups of two monosaccharides.\")\n    print(\"   - Homopolynucleotides are linked by: Phosphodiester Bonds, which form a bridge between the 5' carbon of one sugar and the 3' carbon of the next sugar via a phosphate group.\")\n    print(\"   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    print(\"3. Backbone Composition:\")\n    print(\"   - Polysaccharide Backbone: Composed of a chain of sugar units (carbon and oxygen). The primary atoms are Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\")\n    print(\"   - Homopolynucleotide Backbone: Composed of an alternating sequence of sugar and phosphate groups. This introduces Phosphorus (P) into the backbone. The molecule also contains Nitrogen (N) in its bases.\")\n    print(\"   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Conclusion: While polynucleotides do contain a sugar component, their complex three-part monomer, phosphodiester linkages, and the presence of phosphorus and nitrogen make them structurally distinct from polysaccharides.\")\n\n# Execute the explanation function\nexplain_structural_differences()\n```\n<<<No, homopolynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of macromolecules.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides? or, to be more clear: Are homopolynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
