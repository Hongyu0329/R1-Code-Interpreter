    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to analyze the system of equations at its steady state, which is reached as time $t$ approaches infinity. In the steady state, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, so their time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\nLet $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ denote the steady-state probability of being in state $i$. Setting the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero, we transform the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_i$:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\implies 0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3} \\implies 0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n(Note: The second equation from the problem description is a linear combination of the others in steady state and is redundant).\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be 1 due to the nature of probabilities:\n4.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nMy plan is to solve this system of linear equations:\nFirst, I will use equations (1), (2), and (3) to express probabilities $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ as functions of $p_1$.\n*   From equation (3), $0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3$, which simplifies to $p_2 = p_3$.\n*   From equation (2), $0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 = 0.4 p_2$, which simplifies to $p_1 = p_2$.\n*   Therefore, we find that $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n*   From equation (1), $0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1$, which gives $p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\n\nNext, I will substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (4):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) = 1$\n\nFrom this, we can find an expression for $p_1$, and then for $p_0$. The final required quantity is the sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1\\right) + p_1 = p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)$\n\nBy combining the expressions, we get the final formula for $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3}$\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation with the numerical values and the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given transition rates\nl01 = 0.019\nl10 = 0.65\nl12 = 0.4\nl21 = 0.392\nl23 = 0.008\nl31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +infinity), the derivatives are zero,\n# which allows us to find the steady-state probabilities p_i.\n# As derived in the explanation:\n# p1 = p2 = p3\n# p0 = (l10/l01) * p1\n#\n# Using the normalization condition p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1, we get:\n# p1 * (l10/l01 + 3) = 1\n#\n# The required sum is p0 + p1, which is derived as:\n# p0 + p1 = (l10/l01 + 1) / (l10/l01 + 3)\n\n# Calculate the ratio for convenience\nratio = l10 / l01\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = (ratio + 1) / (ratio + 3)\n\n# Output the final equation with all numbers and the result, as requested.\nprint(f\"P_0(+inf) + P_1(+inf) = ({l10}/{l01} + 1) / ({l10}/{l01} + 3) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462529149021953>>>"
