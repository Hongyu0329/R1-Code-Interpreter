# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G of type E_8
# is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, W(E_8).
# This is a known result from the mathematical literature (e.g., R.W. Carter's
# paper "Conjugacy Classes in the Weyl Group", 1972).

# The number of conjugacy classes for W(E_8) is a fixed constant.
num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112

# The problem asks for this exact number.
# The equation is: Number of tori = 112
