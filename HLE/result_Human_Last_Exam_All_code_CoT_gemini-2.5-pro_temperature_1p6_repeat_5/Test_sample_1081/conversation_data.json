    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow a clear plan based on established mathematical theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question**: In the context of algebraic groups, \"the number of tori\" typically refers to the number of conjugacy classes of these tori under the action of the rational points of the group, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n2.  **Apply a Key Theorem**: I will use a fundamental result from the theory of reductive groups over finite fields. A theorem by Springer and Steinberg establishes a direct correspondence between the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori and the conjugacy classes of the group's Weyl group, $W$.\n3.  **Identify the Weyl Group**: For a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a specific finite group whose structure depends only on the $E_8$ root system. Therefore, the number of its conjugacy classes is a fixed integer, independent of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. It is also a fact that any algebraic group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is split, which simplifies the situation and validates the direct application of the theorem.\n4.  **State the Known Result**: The number of conjugacy classes for $W(E_8)$ is a well-known result in group theory, found in reference texts such as R.W. Carter's \"Finite Groups of Lie Type\".\n5.  **Provide the Code**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that stores this known mathematical constant and prints it as the solution.\n\nThe final equation is straightforward:\nNumber of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori = Number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$\n\nThe following code provides the value for the right-hand side of this equation.\n\n```python\n# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G of type E_8\n# is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, W(E_8).\n# This is a known result from the mathematical literature (e.g., R.W. Carter's\n# paper \"Conjugacy Classes in the Weyl Group\", 1972).\n\n# The number of conjugacy classes for W(E_8) is a fixed constant.\nnum_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n# The problem asks for this exact number.\n# The equation is: Number of tori = 112\nprint(num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8)\n```\n<<<112>>>"
