    # Step 1: Define the properties of the coordinate system.

    # This angle describes the position on a circular cross-section of the torus.

    period = "2*pi radians"

        'Hermite Polynomials': 'Represents functions on the infinite interval (-inf, inf), used in quantum harmonic oscillators.'

    # Step 3: Match the coordinate property to the correct technique.
    # Since the poloidal coordinate is periodic, the Fourier series is the natural and standard choice.
    # The expansion of a function f(theta) where theta is the poloidal angle would look like:
    # f(theta) = sum over m [ A_m * cos(m*theta) + B_m * sin(m*theta) ]
    # Each term (cos and sin) has the correct periodicity.

    1. A toroidal system's geometry includes a 'poloidal' direction, which is an angular coordinate describing the position on a cross-section.
    
    2. By its nature, this angle is periodic. After a full circle (a period of {period}), the position repeats.
    
    3. The question asks for a spectral series expansion, which means representing a function as a sum of basis functions. For a periodic variable, the most suitable basis functions are sines and cosines.
    
    4. The {series_info[correct_choice_name].lower()}, is the technique that accomplishes this.
    
    5. Therefore, the Fourier series is the standard expansion technique adapted for poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.
