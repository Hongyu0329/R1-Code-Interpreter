    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: I will first find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. The structure of the character group depends on this factorization. For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it is a product of non-principal characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime factor $p_i$.\n2.  **Analyze the Order**: The order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. This lcm must be 6.\n3.  **Count Component Characters**: This implies that the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are 2, 3, and 6. I will find the number of characters for each of these orders modulo each prime factor $p_i$. The number of characters of order $k>1$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n4.  **Combine and Calculate**: I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of combinations of component characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ that satisfy the lcm condition.\n    *   First, calculate the total number of tuples where each character $\\chi_i$ has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   Then, subtract the tuples where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., the lcm is 2 or 3).\n    *   The lcm is 2 only if all component characters have order 2.\n    *   The lcm is 3 only if all component characters have order 3.\n5.  **Final Output**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the step-by-step reasoning along with the final equation and its result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = prime_factors(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the conductor d\n    d_factors = prime_factors(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    is_square_free = all(v == 1 for v in d_factors.values())\n    num_prime_factors = len(primes)\n    \n    # Check problem constraints\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(f\"The conductor d={d} is not square-free.
