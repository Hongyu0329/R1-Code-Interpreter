    "My plan is to solve this problem by systematically enumerating all possible minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot and then determining how many of them are unique under the operations of translation and rotation.\n\n1.  **Represent Grid Diagrams:** A 3x3 grid diagram can be mathematically represented by a pair of permutations, (σ, τ), of the set {1, 2, 3}. For the diagram to represent a single, connected knot, the permutation product σ⁻¹τ must be a 3-cycle.\n\n2.  **Identify Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams:** There are two 3-cycles in the permutation group S₃. One corresponds to the left-hand trefoil and the other to the right-hand trefoil. Let's fix one, say `g = (2, 3, 1)`, as the generator for the left-hand trefoil. All grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are then of the form (σ, σg), where σ can be any of the 6 permutations in S₃. This gives a total of 6 grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n\n3.  **Define Symmetries:** The problem states that diagrams are equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by translation or rotation of the grid. These physical operations correspond to specific algebraic transformations on the permutation pairs (σ, τ).\n    *   **Translation:** A cyclic shift of the grid's rows or columns.\n    *   **Rotation:** A 90-degree rotation of the grid.\n\n4.  **Count Unique Diagrams (Orbits):** I will write a Python script to perform these steps. The script will:\n    *   Generate all 6 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n    *   Start with one diagram and apply all possible translations to find all diagrams in its \"translation orbit\" (the set of diagrams connected by translations).\n    *   If there are any diagrams left over, it means translations partition the 6 diagrams into multiple sets.\n    *   Finally, apply the rotation operation to a diagram from the first set. If the result is a diagram in a different set, it proves that rotation connects these sets, meaning all 6 diagrams belong to a single equivalence class under the full group of symmetries.\n    *   The number of unique diagrams is the number of such equivalence classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints out the steps of the calculation to arrive at the final number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_mult(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the product of two permutations p1 * p2.\n    Permutations are 1-indexed tuples, e.g., (2, 3, 1) means 1->2, 2->3, 3->1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (p1[p2[0]-1], p1[p2[1]-1], p1[p2[2]-1])\n\ndef perm_inv(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv = [0, 0, 0]\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inv[val-1] = i + 1\n    return tuple(inv)\n\ndef format_diagram(d):\n    \"\"\"Converts a diagram tuple to a readable string.\"\"\"\n    # Using one-line representation for sigma and tau for clarity\n    s_str = \"\".join(map(str, d[0]))\n    t_str = \"\".join(map(str, d[1]))\n    return f\"(sigma={s_str}, tau={t_str})\"\n\ndef run_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the L-trefoil knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Generate all 6 permutations of {1, 2, 3}\n    s3 = list(itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3]))\n\n    # Step 2: Generate the 6 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n    # These are of the form (sigma, sigma * g), where g is a 3-cycle.\n    # We choose one of the two 3-cycles, g = (2,3,1), to represent the L-trefoil.\n    g_L = (2, 3, 1)\n    l_trefoil_diagrams = []\n    for sigma in s3:\n        tau = perm_mult(sigma, g_L)\n        l_trefoil_diagrams.append((sigma, tau))\n\n    print(f\"Found {len(l_trefoil_diagrams)} possible minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define symmetry operations.\n    def rotate(diagram):\n        \"\"\"Applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\"\"\"\n        sigma, tau = diagram\n        rho = (3, 2, 1) # Permutation for reflection: i -> n+1-i\n        sigma_rot = perm_mult(tau, rho)\n        tau_rot = perm_mult(perm_inv(sigma), rho)\n        return (sigma_rot, tau_rot)\n\n    def translate(diagram):\n        \"\"\"Generates all diagrams equivalent by cyclic translations.\"\"\"\n        c = (2, 3, 1)\n        # Horizontal shifts\n        d_h1 = (perm_mult(diagram[0], c), perm_mult(diagram[1], c))\n        d_h2 = (perm_mult(d_h1[0], c), perm_mult(d_h1[1], c))\n        # Vertical shifts\n        d_v1 = (perm_mult(c, diagram[0]), perm_mult(c, diagram[1]))\n        d_v2 = (perm_mult(c, d_v1[0]), perm_mult(c, d_v1[1]))\n        return {diagram, d_h1, d_h2, d_v1, d_v2}\n\n    # Step 4: Group diagrams by equivalence under translation and rotation.\n    orbits = []\n    unclassified = set(l_trefoil_diagrams)\n\n    # Start with D1 = ((1,2,3), (2,3,1))\n    start_node = l_trefoil_diagrams[0]\n    \n    # Find orbit under translation\n    q = [start_node]\n    orbit1 = {start_node}\n    unclassified.remove(start_node)\n    \n    head = 0\n    while head < len(q):\n      curr = q[head]\n      head += 1\n      # Apply translations\n      for next_d in translate(curr):\n        if next_d in unclassified:\n          orbit1.add(next_d)\n          unclassified.remove(next_d)\n          q.append(next_d)\n    \n    print(f\"Under translation, the diagrams split into classes.
