# Based on the derivation, the term 2 * ||alpha||^2 / (pi^2/6 - 1) simplifies to 1.
# The calculation is as follows:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
# Expression = 2 * ( (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1) ) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10**15
# Expression = 1 + 10**15

# Define the components of the final simplified equation
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 + term2

# Print the final equation with its components
# The format specifier ',' adds thousands separators for readability.
