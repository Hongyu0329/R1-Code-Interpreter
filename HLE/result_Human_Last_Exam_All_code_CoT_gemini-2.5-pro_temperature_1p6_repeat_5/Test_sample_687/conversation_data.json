    "To solve this problem, we will determine a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles, denoted as $s(K)$, for the $9_{23}$ knot. We can achieve this by utilizing a powerful result in knot theory called the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Theory:** The Morton-Franks-Williams inequality provides a direct link between a knot's HOMFLY polynomial, $P(K)(a, z)$, and its minimum number of Seifert circles, $s(K)$. The inequality is stated as:\n    $span_z(P(K)) \\le 2 \\cdot (s(K) - 1)$\n    where $span_z(P(K))$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable $z$ in the HOMFLY polynomial.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Lower Bound:** By rearranging the inequality, we can establish a lower bound for $s(K)$:\n    $s(K) \\ge \\frac{span_z(P(K))}{2} + 1$\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation:** Our script will perform the following steps:\n    *   First, it will compute the HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot using the `spherogram` library.\n    *   Next, it will parse this polynomial to find the highest and lowest powers of the variable $z$.\n    *   Then, it will calculate the span of $z$.\n    *   Finally, it will substitute the span into the rearranged inequality to find the numerical lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_seifert_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the 9_23 knot\n    using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        print(\"To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles, s(K), we use the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality:\")\n        print(\"s(K) >= span_z(P(K)) / 2 + 1, where P(K) is the HOMFLY polynomial.\\n\")\n\n        # 1.

Since we made a Poly in z, it's the first element.\n        all_degrees_z = [m[0] for m in poly_in_z.monoms()]\n        \n        min_deg_z = min(all_degrees_z)\n        max_deg_z = max(all_degrees_z)\n        \n        print(f\"Step 2: The minimum degree of 'z' is {min_deg_z} and the maximum degree is {max_deg_z}.\\n\")\n        \n        # 3.
