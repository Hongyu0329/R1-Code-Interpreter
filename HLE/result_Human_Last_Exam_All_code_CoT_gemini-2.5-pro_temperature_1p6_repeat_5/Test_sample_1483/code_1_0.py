# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
# of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.
# Based on the analysis of the properties of such topological spaces,
# the minimum number can be constructed and proven to be 2.
# A continuum with this property can be formed by joining two special
# continua (which have no proper regular subcontinua) at a single point.
# The number 'two' comes from the decomposition of the space X into
# two proper subcontinua, A and B, which are specifically chosen/constructed
# to be the only regular proper subcontinua.

result = 2
print(f"The smallest possible cardinality is: {result}")
# The question stated: "it is the union of two proper subcontinua."
# Let's print the numbers from the problem description that factor into the solution.
print("The solution relies on a decomposition into two continua.")
first_number = 2
print(f"The number from the problem statement is: {first_number}")
