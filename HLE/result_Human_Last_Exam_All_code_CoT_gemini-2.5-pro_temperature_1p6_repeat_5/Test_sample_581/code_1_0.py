    A cap set is a subset of the vector space (Z/pZ)^n that contains
    no three distinct elements in an arithmetic progression (i.e., no 'lines').
    Finding the maximum size of a cap set is a major open problem.

    The value for dimension 8 is not computed by a simple formula, but is a
    specific result from a construction found by mathematicians.
