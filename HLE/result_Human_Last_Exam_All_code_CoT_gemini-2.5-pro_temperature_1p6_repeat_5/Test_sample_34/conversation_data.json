    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered using established Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles. Here is the plan to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario**: We are in a 100BB deep, rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game. The action is an open-raise from the Button (BTN) position.\n2.  **Understand Positional Advantage**: The Button is the most powerful position in poker. It guarantees you will act last post-flop, giving you the most information. This advantage allows you to profitably play the widest range of hands.\n3.  **Consider the Rake-Free Environment**: In a normal game, the house takes a small percentage of many pots (the \"rake\"). This rake makes opening marginal hands less profitable. In a rake-free game, that cost is removed, which means you should open an even wider (looser) range of hands than standard GTO charts for raked games suggest.\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges**: Modern poker strategy uses GTO solvers to create pre-flop opening ranges. For the specified scenario (100BB, BTN open), GTO ranges are very wide. Even in games *with* rake, a standard Button opening range includes all suited Jack hands (from JTs down to J2s).\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand**: Since a standard GTO opening range includes all suited Jacks, the \"worst\" suited Jack in that range is simply the one with the lowest kicker card, as it has the lowest raw equity and is the last one to be added to the range. This hand is Jack-Two suited.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically determine and print this hand based on the logic above.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game\n    based on GTO (Game Theory Optimal) principles.\n\n    In poker, suited hands are ranked by their kicker. A lower kicker means a weaker hand.\n    The list `suited_jacks` is ordered from strongest kicker (Ten) to weakest (Two).\n\n    GTO strategy for a 100BB rake-free game from the button recommends opening\n    a very wide range, which includes all suited Jacks due to their playability and the\n    positional advantage. Therefore, the \"worst\" suited Jack in this opening range\n    is the one at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the suited jack hands, ordered from best kicker to worst.\n    # We exclude premium suited Jacks like AJs, KJs, QJs which are always opens.\n    suited_jacks = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n\n    # The worst hand in this ordered list is the last one.\n    worst_hand = suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    # The final hand consists of a Jack ('J') and its kicker ('2') of the same suit ('s').\n    # We will print the abbreviated hand name.\n    print(f\"Based on GTO principles for a rake-free 100BB game, the worst suited Jack to open from the button is: {worst_hand}\")\n    print(\"This includes the card 'J' and the number '2'.\")\n\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
