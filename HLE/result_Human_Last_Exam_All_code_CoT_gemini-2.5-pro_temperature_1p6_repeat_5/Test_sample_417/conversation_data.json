    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5,2,4,6-hexasubstituted benzene ring. The identical substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5, and the identical methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, give the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This means the three large arms of the molecule are chemically equivalent. We only need to count the number of unique proton environments in the central core and one of the arms.\n2.  **Count Protons in the Central Core:** We'll count the signals from the methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.\n3.  **Count Protons in the Linker:** We'll analyze the methylene (-CH2-) group that connects the central ring to the indazole moiety.\n4.  **Count Protons in the Indazole Arm:** We'll analyze the complex chiral indazole ligand, which is derived from camphor. Due to its rigid, asymmetric structure, many of its protons will be non-equivalent.\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the unique signals from each part.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step analysis to calculate the total number of peaks.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule by analyzing its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Central Core - Methyl Groups\n    # The molecule has C3 symmetry.
