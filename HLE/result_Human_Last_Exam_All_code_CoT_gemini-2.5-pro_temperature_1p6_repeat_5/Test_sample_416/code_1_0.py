    print("B. Charcot Arthropathy: Strong possibility. Presents as an acute, inflamed joint (hot, red, swollen), often triggered by minor trauma/overuse in a person with underlying neuropathy (common in older adults, e.g., from diabetes). The destructive bony process explains the bony tenderness and negative early X-rays. Crucially, the joint fluid is typically non-inflammatory (as seen here), and the condition does not respond to anti-inflammatory medication because the root cause is mechanical instability.")
    print("C. Septic Arthritis: Ruled out. The gram stain was negative and there were NO white blood cells in the joint fluid. A septic joint would be full of pus and white blood cells.")
