    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break it down to find the solution.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Riddle's Clues:** I will deconstruct the riddle into its core descriptive components.\n    *   \"A wooden stick\" and \"a ladder\": These point to a specific character component (radical).\n    *   \"a square box\": This points to another common radical.\n    *   \"hanging\" and \"placed in the center\": These clues describe the positional relationship between the components.\n2.  **Assemble the Character:** I will combine the identified components according to the positional clues to form the final Chinese character.\n3.  **Present the Solution in Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this analysis and reveals the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Ensure UTF-8 encoding for printing Chinese characters\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and solves the Chinese character riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    riddle = \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.\"\n    \n    print(\"Solving the riddle: '{}'\".format(riddle))\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step-by-step analysis\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the clue 'A wooden stick' or 'a ladder'.\")\n    print(\"This refers to the character component: 木 (mù)\")\n    print(\"It represents a tree or wood, which can be creatively described as a stick or a simple ladder.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the clue 'a square box'.\")\n    print(\"This refers to the radical: 囗 (wéi)\")\n    print(\"This radical means 'enclosure' and looks like a box.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Combining the components based on 'placed in the center'.\")\n    print(\"This tells us to place the 'wooden stick' (木) inside the 'square box' (囗).\")\n    print(\"Combining 木 and 囗 gives us the final character.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Final result\n    final_character = \"困\"\n    pinyin = \"kùn\"\n    meaning = \"trapped, sleepy, difficult\"\n    \n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(\"The character is {} (pinyin: {}), which means '{}'.\".format(final_character, pinyin, meaning))\n    print(\"A tree (木) inside an enclosure (囗) perfectly represents being 'trapped' or 'sleepy'.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<困>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.
