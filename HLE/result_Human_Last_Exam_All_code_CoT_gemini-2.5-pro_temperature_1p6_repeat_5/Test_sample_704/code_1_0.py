# Step 1: Define Newton's color and musical note mapping.
color_to_note = {
    "Red": "C",
    "Orange": "D",
    "Yellow": "E",
    "Green": "F",
    "Blue": "G",
    "Indigo": "A",
    "Violet": "B"
}

# Step 2: Determine the starting color of the range.
# The problem specifies the color produced by combining yellow and blue.
start_color_1 = "yellow"
start_color_2 = "blue"
combined_color = "Green" # Combining yellow and blue produces green.

# Step 3: Determine the ending color of the range.
end_color = "Blue"

# Step 4: Find the musical notes for the start and end of the range.
start_note = color_to_note[combined_color]
end_note = color_to_note[end_color]

# Step 5: Explain the reasoning and identify the final answer.
print(f"The first color is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is {combined_color}.")
print(f"According to Newton's mapping, the musical note for {combined_color} is {start_note}.")
print(f"The second color in the range is {end_color}.")
print(f"According to Newton's mapping, the musical note for {end_color} is {end_note}.")
print(f"The question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between {combined_color} and {end_color}.")
print(f"This range covers the notes from {start_note} to {end_note}. The specific note for the color Blue is G.")
print("\nTherefore, the final answer is the note corresponding to Blue.")

# Final Answer
final_answer = end_note
