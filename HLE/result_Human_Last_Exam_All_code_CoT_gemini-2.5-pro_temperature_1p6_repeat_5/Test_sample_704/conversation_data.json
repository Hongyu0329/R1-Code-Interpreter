    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  I will first establish the mapping between the colors of the spectrum and the musical notes as proposed by Isaac Newton.\n2.  I will determine the color that results from mixing yellow and blue, which will be the starting point of our range.\n3.  The ending point of the range is explicitly stated as blue.\n4.  I will then identify the musical note associated with the end of this range, \"blue\", according to Newton's circle.\n5.  The final Python code will define this mapping and print out the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the final note.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect print to stdout to ensure output is captured\n# sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__\n\n# Step 1: Define Newton's color and musical note mapping.\ncolor_to_note = {\n    \"Red\": \"C\",\n    \"Orange\": \"D\",\n    \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n    \"Green\": \"F\",\n    \"Blue\": \"G\",\n    \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n    \"Violet\": \"B\"\n}\n\n# Step 2: Determine the starting color of the range.\n# The problem specifies the color produced by combining yellow and blue.\nstart_color_1 = \"yellow\"\nstart_color_2 = \"blue\"\ncombined_color = \"Green\" # Combining yellow and blue produces green.\n\n# Step 3: Determine the ending color of the range.\nend_color = \"Blue\"\n\n# Step 4: Find the musical notes for the start and end of the range.\nstart_note = color_to_note[combined_color]\nend_note = color_to_note[end_color]\n\n# Step 5: Explain the reasoning and identify the final answer.\nprint(f\"The first color is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is {combined_color}.\")\nprint(f\"According to Newton's mapping, the musical note for {combined_color} is {start_note}.\")\nprint(f\"The second color in the range is {end_color}.\")\nprint(f\"According to Newton's mapping, the musical note for {end_color} is {end_note}.\")\nprint(f\"The question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between {combined_color} and {end_color}.\")\nprint(f\"This range covers the notes from {start_note} to {end_note}.
