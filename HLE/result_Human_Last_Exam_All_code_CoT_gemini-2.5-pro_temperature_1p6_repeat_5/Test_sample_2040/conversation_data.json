    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to answer your question.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the User's Request:**\nThe user has asked a conceptual physics question but has framed it within a prompt that expects a coded solution. The core task is to determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The secondary task is to present this answer according to the specified format (Python code block, print function, single code block, final answer in `<<<>>>`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Physics Question:**\n*   **What is Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)?** SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon splits into two lower-energy photons. It is a *second-order* nonlinear effect, meaning its efficiency is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n*   **What is the key requirement for a $\\chi^{(2)}$ process?** A fundamental rule in nonlinear optics states that for a material to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$, it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. Materials that have an inversion center are called \"centrosymmetric,\" and for these materials, $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n*   **What are boron nanosheets?** Also known as borophene, these are 2D single-atom-thick sheets of boron. Like other 2D materials, their properties are highly dependent on their specific atomic arrangement (crystal structure).\n*   **Connecting the concepts:** The question boils down to: Do free-standing boron nanosheets have a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry?\n\n**3. Research the Material Properties:**\nI need to check the crystal structure of common, stable, free-standing borophene phases. Research indicates that the most widely studied theoretical and experimentally realized phases of borophene (e.g., the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases) are centrosymmetric. They possess a center of inversion.\n\n**4. Formulate the Conclusion:**\nSince common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility is zero. Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit the second-order nonlinear process of SPDC. Any potential signal would have to come from other, much weaker effects like symmetry breaking at edges/defects or from higher-order multipole contributions, not the intrinsic bulk material response. The general answer is no.\n\n**5. Plan the Code:**\nTo meet the user's formatting request, I will create a Python script. This script will not perform a calculation but will instead use the `print()` function to output the detailed explanation formulated in the previous step. This directly addresses the request for a Python code block that uses `print`.\n\n```python\n# This script provides an explanation for the user's question about\n# spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in boron nanosheets.\n# The explanation is stored in a string and then printed to the console.\n\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed answer to the question of whether\n    free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit SPDC.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The answer hinges on a key principle of nonlinear optics: material symmetry.\n    # SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process.\n    principle = \"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process governed by the material's χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility.\"\n\n    # Such processes have a strict requirement for the material's crystal structure.\n    requirement = \"A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ response is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\"\n\n    # Now, we apply this to the specific material: boron nanosheets.\n    material_properties = \"The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are known to be centrosymmetric. They possess a center of inversion symmetry.\"\n\n    # The conclusion follows directly from applying the principle to the material.\n    conclusion = \"Because their crystal structure has inversion symmetry, their bulk second-order susceptibility χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Therefore, second-order processes like SPDC are forbidden by this symmetry.\"\n\n    # Final summary statement.\n    final_answer = \"In conclusion, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\"\n\n    # Printing the full explanation. There is no equation with numbers in this problem.\n    print(principle)\n    print(requirement)\n    print(material_properties)\n    print(conclusion)\n    print(final_answer)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nexplain_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<No>>>"
