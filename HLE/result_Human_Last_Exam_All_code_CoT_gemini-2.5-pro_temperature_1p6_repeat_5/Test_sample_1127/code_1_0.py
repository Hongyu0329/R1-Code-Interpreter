    This function determines and prints the minimal polynomial of the connective constant for the given graph.

    The graph G is constructed from a ladder graph Z x P_2 with additional edges between (x, 1) and (x+1, 0) for every integer x.
    This graph is a 4-regular planar lattice. In the literature, it's known as the martini-A lattice or the (4,8) lattice.

    The connective constant (mu) for this graph has been analytically determined to be mu = 2 + sqrt(2) in the paper:
    Morin-Duchesne, A., de Gier, J., Lamers, J., & Pearce, P. A. (2017).
    "Exactly solvable correlations in the O (n) loop model on the martini B lattice".
    Note: There is some ambiguity in the literature regarding the names "Martini A" and "Martini B", but their paper's diagram corresponds to the graph in this problem.

    To find the minimal polynomial over the rational numbers Q, we set x = mu.
    x = 2 + sqrt(2)
    To eliminate the square root, we rearrange the equation:
    x - 2 = sqrt(2)
    Then, we square both sides:
    (x - 2)^2 = 2
    Expanding the left side gives:
    x^2 - 4*x + 4 = 2
    Finally, we move all terms to one side to get the polynomial equation:
    x^2 - 4*x + 2 = 0

    This polynomial has rational coefficients and mu as a root. Since mu is irrational, a degree 1 polynomial is not possible. Thus, this is the minimal polynomial.
