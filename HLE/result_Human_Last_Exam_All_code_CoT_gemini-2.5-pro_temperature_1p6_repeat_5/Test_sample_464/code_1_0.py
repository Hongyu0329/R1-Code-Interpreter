    print("The term `integral( x^k * f(x) dx )` is the k-th moment of f(x).\n")

    print("Step 3: Apply the Condition that All Moments are Zero")

    print("  F^(k)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^k * 0 = 0 for all k.")

    print("means F(xi) is equal to its Taylor series expansion. Let's expand around xi = 0:")
    print("  F(xi) = sum_{k=0 to inf} [ F^(k)(0) / k! ] * xi^k\n")

    # Step 5: Conclude the Fourier Transform is Zero

    print("Since we found that F^(k)(0) = 0 for all k, the Taylor series becomes:")
    print("  F(xi) = sum_{k=0 to inf} [ 0 / k! ] * xi^k = 0")
    print("Because F(xi) is analytic, it must be equal to its Taylor series. Therefore:")
    print("  F(xi) = 0 for all xi.\n")

    # Step 6: Conclude the Function is Zero
    print("Step 6: The Function Itself is the Zero Function")
    print("The Fourier transform is an invertible operation on the Schwartz space.")

    # Final Result
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
