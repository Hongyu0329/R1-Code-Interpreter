    "The question asks whether a Schwartz function $f$ must be identically zero if all its moments, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$, are zero for all non-negative integers $k$. The answer is yes.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that walks through the mathematical proof for this conclusion. The script will not perform numerical computations, as no specific function is given (and indeed, no non-zero function satisfies the condition). Instead, it will use `print` statements to lay out the logical steps of the argument in a clear and educational manner.\n\nThe proof proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Introduce the Fourier Transform**: We consider the Fourier transform of the function $f$, which we'll call $\\hat{f}$. For a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform is also a Schwartz function.\n2.  **Connect Moments to Derivatives**: We use a fundamental property of the Fourier transform that connects the moments of $f(x)$ to the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin ($\\xi=0$).\n3.  **Apply the Zero-Moment Condition**: The given condition that all moments of $f$ are zero implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are zero.\n4.  **Use Analyticity**: A key property of the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is that it is analytic. This means it is equal to its Taylor series expansion everywhere.\n5.  **Show the Transform is Zero**: Since all derivatives at the origin are zero, all the coefficients of the Taylor series of $\\hat{f}$ around the origin are zero. This forces the Taylor series, and thus the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ itself, to be identically zero.\n6.  **Invert the Transform**: The Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the space of Schwartz functions. This means it's a one-to-one mapping. If $\\hat{f}$ is the zero function, its inverse transform, the original function $f$, must also be the zero function.\n\nThe following Python script will elaborate on these steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to the problem:\n    If f is a Schwartz function such that all its moments are zero,\n    does it follow that f is identically zero?\n\n    The script walks through the mathematical proof step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- The Problem ---\")\n    print(\"Suppose f: R -> R is a Schwartz class function such that:\")\n    print(\"  integral over R of (x^k * f(x)) dx = 0\")\n    print(\"for all non-negative integers k (k = 0, 1, 2, ...).\")\n    print(\"\\nQuestion: Does it follow that f(x) = 0 for all x?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Answer: Yes, it follows that f(x) = 0.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- The Proof ---\")\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: The Fourier Transform\n    print(\"Step 1: The Fourier Transform\")\n    print(\"Let F(xi) be the Fourier transform of f(x), defined as:\")\n    print(\"  F(xi) = integral( f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx )\")\n    print(\"A key property is that if f(x) is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform\")\n    print(\"F(xi) is also a Schwartz function.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate Moments to Derivatives\n    print(\"Step 2: Connect Moments to Derivatives of the Fourier Transform\")\n    print(\"Let's compute the k-th derivative of F(xi) with respect to xi:\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(xi) = d^k/d(xi)^k [ F(xi) ]\")\n    print(\"            = integral( f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx )\")\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating this derivative at xi = 0 gives:\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(0) = integral( f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k dx )\")\n    print(\"           = (-2*pi*i)^k * integral( x^k * f(x) dx )\")\n    print(\"The term `integral( x^k * f(x) dx )` is the k-th moment of f(x).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the Zero-Moment Condition\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply the Condition that All Moments are Zero\")\n    print(\"We are given that integral( x^k * f(x) dx ) = 0 for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...\")\n    print(\"From the relationship in Step 2, this directly implies:\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^k * 0 = 0 for all k.\")\n    print(\"So, all derivatives of the Fourier transform F(xi) at xi = 0 are zero.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Use Analyticity\n    print(\"Step 4: Use the Analyticity of the Fourier Transform\")\n    print(\"Since F(xi) is a Schwartz function, it is also an analytic function.
