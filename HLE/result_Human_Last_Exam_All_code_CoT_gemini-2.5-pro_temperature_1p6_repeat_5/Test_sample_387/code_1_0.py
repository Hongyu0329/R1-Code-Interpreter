    # 1. Interpret the setup
    # The log structure is given by the monoid P = N^3. The dimension of the space
    # in which the monoid lives is k.
    k = 3

    # The log ideal I is generated by vectors m_1 = (1,0,0) and m_2 = (0,1,0).
    generators = [np.array([1, 0, 0]), np.array([0, 1, 0])]

    # 2. Log blowup construction
    # The log blowup of the log point Spec(k) with log structure from P, at the ideal I,
    # is the toric variety whose fan is the normal fan to the polytope Delta.
    # Delta is the convex hull of the origin and the ideal generators.
    # Vertices of Delta = {0} U {generators}
    vertices = [np.array([0, 0, 0])] + generators

    # 3. Determine the properties of the fan
    # The dimension of the resulting toric variety is the dimension of the largest cone
    # in its normal fan.
    # The cones in the normal fan correspond to the faces of the polytope Delta.
    # The dimension of a normal cone C_F for a face F is given by the formula:
    #   dim(C_F) = k - dim(F)
    # To maximize the cone dimension, we must find the face with the minimum dimension.

    # 4. Calculate the dimension
    # The faces of the polytope Delta include its vertices (dimension 0), edges (dimension 1),
    # and the triangle itself (dimension 2).
    # The minimum possible dimension for a face of a polytope is 0 (a vertex).
    min_face_dimension = 0

    # The dimension of the log blowup is the dimension of the largest cone in the fan.
    dimension_of_blowup = k - min_face_dimension
