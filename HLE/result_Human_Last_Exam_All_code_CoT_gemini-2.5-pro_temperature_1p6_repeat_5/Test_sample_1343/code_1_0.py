  aa = a(m("+", True, sop)) + a(m("+", False, sop))
  bb = f(-1, "0", where(aa > 9, "1", where(aa == 9, "<", "0")))
  bb = a(n(bb != "<", bb))
  cc = (aa + bb) % 10
  ```
- Let's analyze this addition logic. The use of `f(-1, ...)` indicates a **left shift** of the carry. In a sequence of digits, this means a carry from position `i` goes to position `i-1`. This is unconventional but corresponds to a **left-to-right** addition, where numbers are processed from their most significant digit.
- For this to work, the numbers must be aligned at their start (left side). The problem `19+81=100` requires handling overflow. My analysis showed that padding the numbers with one leading zero `0` correctly handles this (e.g., `019+081`).
- The use of `'<'` and the `n()` function is a clever way to handle propagating carries in parallel. For a digit sum of 9 (marked as `'<'`), it will pass on any carry it receives from the right. The `n()` function resolves these carry chains by propagating the next non-'<' carry value backward (leftward).
- After the digit list `cc` is calculated, it's converted to an ASCII string. The problem statement asks to "omit the leading zeroes", so if the result is `05571337`, the final answer should be `5571337`.

### Step 4: Apply the logic to the inputs

**Input 1: `734107+4295754`**
1.  The first three characters are `"734"`.
2.  It contains a `'7'`.
3.  Path 1 is taken.
4.  The input length is 14. `14 > 11` so the aesthetic rule applies.
5.  The output will be `"get pwned"` (9 chars) + `!!!!` (4 chars) + `'1'` (1 char, replacing the 5th `!`). Total length 14.
6.  Result 1: `get pwned!!!!1`

**Input 2: `5429141+142196`**
1.  The first three characters are `"542"`.
2.  It does not contain a `'7'`.
3.  Path 2 is taken.
4.  Perform left-to-right addition.
    -   Operands are `5429141` (length 7) and `142196` (length 6).
    -   Max length is 7. Pad with one leading zero for overflow, so length becomes 8.
    -   Padded operands: `05429141` and `00142196`.
    -   `op1_digits = [0, 5, 4, 2, 9, 1, 4, 1]`
    -   `op2_digits = [0, 0, 1, 4, 2, 1, 9, 6]`
    -   `aa` (digit-wise sum): `[0, 5, 5, 6, 11, 2, 13, 7]`
    -   `w` (initial carry flags): `['0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0']` (no `'<'`)
    -   `bb_pre_n` (left-shift `w`): `['0', '0', '0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0']`
    -   `bb` (final carries): `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
    -   `cc = (aa + bb) % 10`: `[0, 5, 5, 7, 1, 3, 3, 7]`
5.  Convert `[0, 5, 5, 7, 1, 3, 3, 7]` to a string: `"05571337"`.
6.  Omit the leading zero as per the prompt.
7.  Result 2: `5571337`.

### Step 5: Final Output Formatting
Combine the two results with a semicolon: `result1;result2`.

This step-by-step process forms the basis for the Python code below.
