2) Residues from beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning GATING PROPERTIES:
   (Based on established findings from scientific literature)

   Region: SH3-GK Linker (HOOK Region)
   - Residues: ASP-248, GLU-252
     Function: These acidic residues in the linker are implicated in modifying the voltage-dependence of channel activation and inactivation.

   - Residues: TRP-321
     Function: This tryptophan is located in a conserved motif at the beginning of the GK domain and influences channel inactivation kinetics.

   Region: N-Terminus (in certain splice variants)
   - Residues: First ~30 residues
     Function: In isoforms like beta-1a, the N-terminus is crucial for modulating inactivation kinetics. This region is variable between different beta-1 splice variants.

   Region: GK Domain Core
   - Residues: TYR-359
     Function: Part of the core binding domain, mutations here not only disrupt binding but can also have profound effects on gating, indicating its dual role.
