# The Lindhard polarization function Π(k, ω) describes the linear response of
# the charge density in an electron gas to an external potential. It is a central
# quantity in the theory of screening and collective excitations in metals.

# The problem asks for the value of this function for a 3D homogeneous electron
# gas at T=0, specifically at zero momentum transfer (k=0) and zero frequency (ω=0).

# 1. Physical Argument:
# A momentum transfer k=0 corresponds to a spatially uniform potential V(r,t) = V(t).
# Such a potential shifts the energy of every electron in the system by the same
# amount. It does not create any forces (F = -∇V = 0) that would cause electrons
# to move and thereby create a density imbalance (i.e., polarization).
# Because a k=0 potential cannot polarize the gas, the response function for this
# specific perturbation must be zero. This holds for any frequency ω.
# Therefore, Π(k=0, ω) = 0.

# 2. Mathematical Argument:
# The Lindhard function is given by the integral:
# Π(k, ω) = 2 * Integral{d³p / (2π)³} * [f(ε_p) - f(ε_{p+k})] / [ħω + ε_p - ε_{p+k} + iη]
# where f(ε) is the Fermi-Dirac occupation number (a step function at T=0).

# If we set k=0 directly in the integrand, the numerator becomes:
# f(ε_p) - f(ε_{p+0}) = f(ε_p) - f(ε_p) = 0.
# The denominator becomes ħω. The entire integrand is therefore zero for any ω≠0.
# At the specific point (k=0, ω=0), the expression is formally 0/0. However, based
# on the physical principle of charge conservation, the function is strictly zero
# along the entire k=0 axis.

# Conclusion:
# The value of the Lindhard function evaluated *at* k=0 is zero.
# This must be distinguished from the limit as k→0, which is non-zero and gives
# the Thomas-Fermi screening constant. The question specifically requests the value at k=0.
