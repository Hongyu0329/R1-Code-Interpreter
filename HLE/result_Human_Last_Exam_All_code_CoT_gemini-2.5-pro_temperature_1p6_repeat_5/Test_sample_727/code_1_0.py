Problem Analysis:
In the given chess game, after White's move 130. Kh3, Black made the losing move 130... Qe6.
The task is to find the queen move that would have resulted in a draw.

Board State:
- White: King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on h5, pawns on e5 and f4.
- Black: King on e8, Queen on a2.

White's Goal: Advance the e and f pawns to win.
Black's Goal: Find a perpetual check to force a draw.

Analysis of the Losing Move (130... Qe6):
The move 130... Qe6? fails because it allows White's king to move to h4. After 131. Kh4, the Black queen is too close to deliver effective checks, and after 131... Qh6+, White simply blocks with 132. Nh5. White's pawns are then unstoppable, leading to a win for White.

Analysis of the Drawing Move (130... Qa1):
The correct move is 130... Qa1. This move maintains the queen's power from a distance. From a1, the queen can attack the White king from both the first rank and the long a1-h8 diagonal. This positioning creates an unavoidable perpetual check.

A sample line demonstrating the draw is:
130... Qa1
131. Kh4 Qh1+
132. Kg5 Qc1+
133. Kh5 Qh1+ (or 133. Kg6 Qg1+)
White's king cannot escape the continuous checks, and thus the game is a draw by repetition.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the move 'Qa1' would have saved the game for Black.
Looking at the provided answer choices:
A. Qa1
B. Qa7
... and so on.

The correct choice is A.
