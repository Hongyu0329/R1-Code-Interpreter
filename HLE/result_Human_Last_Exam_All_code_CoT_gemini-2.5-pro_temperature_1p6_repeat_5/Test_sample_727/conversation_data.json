    "My thinking process to solve this chess puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know which queen move for Black on move 130 would have led to a draw in the specified chess game. The move played in the game, `130... Qe6`, was a losing blunder.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Position:** I first need to understand the board state right before Black's 130th move.\n    *   **Game:** Carlsen vs. Nepomniachtchi, 2021 World Championship, Game 6.\n    *   **Move:** After White's `130. Kh3`.\n    *   **Material:** It's an endgame of Queen (Black) vs. Rook, Knight, and Pawns (White). Specifically, White has a Rook on `f5`, a Knight on `h5`, and pawns on `e5` and `f4`. Black has a Queen on `a2`.\n    *   **White's Threat:** White's plan is to advance the powerful `e` and `f` pawns, supported by the king and pieces, to either promote a pawn or checkmate the Black king.\n    *   **Black's Goal:** Black's only way to survive is to use the powerful queen to deliver an endless series of checks to the White king (a \"perpetual check\"), preventing White from making progress and forcing a draw.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Losing Move:** The game continued `130... Qe6?`. This move fails because it allows White's king to escape to `h4`. After `131. Kh4`, the Black queen is too close to effectively check the king, and White can use the knight to block with `132. Nh5`, after which the pawns can advance decisively.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Alternatives:** I need to find a move that successfully creates a perpetual check. I will analyze the candidate moves provided. The key is to keep the queen at a safe distance from which it can check the White king from multiple directions.\n    *   Let's analyze the move `130... Qa1` (Option A). This move is ideal. The queen on `a1` controls the entire first rank and can also move up the h-file diagonal to deliver checks. If White plays `131. Kh4`, Black can respond with `131... Qh1+`. White is forced into a sequence like `132. Kg5 Qc1+`, and the king cannot escape the checks. This forces a draw by repetition.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic. The script will:\n    *   Set the context of the puzzle.\n    *   Explain why the move played in the game (`Qe6`) lost.\n    *   Explain why the move `Qa1` secures a draw through perpetual check.\n    *   Identify `Qa1` as option 'A' from the list.\n    *   Print a clear explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_world_championship_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chess position from Carlsen vs. Nepomniachtchi,\n    2021 World Championship Game 6, at move 130, and identifies the drawing move for Black.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Game context and analysis\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nProblem Analysis:\nIn the given chess game, after White's move 130. Kh3, Black made the losing move 130... Qe6.\nThe task is to find the queen move that would have resulted in a draw.\n\nBoard State:\n- White: King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on h5, pawns on e5 and f4.\n- Black: King on e8, Queen on a2.\n\nWhite's Goal: Advance the e and f pawns to win.\nBlack's Goal: Find a perpetual check to force a draw.\n\nAnalysis of the Losing Move (130... Qe6):\nThe move 130... Qe6? fails because it allows White's king to move to h4. After 131. Kh4, the Black queen is too close to deliver effective checks, and after 131... Qh6+, White simply blocks with 132. Nh5. White's pawns are then unstoppable, leading to a win for White.\n\nAnalysis of the Drawing Move (130... Qa1):\nThe correct move is 130... Qa1. This move maintains the queen's power from a distance. From a1, the queen can attack the White king from both the first rank and the long a1-h8 diagonal. This positioning creates an unavoidable perpetual check.\n\nA sample line demonstrating the draw is:\n130... Qa1\n131. Kh4 Qh1+\n132. Kg5 Qc1+\n133. Kh5 Qh1+ (or 133. Kg6 Qg1+)\nWhite's king cannot escape the continuous checks, and thus the game is a draw by repetition.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the move 'Qa1' would have saved the game for Black.\nLooking at the provided answer choices:\nA. Qa1\nB. Qa7\n... and so on.\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\"\"\"\n\n    correct_move = \"Qa1\"\n    correct_option = \"A\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The queen move that draws the game is: {correct_move}\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option: {correct_option}\")\n\n# Execute the analysis and print the result.\nsolve_world_championship_puzzle()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
