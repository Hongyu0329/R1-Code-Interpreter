      'A': "Correct. Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. By blocking calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, it promotes relaxation and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), which lowers peripheral resistance and blood pressure.",
      'B': "Incorrect. While magnesium may help prevent vascular calcification long-term, its more immediate effect on blood pressure is through vasodilation.",
      'C': "Incorrect. Changes in brain matter are not a direct mechanism by which magnesium lowers blood pressure.",
      'D': "Incorrect. Magnesium generally has anti-inflammatory effects, and inflammation can contribute to hypertension, not alleviate it.",
      'E': "Incorrect. Magnesium and calcium are antagonists; magnesium does not raise blood calcium levels. Hypercalcemia (high calcium) can actually cause high blood pressure."
