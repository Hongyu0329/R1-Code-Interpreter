    "Of course, I can help with that. Let's analyze the sequence to find the next number.\n\nThis sequence is quite complex and doesn't follow a simple arithmetic or geometric rule. Puzzles like this often hide the pattern in a way that requires careful observation, sometimes using properties of the prompt text itself. However, in this case, the most revealing clues are within the structure of the number sequence itself, particularly at the end.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  I will focus on the last part of the sequence, as this is where patterns often become clearest.\n2.  I'll identify the repeating numbers and assign them variables (like X and Y) to make the pattern easier to see.\n3.  Based on recognized sub-patterns like repetitions (`XXX`) and alternations (`XYX`), I will deduce the most probable next number.\n4.  The final Python code will present this logic and print the resulting number.\n\nLet's execute the plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the pattern in the tail end of the sequence to find the next number.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # The most complex parts of the sequence seem designed to obscure a simpler pattern at the end.\n    # Let's analyze the tail end of the sequence:\n    # ..., 10, [36, 36, 36], [124, 124, 124], [36, 124], ...\n\n    # Let's denote the primary numbers in this pattern as variables:\n    X = 36\n    Y = 124\n\n    # The pattern can be described as: ..., X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, X, Y, ...\n    # This structure is composed of two sub-patterns:\n    # 1. A block of three X's: (X, X, X) which is (36, 36, 36)\n    # 2. A block of three Y's: (Y, Y, Y) which is (124, 124, 124)\n    # 3. An alternating pattern starting with X, Y: (X, Y, ...) which is (36, 124, ...)\n\n    # A very common and logical completion for an alternating pattern like (X, Y, ...) is (X, Y, X).\n    # This reflects a symmetrical or mirrored structure, which is also seen earlier in the sequence with the sub-pattern (49, 155, 49).\n    \n    # Therefore, the next number should be X.\n    next_number = X\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the end of the sequence: ..., 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124, ?\")\n    print(\"Let X = 36 and Y = 124.\")\n    print(\"The pattern appears to be a series of triplets (X,X,X), (Y,Y,Y) followed by an alternating pattern.\")\n    print(\"The final visible pattern is (X, Y), which is (36, 124).\")\n    print(\"A common completion for this is a symmetric (X, Y, X) pattern.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final equation for the next number is: Next = X = {next_number}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe next number in the sequence is:\")\n    print(next_number)\n\nfind_next_number_in_sequence()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
