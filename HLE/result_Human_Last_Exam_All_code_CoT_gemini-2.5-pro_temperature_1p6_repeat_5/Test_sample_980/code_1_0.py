    # Let's analyze the tail end of the sequence:
    # ..., 10, [36, 36, 36], [124, 124, 124], [36, 124], ...

    # Let's denote the primary numbers in this pattern as variables:
    X = 36
    Y = 124

    # The pattern can be described as: ..., X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, X, Y, ...
    # This structure is composed of two sub-patterns:
    # 1. A block of three X's: (X, X, X) which is (36, 36, 36)
    # 2. A block of three Y's: (Y, Y, Y) which is (124, 124, 124)
    # 3. An alternating pattern starting with X, Y: (X, Y, ...) which is (36, 124, ...)

    # A very common and logical completion for an alternating pattern like (X, Y, ...) is (X, Y, X).
    # This reflects a symmetrical or mirrored structure, which is also seen earlier in the sequence with the sub-pattern (49, 155, 49).
    
    # Therefore, the next number should be X.
