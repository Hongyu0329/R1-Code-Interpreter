    The question asks whether, given an omega_2-length sequence of functions from omega_1 to omega_1 that is increasing modulo finite sets, there must necessarily exist an uncountable subset of these functions that is pointwise bounded by a single function.

    The answer is No. The reasoning proceeds by contradiction, as follows:

    1.  Assume for any such sequence, there exists an uncountable set of indices X and a bounding function g.
    2.  From the uncountable set X, we can choose a subsequence of functions of length omega_1, let's call it F'. Since F' is a subset of a bounded family, F' is also bounded by g.
    3.  For any two functions in F', f_a and f_b with a < b, the set of coordinates where f_b <= f_a is finite.
    4.  Using a partition theorem from ZFC, we can find an uncountable subfamily of F', let's call it F'', and a countable ordinal d, such that for any two functions f_a, f_b in F'' (with a < b), the coordinates where f_b <= f_a are all less than or equal to d.
    5.  Now, consider any coordinate z > d. For this coordinate, the values of the functions in F'' form a strictly increasing sequence of countable ordinals.
    6.  The length of this sequence is uncountable (omega_1). A strictly increasing sequence of countable ordinals of uncountable length must be cofinal in omega_1. This means its supremum is omega_1.
    7.  However, since the family F'' is bounded by g, the values at coordinate z must all be less than g(z), which is a countable ordinal. This implies their supremum is also less than omega_1.
    8.  This leads to a contradiction: the supremum of the values at coordinate z cannot be both equal to omega_1 and less than omega_1.

    Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. It is not necessary for such a bounded uncountable subset to exist.
