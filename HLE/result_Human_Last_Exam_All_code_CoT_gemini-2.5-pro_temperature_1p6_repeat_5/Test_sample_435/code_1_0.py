    # The question is biological, not computational. This script provides a
    # conceptual model to illustrate the predicted effect based on immunological principles.

    # 1. Prediction based on Biology:
    # IL-15 is known to enhance T cell survival, persistence, and effector function.
    # Therefore, CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 are expected to be more potent.
    # This leads to the prediction of increased cytokine release upon activation.
    
    # 2. Conceptual Model:
    # We can represent this with a simple multiplicative model.
    # Let's define a baseline value for cytokine release (e.g., in pg/mL).
    base_cytokine_release = 1500  # Hypothetical baseline cytokine release (e.g., IFN-Î³ in pg/mL)

    # Let's define a hypothetical enhancement factor due to IL-15.
    # Studies suggest IL-15 enhances function, so we'll use a factor > 1.
    il15_enhancement_factor = 2.5 # A hypothetical factor representing a 150% increase

    # Calculate the predicted cytokine release for IL-15 treated cells.
    enhanced_cytokine_release = base_cytokine_release * il15_enhancement_factor
