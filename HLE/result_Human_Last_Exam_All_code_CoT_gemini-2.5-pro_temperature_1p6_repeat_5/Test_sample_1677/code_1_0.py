    This function identifies and prints the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the
    increase in university entrants in Japan.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Option A is factually incorrect. The demographic decline of 18-year-olds was severe and well-predicted.
    - Option B is correct. The university enrollment rate has increased substantially.
    - Option C describes a correct trend, although its impact on the 'entrant' numbers is smaller than other factors.
    - Option D is inappropriate. Two-year colleges have declined, and specialized colleges are not primarily 'prep schools' pushing up university entrant numbers; they are often competitors.
    - Option E is correct. Government deregulation led to an increase in the number of universities.

    Therefore, the incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
