    # Statement A Analysis
    print("A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("   Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   In the dual formulation of SVM, one of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is Σ(alpha_i * y_i) = 0, where alpha_i are the non-negative Lagrange multipliers and y_i are the class labels (+1 or -1).")
    print("   The alpha_i values are non-zero only for support vectors. If all support vectors belonged to a single class (e.g., y_i = +1), the equation would become Σ(alpha_i * 1) = 0. Since alpha_i >= 0, this implies all alpha_i must be 0, which contradicts the existence of support vectors. Thus, support vectors must come from both classes.")

    # Statement B Analysis
    print("B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("   Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   For imbalanced data, we can use different penalty parameters (C_positive, C_negative) for each class in the soft-margin SVM formulation. Assigning a higher C value to the minority class penalizes misclassifications of that class more heavily. This adjustment pushes the decision boundary away from the minority class, which is conceptually equivalent to creating different effective margins for each class to achieve better classification performance.")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("   Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   This is the principle behind the 'kernel trick'. A kernel function, K(x, z), computes the dot product of data points in a high-dimensional feature space without explicitly performing the transformation. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x - z||^2), maps to an infinite-dimensional space, yet its computation is simple and efficient, depending only on the original vectors x and z.")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("   Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("   The SVM decision boundary is determined solely by the support vectors (the points closest to the hyperplane). Interior points are those correctly classified and lying outside the margin. Adding or moving these points (as long as they don't cross the margin) does not change the set of support vectors, and therefore the decision boundary remains unchanged.")

    # Statement E Analysis
    print("E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("   Analysis: This statement is FALSE.")
    print("   While a strictly convex function can have at most one global minimizer, its existence is not guaranteed. A counterexample is f(x) = e^x, defined on the domain of all real numbers. This function is strictly convex because its second derivative, f''(x) = e^x, is always positive.")
    print("   However, f(x) does not have a global minimum; it approaches an infimum of 0 as x approaches -infinity, but it never reaches 0. Therefore, the statement that *any* strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer is false.")
