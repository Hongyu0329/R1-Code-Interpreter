    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the quantum numbers for a p-electron. The orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` is 1, and the spin quantum number `s` is 1/2.\n2.  Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, `j`. The values of `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  For each possible value of `j`:\n    a. Calculate the eigenvalue of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$. The formula for this eigenvalue is $j(j+1)ħ^2$.\n    b. Determine the possible values for the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$. The values of $m_j$ range from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n    c. For each value of $m_j$, calculate the eigenvalue of the z-component of the total angular momentum operator, $J_z$. The formula for this eigenvalue is $m_jħ$.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the results in a clear format, showing the component numbers used in the eigenvalue equations. We will treat Planck's constant `ħ` as a symbolic unit.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1.0  # Orbital angular momentum for p-electron\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J^2 are given by j(j+1)ħ^2.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J_z are given by m_j*ħ.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible values of j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1.0)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Loop through j and m_j to calculate and print eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For total angular momentum quantum number j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print J^2 eigenvalue with its formula\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is {j} * ({j} + 1.0) ħ^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue} ħ^2\")\n        \n        # Determine m_j values and calculate J_z eigenvalues\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        print(f\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z are:\")\n        \n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is just m_j\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {m_j:4.1f}, the eigenvalue is {m_j:4.1f} ħ\")\n            \n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```"
