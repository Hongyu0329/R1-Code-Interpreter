    "My plan is to determine the upper bound for the ideal norm, as requested, by using the well-established Minkowski bound from the geometry of numbers. The relationship involves the field degree ($n$), the number of complex embeddings ($t$), and the field discriminant ($\\Delta_K$).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **State the general formulas:** I will start with Minkowski's general inequality for the norm of an ideal and the general formula for the covolume ($V$) of the integer lattice of a number field.\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** I will substitute the covolume expression into the Minkowski bound to establish a direct relationship between the norm bound (which I'll denote as $k_{k,\\infty}$ as per your notation) and the covolume ($V$).\n3.  **Specialize to quadratic fields:** The mention of \"squarefree natural numbers (N)\" points to the context of quadratic fields, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, which have a degree of $n=2$. I will specialize the general formula for this case.\n4.  **Differentiate between real and imaginary fields:** The specialized formula for quadratic fields still depends on the number of complex embeddings ($t$).\n    *   For real quadratic fields (e.g., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$), $t=0$.\n    *   For imaginary quadratic fields (e.g., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$), $t=1$.\n5.  **Calculate the constants:** The Python script will compute the constant of proportionality for both cases.\n6.  **Determine the single upper bound:** Since you ask for \"the\" upper bound, I will identify the larger of the two constants. This larger value provides a single inequality that is true for all quadratic fields, both real and imaginary.\n7.  **Output the final result:** The code will print the derived equations, showing the numbers involved, and I will provide the final numerical constant in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nprint(\n    \"This script determines the upper bound for the maximum norm (k_k,inf) in relation\\n\"\n    \"to the covolume (V) for quadratic number fields K = Q(sqrt(d)), where d is a squarefree integer.\\n\"\n    \"This is derived from Minkowski's bound.\"\n)\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\n\n# The degree (n) for any quadratic field is 2.\nn = 2\n\n# The general relationship is k_k,inf <= C * V, where the constant C is:\n# C = ( (8/pi)^t * n! ) / n^n\n# Here, 't' is the number of pairs of complex embeddings.\n\n# --- Case 1: Real Quadratic Fields ---\n# For real fields (e.g., d > 0), there are 2 real embeddings and 0 complex, so t = 0.\nt_real = 0\nconstant_real = (8 / math.pi)**t_real * (math.factorial(n) / n**n)\n\nprint(\"For REAL quadratic fields (e.g., K = Q(sqrt(N)) where N is a squarefree natural number):\")\nprint(f\"The number of pairs of complex embeddings is t = {t_real}.\")\nprint(f\"The constant C = (8/pi)^{t_real} * ({n}! / {n}^{n}) = 1 * ({math.factorial(n)} / {n**n}) = {constant_real}\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the upper bound is:\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= ({math.factorial(n)} / {n**n}) * V\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= {constant_real} * V\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Case 2: Imaginary Quadratic Fields ---\n# For imaginary fields (e.g., d < 0), there are 0 real embeddings and 2 complex, so t = 1.\nt_imaginary = 1\nconstant_imaginary = (8 / math.pi)**t_imaginary * (math.factorial(n) / n**n)\n\nprint(\"For IMAGINARY quadratic fields (e.g., K = Q(sqrt(-N)) where N is a squarefree natural number):\")\nprint(f\"The number of pairs of complex embeddings is t = {t_imaginary}.\")\nprint(f\"The constant C = (8/pi)^{t_imaginary} * ({n}! / {n}^{n}) = (8/pi) * ({math.factorial(n)} / {n**n}) = 4/pi\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the upper bound is:\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= (4 / pi) * V\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= {constant_imaginary:.4f} * V\\n\")\n\n# --- Universal Upper Bound ---\n# To find a single upper bound valid for ALL quadratic fields, we take the larger of the two constants.\nuniversal_constant = max(constant_real, constant_imaginary)\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\nprint(\"A single upper bound valid for ALL quadratic fields is found by using the larger constant:\")\nprint(f\"max({constant_real}, {constant_imaginary:.4f}) = {universal_constant:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the universal upper bound in relation to the covolume is:\")\nprint(f\"k_k,inf <= (4 / pi) * V  or approximately k_k,inf <= {universal_constant:.4f} * V\")\n\n# The final answer is the value of this universal constant.\nfinal_answer = 4 / math.pi\n<<<1.2732>>>\n```"
