    print("A. Staple and resect part of the cecum laparoscopically:")
    print("   - This escalates a simple appendectomy to a more complex partial cecectomy.")
    print("   - It is unnecessarily aggressive and does not solve the immediate problem of the stuck instrument. This is incorrect.\n")

    print("B. Pry the stapler open with another laparoscopic instrument:")
    print("   - High risk of tearing the appendix or cecum, causing spillage and bleeding.")
    print("   - Low probability of success due to the strength of the stapler. This is dangerous.\n")

    print("C. Extend the port incision and pry the stapler open:")
    print("   - Extending the port is a good step towards converting to an open procedure.")
    print("   - However, the main goal is not just to 'pry', which is still risky. The goal is to safely complete the operation. This is incomplete.\n")

    print("D. Extend the port of the stapler into a longer incision then complete an open appendectomy via that incision:")
    print("   - This follows the standard of care: convert to an open procedure when laparoscopy is no longer safe.")
    print("   - It uses the most logical and least traumatic incision by extending an existing port.")
    print("   - 'Completing an open appendectomy' encompasses all necessary steps to safely manage the stump and remove the appendix under direct control. This is the safest and most appropriate action.\n")

    print("E. & F. Make a midline incision:")
    print("   - A midline incision is a major laparotomy and is inappropriately located for a focused appendiceal problem.")
    print("   - Converting through the existing port site (a mini-laparotomy) is much less invasive. This is incorrect.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The best step is to convert to an open procedure via the most direct incision to ensure patient safety and definitively resolve the issue.")
