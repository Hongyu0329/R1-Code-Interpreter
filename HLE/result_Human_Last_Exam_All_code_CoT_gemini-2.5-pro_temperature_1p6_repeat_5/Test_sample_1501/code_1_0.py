    """
    This script analyzes and solves the three-part question about the doubling
    construction for nested Steiner Quadruple Systems (SQS).
    """

    # --- Part (a) Analysis ---
    # The question is: True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of
    # Q x {0, 1} is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.
    # "Contained in an ND-pair" for a point refers to its degree in the graph of ND-pairs.
    # A nested SQS(2v) contains 2v-1 ND-sets, and each is a 2-factor. In a 2-factor,
    # every point has a degree of 2.
    # Therefore, the total degree for any point `p` across all 2v-1 ND-sets is:
    # Degree(p) = 2 * (2v - 1) = 4v - 2.
    # The question claims this degree is v - 1.
    # The equality 4v - 2 = v - 1 simplifies to 3v = 1, or v = 1/3.
    # This is impossible for v >= 4. Thus, the statement is false.
    answer_a = "False"

    # --- Part (b) Analysis ---
    # The question is: What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in
    # the SQS(2v) if the pair {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?
    # According to the standard nested doubling construction, the multiplicity of a
    # "horizontal" pair `{(x, 0), (y, 0)}` is the sum of two contributions:
    # 1. A contribution equal to the original multiplicity, `mu`, from the lifting of the
    #    original ND-sets.
    # 2. A contribution of 1 from the new ND-sets created from Type 2 blocks.
    # Thus, the new multiplicity is mu + 1.
    answer_b_expression = "mu + 1"
    
    # --- Part (c) Analysis ---
    # The question is: Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v
    # in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?
    # A pair could have multiplicity v if, for example, a horizontal pair `{(x,0),(y,0)}`
    # had a new multiplicity `mu + 1 = v`, meaning `mu = v - 1`. However, there is no
    # guarantee that a pair with `mu = v - 1` exists in every nested SQS(v).
    # We can check with a counterexample. Let v=4. For the unique nested SQS(4),
    # every pair has multiplicity mu = 1.
    # In the constructed nested SQS(8), the pair multiplicities are:
    # - Horizontal pairs: mu + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.
    # - Vertical pairs `{(x,0),(x,1)}`: v/2 = 4/2 = 2.
    # - Diagonal pairs: Can be shown to also have small integer multiplicities (e.g., 2).
    # None of the pairs have multiplicity v=4. Since a counterexample exists, the
    # answer is no.
    answer_c = "No"

    # --- Final Answer ---
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b_expression}; (c) {answer_c}")

    # As per the instruction to "output each number in the final equation",
    # we print the equation for part (b). The number is 1.
    print("\nThe equation for part (b) is: new_multiplicity = mu + 1")
