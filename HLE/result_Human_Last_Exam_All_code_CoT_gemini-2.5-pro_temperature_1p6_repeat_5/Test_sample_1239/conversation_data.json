    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** I will first identify the continuous transformations (symmetries) that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions invariant. These transformations form a Lie group.\n2.  **Determine the Dimension of Each Symmetry:** For each type of symmetry transformation, I will determine the number of independent parameters required to specify it. This number is the dimension of that particular subgroup of symmetries. The transformations include:\n    *   Time translation\n    *   Space translations\n    *   Spatial rotations\n    *   Galilean boosts\n    *   Scaling transformations (dilations)\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The total dimension of the full Lie symmetry group is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry types.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that assigns the dimension of each symmetry type to a variable, then calculates and prints the sum. The script will explicitly print the equation representing the sum of these dimensions, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Lie group of symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations is composed of\n    # several types of transformations.

Since space is R^3, this is a 3-vector.\n    space_translation_dim = 3\n\n    # 3. Spatial rotations: x' = R*x. The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has dimension 3.\n    spatial_rotation_dim = 3\n\n    # 4. Galilean boosts: x' = x - v_0*t, u' = u - v_0. The boost velocity v_0 is a 3-vector.\n    galilean_boost_dim = 3\n\n    # 5. Scaling (Dilation): t' = a^2*t, x' = a*x.
