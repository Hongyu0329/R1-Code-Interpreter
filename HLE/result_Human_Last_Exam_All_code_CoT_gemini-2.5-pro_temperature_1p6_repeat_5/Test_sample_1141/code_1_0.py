# The user's problem formulation for cutting a steel billet was analyzed.
# The analysis revealed a critical error in the non-overlapping constraints involving the T1 cube pieces.
#
# The provided constraints for T1 pieces are of the form:
#   min(|x_i-x_j|, |y_i-y_j|, |z_i-z_j|) >= k
#
# This mathematical condition requires that the centers of the two pieces be separated by at least 'k' units
# in ALL three dimensions (x, y, and z) simultaneously.
#
# The correct condition for two non-overlapping axis-aligned objects (like cubes) is that they must be
# separated in AT LEAST ONE dimension. This would be represented using a 'max' function, not a 'min' function.
#
# For instance, two T1 cubes (side length 2 in grid units) with centers at (x_i, y_i, z_i) and (x_j, y_j, z_j)
# do not overlap if:
#   max(|x_i - x_j|, |y_i - y_j|, |z_i - z_j|) >= 2
#
# Because the user's formulation is geometrically incorrect, it does not accurately represent the stated problem.
# According to the user's instructions, if the formulation is not correct, the output should be 0.
#
# Therefore, we print 0.
result = 0
