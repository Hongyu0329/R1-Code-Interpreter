    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix:\n\n1.  I will use the `numpy` library in Python for matrix representation.\n2.  The matrix `A` will be defined as provided in the problem.\n3.  To satisfy the requirement of showing the calculation, I will apply the cofactor expansion formula for a 3x3 determinant, which is: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n4.  The python script will substitute the values from matrix `A` into this formula and print each step of the calculation, showing how the numbers are used.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the computed determinant value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem is to compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n# The context \"m_1/2 = 13\" is specific to the theory of Markov quivers but is not\n# needed for the direct calculation of the determinant of the provided matrix.\n\n# The given matrix A is:\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# To compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, we use the formula:\n# det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n# where the matrix elements are:\n# [[a, b, c],\n#  [d, e, f],\n#  [g, h, i]]\n\n# Extract the elements from matrix A\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the individual terms\nterm1 = e * i - f * h\nterm2 = d * i - f * g\nterm3 = d * h - e * g\n\n# Calculate the final determinant\ndeterminant = a * term1 - b * term2 + c * term3\n\n# As requested, here is the equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"Computing the determinant of matrix A:\\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(\"Using the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\nprint(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n\n# The final equation with each number explicitly shown\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Intermediate calculation steps\nprint(f\"       = {a} * ({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a} * ({term1}) - ({b}) * ({term2}) + {c} * ({term3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a * term1} - ({b * term2}) + ({c * term3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a * term1 + (-1)*(b*term2) + c*term3}\")\nprint(f\"       = {int(determinant)}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {int(determinant)}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
