    "To evaluate the integral \\( \\langle \\phi_i \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right| \\phi_j\\rangle \\) for a \\(1s\\) Slater orbital, we need to solve the integral \\( \\int \\phi_{1s}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s} \\, d\\tau \\). This is the expectation value of the potential energy operator \\(1/r\\), which represents the attraction between an electron and a nucleus. The evaluation assumes that the orbital for the 'bra' \\( \\langle \\phi_i | \\) and the 'ket' \\( | \\phi_j \\rangle \\) is the same \\(1s\\) orbital, centered at the origin.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this using a Python script:\n1.  **Define the Orbital:** A \\(1s\\) Slater-Type Orbital (STO) is given by \\( \\phi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = N e^{-\\zeta r} \\), where \\(N\\) is a normalization constant and \\(\\zeta\\) (zeta) is the orbital exponent.\n2.  **Normalization:** The normalization constant \\(N\\) is first calculated by solving the integral \\( \\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle = \\int |N e^{-\\zeta r}|^2 d\\tau = 1 \\). The volume element in spherical coordinates is \\(d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\).\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The full integral for the expectation value is then set up: \\( \\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle = \\int (N e^{-\\zeta r}) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) (N e^{-\\zeta r}) \\, r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\).\n4.  **Symbolic Integration:** The `sympy` library in Python will be used to perform the symbolic integration over the spatial variables \\(r\\), \\(\\theta\\), and \\(\\phi\\).\n5.  **Final Result:** The script will print the steps of the calculation and the final symbolic result. The final equation will be printed, and its numerical components will be explicitly shown.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_1s_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a Slater-type orbital.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols used in the calculation.\n    # r, theta, phi are the spherical coordinates.\n    # zeta is the exponent of the Slater orbital.\n    r, theta, phi = sp.symbols('r theta phi', real=True, positive=True)\n    zeta = sp.symbols('zeta', real=True, positive=True, nonzero=True)\n    N = sp.Symbol('N', real=True, positive=True) # Normalization constant\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the unnormalized 1s Slater orbital.\")\n    # The functional form of a 1s STO is exp(-zeta*r).\n    phi_unnormalized = sp.exp(-zeta * r)\n    print(f\"phi_unnormalized = {phi_unnormalized}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the normalization constant N.\")\n    print(\"The normalization condition is integral( (N*phi)^2 * d_tau ) = 1.\")\n    # The integrand for normalization includes the square of the orbital and the volume element.\n    # d_tau = r^2 * sin(theta) * dr * dtheta * dphi\n    integrand_norm = phi_unnormalized**2 * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n    \n    # Perform the integration over all space.\n    # The integral over phi (0 to 2*pi) of sin(theta) gives 2*pi.\n    # The integral over theta (0 to pi) of sin(theta) gives 2.\n    # Total angular integral is 4*pi.\n    # The radial integral is integral(r^2 * exp(-2*zeta*r), r from 0 to oo)\n    # The total integral is N^2 * (4*pi) * integral_r = 1\n    \n    # Using sympy to do it step-by-step:\n    norm_integral_val = sp.integrate(integrand_norm, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi), (theta, 0, sp.pi), (r, 0, sp.oo))\n    \n    print(f\"The integral of (phi_unnormalized)^2 over all space is: {norm_integral_val}\")\n    \n    # Solve for N from N**2 * norm_integral_val = 1\n    N_squared = 1 / norm_integral_val\n    N_expr = sp.sqrt(N_squared)\n    print(f\"The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 / ({norm_integral_val})) = {N_expr}\\n\")\n    \n    # Define the fully normalized 1s Slater orbital\n    phi_1s = N_expr * phi_unnormalized\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Set up the integral for the expectation value <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>.\")\n    operator = 1 / r\n    \n    # The integrand for the expectation value.\n    integrand_exp_val = phi_1s * operator * phi_1s * r**2 * sp.sin(theta)\n    \n    print(f\"Normalized phi_1s = {phi_1s}\")\n    print(f\"Operator = {operator}\")\n    print(\"Integrand = (phi_1s)^2 * (1/r) * r^2 * sin(theta)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Evaluate the integral.\")\n    # Perform the full integration.\n    final_result = sp.integrate(integrand_exp_val, (phi, 0, 2*sp.pi), (theta, 0, sp.pi), (r, 0, sp.oo))\n    \n    print(\"The integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> evaluates to:\")\n    # Print the final symbolic result as an equation\n    final_eq = sp.Eq(sp.Symbol('<phi_1s|1/r|phi_1s>'), final_result)\n    print(final_eq)\n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Final Equation Analysis:\")\n    # Decompose the result into its numerical coefficient and variable parts\n    # This addresses the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    coeff, terms = final_result.as_coeff_Mul()\n    variable_part = 1\n    if terms:\n        variable_part = sp.Mul(*terms)\n\n    print(\"The final result can be written as: Coefficient * Variable(s)\")\n    print(f\"The numerical coefficient in the equation is: {coeff}\")\n    print(f\"The variable part of the equation is: {variable_part}\")\n\nevaluate_1s_slater_integral()\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
