    Calculates and explains the critical exponent nu for a G4-theoretical framework.

    In a G4 (or phi^4) Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework, the value of the
    critical exponent nu, which governs the scaling of the correlation length
    (xi ~ |T - Tc|^-nu), depends on the spatial dimension 'd'.

    The upper critical dimension for this theory is d_c = 4.
    For any dimension d >= 4, the system's behavior is described exactly by
    mean-field theory. In mean-field theory, nu takes a universal, precise value.
