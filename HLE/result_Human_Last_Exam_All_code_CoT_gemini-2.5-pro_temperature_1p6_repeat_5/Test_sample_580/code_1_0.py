    This function analyzes the clinical case to determine the most appropriate physical exam maneuver.

    The patient's history of chronic prednisone and alcohol use strongly suggests Avascular Necrosis (AVN)
    of the femoral head as the most likely diagnosis, despite the normal X-ray (which is common in early AVN).

    The definitive physical exam maneuver for intra-articular hip pathology like AVN is stressing the joint.
    Pain elicited upon internal rotation of the hip is a classic finding.

    Therefore, the correct action to confirm the diagnosis is Internal Rotation.
