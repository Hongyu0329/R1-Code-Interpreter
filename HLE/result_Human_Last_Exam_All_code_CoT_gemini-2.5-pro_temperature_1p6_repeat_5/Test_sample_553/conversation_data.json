    "This is a music theory question. Let's break it down to find the correct song.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user is asking for a Beatles song that starts with a specific chord progression: \"from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\"\n2.  **Analyze the Music Theory:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major.\n    *   **Fifth Note:** In any key, this is the 5th note of the scale. In C major, the fifth note is G.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is a *minor* chord built on that fifth note. A standard major key has a *major* chord on the fifth (the \"dominant\" V chord). So, in C major, the standard V chord is G major. A \"minor fifth\" would be G *minor*. This I -> v progression (e.g., C major to G minor) is a less common, but very distinctive and beautiful-sounding chord change, often borrowed from the parallel minor key.\n3.  **Search for the Song:** Now, I need to find a Beatles song that uses this I -> v progression at the beginning.\n    *   The song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul* is famous for its sophisticated harmonies.\n    *   The song is in the key of F. The tonic (I) chord is **F major**.\n    *   The fifth note in the key of F is C. The minor fifth (v) chord would be **C minor**.\n    *   Let's look at the song's structure. The opening verse starts with the line \"Michelle, ma belle,\" which is sung over the **F major** (I) tonic chord.\n    *   The very next line, \"Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble,\" begins with a **C minor** (v) chord, perfectly matching the user's description. The progression is Fmaj -> Cm -> C7 -> F.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The song is \"Michelle.\" I will now write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.\n\n    The user is asking for a song that moves from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.\n    - Tonic chord (I): The \"home\" chord of the key.\n    - Minor fifth chord (v): A minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n\n    An analysis of The Beatles' discography points to one famous example:\n    Song: \"Michelle\"\n    Key: F\n    Tonic (I) chord: F Major\n    Minor fifth (v) chord: C minor\n\n    The progression occurs in the verse:\n    - \"Michelle, ma belle...\" is sung over the F Major (I) chord.\n    - \"sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble...\" starts on the C minor (v) chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that features a prominent chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"In this song, the progression is from the tonic chord {tonic_chord} (I) to the minor fifth chord {minor_fifth_chord} (v).\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
