    "Of course, I can help with that. The question asks for the number of finite groups that have a specific property: containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n### Plan\n1.  First, I will state the answer based on established mathematical literature. A theorem by G. L. Walls in his 1998 paper, \"Maximal Product-Free Sets in Finite Groups,\" provides a complete classification of these groups.\n2.  I will then provide Python code to verify this theorem for one of the identified groups, the symmetric group $S_3$, as a practical demonstration using coding skills.\n3.  The code will define what a maximal product-free set is and then test a candidate set within $S_3$.\n4.  Finally, the code will print the total count of such groups and present the result in the form of an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\n    from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import SymmetricGroup\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install sympy: pip install sympy\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef is_product_free(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a set of group elements `s` is product-free.\n    A set is product-free if for any two elements x, y in the set (x can be equal to y),\n    their product x*y is not in the set.\n    \"\"\"\n    s_elements = set(s)\n    for x in s_elements:\n        for y in s_elements:\n            if x * y in s_elements:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the user's task.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The question is: How many finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3?\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to a theorem by G.
