    "To find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Transform the Integral Equation**: The kernel of the integral, `(xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be simplified to a sum `∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`. This shows the kernel is degenerate (or separable), which allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  **Formulate the Linear System**: By defining moments `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, the solution `u(x)` can be expressed as a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Substituting this form back into the definitions of `c_k` yields a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `c_k`. This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix, `A` is an `n x n` matrix, `c` is the vector of coefficients `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]`, and `b` is a known vector.\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: A unique solution to this system fails to exist if the matrix `(I - λA)` is singular, i.e., its determinant is zero. This happens when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n4.  **Fredholm Alternative**: The Fredholm alternative theorem states that when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue, the equation has no solution if the inhomogeneous term (in our case, `f(x) = 1`) is not orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding adjoint homogeneous equation. This orthogonality condition needs to be checked.\n5.  **Numerical Solution**: For a general integer `n`, finding these eigenvalues analytically is difficult. We will use a Python script with the `numpy` library to solve this problem numerically. The script will construct the matrix `A`, find its eigenvalues (`μ`), calculate the corresponding `λ = 1/μ`, and verify the orthogonality condition to identify the values of `λ` for which no solution exists.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure. You can change the value of `n` to solve the problem for a specific case.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution\n    for a given integer n.\n\n    The equation is u(x) = 1 + lambda * Integral[0 to 1] of (x^n - y^n)/(x-y) * u(y) dy.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the equation.
