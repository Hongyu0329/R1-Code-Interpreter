def solve_isomer_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the reaction and determines the number of isomers formed.

    The user is asking about the number of isomers formed when the ligand
    L = 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole
    reacts with the complex C = cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II).

    Step 1: Determine the reaction product.
    The tridentate ligand L will substitute one bidentate bpy ligand and the two
    monodentate Cl ligands to form a stable 6-coordinate octahedral complex.
    Product P = [Ru(L)(bpy)Cl]+

    Step 2: Determine the number of geometric isomers for P.
    The ligand L is a rigid, planar, and symmetric tridentate ligand that
    coordinates in a meridional (mer) fashion. The bidentate bpy ligand and
    monodentate Cl ligand must fit into the three remaining sites. Due to the
    high symmetry of the mer-[Ru(L)] framework, there is only one possible
    geometric arrangement for the bpy and Cl ligands.
    So, the number of geometric isomers is 1.

    Step 3: Determine the number of optical isomers (enantiomers).
    A molecule is achiral if it possesses a plane of symmetry. The single
    geometric isomer of [Ru(L)(bpy)Cl]+ has a plane of symmetry that
    bisects the symmetric ligand L. Therefore, the complex is achiral and
    does not have an enantiomer.

    Step 4: Calculate the total number of isomers.
    Total Isomers = (Number of Geometric Isomers that are Achiral) +
                    (Number of Geometric Isomers that are Chiral * 2)
    In this case, we have 1 geometric isomer, and it is achiral.
