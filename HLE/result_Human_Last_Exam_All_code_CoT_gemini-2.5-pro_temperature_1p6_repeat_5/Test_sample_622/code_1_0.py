    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. 'Mary' is an R-expression (a referring expression).")
    print("2. 'She' is a pronoun. The subscript 'i' indicates 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person.")
    print("3. The subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("4. Binding Principle C states that an R-expression must be free (not c-commanded by a co-referential expression).")
    print("Result: This sentence violates Principle C because the R-expression 'Mary_i' is bound by 'She_i'. Thus, it is ungrammatical.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This question is ungrammatical. The correct form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("2. The error comes from moving 'Whose' out of the noun phrase 'whose glasses', which is an illicit movement (violates island constraints).")
    print("3. This movement leaves behind a trace that is not properly bound by its antecedent ('Whose').")
    print("4. The requirement for a trace to be properly bound by its antecedent is a form of binding principle (often called the Empty Category Principle or ECP).")
    print("Result: This sentence is ungrammatical because it violates trace binding principles.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This question is ungrammatical. It attempts to question one part of a coordinate structure ('Mary and who').")
    print("2. This violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC), which is another type of island constraint.")
    print("3. The movement of 'Who' leaves a trace inside the coordinate structure: 'Who_i does John like Mary and t_i'.")
    print("4. This trace is not properly bound, violating the ECP.")
    print("Result: This sentence is ungrammatical because it violates trace binding principles.\n")

    # Conclusion
    print("-" * 50)
    print("Conclusion: All three sentences, A, B, and C, are ungrammatical due to violations of binding principles (Principle C for sentence A, and trace binding for sentences B and C).")
    print("\nTherefore, the correct choice is the one that includes A, B, and C.")
    print("Final Answer Choice: G")
