    "This is a trivia question about the 1972 film *Solaris*. I will determine the answer by recalling the plot and character development within the movie.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify the character from Andrei Tarkovsky's *Solaris* who misses the sound of rustling leaves. This points to a character who is homesick for Earth and its specific sensory experiences.\n2.  **Evaluate the characters:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist psychologist sent from Earth. A major theme of his character is his deep emotional connection to his past on Earth, his home, his father, and his deceased wife. He has many flashbacks to a dacha on Earth, surrounded by nature. His longing for Earth is central to the film's philosophical explorations.\n    *   **Hari:** A \"guest\" or simulacrum of Kris's dead wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has no memory of Earth beyond what Kris remembers of her. Therefore, she cannot miss something she never truly experienced or doesn't remember.\n    *   **Snaut and Sartorius:** The two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. They have been in space for a long time and have become cynical and detached. Sartorius is cold and obsessed with the scientific problem, while Snaut is more philosophical but weary. While they might be homesick, the specific, poetic longing for \"rustling leaves\" is more characteristic of the film's protagonist, Kris, who represents the human, emotional element in contrast to their hardened scientific perspectives.\n    *   **Gibarian:** He is already dead when Kris arrives, appearing only in a video message. While he was clearly in despair, the specific sentiment in question is not attributed to him.\n3.  **Identify the specific scene/dialogue:** Throughout the film, Kris expresses a profound nostalgia for Earth. In his conversations, he laments that humanity seeks a mirror of Earth in space, not something truly new. His shame isn't about missing Earth, but about humanity's inability to move beyond it. His character is the one most strongly associated with this deep, sensory-based homesickness, epitomized by missing something as simple and natural as the rustling of leaves, which contrasts sharply with the sterile, artificial environment of the space station. Therefore, Kris is the correct character.\n\n<<<A>>>"
