    This function explains the reasoning behind the correct answer and prints it.
    The problem asks how a bacterial population without lateral gene transfer (LGT),
    relying on rare mutations, can acquire drug resistance as fast as a population with frequent LGT.

    print("Plan and Reasoning:")
    print("1. The core challenge for the second bacterium is that its source of resistance (de novo mutation) is a rare event.")
    print("2. For this population to acquire resistance at the same overall pace as a population using frequent LGT, the new resistant strain must spread extremely rapidly once it appears.")
    print("3. Rapid spread is driven by high fitness and strong selective advantage.")
    print("4. A resistance mutation can sometimes have a fitness cost. A 'compensatory mutation' can reverse this cost, making the resistant strain highly competitive.")
    print("5. 'Cross-resistance' (one mutation providing resistance to multiple drugs) gives the strain a massive advantage, especially in environments with multiple stressors. It allows the strain to survive subsequent treatments without needing new mutations.")
    print("6. Choice B combines these two powerful elements: compensatory mutations to ensure high fitness and competitiveness, and cross-resistance to provide a broad, powerful selective advantage.")
    print("7. This combination provides the most robust explanation for how a single rare mutation event can lead to an explosive spread of the resistant lineage, matching the pace of LGT-driven resistance.")
