# Based on the scientific description of the skull of Irritator challengeri,
# the posteroventral portion of the lacrimal recess is subdivided.

# Number of anterior depressions in this specific recess
anterior_depression = 1

# Number of posterior depressions in this specific recess
posterior_depression = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions
total_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression

# The final equation is the sum of these parts.
# Let's print the final answer and the components of the "equation".
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {anterior_depression} anterior depression + {posterior_depression} posterior depression, for a total of {total_depressions} depressions.")
