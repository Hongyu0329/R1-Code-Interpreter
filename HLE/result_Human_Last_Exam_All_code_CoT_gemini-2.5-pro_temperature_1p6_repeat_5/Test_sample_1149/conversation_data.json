    "To determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will consult the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al., \"On *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda) and the Lower Cretaceous opening of the South Atlantic.\"\n2.  I will locate the description of the lacrimal bone within this paper.\n3.  The paper describes the antorbital fossa on the lacrimal bone. It notes that a posteroventral recess within this fossa is \"subdivided by a delicate, vertical lamina of bone into a smaller anterior and a larger posterior depression.\"\n4.  This description clearly indicates two distinct depressions.\n5.  I will write a simple Python script to represent this finding, assigning the number of anterior and posterior depressions to variables and then summing them to find the total.\n\n```python\n# Based on the scientific description of the skull of Irritator challengeri,\n# the posteroventral portion of the lacrimal recess is subdivided.\n\n# Number of anterior depressions in this specific recess\nanterior_depression = 1\n\n# Number of posterior depressions in this specific recess\nposterior_depression = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression\n\n# The final equation is the sum of these parts.\n# Let's print the final answer and the components of the \"equation\".\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {anterior_depression} anterior depression + {posterior_depression} posterior depression, for a total of {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
