# Based on the analysis, n is determined by the condition f(n) > 10.
# The eigenvalues of W_n are all 1.
# f(n) is the sum of the absolute cubes of the eigenvalues, which is n.
# The condition becomes n > 10, so the smallest integer n is 11.
n = 11

# The infinity norm of W_n for n=11 is determined by its structure.
# S_11 is non-derogatory, so its Weyr/Jordan form consists of a single block.
# W_11 is similar to the Jordan block J_11(1).
# The infinity norm of J_11(1) is the maximum absolute row sum.
# For a Jordan block with eigenvalue 1, the max row sum is |1| + |1| = 2.
W_norm_inf = 2

# The final result is the product of n and the infinity norm of W_n.
result = n * W_norm_inf
