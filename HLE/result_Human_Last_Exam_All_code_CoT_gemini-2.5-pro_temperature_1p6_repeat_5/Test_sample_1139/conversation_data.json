    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the correct mathematical space that describes the bosonic sector of the specified supersymmetric sigma-model and then calculate its dimension. The number of variables needed to parametrize a space is equal to its dimension.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For a supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the bosonic sector (the space of non-Grassman variables) is a symmetric space `M = G/H`. According to the classification of these models, the appropriate space is `M = O(2n) / U(n)`.\n2.  **Set the Number of Replicas:** The problem specifies `n = 2` replicas. Therefore, the manifold is `M = O(4) / U(2)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension:** The dimension of this manifold is the difference between the dimensions of the groups `G` and `H`: `dim(M) = dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2))`.\n4.  **Dimension Formulas:**\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(p)` is `p * (p - 1) / 2`.\n    *   The dimension of the unitary group `U(q)` is `q^2`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** We will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final result in the form of an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for a specific supersymmetric sigma-model.\n\n# The problem specifies n=2 replicas for symmetry class D.\nn = 2\n\n# The bosonic manifold for this model is O(2n)/U(n).\n# So we need to find the dimension of O(p)/U(q) where p=2n and q=n.\np = 2 * n\nq = n\n\n# The dimension of the orthogonal group O(p) is p*(p-1)/2.\ndim_O_p = p * (p - 1) // 2\n\n# The dimension of the unitary group U(q) is q^2.\ndim_U_q = q**2\n\n# The dimension of the manifold is the difference between the dimensions of the two groups.\nresult = dim_O_p - dim_U_q\n\n# We print the final equation showing how the result is derived.\nprint(f\"The number of variables is given by the dimension of the manifold O({p})/U({q}).\")\nprint(f\"This is calculated as dim(O({p})) - dim(U({q})).\")\nprint(f\"The final calculation is: {dim_O_p} - {dim_U_q} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
