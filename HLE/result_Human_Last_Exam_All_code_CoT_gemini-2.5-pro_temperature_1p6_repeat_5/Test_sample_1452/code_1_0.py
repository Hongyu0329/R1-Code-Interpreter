# The user wants to find the equation associated with Max Born.
# Max Born is famous for the Born rule in quantum mechanics, which gives the probability
# of finding a quantum particle at a certain point.
# The rule is represented by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |ψ|².

name = "Max Born"
# The equation contains the number 2 as a superscript.
equation_text = "|ψ|²"
number_in_equation = 2

print(f"Name: {name}")
# The final print statement will show the equation including the number 2.
print(f"Equation: |ψ|{number_in_equation}")
