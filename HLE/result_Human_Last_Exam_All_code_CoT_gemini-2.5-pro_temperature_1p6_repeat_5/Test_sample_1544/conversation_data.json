    "This is a complex endgame position where White has a significant advantage due to the passed pawn on d6. The optimal strategy for White is to eliminate Black's primary defender, the queen, or force it into a passive position, thereby allowing the d-pawn to advance.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to find the best move:\n\n1.  **Evaluate the position**: White's strength lies in the d6 passed pawn, which is one square away from promotion. Black's queen on c5 is the only piece preventing the pawn's immediate advance and also poses a threat to White's king. White's queen on f2 is well-placed to support the attack.\n2.  **Consider candidate moves**:\n    *   `Qxc5+`: This seems tempting as it removes Black's active queen. However, after `1. Qxc5+ kxc5`, Black's king attacks the d6 pawn. Black can play `2... Kxd6`, capturing the pawn and leading to a drawn pawn endgame. This gives away the winning advantage.\n    *   `Qd4`: This move is the most effective. It directly challenges the Black queen and places it in a difficult situation.\n3.  **Analyze the consequences of `Qd4`**:\n    *   **If Black trades queens (`1... Qxd4+`)**: White responds with `2. cxd4`. The resulting pawn endgame is winning for White. The d6-pawn is now protected by the d4-pawn, and White's king can advance to support its pawns, while Black's king is cut off and unable to stop the pawn's promotion.\n    *   **If Black avoids the trade (e.g., `1... Kc7`)**: White can play `2. Qe5+`. This forces the Black king into a worse position and sets up a winning attack by pushing the d-pawn to d7. For example, after `2... Kb7`, White plays `3. d7`. Now, if Black captures with `3... Qxd7`, White plays `4. Qd6+`, winning the queen. If Black does not capture, the pawn will promote.\n\nBased on this analysis, `Qd4` is the decisive move that secures the win for White.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chess position from the FEN 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n    and prints the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    position_summary = \"\"\"\n    White's decisive advantage is the passed pawn on the d6 square. Black's queen is the only\n    piece holding the position together. White's best move must exploit this situation.\n\n    The move 1. Qd4 forces a win in all variations:\n    - If Black plays 1... Qxd4+, White responds with 2. cxd4, leading to a winning pawn endgame.\n    - If Black avoids the trade with a king move like 1... Kc7, White continues with 2. Qe5+,\n      which leads to unstoppable threats involving the advance of the d-pawn to d7.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    best_move = \"Qd4\"\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the position:\")\n    print(position_summary)\n    print(f\"The best move for White is: {best_move}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Qd4>>>"
