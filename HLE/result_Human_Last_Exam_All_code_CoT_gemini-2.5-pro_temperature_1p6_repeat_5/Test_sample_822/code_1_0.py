    print("1. Patient Profile and Risk Factors:")
    print(" - Age: 62 years old")
    print(" - Smoking History: 20-pack-years (significant risk for lung cancer)")
    print(" - Occupation: Ship building (implies asbestos exposure, a major risk factor for lung cancer and mesothelioma)")
    print("\nThese factors create a very high pre-test probability for an asbestos-related lung disease, primarily lung cancer.")

    print("\n2. Initial Clinical Presentation:")
    print(" - Systemic Symptoms: Fatigue, loss of appetite.")
    print(" - Musculoskeletal: Pain and swelling in multiple joints (wrists, ankles, elbows). This is suggestive of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a paraneoplastic syndrome strongly associated with lung cancer.")
    print(" - Imaging: Chest X-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules, a hallmark of lung cancer (either primary with metastases or multifocal).")
    print(" - Progression: Symptoms like confusion, bruising, and difficulty swallowing suggest metastatic disease (to the brain), paraneoplastic effects, or local tumor progression (mediastinal compression).")
    
    print("\n3. Terminal Events and Final Diagnosis:")
    print(" - Immunosuppression: The patient's underlying cancer and steroid treatment made him severely immunocompromised.")
    print(" - Opportunistic Infection: In Africa, he developed an acute illness (fever, productive cough, cutaneous lesions) that rapidly progressed to septic shock. This clinical picture in an immunocompromised host is classic for a disseminated opportunistic infection.")
    print(" - Likely Pathogen: The failure of Aminoglycoside therapy and the specific symptoms (pulmonary + cutaneous) make disseminated Nocardiosis a very likely diagnosis for the terminal infection.")

    print("Primary Disease Conclusion:")
    print("The primary disease that explains the patient's history, risk factors, and initial presentation is Lung Cancer. The final septic episode was a secondary complication resulting from the immunocompromised state caused by the cancer and its treatment.")
