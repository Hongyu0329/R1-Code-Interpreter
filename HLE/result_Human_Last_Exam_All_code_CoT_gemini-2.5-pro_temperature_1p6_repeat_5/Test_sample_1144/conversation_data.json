    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). The formula for the minimum uncertainty is Δp ⋅ Δx = ħ / 2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Bohr Model of the Atom:** This model quantizes the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit: L = nħ, where n is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so L = ħ. The angular momentum is also defined as L = p ⋅ r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the orbital radius.\n\n2.  **Formulate expressions for Δp and p:**\n    *   From the Uncertainty Principle, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as: Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n    *   From the Bohr model for the first orbit (n=1), we have p ⋅ r₁ = ħ, where r₁ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (also known as the Bohr radius, a₀). This gives us an expression for the electron's momentum: p = ħ / r₁.\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio (Δp / p):**\n    *   We need to find the ratio Δp / p.\n    *   Substitute the expressions from the previous step:\n        Ratio = (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)\n    *   The ħ terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n        Ratio = r₁ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values and compute the result:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 × 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   Bohr radius (r₁) = 5.29177 × 10⁻¹¹ m.\n    *   Plug these values into the simplified ratio formula to get the final numerical answer.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum to its\n    momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants and given values\n    # Bohr radius (r1) for the first orbit in meters\n    r1 = 5.29177210903e-11\n    # Uncertainty in position (delta_x) in meters\n    # Given as 10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m\n    delta_x = 10e-12\n\n    # The ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) to the momentum (p) is\n    # derived as:\n    # delta_p / p = (hbar / (2 * delta_x)) / (hbar / r1) = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n    ratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum (Δp/p).\")\n    print(\"The simplified formula for the ratio is r1 / (2 * Δx).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Radius of the first Bohr orbit (r1): {r1:.5e} m\")\n    print(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx): {delta_x:.5e} m\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {r1:.5e} / (2 * {delta_x:.5e})\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {ratio:.6f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645886>>>"
