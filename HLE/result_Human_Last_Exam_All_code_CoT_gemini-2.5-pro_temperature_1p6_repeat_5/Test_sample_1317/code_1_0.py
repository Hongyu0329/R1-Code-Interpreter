# The problem describes an interrupted mating experiment, a classic technique for mapping bacterial genes.
# The fundamental principle is that genes are transferred from a donor (Hfr) to a recipient (F-) cell in a linear
# sequence starting from an origin of transfer (oriT).
# The connection between cells is fragile and can break at any time. This means that genes closer to the oriT
# are transferred more successfully to a larger number of cells than genes that are farther away.
# Consequently, the frequency of recombinants for a given gene is highest for the genes transferred earliest
# and decreases with the time of entry (i.e., distance from the origin).

# The gene order is given as thr-azi-gal.
# This means: Time(thr) < Time(azy) < Time(gal).
# Therefore, the frequency of recombinants will be: Freq(thr) > Freq(azy) > Freq(gal).

# We will now model this to find the location with the highest frequency among the choices.

# 1. Assign arbitrary distances (representing time of entry in minutes) to each gene.

    "thr": 9,
    "azy": 18,

    "C": ("Between azy and gal", (gene_locations["azy"] + gene_locations["gal"]) / 2),
    "D": ("Immediately before thr+", -1), # This location is not transferred.
    "E": ("Adjacent to gal", gene_locations["gal"] + 0.1)
}

# 3. Use an exponential decay model for recombination frequency: F(d) = F_0 * e^(-k*d)
#    where d = distance, F_0 = initial frequency, k = interruption rate.
initial_frequency = 100.0  # Represents 100% at the start
interruption_constant = 0.05 # An arbitrary constant for the rate of interruption
