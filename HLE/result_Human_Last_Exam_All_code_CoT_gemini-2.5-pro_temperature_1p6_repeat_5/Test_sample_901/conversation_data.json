    "Of course. This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an E2 elimination reaction, where stereochemistry dictates the final product. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reactant is an alkyl halide ((1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane) and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, sterically hindered base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Recall the E2 Mechanism Requirement:** The key to an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring is the stereochemical requirement for an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. This means the leaving group (the bromine atom) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must both be in axial positions (diaxial) for the elimination to occur.\n3.  **Analyze the Reactant's Conformations:**\n    *   The given stereochemistry (1S, 2R) indicates that the bromine at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are *trans* to each other.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one with both groups equatorial (e,e) and one with both groups axial (a,a).\n    *   The (e,e) conformation is far more stable and is the predominant form of the molecule at equilibrium. However, in this conformation, the equatorial bromine is not correctly aligned for E2 elimination.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the much less stable (a,a) conformation, where the bromine is in the required axial position.\n4.  **Identify the Elimination Site:**\n    *   With the molecule in the reactive (a,a) conformation, the bromine at C1 is axial. We must now look for an axial hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (either C2 or C6).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. There is **no** axial hydrogen here, so elimination towards C2 to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene) is not possible.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:** Since elimination can only occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 remains, resulting in the product **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define reaction components\n    reactant = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 Elimination\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the {reaction_type} of {reactant} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Explain the core principle of E2 on a cyclohexane ring\n    print(\"Step 1: The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) and an adjacent hydrogen (H) to be anti-periplanar.\")\n    print(\"On a cyclohexane ring, this means both Br and H must be in axial positions (diaxial).\\n\")\n    \n    # Analyze the conformations\n    print(\"Step 2: The reactant, a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, must be in its (axial, axial) conformation for the reaction to occur, even though this conformer is less stable.\\n\")\n    \n    # Identify the specific H to be removed\n    print(\"Step 3: In the reactive (axial, axial) conformation:\")\n    print(\"  - The Bromine at C1 is axial.\")\n    print(\"  - The Methyl group at C2 is axial, so the hydrogen at C2 is equatorial.
