    "This problem requires calculating the connectivity of a map between two spaces from algebraic topology. To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces**: The source space is $S = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 )$ and the target space is $T = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  **Define Connectivity**: A map $f: S \\to T$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (a surjection) for $i = k$.\n3.  **Calculate Connectivity of Spaces**: I will compute the connectivity of both the source and target spaces using standard formulas:\n    *   $\\text{conn}(S^n) = n-1$\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Omega X) = \\text{conn}(X)-1$\n    *   $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma X) = \\text{conn}(X)+1$\n    *   $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) = \\text{conn}(X)+\\text{conn}(Y)+1$\n4.  **Analyze the Map's Connectivity**:\n    *   The connectivity of the spaces gives a baseline for the map's connectivity.\n    *   I will then examine the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups. For the specific canonical map in question, results from the literature show that it is an isomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group.\n    *   I will then proceed to the next dimension and analyze the map there to find the precise connectivity.\n\nThis step-by-step calculation will be performed by the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress warnings about a clean exit, as this script doesn't need them.\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper functions for connectivity calculations\n    def conn_sphere(n):\n        return n - 1\n\n    def conn_loop(conn_X):\n        return conn_X - 1\n\n    def conn_suspension(conn_X):\n        return conn_X + 1\n\n    def conn_smash(conn_A, conn_B):\n        return conn_A + conn_B + 1\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation of the map's connectivity:\")\n    print(\"Map: f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # 1.
