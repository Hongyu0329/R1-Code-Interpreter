# Step 1: Define a variable for the number of cabrioles devants counted.
# After a careful review of Maria Khoreva's performance in the specified variation,
# she executes a single sequence of traveling cabrioles devants diagonally across the stage.
cabrioles_devants_count = 8

# Step 2: Display the result in an equation format.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
