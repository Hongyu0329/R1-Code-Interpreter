# Step 1: Define and calculate the golden ratio, tau.
# The golden ratio is a well-known mathematical constant, approximately 1.618.
tau = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

# Step 2: Calculate the value 'a' based on the theoretical result.
# The volume is the only obstruction at a = tau^4.
a = tau**4

# Step 3: Calculate the value of c(a), which is equal to sqrt(a) at this point.
c_a = math.sqrt(a)

# Step 4: Print the results in a clear format.
# We are showing the values and the final equation to verify the condition.
