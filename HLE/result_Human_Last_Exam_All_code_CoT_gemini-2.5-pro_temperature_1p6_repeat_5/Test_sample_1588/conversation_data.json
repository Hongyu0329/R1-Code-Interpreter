    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The BCH formula terms of a given order `n` form a basis for the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y). The number of these terms is given by Witt's formula.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **State Witt's Formula**: The number of basis elements of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra with `k` generators is given by:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n2.  **Define the Parameters**: For this problem, we are interested in:\n    *   `n = 10` (the order of the coefficients).\n    *   `k = 2` (the two generators, X and Y).\n    *   The sum `Σ_{d|n}` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n3.  **Implement the Calculation in Python**:\n    *   I will write a helper function to calculate the Möbius function `μ(m)`.\n    *   I will find all divisors `d` of `n=10`. These are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n    *   I will then compute each term `μ(10/d) * 2^d` in the sum.\n    *   Finally, I will sum these terms and divide by `n=10` to get the result.\n    *   The code will print the full calculation step-by-step as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef moebius(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function mu(m).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(m) = 0 if m has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(m) = (-1)^p if m is a product of p distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if m == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    p_factors_count = 0\n    temp_m = m\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= temp_m:\n        if temp_m % i == 0:\n            p_factors_count += 1\n            temp_m //= i\n            # If the same prime factor divides again, m is not square-free\n            if temp_m % i == 0:\n                return 0\n        i += 1\n    if temp_m > 1:  # The remaining number is a prime factor\n        p_factors_count += 1\n        \n    return -1 if p_factors_count % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for a given order n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    calculation_terms = []\n\n    # Apply Witt's formula: (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(n/d) * k^d\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_val = moebius(n // d)\n        term = mu_val * (k**d)\n        total_sum += term\n        calculation_terms.append(str(term))\n    \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Format the equation string for printing\n    # Example: (1/10) * (2 - 4 - 32 + 1024) = 99\n    sum_string = \" + \".join(calculation_terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    \n    print(f\"The number of terms is given by Witt's formula L_n(k) = (1/n) * Sum_{{d|n}} mu(n/d) * k^d\")\n    print(f\"For n=10, k=2:\")\n    print(f\"The divisors of 10 are: {divisors}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the sum:\")\n    sum_calc_details = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        sum_calc_details.append(f\"d={d}: mu(10/{d})*2^{d} = mu({10//d})*2^{d} = {moebius(10//d)}*{2**d} = {moebius(10//d) * (2**d)}\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(sum_calc_details))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"(1/{n}) * ({sum_string}) = (1/{n}) * ({total_sum}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_count()\n    print(\"\\n<<<99>>>\")\n\n```"
