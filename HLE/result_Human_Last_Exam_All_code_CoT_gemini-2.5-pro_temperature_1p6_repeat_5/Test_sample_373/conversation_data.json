    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: First, I will define the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This graph is constructed by taking two separate complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each and connecting them with a single edge. This single connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Identify Node Types and Degrees**: There are two types of nodes in this graph:\n    *   **Bridge Nodes**: The two nodes (one from each clique) that are connected by the bottleneck edge. I'll calculate their degree. Each is connected to 4 other nodes in its own clique and 1 node in the other clique, for a total degree of 5.\n    *   **Internal Nodes**: The remaining 8 nodes. Each is connected only to the 4 other nodes within its own clique, so their degree is 4.\n3.  **Understand the Gossiping Algorithm**: The problem specifies randomized uniform gossiping. This process works in two steps:\n    a.  Select a node `u` uniformly at random from the 10 total nodes.\n    b.  Select one of `u`'s neighbors, `v`, uniformly at random.\n    The \"sampled\" edge is `(u, v)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    a.  We pick the first bridge node, then we pick its neighbor which is the second bridge node.\n    b.  We pick the second bridge node, then we pick its neighbor which is the first bridge node.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios. I will calculate this sum.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that implements the calculation described above. The script will print a clear explanation of the steps and the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_barbell_gossip():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (K5)\n    # connected by a single edge.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # There are two \"bridge\" nodes that form the bottleneck edge.\n    # We need to calculate the degree of these bridge nodes.\n    # Degree = (connections within its clique) + (the bottleneck connection)\n    degree_of_bridge_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # In uniform gossiping, we first pick a node `u` with probability 1/N,\n    # and then a neighbor `v` with probability 1/degree(u).\n\n    # The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways:\n    # Scenario 1: Pick the first bridge node, then the second one.\n    # Probability of picking the first bridge node = 1 / total_nodes\n    # Probability of picking its bridge neighbor = 1 / degree_of_bridge_node\n    prob_scenario_1 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bridge_node)\n\n    # Scenario 2: Pick the second bridge node, then the first one.\n    # The probability is identical due to the graph's symmetry.\n    prob_scenario_2 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bridge_node)\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of these two mutually exclusive scenarios.\n    total_probability = prob_scenario_1 + prob_scenario_2\n\n    print(f\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated based on the following:\")\n    print(f\"- Total nodes (N): {total_nodes}\")\n    print(f\"- The graph has 2 'bridge' nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\")\n    print(f\"- The degree of each bridge node is ({clique_size}-1) + 1 = {degree_of_bridge_node}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The probability is the sum of two scenarios:\")\n    print(f\"1.
