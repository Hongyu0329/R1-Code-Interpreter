    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the publicly available connectome data. My plan involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch the Data**: I will programmatically access the comprehensive chemical synapse dataset of the adult hermaphrodite worm from Cook et al. (2019).\n2.  **Filter Connections**: From this dataset, I will isolate all the outgoing synaptic connections originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  **Aggregate and Find the Maximum**: I will then group these connections by their target (postsynaptic) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each. This will allow me to identify the neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n4.  **Display the Result**: Finally, I will print the name of this primary target neuron and present a clear breakdown of the synapse counts from both ASJL and ASJR that contribute to this total.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this analysis:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport io\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script downloads the C. elegans connectome data (Cook et al., 2019)\n    to find the main postsynaptic target of the ASJ neurons based on synapse count.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Fetching C. elegans connectome data...\")\n    # URL for the chemical synapse data from Cook et al., 2019\n    url = 'https://www.cshlpress.com/supp/cshlp/2019/849033/Supplemental_file_S1.csv'\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        \n        # Load the data into a pandas DataFrame\n        connectome_data = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text))\n        \n        # Define the presynaptic neurons of interest (ASJ left and right)\n        asj_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n        \n        # Filter for all outgoing connections from ASJ neurons\n        asj_outputs = connectome_data[connectome_data['Presynaptic'].isin(asj_neurons)]\n        \n        if asj_outputs.empty:\n            print(f\"No connections found for {', '.join(asj_neurons)} in the dataset.\")\n            return\n\n        # Group by the postsynaptic neuron and sum the synapse counts\n        # The 'Nbr of sections' column represents the number of synapses\n        synapse_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('Postsynaptic')['Nbr of sections'].sum()\n        \n        # Find the neuron with the maximum number of incoming synapses from ASJ\n        main_target_cell = synapse_counts.idxmax()\n        total_synapses = synapse_counts.max()\n        \n        # Get the breakdown from ASJL and ASJR to the main target\n        target_connections = asj_outputs[asj_outputs['Postsynaptic'] == main_target_cell]\n        breakdown = target_connections.groupby('Presynaptic')['Nbr of sections'].sum()\n        \n        asjl_count = breakdown.get('ASJL', 0)\n        asjr_count = breakdown.get('ASJR', 0)\n\n        # Print the final result in the specified format\n        print(f\"\\nAnalysis complete.
