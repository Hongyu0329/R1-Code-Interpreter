    This function solves the three-part literary puzzle and prints the result.
    
    Part (A): The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School." The faked
    tracks were made to look like a cow's. Answer: 6.
    
    Part (B): With the constraint that the numbers must sum to a multiple of 8,
    and given A=6 and C=7, B must be 3. The theme "education vs mis-education"
    fits, as the novel's commentator, Kinbote, systematically misinforms and
    misguides the reader. Answer: 3.
    
    Part (C): Nabokov's most intensive experience with "intricate back-referencing"
    was his massive annotated translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." Answer: 7.
