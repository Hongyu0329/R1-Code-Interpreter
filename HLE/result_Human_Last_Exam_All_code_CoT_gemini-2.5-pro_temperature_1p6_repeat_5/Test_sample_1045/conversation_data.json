    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atomic orbital.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** As a first-row element, it only has valence orbitals. The `31` part means its `1s` valence orbital is \"split\" into two separate contracted basis functions. Therefore, each Hydrogen atom uses **2** basis functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row element, it has both core and valence orbitals.\n        *   The `6` describes the core `1s` orbital, which is represented by a single contracted basis function.\n        *   The `31` describes the valence orbitals (`2s` and `2p`). Each of these four valence orbitals is split into two basis functions.\n        *   Total for Carbon = 1 (for core `1s`) + 4 (for valence `2s`, `2px`, `2py`, `2pz`) * 2 = 1 + 8 = **9** basis functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of functions is the sum of the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# For a 6-31G basis set:\n# Number of contracted functions for a Hydrogen atom (1s orbital split into 2)\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n# Number of contracted functions for a Carbon atom (1s core is 1 function, 2s and 2p valence are split into 2 functions each)\n# 1 (core) + 4 (valence orbitals) * 2 = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n\n# Calculate the total number of basis functions\ntotal_functions = (num_carbon * functions_per_C) + (num_hydrogen * functions_per_H)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"For toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} C * {functions_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen} H * {functions_per_H} functions/H) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
