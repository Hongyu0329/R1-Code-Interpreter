    "Of course. This is a question about art history. I will provide a script that prints the answer.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the key elements of the question: artist (Curt Querner), artwork (self-portrait), year (1933), context (escaped from Gestapo), and the specific query (what he is holding as a symbol of resistance).\n2.  Access my knowledge base regarding 20th-century German art, specifically the \"New Objectivity\" movement and artists who were persecuted by the Nazi regime.\n3.  Locate the information for the painting \"Self-Portrait with Spatula\" (Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel) from 1933.\n4.  Formulate a shell script to display the answer clearly. The script will use the `echo` command to print the name of the object.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script answers the question about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n# The painting is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel\" (Self-Portrait with Spatula).\n# The spatula represents his identity as a worker and an artist, a tool of creation held up\n# in defiance after his arrest by the Gestapo.\n\necho \"The object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance is a spatula.\"\n```\n<<<a spatula>>>"
