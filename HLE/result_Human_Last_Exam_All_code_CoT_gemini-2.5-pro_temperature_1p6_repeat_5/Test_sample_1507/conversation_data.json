    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the great icosahedron and its outer-hull.\n\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its vertices are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of the great icosahedron is therefore a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the surface of the outer-hull:** A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron whose surface is already composed of triangles. The question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this surface. Since the surface is already made of triangles, the number of triangles is simply the number of faces of the icosahedron.\n3.  **Calculate the number of faces:** We can find the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron using Euler's polyhedron formula: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V = 12).\n    *   A regular icosahedron has 30 edges (E = 30).\n    *   Rearranging Euler's formula to solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n    *   Substituting the values: `F = 2 - 12 + 30 = 20`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n# The great icosahedron shares these vertices, so its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n# The surface of a regular icosahedron is already made of triangles.\n# We can find the number of these triangular faces (F) using Euler's polyhedron formula: V - E + F = 2\n# Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n\n# Number of vertices of a regular icosahedron\nV = 12\n# Number of edges of a regular icosahedron\nE = 30\n# Euler's characteristic for a sphere\nchi = 2\n\n# We calculate the number of faces (F) using the formula: F = chi - V + E\nF = chi - V + E\n\nprint(f\"The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron has {V} vertices and {E} edges.\")\nprint(\"Using Euler's polyhedron formula (V - E + F = 2), we can find the number of faces (F).\")\nprint(\"F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(f\"F = {chi} - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"The number of triangular faces is: {F}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
