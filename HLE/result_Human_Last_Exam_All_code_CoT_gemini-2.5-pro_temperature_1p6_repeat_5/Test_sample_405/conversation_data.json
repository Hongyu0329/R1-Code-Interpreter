    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  I will first identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will determine the distinct, observable color associated with each of these allotropes.\n3.  I will then create a Python script to represent this information. The script will store the allotropes and their colors in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will print out each color counted.\n5.  Finally, the script will display the total number of colors as a sum, fulfilling the requirement to show an equation. The equation will be `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, representing the colors white, red, black, violet, and blue.\n\n```python\n# The main allotropes of phosphorus and their distinct colors\nallotropes_with_colors = {\n    \"White Phosphorus\": \"White\",\n    \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n    \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\",\n    \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n    \"Blue Phosphorus\": \"Blue\"\n}\n\n# Get the count of distinct colors\ncolor_count = len(allotropes_with_colors)\n\nprint(f\"There are {color_count} main observable colors in the allotropes of pure phosphorus.\")\nprint(\"They are:\")\nfor allotrope, color in allotropes_with_colors.items():\n    print(f\"- {color} (from {allotrope})\")\n\n# Build and print the final equation showing the count\nequation_parts = [f\"1 ({color})\" for color in allotropes_with_colors.values()]\nequation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\nfinal_equation = f\"\\n{equation_string} = {color_count}\"\n\nprint(final_equation)\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
