    "My plan is to identify the movie based on the very specific details provided in your query.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** I will break down the scene into key searchable elements:\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bicycle.\n    *   **Action:** Pedaling *directly toward* an oncoming car (a game of \"chicken\").\n    *   **Production:** A Hollywood feature film from a major or well-known studio.\n\n2.  **Search and Identify:** I will use these key elements to search for the specific movie. The combination of a \"pink bike\" and playing \"chicken\" with a car is highly distinctive and points to a memorable scene. This process leads to the 2006 film *Akeelah and the Bee*.\n\n3.  **Verify the Scene:** In the film *Akeelah and the Bee*, the character Javier, who is a teenager, rides his pink lowrider bicycle directly at an oncoming car to teach Akeelah a lesson about fearlessness, swerving away at the last moment. This perfectly matches all the details of your request.\n\n4.  **Code Formulation:** I will create a Python script that stores the name of the film in a variable and uses the `print()` function to display the answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the film based on a specific scene description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The film matching the description of a teenager on a pink bike\n    # pedaling toward an oncoming car is \"Akeelah and the Bee\".\n    film_title = \"Akeelah and the Bee\"\n\n    # Print the answer to the user.\n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film with this scene is: {film_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<Akeelah and the Bee>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
