        'III': "Correct. When taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone in Suboxone is poorly absorbed, making the safety profiles of the two medications very similar, as both are primarily driven by the active ingredient, buprenorphine.",

        'V': "Correct. This statement accurately describes that safety is context-dependent. It contains a typo ('lack of naloxone' should be 'presence of naloxone'), but the overall intent is clear and correct: Suboxone deters injection misuse, while both are similarly safe when taken orally as prescribed."
