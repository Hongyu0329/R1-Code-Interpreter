    The incorrect statement is C. Here is a breakdown of why:

    A. Correct. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) was a period when many Hanfu traditions were formalized. The phoenix crown (凤冠), dragon and phoenix robe (龙凤褂), and the red bridal veil (红盖头) became iconic elements of traditional wedding attire for the bride.

    B. Correct. In the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC), according to texts like the 'Book of Rites', a bride's departure from her home involved rituals emphasizing modesty, which included covering her face with a veil or cloth.

    C. Incorrect. During the Tang and Song dynasties, it was indeed a custom for brides to cover their faces. However, they used a round fan (团扇, tuánshàn), not a folding fan (折扇, zhéshàn). The folding fan was introduced to China from Japan or Korea and only gained popularity during the later Song or Ming dynasties. The specific mention of a 'folding fan' makes this statement historically inaccurate.

    D. Correct. The xiapei (霞帔), a long, decorated shawl, became a standard part of the formal attire for women of noble rank from the Song Dynasty onward, often worn with a ceremonial crown like the phoenix crown (凤冠). This influenced formal bridal wear.

    E. Correct. During the Qing Dynasty, despite Manchu rule and dress codes, Han Chinese were largely permitted to adhere to their own traditions for weddings. This meant they continued to use Ming-style wedding attire, which typically included a red robe over a blouse, a red skirt, and embroidered shoes.
