    # --- Part (a) Analysis ---
    # We analyze the behavior of J_t(u,v) by applying the scaling transformation
    # w_t(x, y) = t^((1+s)/2) * w(t^s * x, t * y) to each term.
    # The L2-norm is preserved by this transformation.
    # We need to find how the other terms scale with t.

    s, p, t = sympy.symbols('s p t', positive=True)

    # The H^{1,s} norm consists of derivatives.
    # The integral of |∂_x w_t|^2 scales as t^(2s).
    # The integral of |∂_y w_t|^2 scales as t^2.
    # By choosing a test function that varies mostly along x, we can make
    # the kinetic energy scale like t^(2s). Let's call its exponent `exp_K`.
    exp_K = 2 * s

    # The L^p norm term scales as follows:
    # integral(|w_t|^p) = integral( |t^((1+s)/2) w(t^s x, t y)|^p dx dy )
    # This scales with t to the power of: p*(1+s)/2 - (s+1) = (p-2)*(1+s)/2.
    exp_Lp = (p - 2) * (1 + s) / 2

    # The functional J_t will be unbounded from below if the term with a
    # negative sign has a higher power of t than the positive kinetic energy term.
    # We check if exp_Lp > exp_K.
