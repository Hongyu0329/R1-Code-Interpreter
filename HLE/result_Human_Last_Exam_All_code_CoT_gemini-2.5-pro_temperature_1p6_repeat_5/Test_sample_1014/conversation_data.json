    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script that implements a standard algorithm for prime factorization called trial division. The process is as follows:\n1.  Start with the number `n` (in this case, 8139881) and an empty list of factors.\n2.  First, check for the smallest prime factor, 2. I'll divide `n` by 2 as many times as possible, adding a 2 to our list of factors for each successful division.\n3.  After handling all factors of 2, the remaining number must be odd. So, I will then check for odd prime factors, starting from 3.\n4.  I will iterate through odd numbers (`i` = 3, 5, 7, ...) up to the square root of the remaining `n`. For each `i`, I'll divide `n` by `i` as many times as possible, adding `i` to our list of factors each time.\n5.  After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is itself a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n6.  Finally, I will print the prime factorization in the form of an equation, as requested, and then state the largest prime factor found, which will be the last number in our list of factors. If the number is prime, the \"equation\" will simply be `n = n`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factors of a given integer, prints the factorization equation,\n    and identifies the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # First, handle the factor of 2, if any\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Next, handle odd factors. We only need to check up to the square root\n    # of the remaining number n.\n    for i in range(3, math.isqrt(n) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n\n    # If n is still greater than 2 at this point, the remaining n is a prime factor.\n    # This handles the case where n is prime or the last factor is > sqrt(original_n)\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the original number was a prime greater than 2, the list will now contain it.\n    # If the list is still empty, it means the number was 0 or 1.\n    if not factors and original_n > 1:\n        factors.append(original_n)\n\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"{original_n} has no prime divisors.\")\n    else:\n        # Format the output as an equation, as requested.\n        equation = f\"{original_n} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(equation)\n\n        # The largest prime factor will be the last one in the list.\n        largest_prime = factors[-1]\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    number_to_factor = 8139881\n    find_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
