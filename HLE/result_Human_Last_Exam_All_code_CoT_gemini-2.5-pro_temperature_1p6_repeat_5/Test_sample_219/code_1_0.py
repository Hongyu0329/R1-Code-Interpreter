    print("Step 3: Analyzing path 'c' (C -> R)")
    print("   - This path links Nectar Caffeine (C) to Pollinator Retention (R).")
    print("   - As with path 'a', the memory-enhancing properties of caffeine make pollinators more likely to remember and return to the caffeinated plants.")

    print("   - Having more pollinators consistently present and visiting the flowers in an area leads to more successful pollination events across the entire crop.")
    print("   - This directly increases the overall yield.")
    print("   - Therefore, an increase in R leads to an increase in Y.")
    print("   - Sign of 'd' is: +\n")

    print("Step 5: Analyzing path 'e' (C -> Y)")
    print("   - This path represents the direct effect of Nectar Caffeine (C) on Total Yield (Y).")
    print("   - Caffeine is a plant secondary metabolite that often functions as a natural defense against herbivores and pests.")
    print("   - By protecting the plant from damage, caffeine helps the plant conserve resources that can be allocated to fruit and seed production.")
