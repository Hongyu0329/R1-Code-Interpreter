    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of evolutionary genetics. As per the instructions, I will formulate the response within a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the question and the multiple-choice options within the script.\n2.  Analyze each option to determine its validity.\n    *   Eliminate options that are incorrect or operate at the wrong biological scale (e.g., adaptive radiation).\n    *   Focus on the primary mechanisms known to explain gene duplicate retention.\n3.  Compare the two main correct models: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\n4.  Justify why one might be considered \"most likely\" in the context of the question. Subfunctionalization offers a powerful explanation for the initial retention of both gene copies, as it relies on more common loss-of-function mutations to make both copies necessary. This prevents the duplicate from being quickly lost as a pseudogene, providing the raw material for future evolution.\n5.  The script will print this analysis and declare the final chosen answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a multiple-choice question about the fate of duplicate genes\n    and prints the reasoning and the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the following question:\\n\")\n    print(f'\"{question}\"\\n')\n    print(\"Answer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find the mechanism that explains both the 'retention' (keeping the duplicated gene) and 'divergence' (the two copies becoming different) of genes.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
