    print("\n1. Evaluating incorrect options:")
    print("   - A (Gene conversion): This process tends to make gene copies more similar, not divergent. It counteracts divergence.")
    print("   - B (Pseudogenization): This is the most common fate, where one copy becomes non-functional. It represents a failure of functional retention, so it's not the mechanism for keeping both active genes.")
    print("   - E (Adaptive radiation): This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a specific molecular mechanism for a single gene.")

    print("\n2. Evaluating the primary candidate mechanisms:")
    print("   - This leaves C and D, which are the two main accepted models for the functional retention of duplicated genes.")
    print("   - C (Neofunctionalization): In this model, one copy keeps the original function while the other acquires a brand new, beneficial function through mutation. This clearly explains both retention (the new function is useful) and divergence.")
    print("   - D (Subfunctionalization): In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of these functions. As a result, both copies are now required to perform the original set of tasks. This explains retention (both are needed) and divergence (they accumulate different mutations).")

    print("\n3. Determining the 'most likely' mechanism:")
    print("   - Both C and D are critically important and correct mechanisms. However, a key challenge for a new duplicate gene is to avoid being silenced or lost (pseudogenization).")
    print("   - Subfunctionalization provides a compelling solution to this initial problem. It relies on relatively common degenerative mutations to partition the original functions, quickly making both gene copies indispensable for full fitness.")
    print("   - Neofunctionalization requires a rarer beneficial, gain-of-function mutation to occur before the gene is lost. Therefore, many scientists argue that Subfunctionalization is a more common or 'likely' initial step for preserving duplicate genes.")
    
    final_answer = 'D'
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print(f"Based on the analysis, Subfunctionalization (D) is a very likely mechanism because it provides a passive and robust route for the initial retention of both gene copies, which is the necessary first step for long-term divergence.")
