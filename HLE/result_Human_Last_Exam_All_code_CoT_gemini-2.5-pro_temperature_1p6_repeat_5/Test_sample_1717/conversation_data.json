    "Of course. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python script to execute.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Values:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  **Find the Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I'll determine the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players in Expert Mode. This formula is linear.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The request specifies an \"infinite number of players\". For a linear formula that increases with player count, this would mathematically result in infinite health.\n4.  **Consider Engine Limitations:** The phrase \"According to the source code\" is a key hint. In programming, values are limited by their data types. I'll identify the data type used for NPC health in Terraria and its maximum possible value. This value acts as a hard cap.\n5.  **Synthesize and Calculate:** The theoretical maximum health is not infinite but is instead capped at the maximum value of the health variable. My script will state the formula and base values, explain why the engine's limit is the true answer, and print this final, capped value. It will also show the equation and the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation and provide the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_terraria_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters from the game's source code.\n    base_health_eoc_expert = 3640\n    per_player_multiplier = 0.35  # In Expert Mode, health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    \n    # The health formula is: Health = BaseHealth * (1 + Multiplier * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    \n    print(\"Terraria Expert Mode Health Calculation for Eye of Cthulhu\\n\")\n    print(f\"Base Health: {base_health_eoc_expert}\")\n    print(f\"Per-Player Multiplier: {per_player_multiplier*100}%\")\n    print(\"Formula: Health = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze the \"infinite players\" constraint.\n    print(\"With an infinite number of players (N), the health calculated by the formula would also be infinite.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria's source code reveals a technical limitation.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Introduce the engine's hard cap.\n    # NPC health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (int), which has a maximum value.\n    health_cap = 2147483647\n    \n    print(f\"NPC health is stored in a 32-bit signed integer, which has a maximum value of {health_cap:,}.\")\n    print(\"Any calculated health value exceeding this cap is clamped to this maximum value.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is this hard-coded limit.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Show the final conclusion and the numbers involved.\n    # We can show the equation with the capped value as the result.\n    # MaxHealth = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))\n    \n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(\"The final health is the lesser of the two values: the result of the formula or the integer limit.\")\n    print(\"Final Health = min(FormulaResult, EngineCap)\")\n    print(f\"So, the final theoretical maximum health is the engine cap itself.\")\n    \n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We can present it as: \"EngineCap = The final result of the equation under max conditions\"\n    # To satisfy this, let's find the number of players (N) where the cap is reached.\n    # health_cap = base_health_eoc_expert * (1 + per_player_multiplier * (N-1))\n    # (health_cap / base_health_eoc_expert) = 1 + per_player_multiplier * (N-1)\n    # ((health_cap / base_health_eoc_expert) - 1) / per_player_multiplier = N - 1\n    # N = (((health_cap / base_health_eoc_expert) - 1) / per_player_multiplier) + 1\n    \n    players_to_reach_cap = (((health_cap / base_health_eoc_expert) - 1) / per_player_multiplier) + 1\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo demonstrate, the number of players required to hit this cap is roughly:\")\n    print(f\"N = (( {health_cap} / {base_health_eoc_expert} ) - 1) / {per_player_multiplier} + 1 â‰ˆ {math.ceil(players_to_reach_cap):,}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- FINAL ANSWER ---\")\n    final_health = health_cap\n    print(f\"The theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is {final_health:,}.\")\n\n\ncalculate_terraria_max_health()\n<<<2147483647>>>\n```"
