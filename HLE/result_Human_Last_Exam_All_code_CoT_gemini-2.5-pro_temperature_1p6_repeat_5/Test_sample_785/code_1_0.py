# Step 2: Determine the dimensions of irreducible representations (irreps).
# Let rho be an irrep of H on a vector space V.
# A_1 commutes with A_3 and A_4. A_3 commutes with A_1 and A_2.
# We can show that A_1 and A_3 must be scalar matrices in any irrep.
# Proof for A_3: Let V = V_+ + V_- be the decomposition of V into +1 and -1 eigenspaces for A_3.
# Since [A_1, A_3]=0 and [A_2, A_3]=0, A_1 and A_2 preserve this decomposition (are block-diagonal).
# For V to be irreducible, A_4 must mix V_+ and V_- (be off-diagonal), since [A_3, A_4] != 0.
# Let A_4 = [[0, X], [Y, 0]]. A_4^2=I means XY=I and YX=I.
# A_3 = [[I, 0], [0, -I]].
# A_3 A_4 = [[0, X], [-Y, 0]]. (A_3 A_4)^2 = [[-XY, 0], [0, -YX]] = -I.
# So (A_3 A_4)^3 = -A_3 A_4. The relation (A_3 A_4)^3=I implies -A_3 A_4=I, which is impossible for an off-diagonal matrix.
# Thus, one of the eigenspaces must be zero, making A_3 a scalar matrix, A_3 = lambda * I.
# A similar argument shows A_1 = mu * I.
# Since A_i^2=I, lambda and mu must be +1 or -1.

# (A_3 A_4)^3 = I => (lambda * A_4)^3 = I => lambda * A_4 = I => A_4 = lambda * I.
# The remaining relation is (A_2 A_4)^3 = I.
# Substituting A_2=mu*I and A_4=lambda*I gives ((mu*I)(lambda*I))^3 = I.
# (mu*lambda*I)^3 = I => mu*lambda*I = I => mu*lambda = 1.
