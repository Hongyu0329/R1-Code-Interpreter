    This function solves the problem by implementing the logic derived above.
    1.  The condition for a manifold to be "full" is simplified to its Euler
        characteristic being zero, chi(M) = 0.
    2.  The Euler characteristic of the specified manifolds M(a,b) = M(a) x M(b)
        is chi(M(a,b)) = 4 * (1-a) * (1-b).
    3.  The Euler characteristic for a connect-sum of l 4-manifolds is
        chi(N) = sum(chi_i) - 2*(l-1).
    4.  Setting chi(N)=0 gives the equation: sum_{i=1 to l} (1-a_i)*(1-b_i) = (l-1)/2.
    5.  The minimal integer l for which this has a solution (with a_i, b_i != 1)
        is l=3. The equation for l=3 is:
        (1-a_1)(1-b_1) + (1-a_2)(1-b_2) + (1-a_3)(1-b_3) = 1
    6.  To find the lexicographically smallest tuple (a_1,b_1, ...), we must
        use the smallest possible pairs (a_i, b_i). The combination of pairs
        {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)} satisfies the equation and uses the smallest
        possible pairs.
