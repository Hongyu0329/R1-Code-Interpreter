    "To solve this problem, we need to find an unknown intermediate state of an elementary cellular automaton, given the state before it and the state after it. We also don't know the rule that governs the automaton's evolution.\n\nHere is the plan to find the unique solution:\n1.  An elementary cellular automaton's evolution is defined by one of 256 possible rules (Rule 0 to Rule 255).\n2.  The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. We will assume periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around (the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and vice-versa).\n3.  I will write a script that iterates through every one of the 256 possible rules.\n4.  For each rule, the script will perform two steps:\n    a.  First, it will apply the rule to the initial state `01101001` to generate a candidate for the intermediate state.\n    b.  Second, it will apply the same rule to this new candidate state.\n5.  The script will then compare the result of the second step with the given final state `10000111`.\n6.  If they match, the candidate for the intermediate state is a valid solution.\n7.  Since the problem asks for \"the only valid solution,\" we expect to find exactly one such intermediate state after testing all 256 rules. The script will print this unique result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton sequence\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    gen0_str = \"01101001\"\n    gen2_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    def evolve(state_str, rule_num):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the next generation of a cellular automaton.\n        Uses periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Convert rule number to its 8-bit binary representation.\n        # This string directly maps neighborhoods (from '111' down to '000') to outputs.\n        rule_bin = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        \n        # A mapping from neighborhood patterns to their index in the rule's binary string.\n        # e.g., '111' corresponds to index 0, '110' to index 1, etc., following the Wolfram convention.\n        neighborhoods = {\n            (1, 1, 1): 0, (1, 1, 0): 1, (1, 0, 1): 2, (1, 0, 0): 3,\n            (0, 1, 1): 4, (0, 1, 0): 5, (0, 0, 1): 6, (0, 0, 0): 7\n        }\n        \n        state = [int(c) for c in state_str]\n        length = len(state)\n        next_state = [0] * length\n\n        for i in range(length):\n            # Determine the 3-cell neighborhood, wrapping around the edges.\n            left = state[i - 1]\n            center = state[i]\n            right = state[(i + 1) % length]\n            \n            pattern = (left, center, right)\n            \n            # Find the output for this pattern from the rule.\n            rule_index = neighborhoods[pattern]\n            next_state[i] = int(rule_bin[rule_index])\n            \n        return \"\".join(map(str, next_state))\n\n    valid_intermediate_steps = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary cellular automaton rules.\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # First evolution: gen0 -> gen1\n        gen1_candidate = evolve(gen0_str, rule)\n        \n        # Second evolution: gen1 -> gen2\n        gen2_candidate = evolve(gen1_candidate, rule)\n        \n        # Check if the result matches the given final generation\n        if gen2_candidate == gen2_str:\n            valid_intermediate_steps.add(gen1_candidate)\n\n    # The problem implies a unique solution, so we expect to find exactly one.\n    if len(valid_intermediate_steps) == 1:\n        solution = valid_intermediate_steps.pop()\n        # Output the single valid solution for the intermediate step.\n        print(solution)\n    elif len(valid_intermediate_steps) == 0:\n        print(\"No solution found.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is not expected based on the problem description.\n        print(\"Multiple possible intermediate steps found:\")\n        for s in sorted(list(valid_intermediate_steps)):\n            print(s)\n\nsolve_automaton()\n```\n<<<10101101>>>"
