    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this riddle.\n\nFirst, I will break down the provided text into distinct clues.\n1.  **The Author:** The quote is from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This strongly suggests the subject is a figure of importance in Russian history or culture.\n2.  **The Subject's Description:** He is called \"a joy-discovering sailor,\" which points to an explorer or navigator.\n3.  **The Mystery:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" clearly states that the subject's burial place was lost to history.\n4.  **The Timeline:** The answer to the location of the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is a key, specific clue.\n\nNext, I will synthesize these clues. I need to find a famous explorer, likely connected to Russia, whose long-lost grave was discovered in or around the late 1980s. A search for these specific criteria leads to Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer who served in the Russian Navy. He died in 1741, and his remains were discovered by a Danish-Russian expedition on Bering Island in 1991, which aligns with the \"late 1980s\" timeframe in a historical context.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function pieces together the clues from the riddle to identify the historical figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The source of the quote points to a Russian context.\n    clue_poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky (a prominent Russian poet)\"\n\n    # Clue 2: The description of the man.\n    clue_description = \"'a joy-discovering sailor' (an explorer/navigator)\"\n\n    # Clue 3: The central mystery of the poem.\n    clue_mystery = \"A lost grave, whose location was unknown for centuries\"\n\n    # Clue 4: The time the mystery was solved.\n    clue_discovery = \"The grave was found in the late 1980s / early 1990s\"\n\n    # Synthesizing the clues points to the explorer whose remains were found in 1991 on Bering Island.\n    solution = \"Bering\"\n\n    print(\"Deducing the answer from the provided clues:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    # The final equation, showing how each clue contributes to the answer.\n    print(f\"The clue from '{clue_poet}' about\")\n    print(f\"a '{clue_description}' with\")\n    print(f\"a '{clue_mystery}' that was solved when\")\n    print(f\"'{clue_discovery}'\")\n    print(\"=============================================\")\n    print(f\"Logically leads to the last name: {solution}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Bering>>>"
