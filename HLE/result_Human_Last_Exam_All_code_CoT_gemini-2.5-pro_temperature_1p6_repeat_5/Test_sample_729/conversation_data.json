    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. Since the order is $128 = 2^7$, this group corresponds to the form $Q_{2^n}$ with $n=7$.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n3.  **Analyze the Power Subgroups of $Q_{2^n}$:** For the generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$, it can be shown that the set of distinct power subgroups is given by $G^{2^i}$ for $i=0, 1, 2, \\dots, n-1$.\n    *   For any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. So we only need to consider exponents $k$ that are powers of 2.\n    *   The distinct power subgroups are: $G^1, G^2, G^4, \\dots, G^{2^{n-1}}$.\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** For $Q_{128}$, we have $n=7$. The distinct power subgroups are $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, G^{16}, G^{32}, G^{64}$. This gives a total of 7 distinct subgroups.\n5.  **General Formula:** The number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$ is simply $n$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will calculate $n$ from the group size (128) using the logarithm base 2 and then print the result, showing the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_quaternion_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group\n    of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # The size of a generalized quaternion group is always a power of 2, denoted as 2^n.\n    # We find n by taking the logarithm base 2 of the group size.\n    # The float result is converted to an integer.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}, the number of distinct power subgroups\n    # is exactly n. These subgroups correspond to G^(2^i) for i = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    print(f\"The generalized quaternion group of size {group_size} is Q_{2**n}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups in Q_{2**n} is equal to n.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    \n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Number of power subgroups = log2({group_size}) = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve_quaternion_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
