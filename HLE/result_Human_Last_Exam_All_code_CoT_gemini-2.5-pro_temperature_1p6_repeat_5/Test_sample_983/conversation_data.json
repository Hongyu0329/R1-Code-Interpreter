    "This sequence is quite tricky as it does not follow a standard mathematical progression. After analyzing the sequence and exploring several possibilities from online puzzle communities, a consistent rule for the entire given sequence could not be found, suggesting there might be typos in the sequence itself.\n\nHowever, a common type of rule for such puzzles involves using the digits of the previous number to calculate the next one. One plausible, albeit not perfectly matching, candidate rule for this kind of puzzle is that the next number is the current number plus the sum of the squares of its digits.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a function that takes a number as input.\n2.  The function will calculate the sum of the squares of each digit of that number.\n3.  Take the last number from the provided sequence, which is 2352.\n4.  Apply the function to this number to get the increment.\n5.  Add the increment to the last number to find the next number in the sequence.\n6.  Print the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence based on a plausible rule.\n    The rule is: next_number = current_number + sum_of_the_squares_of_digits(current_number)\n    \"\"\"\n    current_number = 2352\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the digits\n    digits = [int(d) for d in str(current_number)]\n    sum_of_squares = sum(d**2 for d in digits)\n    \n    next_number = current_number + sum_of_squares\n    \n    # \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # The equation will be current_number + (d1^2 + d2^2 + ...) = next_number\n    # However, to be cleaner, let's just print the sum directly.\n    # The user request might be interpreted as \"current + sum = next\".\n    \n    print(f\"{current_number} + {sum_of_squares} = {next_number}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<2394>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
