# The objective is to find the shortest sequence of commands (L for line, C for circle) 
# to construct a square inscribed in a given circle.
# We start with the circle's center (O) and a point on its circumference (A).

# Plan:
# 1. (L) Draw a line through the center O and point A. This line is a diameter and 
#    intersects the circle at a second point, C. AC is the first diagonal of the square.
# 2. (C) To find the perpendicular diagonal, we construct the perpendicular bisector of AC.
#    Draw a circle centered at A with a radius defined by the distance to C.
# 3. (C) Draw another circle centered at C with a radius defined by the distance to A.
# 4. (L) The two circles from the previous steps intersect at two new points (P and Q). 
#    Draw a line through P and Q. This line is the second diagonal of the square, 
#    and it intersects the original circle at points B and D.
# The vertices A, B, C, and D form the inscribed square.

# The sequence of commands is therefore LCCL.
