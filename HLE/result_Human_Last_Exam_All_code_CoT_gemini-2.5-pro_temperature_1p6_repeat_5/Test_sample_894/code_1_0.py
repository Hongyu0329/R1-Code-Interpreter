def find_nullifiable_propositions():
    """
    This function identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure on the same ballot.

    The analysis is based on the conflict clauses found in the official voter guide:
    - Proposition G (Real Property Transfer Tax) is in conflict with Proposition C.
    - Proposition H (School/College Elections) is in conflict with Proposition I.
    - Proposition I (School/College Elections) is in conflict with Proposition H.
    - Proposition K (Surveillance Technology) is in conflict with Proposition J.
    - Proposition L (Ethics Laws) is in conflict with Proposition M.
    - Proposition M (Ethics Laws) is in conflict with Proposition L.

    In each of these cases, the proposition with fewer 'yes' votes is nullified
    if its competitor also passes. Therefore, all of these propositions could
    potentially be nullified.
