    # --- Question 1 ---
    print("--- Part 1: Complexity of Constant Precision Transformers ---")
    print("We are given a transformer with constant depth, polynomial width, and constant precision.")
    print("\nStep 1: Analyze the core computations.")
    print("A transformer's computations are dominated by matrix multiplication and non-linearities, which break down into vast numbers of arithmetic multiplications and additions.")
    print("With 'constant precision', all numbers are represented by an O(1) number of bits (a constant).")
    print("Therefore, multiplying or adding two constant-precision numbers is an O(1) operation that can be performed by a constant-size circuit (like a small lookup table).\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the network structure.")
    print("Each layer of the transformer computes the outputs for 'poly(n)' neurons in parallel, where n is the input size.")
    print("Each neuron's output is a sum of polynomially many terms. Each term is a product of these O(1)-bit numbers.")
    print("The task of summing 'poly(n)' numbers of constant bit-width is a well-known problem solvable within the complexity class TC0.")
    print("TC0 is the class of problems solvable by constant-depth circuits with an unlimited fan-in, polynomial number of threshold gates (which can count and compare).\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Conclusion for Part 1.")
    print("The prompt gives that the more complex log-precision transformers are in TC0. Since constant-precision transformers are a simpler case where the fundamental operations are less complex, they also fall within TC0.")
    print("The dominant computation (summing polynomially many small numbers) is a canonical TC0 task.\n")
    print(">>> Conclusion for Part 1: The complexity class is TC0.\n\n")

    # --- Question 2 ---
    print("--- Part 2: Complexity with Polynomial Chain-of-Thought ---")
    print("We now allow the TC0 transformer to perform 'poly(n)' steps of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.\n")

    print("Step 1: Define the computational model.")
    print("Polynomial CoT means the transformer's function is applied iteratively for a polynomial number of steps. The output of one step is used as input for the next.")
    print("This creates a model of 'poly(n)' iterations of a TC0-computable function.\n")

    print("Step 2: Show the model is contained within P (Polynomial Time).")
    print("A single pass of the transformer is in TC0. Any TC0 function can be evaluated in polynomial time on a standard computer.")
    print("The input to each step has a size that is polynomial in the original input size 'n'.")
    print("Executing a single step takes poly(n) time. Repeating this for poly(n) steps results in a total runtime of poly(n) * poly(n) = poly(n).")
    print("Thus, the entire process is solvable in polynomial time, which means the class is a subset of P.\n")

    print("Step 3: Show the model is P-hard.")
    print("To prove it is P-hard, we show it can simulate any polynomial-time Turing machine (TM).")
    print("The complete configuration of a TM (tape contents, head position, current state) at any time 't' can be encoded as a polynomial-length string.")
    print("The function that computes the TM's configuration at time 't+1' from the configuration at 't' is a simple, local update function. This function can be implemented in TC0.")
    print("By setting our transformer to compute this TM update function and iterating it for a polynomial number of steps, we can simulate any P-time computation.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion for Part 2.")
    print("Since the computational model is both contained in P and is P-hard, it is exactly equivalent to the class P.\n")
    print(">>> Conclusion for Part 2: The complexity class is P.")
