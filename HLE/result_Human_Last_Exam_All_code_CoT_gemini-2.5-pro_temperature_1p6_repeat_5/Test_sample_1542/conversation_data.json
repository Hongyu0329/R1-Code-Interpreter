    "Here is a plan to solve the problem by enumerating all possibilities and finding the equivalence classes:\n\n1.  **Define a Quadratic Form:** A quadratic form in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is given by the polynomial $Q(x_1, x_2) = ax_1^2 + bx_1x_2 + cx_2^2$, where coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. We can represent each form as a tuple `(a, b, c)`. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms.\n\n2.  **Define Equivalence:** Two forms, $Q$ and $Q'$, are equivalent if $Q'(x) = Q(L(x))$ for some invertible linear transformation $L$. The transformation $L$ is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $T$ with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is a unit (i.e., one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$).\n    If we apply a transformation $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ to the variables, the coefficients $(a,b,c)$ of the quadratic form change to $(a', b', c')$ as follows:\n    $a' = ap^2 + bpr + cr^2 \\pmod 8$\n    $b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs \\pmod 8$\n    $c' = aq^2 + bqs + cs^2 \\pmod 8$\n    Additionally, swapping the variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ transforms a form $(a,b,c)$ to $(c,b,a)$. This is also an invertible linear transformation represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so it is covered by the rule above.\n\n3.  **Find Equivalence Classes:** We can find the number of classes by partitioning the 512 forms into disjoint sets of equivalent forms.\n    - We will start with a set of all 512 forms.\n    - We will iterate until this set is empty. In each iteration, we pick an unclassified form, find all other forms equivalent to it (its orbit), count this as one class, and remove all these forms from our set of unclassified forms.\n    - A Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a good algorithm to find the entire equivalence class starting from one member.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The Python code will perform the following steps:\n    - Generate all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    - Create a set of all 512 forms.\n    - Loop to find and count classes one by one using BFS, as described above, until no unclassified forms are left.\n    - Finally, print the total count of classes found.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # 1.
