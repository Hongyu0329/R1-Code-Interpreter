    "Here is my plan to solve this request:\n1.  First, I will compile a list of notable paintings by Lady Butler and the historical battles they depict.\n2.  Next, I will find the year each of these battles occurred.\n3.  I will store this information, mapping the battle (and its associated painting) to its year, in a Python dictionary.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that iterates through this dictionary to find the battle with the latest date and prints the name of the painting, the battle, and the year.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress warnings that are not relevant for this simple script\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\ndef find_latest_battle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler from a predefined list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping battle names (and their paintings) to their year of occurrence.\n    # Format: \"Painting Title (Battle)\" : Year\n    battles = {\n        \"'The Roll Call' (Battle of Inkerman)\": 1854,\n        \"'Quatre Bras' (Battle of Quatre Bras)\": 1815,\n        \"'Balaclava' (Battle of Balaclava)\": 1854,\n        \"'The Defence of Rorke's Drift' (Battle of Rorke's Drift)\": 1879,\n        \"'Scotland for Ever!'
