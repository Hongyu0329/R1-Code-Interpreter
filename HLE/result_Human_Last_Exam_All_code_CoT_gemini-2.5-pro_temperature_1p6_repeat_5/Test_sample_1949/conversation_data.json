    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Research:** I will search through the text of the Aeneid (and scholarly summaries) to compile a list of all named rivers.\n2.  **Data Collection:** I will find the accepted modern geographical lengths of these anciently named rivers.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Store the rivers and their lengths in a dictionary.\n    *   Sort this data to find the three rivers with the greatest lengths.\n    *   Print the names of these top three rivers along with their lengths as the final output.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # The Aeneid mentions rivers like the Nile (Nilus), Danube (Ister),\n    # Euphrates, Tigris, Ganges, Rhine (Rhenus), Po (Eridanus), and Tiber (Tiberis).\n    river_data = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Tigris': 1850,\n        'Rhine': 1230,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Convert the dictionary to a pandas DataFrame for easy sorting.\n    df = pd.DataFrame(list(river_data.items()), columns=['River', 'Length (km)'])\n\n    # Sort the DataFrame by length in descending order.\n    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='Length (km)', ascending=False)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = df_sorted.head(3)\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for index, row in top_three_rivers.iterrows():\n        print(f\"- {row['River']}: approximately {row['Length (km)']} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
