# The plan is to break down the riddle into its core components
# and then assemble them to form the final character.

# From "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another;",
# we deduce the number of horizontal strokes.
num_horizontal = 2

# From "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another;"
# and "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right;",
# we deduce the number of vertical strokes.
num_vertical = 2

# The character formed by these strokes is "井" (jǐng), meaning "well".
final_character = "井"

# Now, we print the analysis as an equation, showing how the
# component strokes combine to form the final character.
