# The number of closed tree-like walks of length 6 in a simple graph X
# can be written as an expression of the form:
# C(X) = c_1*e + c_2*k + c_3*p + c_4*Sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c_5*Sum(deg(v) choose 3)

# Based on combinatorial counting of the different types of tree-like walks,
# the coefficients are determined as follows:
c_1 = 2  # From walks on P_2 subgraphs (single edges)
c_2 = 0  # K_3 contains a cycle, so no tree-like walks have K_3 as their edge set.
c_3 = 6  # From walks on P_4 subgraphs (paths of length 3)
c_4 = 12 # From walks on P_3 subgraphs (paths of length 2)
c_5 = 12 # From walks on K_{1,3} subgraphs (claws)

# The final expression is:
# C(X) = 2*e + 0*k + 6*p + 12*Sum(deg(v) choose 2) + 12*Sum(deg(v) choose 3)
