    # The text describes Pannenberg's project of formulating a "cosmic history"
    # that integrates contemporary physics and is built on a "contingent concept of time".
    # This project required drawing from specific philosophical traditions.

    # 1. Influence of Georg Hegel:
    # Pannenberg's entire theology of history is a critical dialogue with Georg Hegel.
    # Hegel viewed history as the self-revelation of the Absolute Spirit. Pannenberg
    # adapted this to his own eschatological framework, where God is revealed throughout
    # history, with its final meaning determined by the future. Hegel is the essential
    # background for Pannenberg's understanding of history itself.
    philosopher_1 = "Georg Hegel"

    # 2. Influence of Friedrich Schelling:
    # To expand his theology of history into a "cosmic history" that includes science and
    # nature, Pannenberg turned to another German Idealist, Friedrich Schelling.
    # Schelling's "Naturphilosophie" (philosophy of nature) treated nature not as a static
    # machine but as a dynamic, historical unfolding of the Absolute. This provided the
    # ideal philosophical framework for Pannenberg to integrate the findings of physics
    # and biology into his theological account of history.
    philosopher_2 = "Friedrich Schelling"

    # The correct choice combines these two thinkers.
