    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the key figures (Liu Ban, Zhang Ji) and the subject (seven-character poems).\n2.  I will search for the specific text where Liu Ban evaluates Zhang Ji's poetry. The most authoritative source for this is Liu Ban's own work, *Zhongshan shi hua* (《中山诗话》).\n3.  I will extract the original quote and its meaning to formulate a comprehensive answer in Chinese. The evaluation highlights that the poems are more \"artless\" (拙) than \"skillful\" (巧), but Liu Ban still appreciates certain lines.\n4.  Finally, as requested, I will present the complete answer within a Python code block, using the `print()` function to display the information.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the exact evaluation by Liu Ban (刘攽) on Zhang Ji's (张籍) seven-character poems.\n\ndef print_evaluation():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's poetry in Chinese.\n  \"\"\"\n  evaluation_summary = \"根据北宋刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的记载，他对唐代诗人张籍的七言诗的评价可以概括为“拙多于巧”。\"\n  \n  original_quote = \"原文是：“张籍七言诗，拙多于巧，然吾常爱其‘海燕飞来广陵郡，江帆到日客心惊’，以为佳句也。”\"\n  \n  explanation = \"\"\"\n  这段话的意思是：刘攽认为张籍的七言诗整体风格质朴，甚至有些笨拙，胜过了其工整巧妙之处（拙多于巧）。\n  然而，他并非完全否定，反而非常欣赏其中的佳句，并特别举出“海燕飞来广陵郡，江帆到日客心惊”这两句，认为它们是难得的佳作。\n  因此，刘攽的评价是一种带有欣赏的批评，认为张籍的诗歌于质朴天成中见其功力。\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  print(evaluation_summary)\n  print(original_quote)\n  print(explanation)\n\nprint_evaluation()\n```\n<<<拙多于巧>>>"
