    "This problem asks for the minimum possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space `X` into a Banach space `B`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the term \"number of isometric embeddings\"**: An isometric embedding is a function `f: X -> B` that preserves distances. We will see that for typical choices of `X` and `B`, this number is infinite.\n2.  **Constrain the problem**: To find the \"smallest possible number\", we need to select a specific `X` and `B` that minimize this number. This means choosing the most restrictive, yet valid, spaces.\n3.  **Choose the Banach space B**: We'll select the trivial Banach space `B = {0}`, which contains only the zero vector. This is the simplest possible Banach space.\n4.  **Determine the properties of X**: We will deduce what properties the ultrametric space `X` must have to be embeddable into `B = {0}`.\n5.  **Count the embeddings**: For the specific `X` and `B` we've identified, we will count how many isometric embedding functions exist.\n6.  **Final Conclusion**: We will show that this count is the minimum possible, as the number of embeddings cannot be zero.\n\nThe Python script below will walk through this reasoning and calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite\n    ultrametric space X into a Banach space B by analyzing a minimal case.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1] Understanding the problem\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> B that preserves distances, meaning d(x1, x2) = ||f(x1) - f(x2)||.\")\n    print(\"For a typical Banach space (e.g., Euclidean space), if one embedding 'f' exists, infinitely many exist (e.g., f(x) + c for any constant vector c).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[Step 2] Finding the minimal case\")\n    print(\"To find the *smallest possible* number, we must select the most restrictive (and simplest) spaces for X and B.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the trivial Banach space: B = {0}.
