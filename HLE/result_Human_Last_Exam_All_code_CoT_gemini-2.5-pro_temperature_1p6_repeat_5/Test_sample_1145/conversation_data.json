    "My plan is to solve this problem by first principles of quantum mechanics. The probability of finding a particle in a specific region of a 1D box is determined by integrating the probability density function, which is the square of the wavefunction, over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **State the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)`.\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability density is `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)`.\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability `P` is the integral of the probability density over the given interval from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n    `P = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2 * π * x / a) dx` for the quantum state `n = 2`.\n4.  **Calculate Numerically:** This integral can be solved numerically. I will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function for a precise calculation. For the purpose of calculation, the box length `a` can be set to 1, as it cancels out when using relative coordinates (`x/a`). The integration limits then become 0.495 to 0.505.\n5.  **Present the Code:** I will provide a Python script that defines the constants, sets up the function to be integrated, performs the numerical integration, and prints the final equation along with the calculated probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the constants for the problem\nn = 2\nx1_rel = 0.495  # x1 = 0.495a\nx2_rel = 0.505  # x2 = 0.505a\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function for a particle in a 1D box\n# The function is |ψ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a).\n# We can set a=1 and integrate x from 0.495 to 0.505.\n# This is equivalent to integrating (2 * sin²(n*π*u)) with respect to u=x/a.\ndef probability_density(u, n_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability density for a relative position u = x/a.\n    The factor (2/a) is handled by returning 2 * sin²(...) so that\n    integrating with respect to u=x/a gives the correct probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * u))**2\n\n# 3. Print the equation being solved\nprint(\"The probability P of finding the particle is given by the integral of the probability density function |ψ(x)|².\")\nprint(\"The specific equation for n = 2 in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is:\")\nprint(\"P = \\u222B[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin\\u00b2(2\\u03c0x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\n# 4. Perform the numerical integration\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1_rel, x2_rel, args=(n,))\n\n# 5. Print the result\nprint(f\"The calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n<<<6.579737485292444e-06>>>"
