    Analyzes the camera trap scenario to determine the most crucial image augmentation.
    
    The deployment scenario involves a fixed camera, fixed infrared lighting, and a fixed background.
    Animals, however, will pass through the scene in two primary directions: left-to-right and right-to-left.
    
    An image classification model might inadvertently learn features specific to one direction if the 
    training data (from GBIF) has an unbalanced representation of animal orientations. For example, if most 
    training images show animals facing right, the model may perform poorly when it encounters an animal facing left.
    
    A horizontal flip augmentation directly addresses this problem. It creates a mirror image of a training photo,
    effectively teaching the model that an animal's identity is independent of its horizontal orientation.
    This is a fundamental and guaranteed variation in the deployment environment.
    
    Other augmentations are less critical:
    - Brightness/contrast augmentations are not as important because the infrared lighting is fixed.
    - Color-based augmentations are detrimental because the deployment images are infrared (monochrome).
    - Scale augmentation is less vital because the camera-to-subject distance is relatively constant.
    - Motion blur is a plausible variation, but the fast shutter speed (1/500s) minimizes its effect,
      making it less critical than the guaranteed directional variance.
      
    Therefore, the horizontal flip is the single most important augmentation for improving deployment accuracy.
