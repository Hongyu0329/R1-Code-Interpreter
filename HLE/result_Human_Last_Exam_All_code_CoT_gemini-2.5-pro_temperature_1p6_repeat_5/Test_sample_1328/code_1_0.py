def solve_optimal_feedback():
    """
    Calculates the optimal feedback adjustment factor 'b' for a wireless channel.

    The problem is to maximize the mutual information, which simplifies to maximizing
    the determinant of the received signal's covariance matrix. This determinant
    is a quadratic function of the feedback factor b:
    det = -b^2 + (2 * P1 * alpha) * b + constant

    The maximum of this downward-opening parabola is found at its vertex.
    The formula for the vertex gives the optimal b.
