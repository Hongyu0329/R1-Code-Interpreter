    "To solve this equation, I will first convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers.\n\n1.  **VIII** is the Roman numeral for 8.\n2.  **CCC** is the Roman numeral for 300.\n3.  **CCXCI** is the Roman numeral for 291 (CC = 200, XC = 90, I = 1).\n\nSo, the equation in modern numbers is `8 / 300 - 291`.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to calculate the solution and print the full equation with the answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the equation\nnum1 = 8\nnum2 = 300\nnum3 = 291\n\n# Calculate the result\n# The expression is num1 / num2 - num3\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers and the final result\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-290.97333333333336>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
