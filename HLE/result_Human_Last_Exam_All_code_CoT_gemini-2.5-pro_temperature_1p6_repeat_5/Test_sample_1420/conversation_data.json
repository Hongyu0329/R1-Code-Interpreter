    "In the context of the renormalization group, the critical exponents of a system can be calculated as an expansion in the small parameter ϵ = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension. For models in the O(n) universality class (which includes the Ising model for n=1, the XY model for n=2, etc.), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.\n\nThe scaling exponent α for the specific heat (C ~ |T - T_c|^(-α)) can be calculated using this epsilon expansion. The problem asks for this value for a system with spatial dimension d=3. The most common case studied, and the one we will assume here, is the Ising model universality class, which corresponds to n=1 spin component.\n\nHere is the plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Define the parameters**: Set the spatial dimension d=3, the upper critical dimension d_c=4, and the number of spin components n=1 (for the Ising model).\n2.  **Calculate ϵ**: Compute ϵ = d_c - d.\n3.  **Use the formula for α**: Apply the well-known first-order epsilon expansion formula for α, which is α = (4-n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ.\n4.  **Compute the result**: Substitute the values of n and ϵ into the formula to find the value of α.\n5.  **Present the output**: The python script below will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, showing how the final value is obtained. The final result will be presented as both an exact fraction and a decimal.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
