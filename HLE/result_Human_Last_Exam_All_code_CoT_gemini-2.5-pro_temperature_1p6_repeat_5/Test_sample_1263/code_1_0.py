# The user wants to know if the calculation is possible.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the calculation is not feasible
# due to the 4-bit integer limitation which leads to unavoidable overflows
# during the multiplication of constants.
# The final answer should be "N0".

# This code block is just to provide the final answer in the requested format.
# It does not perform the calculation, as the analysis concluded it is impossible.
