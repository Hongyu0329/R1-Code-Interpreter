    "To answer this question, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Identify the specific paper in question: Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n2.  Research the citations and intellectual foundations of this specific paper. While Einstein's papers from that year are famous for having few citations, they built upon existing work.\n3.  The term \"lectures\" often refers to a published collection of lectures, which was a common format for scientific books at the time. I will search for a person whose lecture series was cited or was a clear intellectual basis for Einstein's work.\n4.  Once the person is identified, I will write a Python script to declare this information in variables and print a formatted string that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the scientist whose lectures were\n    cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Historical research shows that Einstein's work on statistical mechanics,\n    # which he applied to Brownian motion, was built on the foundations\n    # laid by a particular physicist.
