    # with overlapping pain, psychological, and substance use issues. It is the best starting point.
    # Statement V: Buprenorphine-naloxone is a first-line, safe, and effective treatment for
    # opioid use disorder, which is strongly suggested by the patient's inability to taper.
    # It is a key tool in modern opioid management.
    # Options I (insufficient) and III (unsafe) are poor choices.
    # The combination of IV and V represents the best process and a specific, excellent treatment option.
