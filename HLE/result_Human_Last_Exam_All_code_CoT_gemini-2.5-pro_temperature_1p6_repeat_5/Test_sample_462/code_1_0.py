# Define the given side length of the large square
side_length_large_square = 20.0

# 1. Determine the radius of the circles.
# The side length L = 4 * radius. So, radius = L / 4.
radius = side_length_large_square / 4.0

# 2. Determine the properties of the inner square formed by the circles' centers.
# The side length of this inner square is the distance between adjacent circle centers, which is 2 * radius.
side_length_inner_square = 2.0 * radius
area_inner_square = side_length_inner_square ** 2

# 3. Calculate the area of the circle parts inside the inner square.
# This consists of four 90-degree sectors, which together form one full circle.
area_of_circle_parts = math.pi * radius ** 2

# 4. Calculate the final area by subtracting the circle area from the inner square's area.
final_area = area_inner_square - area_of_circle_parts
