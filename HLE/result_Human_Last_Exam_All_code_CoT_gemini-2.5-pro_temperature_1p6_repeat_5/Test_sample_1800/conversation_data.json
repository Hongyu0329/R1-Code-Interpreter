    "Of course. Here is the analysis and the code to address your question.\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single, universally fixed value. It is highly dependent on the catalyst synthesis method, nanoparticle morphology, and specific reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure). The goal is to maximize the dispersion of nickel, create a strong interaction between Ni and the Ceria (CeO₂) support, and generate a high number of active sites at the Ni-CeO₂ interface, which are crucial for catalytic activity.\n\nBased on a review of scientific literature, an optimal range has been identified that balances activity, stability, and selectivity.\n\n*   **Too little Ni:** Results in an insufficient number of active sites for the reaction.\n*   **Too much Ni:** Can lead to the formation of larger nickel particles (sintering), which reduces the active surface area. It can also promote undesirable side reactions, such as methanation during the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction.\n\nThe Python code below summarizes the findings from scientific literature and provides the commonly accepted optimal range for the Ni content. It also calculates the specific Ni/Ce atomic ratio for a representative value within that range.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes findings on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    in WGS and water splitting reactions based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The optimal range for Ni content is often cited in atomic percent (at%).\n    # This is the percentage of Ni atoms relative to the total number of metal atoms (Ni + Ce).\n    lower_bound_at_percent = 10\n    upper_bound_at_percent = 20\n    \n    # A value around 15 at% is frequently cited as a \"sweet spot\" in many studies.\n    representative_ni_at_percent = 15\n    \n    # Corresponding cerium atomic percent for the representative value.\n    representative_ce_at_percent = 100 - representative_ni_at_percent\n    \n    # Calculate the atomic ratio (Ni/Ce) from the representative atomic percentages.\n    # This represents the final equation requested.\n    ni_ce_atomic_ratio = representative_ni_at_percent / representative_ce_at_percent\n    \n    print(\"Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Ni-Ceria Catalysts\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(\"The ideal ratio is not a single fixed value but falls within a well-studied range.\")\n    print(f\"An optimal Ni content generally lies between {lower_bound_at_percent} at% and {upper_bound_at_percent} at% (atomic percent).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis range maximizes the number of active Ni-Ceria interface sites while preventing Ni particle sintering and undesirable side reactions.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Example Calculation for a Representative Value ---\")\n    print(f\"Let's consider a representative optimal value of {representative_ni_at_percent} at% Ni.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to {representative_ce_at_percent} at% Ce.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Ni/Ce atomic ratio is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = (Ni at%) / (Ce at%)\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {representative_ni_at_percent} / {representative_ce_at_percent}\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Ni/Ce Atomic Ratio: {ni_ce_atomic_ratio:.3f}\")\n    \nfind_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<A Ni atomic content of 10-20% (defined as Ni/(Ni+Ce)) is generally considered ideal to maximize catalytic performance.>>>"
