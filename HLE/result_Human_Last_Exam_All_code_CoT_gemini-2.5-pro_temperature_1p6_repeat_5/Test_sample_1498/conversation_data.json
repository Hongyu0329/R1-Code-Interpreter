    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe task is to identify the range of verses (abyƒÅt) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', where the 25 prophets of Islam are listed by name. I will write a simple Python script to state this range clearly.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the starting verse number where the list of prophets begins.\n2.  Identify the ending verse number where the list concludes.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these two numbers in variables.\n4.  The script will then print a sentence that clearly states the answer, using the stored variables.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (abyat) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The list of the 25 prophets begins at bayt (verse) 35.\n    start_bayt = 35\n\n    # The list concludes at bayt (verse) 38.\n    end_bayt = 38\n\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<35 to 38>>>"
