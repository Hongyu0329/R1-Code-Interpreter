    Computes the dimension of the 31st homology group of G with trivial real coefficients.
    
    As explained in the reasoning, the homology of the group G, H_k(G, R), is isomorphic
    to the homology of the group Z^2, H_k(Z^2, R). This is because G fits into a short
    exact sequence 1 -> K -> G -> Z^2 -> 1, where the kernel K is an acyclic group.

    The dimension of the k-th homology group of Z^n with real coefficients is given
    by the binomial coefficient C(n, k).

    In this problem, the group is Z^2, so n=2. We need to compute the homology in degree 31, so k=31.
