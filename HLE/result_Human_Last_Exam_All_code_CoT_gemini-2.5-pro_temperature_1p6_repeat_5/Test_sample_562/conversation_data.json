    "My plan is to write a Python script to determine the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character \"謄\".\n\n1.  I will first identify the radical of \"謄\". The character is composed of 言 on the left and 朕 on the right. The radical is the left-hand component, 言.\n2.  When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as ごんべん (gonben).\n3.  I will then find the standard Hepburn romanization for ごんべん, which is \"Gonben\".\n4.  The Python script will store this information in a dictionary, mapping the Kanji character to its radical's name.\n5.  Finally, the script will look up the character '謄' and print its radical's name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_kanji_radical(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Hepburn-romanized name of the radical for a given Kanji character.\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary for the lookup.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping specific Kanji characters to their radical's name in Hepburn romanization.\n    # The key is the kanji character, and the value is the name of its radical.\n    radical_database = {\n        '謄': 'Gonben',  # The target character. Its radical is 言 (gon), called Gonben as a left-side component.\n        '媛': 'Onnahen', # The example character from the prompt. Its radical is 女 (onna), called Onnahen as a left-side component.\n        '話': 'Gonben',  # Another example with the same radical.\n        '林': 'Kihen',   # Radical is 木 (ki) on the left side.\n        '海': 'Sanzui'   # Radical is 氵 (sanzui).\n    }\n\n    if character in radical_database:\n        return radical_database[character]\n    else:\n        return f\"Radical information for '{character}' is not available in the local database.\"\n\n# The character we want to analyze\ntarget_character = '謄'\n\n# Find the radical name\nradical_name = find_kanji_radical(target_character)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The bushu / radical in the Japanese character '{target_character}' is: {radical_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
