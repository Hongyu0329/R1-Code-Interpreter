    # existence of singular vectors at the corresponding rational level k.

    # Answer to part (b)
    # A non-trivial ideal is by definition a submodule (hence a module for the algebra).
    # Its existence in this context is established by it being generated by a singular vector.
    # Therefore, both conditions are met.
    answer_b = "both"

    # Answer to part (c)
    # Simplicity of V(p) as a VA implies it is irreducible as a module over itself.
    # Since the action of V(p) is a restriction of the L_k(sl_2) action, any L_k(sl_2)-submodule
    # would also be a V(p)-submodule (an ideal). Thus, simplicity implies irreducibility.
