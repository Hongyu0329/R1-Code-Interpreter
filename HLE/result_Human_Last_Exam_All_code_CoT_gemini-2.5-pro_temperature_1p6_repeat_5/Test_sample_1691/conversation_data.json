    "To solve this problem, we need to develop an analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for a small, positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the integral:** The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. For $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the denominator becomes very small when the term $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is close to zero. This happens near $x=0$.\n2.  **Approximate the integrand:** For small $x$, the function $f(x)$ is dominated by the term with the lowest power of $x$, which is $9.0x^{5.0}$. So, we can approximate the integral by focusing on this dominant term: $f(x) \\approx 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n3.  **Simplify the integral:** The integral can be approximated as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}} dx$. The primary contribution to this integral comes from the region where $9.0x^{5.0}$ is of the same order as $\\epsilon$. This occurs in a very small interval around $x=0$. Therefore, changing the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ introduces a negligible error and allows for an exact analytical solution.\n4.  **Solve analytically:** The approximated integral $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}} dx$ is a standard form. Its solution can be expressed as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{-p}$.\n    *   The power $p$ is derived from the exponent of the dominant term, $k=5.0$, as $p = (k-1)/k = 4/5 = 0.8$.\n    *   The coefficient $C$ is given by the formula $C = \\frac{\\pi}{k \\cdot c^{1/k} \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/k)}$, where $c=9.0$ and $k=5.0$.\n5.  **Calculate and present:** We will use a Python script to compute the numerical values of $C$ and $p$ and present the final analytical formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef approximate_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the constants for the analytical approximation of the integral I(epsilon)\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is of the form I(epsilon) = integral[1 / (epsilon + f(x))] dx.\n    # For small epsilon, the behavior is dominated by the region where x is small.\n    # The function f(x) = 9.0*x**5.0 + 5.0*x**6.0 + 9.0*x**8.0 is approximated\n    # by its dominant term for x->0, which is c*x**k.\n    c = 9.0\n    k = 5.0\n    \n    # The integral approximation for small epsilon is I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon**(-p).\n    \n    # The power 'p' is determined by the exponent 'k'.\n    # p = (k-1)/k\n    p = (k - 1.0) / k\n    \n    # The coefficient 'C' is found from the analytical solution of the simplified integral:\n    # I ≈ integral from 0 to infinity of 1/(epsilon + c*x**k) dx\n    # This evaluates to C = (π / (k * sin(π/k))) / c**(1/k)\n    coefficient_C = math.pi / (k * math.pow(c, 1.0/k) * math.sin(math.pi/k))\n\n    print(\"The integral is I(e) = integral_0^15 [1 / (e + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8)] dx.\")\n    print(\"For small epsilon (e), the integral is approximated by I(e) ≈ C * e**(-p).\")\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The final derived analytical formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {coefficient_C:.5f} * epsilon**(-{p:.1f})\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"The individual numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient C = {coefficient_C:.5f}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent p = {p:.1f}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the results\napproximate_integral()\n```\n<<<0.68890>>>"
