    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The degeneracy `D` is given by `D = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Standard Formula:** For a toric code on a connected 2D surface of genus `g` with `b` boundaries (holes), the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the formula `k = 2g + b - 1` (for `b > 0`). In the problem described, the surface is topologically a sphere (genus `g=0`) into which `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes have been introduced. Thus, the total number of boundaries is `b = n + m`.\n\n2.  **Applying the Standard Formula:** Substituting `g=0` and `b=n+m` into the standard formula, we get:\n    `k = 2*0 + (n + m) - 1 = n + m - 1`\n    This would imply a degeneracy of `D = 2^(n+m-1)`. However, this result is not among the given answer choices. This suggests that the question assumes a different physical model or a different interpretation.\n\n3.  **Alternative Model (Infinite Plane):** A common alternative model considers the toric code on an infinite plane with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes. An infinite plane is topologically equivalent to a sphere with one extra, special boundary \"at infinity\". This special boundary can act as a \"sink\" for topological charge, effectively removing the constraint that the product of all anyon charges across the holes must be trivial.\n\n4.  **Counting Qubits in the Alternative Model:** By removing this global constraint, the logical operators associated with each of the `n+m` holes can be considered independent. In this picture, the number of logical qubits `k` is simply equal to the total number of holes.\n    `k = n + m`\n\n5.  **Final Degeneracy Calculation:** With `k = n+m`, the ground state degeneracy `D` is:\n    `D = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`\n    This result matches answer choice A. This interpretation is the most plausible one that leads to one of the provided answers.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes under the infinite plane assumption.\n    Since n and m are not given, this function will print the components\n    of the formula symbolically.\n    \"\"\"\n    base = 2\n    # The exponent is the sum of the number of smooth (n) and rough (m) holes.\n    exponent_str = \"n + m\"\n    \n    # Output the components of the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Base: {base}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent: {exponent_str}\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {base}^({exponent_str})\")\n\nsolve_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
