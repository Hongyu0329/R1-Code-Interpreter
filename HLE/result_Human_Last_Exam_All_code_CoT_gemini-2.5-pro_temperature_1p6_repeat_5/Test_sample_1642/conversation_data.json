    "This problem asks for the maximum number `m` of queens of the same color (m white, m black) that can be placed on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints**: The core constraint is that queens of the same color cannot attack each other. This is the classic N-Queens problem, where N=16.\n2.  **Determine the Upper Bound**: For an N x N board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is N. This is because if you place more than N queens, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two must share a row, causing them to attack. For a 16x16 board, this means you can place at most 16 white queens and at most 16 black queens. Therefore, `m` cannot be greater than 16.\n3.  **Check Feasibility for the Upper Bound**: The next step is to determine if `m = 16` is actually possible. This requires placing 16 white queens and 16 black queens on the same board in valid, non-overlapping configurations. This is possible if we can find two N-Queens solutions whose sets of coordinates are disjoint.\n4.  **Construct a Solution**: We can prove `m = 16` is possible by construction.\n    *   First, we'll generate a known valid solution for placing 16 queens on a 16x16 board. We'll use this for the white queens.\n    *   Second, we'll create a second valid solution for the black queens. A simple way to create a new solution from an existing one is to \"shift\" all the columns by one (with wrap-around). This new configuration is also a valid N-Queens solution and is guaranteed to be disjoint from the original.\n5.  **Code the Proof**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Sets N = 16.\n    *   Generates coordinates for 16 white queens using a known formula.\n    *   Generates coordinates for 16 black queens by shifting the white queens' positions.\n    *   Verifies that both configurations are valid (no queens of the same color attack) and that they do not share any squares.\n    *   Concludes that since `m=16` is possible and `m>16` is impossible, the maximum value for `m` is 16.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_placement_safe(queens):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given placement of queens is 'safe', meaning no two queens attack each other.\n    A placement is a list of (row, col) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(queens)\n    if n <= 1:\n        return True\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            r1, c1 = queens[i]\n            r2, c2 = queens[j]\n            # Check for attacks on the same row, column, or diagonal\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2 or abs(r1 - r2) == abs(c1 - c2):\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by demonstrating the maximum m is 16.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 16\n    m_max_theoretical = N\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the problem for a {N}x{N} chessboard.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the upper bound for m.\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the maximum possible value for m.\")\n    print(f\"The N-Queens problem states that the maximum number of non-attacking queens on an {N}x{N} board is {N}.\")\n    print(\"If we try to place m > 16 queens of the same color, at least two must share a row (by the pigeonhole principle), causing them to attack.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the value of m cannot exceed {m_max_theoretical}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Show that m = 16 is possible by construction.\n    print(\"Step 2: Check if m = 16 is achievable.\")\n    print(\"To achieve m = 16, we need to find two valid, non-overlapping solutions to the 16-Queens problem.\")\n\n    # A known construction for an N-Queens solution where N is even and not 2 or 6.\n    # We use 0-based indexing (rows/cols from 0 to 15).\n    white_queens = []\n    k = N // 2\n    for i in range(k):\n        white_queens.append((i, 2 * i + 1))\n    for i in range(k):\n        white_queens.append((k + i, 2 * i))\n\n    print(\"\\n> Placement for 16 White Queens constructed.\")\n    # This construction is known to be valid, but we verify it programmatically.\n    if not is_placement_safe(white_queens):\n         print(\"Error in white queen construction.
