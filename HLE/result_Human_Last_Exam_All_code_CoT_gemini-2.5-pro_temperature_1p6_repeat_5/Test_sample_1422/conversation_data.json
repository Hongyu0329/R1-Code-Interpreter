    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of vertices (V) required to form a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram. We will assume the simplest and most common type of interacting scalar field theory, which is the $\\phi^4$ theory. In this theory, every interaction vertex connects four propagator lines.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key topological formulas for Feynman diagrams.\n    *   The first relates the number of loops (L) to the number of internal propagators (I) and vertices (V):  `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The second relates the number of vertices (V), internal propagators (I), and external lines (E) based on the type of interaction. For $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex has 4 lines, the formula is: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`.\n2.  **Set up the equations:** We are given L=2. We will use the two formulas to derive an expression for the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of external lines (E).\n3.  **Minimize the number of vertices:** The derived expression will show that V is minimized when E is minimized. The minimum possible number of external lines is E=0, which corresponds to a vacuum diagram.\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** I will substitute E=0 and L=2 into the formulas to find the minimum value of V.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these steps to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi^4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We are given the number of loops.\n    L = 2\n\n    # The goal is to find the minimum number of vertices (V).\n    # We will derive a relationship between V and the number of external lines (E).\n\n    print(\"We start with two fundamental formulas for Feynman diagrams in a phi^4 theory:\")\n    print(\"1.
