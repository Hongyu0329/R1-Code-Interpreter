    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** The simplicial volume of a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$ is given by the formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4$.\n\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces:** According to a theorem by Gromov, for two closed oriented hyperbolic surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ ($g,h \\geq 2$), the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 6 \\cdot ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$. This formula also holds for $g,h \\geq 1$.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, we will calculate the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{31}$ (where $g=31$).\n    *   Second, we will calculate the simplicial volume for $\\Sigma_{17}$ (where $h=17$).\n    *   Finally, we will use these values to compute the simplicial volume of their product, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the genus for each surface\n    g = 31\n    h = 17\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Compute the simplicial volume of the first surface, Sigma_g.\")\n    print(\"The formula is ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4.\")\n    # Calculate the simplicial volume of Sigma_g\n    sv_g = 4 * g - 4\n    print(f\"For g = {g}, ||Sigma_{g}|| = 4 * {g} - 4 = {4*g} - 4 = {sv_g}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the simplicial volume of the second surface, Sigma_h.\")\n    print(\"The formula is ||Sigma_h|| = 4h - 4.\")\n    # Calculate the simplicial volume of Sigma_h\n    sv_h = 4 * h - 4\n    print(f\"For h = {h}, ||Sigma_{h}|| = 4 * {h} - 4 = {4*h} - 4 = {sv_h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Compute the simplicial volume of the product, Sigma_g x Sigma_h.\")\n    print(\"The formula is ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * ||Sigma_g|| * ||Sigma_h||.\")\n    # Calculate the simplicial volume of the product\n    sv_product = 6 * sv_g * sv_h\n    print(f\"The final simplicial volume is:\")\n    print(f\"||\\Sigma_{{{g}}} x \\Sigma_{{{h}}}|| = 6 * {sv_g} * {sv_h} = {sv_product}\")\n\n\ncompute_simplicial_volume_product()\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
