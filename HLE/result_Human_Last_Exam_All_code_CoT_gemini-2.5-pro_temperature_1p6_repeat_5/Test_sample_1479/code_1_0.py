print("   - Structure: 2-dimensional.")
print("   - Description: A function maps a 1D input (x) to a 1D membership grade (Î¼), creating a 2D plot.\n")

# Step 2: Define Type-2 MF
print("2. Type-2 Fuzzy Set:")
print("   - Structure: 3-dimensional.")
print("   - Description: The membership grade is a 1D fuzzy set (an interval), not a crisp number. This adds a dimension of uncertainty, resulting in a 3D membership function.\n")

# Step 3: Define Type-3 MF and identify the key difference from Type-2
print("3. Type-3 Fuzzy Set:")
print("   - Structure: 4-dimensional.")
print("   - Description: The membership grade is a Type-2 fuzzy set. A Type-2 fuzzy set itself is a 3D structure.")
print("   - Key Difference: The transition from Type-2 to Type-3 involves changing the uncertainty model from a 2D 'Footprint of Uncertainty' to a full 3D structure (the Type-2 set used for the membership grade).\n")
