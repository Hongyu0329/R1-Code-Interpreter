    "Answering this question requires knowledge of film history and iconography. The process involves identifying the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks and then chronologically examining the winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture to find the first film that features one of them.\n\n1.  **Identify the Obelisks**: There are two Luxor Obelisks. One remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and the other is at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Chronological Film Analysis**: I will examine early Best Picture winners to see if their setting includes either Luxor or Paris.\n    *   Many early winners are set in the USA, Great Britain, or the battlefields of World War I, with no scenes in Egypt or Paris.\n    *   The first winner set prominently in Paris is *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), but it focuses on interior locations and specific historical sites other than the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   The next relevant winner is *Casablanca*, which won Best Picture for the year 1943. It features a famous and pivotal flashback sequence set in Paris. During this montage of Rick and Ilsa's romance, there is a clear shot of them in a car driving through the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk plainly visible.\n    *   Later winners set in Paris, such as *An American in Paris* (1951) and *Gigi* (1958), also feature the obelisk, but they came after *Casablanca*.\n    *   No Best Picture winner before or around that time features scenes at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, *Casablanca* is the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe following Python script encapsulates this reasoning and presents the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning and identifies the first\n    Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the two Luxor Obelisks and their locations.\n    explanation_part1 = \"\"\"\n    First, it's important to know that there are two Luxor Obelisks.\n    One is in Luxor, Egypt, at the Luxor Temple.\n    The other stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n    We need to find the first Best Picture winner that depicts either of these locations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 2: Chronologically review Best Picture winners.\n    explanation_part2 = \"\"\"\n    By reviewing the list of early Academy Award winners for Best Picture, we can check their settings.\n    Many early winners are set in America or England. Several winners are set in France, particularly Paris.\n    \n    - 'The Life of Emile Zola' (winner for 1937) is set in Paris, but does not feature prominent shots of the Place de la Concorde.\n    - 'Casablanca' (winner for 1943) contains a famous and crucial flashback sequence showing the protagonists' romance in Paris.\n    \n    During this Paris montage in 'Casablanca', Rick and Ilsa are shown in a car driving through the Place de la Concorde, and the Luxor Obelisk is clearly visible in the background.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.\n    explanation_part3 = \"\"\"\n    No Best Picture winners prior to 1943 were set in Luxor, Egypt, and 'Casablanca' is the first winner to feature a clear on-screen depiction of the obelisk in Paris. Other winners set in Paris like 'An American in Paris' (1951) or 'Gigi' (1958) came later.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Print the explanation.\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation_part1).strip())\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation_part2).strip())\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation_part3).strip())\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # State the final answer.\n    final_answer = \"Casablanca\"\n    print(f\"The final answer is: {final_answer}\")\n\nfind_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk()\n\n```\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
