    # Step 1: Identify the two Luxor Obelisks and their locations.
    explanation_part1 = """
    First, it's important to know that there are two Luxor Obelisks.
    One is in Luxor, Egypt, at the Luxor Temple.
    The other stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.
    We need to find the first Best Picture winner that depicts either of these locations.
    """

    # Step 2: Chronologically review Best Picture winners.
    explanation_part2 = """
    By reviewing the list of early Academy Award winners for Best Picture, we can check their settings.
    Many early winners are set in America or England. Several winners are set in France, particularly Paris.
    
    - 'The Life of Emile Zola' (winner for 1937) is set in Paris, but does not feature prominent shots of the Place de la Concorde.
    - 'Casablanca' (winner for 1943) contains a famous and crucial flashback sequence showing the protagonists' romance in Paris.
    
    During this Paris montage in 'Casablanca', Rick and Ilsa are shown in a car driving through the Place de la Concorde, and the Luxor Obelisk is clearly visible in the background.
    """

    # Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.
    explanation_part3 = """
    No Best Picture winners prior to 1943 were set in Luxor, Egypt, and 'Casablanca' is the first winner to feature a clear on-screen depiction of the obelisk in Paris. Other winners set in Paris like 'An American in Paris' (1951) or 'Gigi' (1958) came later.
