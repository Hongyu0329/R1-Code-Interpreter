# This Python script will print the Old Church Slavonic verb form for the
# 3rd person plural imperative of the verb "to be".

# The target form is: (3rd person singular plural, imperative, command or suggestion)
# Based on the patterns of Old Church Slavonic grammar, particularly the imperative
# mood built from the 'бѫд-' stem, the correct form is 'бѫдѧтъ'.

verb_form = "бѫдѧтъ"
print(verb_form)
