def solve_graph_problem():

    This function constructs a graph that has an automorphism group of order 3
    and calculates its number of edges. The construction is based on the reasoning
    that the number of vertices must be a multiple of 3, and the edges must
    form orbits of size 3.

    The graph has 6 vertices, partitioned into two sets V1={v1,v2,v3} and V2={u1,u2,u3}.
    For simplicity, we represent them as {0,1,2} and {3,4,5}.
