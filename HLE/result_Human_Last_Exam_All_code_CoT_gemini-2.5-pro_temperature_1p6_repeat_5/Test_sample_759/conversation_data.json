    "The user is asking for the smallest number of edges, `e`, for a simple connected graph `γ` whose automorphism group `Aut(γ)` has an order of exactly 3.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the group `Aut(γ)`:** The order of the group is 3, which is a prime number. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group `Z_3`. This means the group consists of three permutations of the vertices: the identity, a permutation `φ` of order 3, and its inverse `φ²`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the graph:**\n    *   The permutation `φ` must be composed of disjoint 3-cycles. This means the set of vertices `V` can be partitioned into orbits of size 3. If there were any fixed points (orbits of size 1), they would introduce symmetries that generally lead to automorphism groups larger than `Z_3`. For instance, a single vertex attached to a 3-cycle creates a graph with an automorphism group of order 6 (`D_3`). Therefore, the number of vertices `|V|` must be a multiple of 3.\n    *   The set of edges `E` must also be preserved by `φ`. This means the edges are also partitioned into orbits, where each orbit has 3 edges. Consequently, the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n\n3.  **Search for the smallest `e`:**\n    *   A graph must have at least `|V|-1` edges to be connected.\n    *   **Case `|V|=3`:** The only connected graph is the 3-cycle (`C_3`), which has `e=3`. However, the automorphism group of `C_3` is the dihedral group `D_3`, with order 6. So, `|V|=3` is not possible.\n    *   **Case `|V|=6`:** This is the next possibility. Let the vertices be partitioned into two orbits, `V_1 = {v1, v2, v3}` and `V_2 = {u1, u2, u3}`. The permutation `φ` acts as `(v1 v2 v3)(u1 u2 u3)`. For the graph to be connected, `e` must be at least 5. Since `e` must be a multiple of 3, the smallest possible values are `e=6` and `e=9`.\n        *   **`e=6`:** We need to form a connected graph using two orbits of 3 edges each. Common constructions, like a `C_3` on `V_1` connected by \"spokes\" to `V_2`, result in a prism-like graph with a larger automorphism group (`D_3`, order 6) due to reflectional symmetry.\n        *   **`e=9`:** We can try to build a graph with 9 edges (3 orbits of 3 edges) that breaks these extra symmetries. A good candidate is a \"twisted prism\" graph:\n            *   Orbit 1: A 3-cycle on `V_1`: `(v1,v2), (v2,v3), (v3,v1)`\n            *   Orbit 2: A 3-cycle on `V_2`: `(u1,u2), (u2,u3), (u3,u1)`\n            *   Orbit 3: \"Twisted\" spokes connecting `V_1` and `V_2`: `(v1,u2), (v2,u3), (v3,u1)`\n    This construction is chiral (lacks reflectional symmetry) and the two vertex orbits are not interchangeable. Its automorphism group can be shown to be exactly `Z_3`. Thus, a graph with 9 edges exists.\n\n4.  **Final conclusion:** Since smaller values of `e` (like 3 and 6) lead to graphs with larger automorphism groups, `e=9` is the smallest possible number of edges.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that constructs this graph and verifies its number of edges.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a graph that has an automorphism group of order 3\n    and calculates its number of edges.
