    1.  **CARS Principle:** Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a nonlinear optical process that generates a signal at a new frequency, the anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as). In a common setup, this is given by ω_as = 2ω_p - ω_s, where ω_p is the pump frequency and ω_s is the Stokes frequency. The process is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference (Ω = ω_p - ω_s) matches a molecular vibration.

    2.  **Broadband (Multiplex) CARS:** To acquire a full vibrational spectrum quickly, one of the input beams is made spectrally broad (a continuum of frequencies) while the other is spectrally narrow (a single frequency).

    3.  **Analyzing the Scenario (Broadband Pump):** The question specifies a broadband pump beam. Let's assume a narrowband Stokes beam.
        *   Input Pump: A range of frequencies (ω_p).
        *   Input Stokes: A single frequency (ω_s).
        *   Probed Vibrations: Since ω_p is broad, a wide range of vibrational frequencies (Ω = ω_p - ω_s) can be excited simultaneously.
        *   Output Signal: The resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as = 2ω_p - ω_s) will also be broadband.

    4.  **Distinguishable Information:** Each specific vibrational frequency (Ω_vib) will be excited by a specific frequency component from the pump beam (ω_p = Ω_vib + ω_s). This generates a signal at a unique anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as). By using a spectrometer to measure the spectrum of the broadband anti-Stokes signal, we can map each output frequency to a specific molecular vibration. Therefore, the signal contains a spectrum of distinguishable vibrational information.

    5.  **Evaluating the Options:**
        *   A & E are incorrect: An anti-Stokes beam is the signal that is generated in CARS.
        *   B is incorrect: The entire purpose of broadband CARS is to encode distinguishable vibrational information into the spectrum of the anti-Stokes beam.
        *   C is correct: As explained, the broadband anti-Stokes signal contains a spectrum that can be resolved into its constituent vibrational peaks.
