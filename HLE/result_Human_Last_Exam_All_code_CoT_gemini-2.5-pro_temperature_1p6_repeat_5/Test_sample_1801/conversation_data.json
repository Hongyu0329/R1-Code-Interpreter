    "My plan is to identify the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial. Since this is a knowledge-based question rather than a computational one, I will write a Python script to simply print the names of these two laureates and the years they received their awards.\n\n```python\ndef find_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    laureate1_name = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate1_year = 2008\n\n    laureate2_name = \"William F. Sharpe\"\n    laureate2_year = 1990\n\n    print(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate1_name} (Awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in {laureate1_year})\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate2_name} (Awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in {laureate2_year})\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and William F.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
