    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Re-interpret the question using a key theorem:** The question asks for the number of elements `w` in the reflection group H3 that possess a \"regular eigenvector\" with a corresponding eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. A fundamental theorem by Lehrer and Springer simplifies this condition. It states that for any eigenvalue `λ` that is not equal to 1 or -1, the corresponding eigenspace is guaranteed to contain a regular eigenvector.\n2.  **Apply the theorem:** An eigenvalue of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., e^(2πi/10)). Such a value can never be 1 or -1. Therefore, the condition \"has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10\" is equivalent to the simpler condition \"has an eigenvalue of order 10\".\n3.  **Simplify the problem:** The task is now to count the number of elements in the group H3 that have a primitive 10th root of unity as one of their eigenvalues.\n4.  **Analyze the structure of H3:** The reflection group H3, the symmetry group of the icosahedron, is mathematically equivalent (isomorphic) to the direct product of two smaller groups: A5 and C2.\n    *   A5 is the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, known as the alternating group on 5 elements. Its order is 60.\n    *   C2 is a group with two elements: the identity (I) and the central inversion (-I).\n    *   This means every element in H3 is either a pure rotation `g` (from A5) or a rotatory-inversion `-g`.\n5.  **Analyze the eigenvalues of H3 elements:** We will check which elements can have eigenvalues of order 10.\n    *   The elements `g` from A5 are rotations in 3D. Their eigenvalues are of the form {1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}. The orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5. None of these can produce an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    *   The elements `-g` have eigenvalues {-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}. For an eigenvalue `-e^(iθ)` to have an order of 10, the original rotational part `e^(iθ)` must have an order of 5. For example, if `e^(iθ)` is a primitive 5th root of unity, then `-e^(iθ) = e^(πi) * e^(2πi/5) = e^(7πi/5)`, which is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n6.  **Identify the target elements:** We conclude that an element of H3 has an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if it is of the form `-g`, where `g` is an element of order 5 in A5.\n7.  **Count the elements:** The final step is to count how many elements of order 5 exist in the group A5. In A5 (the group of even permutations of 5 items), the elements of order 5 are the 5-cycles. The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group S5 is calculated as (5-1)!. Since all 5-cycles are even permutations, they all belong to A5.\n\nThis plan reduces a complex group theory question to a straightforward combinatorial calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Explain the problem's simplification based on group theory.\nprint(\"The question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group H3\")\nprint(\"that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step reasoning:\")\nprint(\"1.
