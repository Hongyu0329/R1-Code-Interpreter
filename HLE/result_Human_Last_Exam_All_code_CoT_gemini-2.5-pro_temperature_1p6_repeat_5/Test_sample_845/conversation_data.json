    "The user is asking for the specific term used to describe the time value between consecutive heartbeats, which is the basis for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the correct terminology for the time interval between heartbeats. This value is most commonly referred to as the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or the R-R interval (named after the R-peak in an ECG waveform, but the term is often used generically). Since the user mentioned PPG, Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) is a very appropriate and general term.\n2.  Create a simple Python script.\n3.  The script will define a variable holding the name of this value.\n4.  The script will then print an explanatory sentence containing the term, directly answering the user's question.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the name of the value computed between heartbeats to measure HRV.\n# This value is the duration of the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats.\n# The most common and technically accurate term for this is the \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI).\n\n# Define the term as a string.\nterm = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n\n# Print the answer in a clear statement.\nprint(f\"The value computed as the time between consecutive heartbeats for HRV calculation is called the: {term}\")\n\n```\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
