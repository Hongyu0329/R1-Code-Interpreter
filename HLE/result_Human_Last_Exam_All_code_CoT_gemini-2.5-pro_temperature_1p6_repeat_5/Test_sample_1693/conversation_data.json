    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the ship and present the answer.\n\nFirst, I will research the naval and maritime losses of France during World War II, specifically focusing on the period before the armistice was signed on June 22, 1940. I will filter these losses to only include those caused by German U-boats, which can include direct torpedo attacks or mines laid by U-boats.\n\nNext, for each ship identified, I will find its displacement or tonnage to determine which was the largest. Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear statement answering the question, including the ship's name and its tonnage.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_ship_sunk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a German U-boat's action before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical data for the ship\n    ship_name = \"SS Champlain\"\n    ship_type = \"passenger liner\"\n    tonnage = 28124  # Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)\n    u_boat = \"U-65\"\n    cause = \"a mine laid by the U-boat\"\n\n    # Dates\n    sunk_year = 1940\n    sunk_month = 6\n    sunk_day = 17\n\n    armistice_year = 1940\n    armistice_month = 6\n    armistice_day = 22\n\n    # Print the detailed answer\n    print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat's action before the armistice of {armistice_month}/{armistice_day}/{armistice_year} was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {sunk_month}/{sunk_day}/{sunk_year} after striking {cause} '{u_boat}'.\")\n    print(f\"The ship had a displacement of {tonnage} Gross Register Tons.\")\n    print(f\"The ship in question is: {ship_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_largest_ship_sunk()\n```\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
