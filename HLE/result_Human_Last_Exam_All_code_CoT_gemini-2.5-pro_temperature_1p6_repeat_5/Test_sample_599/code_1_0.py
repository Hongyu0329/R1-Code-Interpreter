# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# As determined by the analysis, the sequence of segmented numbers
# corresponds to the powers of 2 (starting from 2^0).
# The Nth segmented number is 2^(N-1).

# Define the position in the sequence
n = 50

# The base of the power is always 2 for this sequence.
base = 2

# The exponent is N-1.
exponent = n - 1

# Calculate the result. Python handles large integers automatically.
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation and its components as requested.
# The equation for the 50th element is 2^49.
print(f"The {n}th segmented number is given by the equation: {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The result is: {result}")
