# This script evaluates 10 statements about the geologic history of the North American Cordillera.
# Each statement is classified as a "Consensus" (C) or "Debated" (D) view.
# The final output is a continuous string of these classifications.

# Statement 1: The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> C
# Statement 2: Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> D
# Statement 3: An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed by the end of the Cretaceous. -> D
# Statement 4: An "Arizonaplano" was constructed via magmatic thickening. -> D
# Statement 5: Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> C
# Statement 6: The Sierra Nevada and Idaho Batholiths were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc. -> C
# Statement 7: A series of large ignimbrite eruptions began in the Eocene and propagated southwest. -> C
# Statement 8: The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous. -> D
# Statement 9: The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene. -> D
# Statement 10: Laramide-style deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. -> D
