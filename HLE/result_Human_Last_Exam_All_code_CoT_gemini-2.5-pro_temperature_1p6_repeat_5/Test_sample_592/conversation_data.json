    "My plan is to first identify the specific detail requested from the movie \"Ovosodo\". This is a factual lookup, not a computational task. I will search for a plot summary of the 1997 film to determine the US city where the character Tommaso moves. Once I have found the correct city, I will write a simple Python script to store this information in a variable and then print it out in a clear sentence, as requested by the user format.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify a specific detail from the plot of the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\".\n# I will find the information and then present it using this script.\n\n# The US city the character Tommaso moves to.\nus_city = \"New York City\"\n\n# Print the final answer in a sentence.\nprint(f\"In the movie Ovosodo, Tommaso moves to {us_city}.\")\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
