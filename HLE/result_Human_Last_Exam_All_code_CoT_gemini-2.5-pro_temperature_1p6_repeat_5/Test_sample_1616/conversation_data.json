    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a long (or tense) vowel becomes short (or lax) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word). For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables, and its vowel must have been tense in its root form.\n\nMy plan is to analyze each word based on these criteria:\n1.  **Syllable Count:** Does the word have three or more syllables? If not, trisyllabic laxing cannot apply.\n2.  **Root Vowel:** If the word has three or more syllables, is the vowel in the third-to-last syllable derived from a related word where that vowel is long/tense?\n\nI will write a Python script that stores this linguistic information and systematically checks each word against the rule to find the one that has not undergone the change.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_data = {\n        'southern': {\n            'syllables': 2,\n            'root': 'south (/aʊ/)',\n            'analysis': \"Has only 2 syllables.
