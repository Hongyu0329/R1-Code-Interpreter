    # Principle: Vicarious Liability
    # An employer is liable for the negligent acts of an employee committed
    # within the scope of their employment. The employee remains directly liable.
    # When two parties are liable for the same damage, they are jointly and severally liable.

    # --- Incident 1: Mark and the Pool ---
    # Mark was negligent while performing his job.
    # Conclusion: Mark is directly liable, and Evergreen is vicariously liable.

    # Conclusion: Lincoln is directly liable, and Evergreen is vicariously liable.
