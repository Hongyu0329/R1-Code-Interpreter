    "Here is a plan to compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\):\n\n1.  **Identify the corresponding quadratic irrational.** For a rational number \\( p/q \\), the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with the quadratic irrational number \\( \\alpha_{p/q} = \\frac{3q - 2p + \\sqrt{9q^2 - 4}}{2q} \\). For this problem, \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\).\n\n2.  **Calculate the value of \\( \\alpha_{4/7} \\).**\n    *   \\( p = 4, q = 7 \\)\n    *   Numerator constant part: \\( 3q - 2p = 3(7) - 2(4) = 21 - 8 = 13 \\).\n    *   Value under the square root: \\( D = 9q^2 - 4 = 9(7^2) - 4 = 9(49) - 4 = 441 - 4 = 437 \\).\n    *   Denominator: \\( 2q = 2(7) = 14 \\).\n    *   So, the number is \\( \\alpha = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{437}}{14} \\).\n\n3.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\( \\alpha \\).** The standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a number \\( \\xi \\) is iterative:\n    *   Set \\( \\xi_0 = \\xi \\).\n    *   For \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\):\n        *   \\( a_k = \\lfloor \\xi_k \\rfloor \\) (the integer part).\n        *   \\( \\xi_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_k - a_k} \\).\n    *   The process is repeated until the term \\( \\xi_k \\) repeats, which indicates that the continued fraction is periodic.\n\n4.  **Implement the algorithm in Python.** To avoid floating-point inaccuracies, the number \\( \\xi_k \\) will be represented symbolically as a fraction of the form \\( \\frac{\\text{num} + \\text{num\\_sqrt} \\cdot \\sqrt{D}}{\\text{den}} \\). The algorithm will track the integer coefficients `(num, num_sqrt, den)` and stop when a set of these coefficients repeats. The resulting sequence of integer parts `a_k` forms the continued fraction.\n\n5.  **Present the final result.** The code will print the final equation showing the computed sequence of coefficients for the continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef simplify_fraction(num, num_sqrt, den, D):\n    \"\"\"Simplifies the fractional representation by dividing by the GCD.\"\"\"\n    if den < 0:\n        num = -num\n        num_sqrt = -num_sqrt\n        den = -den\n    common_divisor = gcd(gcd(num, num_sqrt), den)\n    return num // common_divisor, num_sqrt // common_divisor, den // common_divisor\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    This corresponds to the continued fraction of alpha = (3q - 2p + sqrt(9q^2 - 4)) / (2q).\n    \"\"\"\n    D = 9 * q**2 - 4\n    \n    # Initial state for alpha\n    num = 3 * q - 2 * p\n    num_sqrt = 1\n    den = 2 * q\n\n    # Store computed coefficients and visited states to detect cycles\n    coeffs = []\n    visited_states = {}\n    \n    # The initial state, simplified\n    state = simplify_fraction(num, num_sqrt, den, D)\n\n    # Loop until a state repeats\n    while state not in visited_states:\n        visited_states[state] = len(coeffs)\n        \n        num, num_sqrt, den = state\n        \n        # Calculate the integer part a_k\n        # a_k = floor((num + num_sqrt * sqrt(D)) / den)\n        # Using floating point for floor is safe here\n        a_k = math.floor((num + num_sqrt * math.sqrt(D)) / den)\n        coeffs.append(a_k)\n        \n        # Calculate the next state for alpha_{k+1} = 1 / (alpha_k - a_k)\n        # alpha_k - a_k = (num + num_sqrt*sqrt(D))/den - a_k\n        #               = (num - a_k*den + num_sqrt*sqrt(D)) / den\n        \n        # 1 / (alpha_k - a_k) = den / (num - a_k*den + num_sqrt*sqrt(D))\n        # Rationalize the denominator:\n        # Multiply by (num - a_k*den - num_sqrt*sqrt(D))\n        \n        next_num_part = num - a_k * den\n        \n        next_den = next_num_part**2 - (num_sqrt**2) * D\n        next_num = den * next_num_part\n        next_num_sqrt = -den * num_sqrt\n\n        state = simplify_fraction(next_num, next_num_sqrt, next_den, D)\n\n    # A cycle is detected.
