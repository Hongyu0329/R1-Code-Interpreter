# The task is to identify the product of a two-step organic synthesis reaction.

# Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation
# The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two directing groups
# on the benzene ring: the amide at position 1 and the dimethylamino group at position 3.
# Both groups direct the strong base (sec-BuLi) to deprotonate the C-2 position.
# This creates a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate at position 2.

# Step 2: Electrophilic Quench
# The aryllithium intermediate reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).
# A methyl group is added to the C-2 position of the ring.

# The name of the final product is constructed by adding "2-methyl" to the
# starting material's name and ordering the ring substituents alphabetically.
# The numbers in the name specify the positions of the substituent groups.
# 'dimethylamino' comes before 'methyl' alphabetically.
# The number for the dimethylamino group is 3.
# The number for the new methyl group is 2.
