# The user wants to identify the correct first-line treatment for a patient in hemorrhagic shock.

# Patient data:
# Diagnosis: Hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock due to femur fracture.
# Vitals: HR 160, BP 40/60.
# Symptoms: Disoriented, cold/clammy skin, active bleeding.
# Labs: Hb 6 gm/dL.

# Treatment Goal: The primary and immediate goal is to restore circulating blood volume to improve tissue perfusion and blood pressure. This is called fluid resuscitation.

# Analysis of options:
# A. Lay down the person and elevate legs along with CPR.
#    - Elevating legs is a good temporary measure.
#    - CPR is only for cardiac arrest (no pulse). This patient has a pulse of 160. This is incorrect and harmful.
# B. Administer anticlotting medicine such as aspirin or heparin.
#    - The patient is bleeding profusely. Anticoagulants would worsen the hemorrhage. This is incorrect and dangerous.
# C. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline or Ringer's lactate.
#    - This is the standard of care for initial resuscitation in hypovolemic shock.
#    - Normal saline and Ringer's lactate are isotonic crystalloid fluids used to rapidly expand intravascular volume. This is the correct answer.
# D. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline.
#    - This is a correct action, but it is a subset of option C. Option C is more comprehensive as it includes Ringer's lactate, another standard and often preferred fluid.
# E. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline with fructose.
#    - Sugar-containing solutions are not used for initial volume resuscitation as the sugar is metabolized, leaving hypotonic free water which is not effective at staying in the vascular space.

# The best and most comprehensive answer is C.
# It addresses the immediate life threat (circulatory collapse) with the standard, appropriate medical intervention.

# Printing the rationale for the final choice.
print("The patient is in severe hypovolemic (hemorrhagic) shock due to significant blood loss from a femur fracture.")
print("The immediate priority is to restore circulating volume to raise blood pressure and perfuse vital organs.")
print("The standard first-line treatment is rapid intravenous infusion of isotonic crystalloid solutions.")
print("Both Normal Saline and Ringer's Lactate are standard isotonic crystalloids for this purpose.")
print("Therefore, the most correct and comprehensive choice is 'Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline or Ringer's lactate'.")
