        "3. Key enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) are rapidly mobilized to neutralize the ROS as they are formed. This constitutes the initial response.",
        "4. Other components like liposoluble and hydrosoluble antioxidants are also involved, but the enzymatic system is the primary 'activatable' and initial defense mechanism against an acute stress event."
