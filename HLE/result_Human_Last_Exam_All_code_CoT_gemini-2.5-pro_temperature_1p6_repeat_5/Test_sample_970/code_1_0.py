    Determines the necessary assumptions for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent
    to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The analysis shows that either of two conditions is sufficient:
    1.  (a) The prior distribution over models has finite entropy. This provides an absolute
        bound on the total amount of information that can be learned.
    2.  (c) The agent's policy induces a state occupancy distribution that converges. This ensures
        the data-gathering process stabilizes, allowing learning to complete.

    To guarantee a proof, we must assume that the case where both conditions are false
    does not occur. This means we need to assume (a OR c).

    The result is formatted into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as requested.
