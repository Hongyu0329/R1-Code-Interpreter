    "Of course. To solve this, we will rely on the known results of the Gauss class number problem. The problem of finding all imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number has been computationally solved for class numbers up to 100 by M. Watkins. We can use these established results to answer your question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the list of all known negative fundamental discriminants (`d`) for which the class number `h(d)` is 48. This data comes from published mathematical research.\n2.  Create a Python list containing all these discriminants. By having them explicitly in the code, all numbers involved in the final count are present.\n3.  Use the `len()` function to count the number of elements in this list.\n4.  Print the final count in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\nThis approach provides a correct and verifiable answer by programmatically counting the elements from the complete known set.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Gauss class number problem for h=48 by using pre-computed results.\n\n    The function identifies the number of negative fundamental discriminants\n    that have a class number of 48.
