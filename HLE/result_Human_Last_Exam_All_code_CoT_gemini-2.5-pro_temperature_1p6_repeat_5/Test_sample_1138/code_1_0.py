    A step-by-step analysis leads to the following conclusions:

    1. Premise: The question describes ECDSA as "existentially forgeable". This likely refers to its signature malleability, where a new signature can be created for an existing message. This violates Strong Existential Unforgeability (sEUF-CMA).

    2. Option A (False): Due to signature malleability, an adversary can easily create a new ECDSA signature for a message that has already been signed. The probability of success is high (non-negligible), not negligible.

    3. Option B (True): Recovering the secret key from a public key and signature in ECDSA is computationally equivalent to solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is considered intractable. The probability of success for an adversary is negligible.

    4. Option C (True): The statement says this is true for "some" schemes. For example, in textbook RSA signatures (which are existentially forgeable), an attacker can forge a signature for the message m=1 without the secret key.

    5. Option D (False): The statement claims message recovery is hard for "all" such schemes. However, in textbook RSA, the message can be recovered from the signature via m = sig^e mod N. This serves as a counterexample.

    Conclusion: Since both statements B and C are true, the correct answer is E.
