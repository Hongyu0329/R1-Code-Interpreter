# Given values from the problem description
Ro = 3.0  # Basic reproduction number
breakthrough_rate = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people got the infection

# Step 1: Calculate the herd immunity threshold (p_i).
# This is the minimum proportion of the population that needs to be immune to
# prevent the epidemic.
# The formula is p_i = 1 - 1/Ro
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / Ro)

# Step 2: Calculate the vaccine effectiveness (e).
# If 6% of vaccinated people get the infection, the vaccine is 94% effective
# at preventing infection.
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - breakthrough_rate

# Step 3: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c).
# This is the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated,
# accounting for the vaccine's effectiveness.
# The formula is p_c = p_i / e
critical_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_effectiveness

# Output the results and the calculation steps

print(f"\nConclusion: To prevent the spread of the virus, the theoretical threshold for vaccine coverage is approximately {critical_coverage:.1%}.")
