Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions ready here for Atorvastatin {atorvastatin_dose}mg, Junel Fe {junel_fe_dose_1}/{junel_fe_dose_2}mg, and Fluoxetine {fluoxetine_dose}mg.

I noticed you mentioned taking Excedrin for your headache. I want to provide some important information about that. Your Fluoxetine {fluoxetine_dose}mg can increase the risk of bleeding, and the {excedrin_components} in Excedrin does the same. Taking them together can further increase your risk of stomach or intestinal bleeding.

For future headaches, I would recommend using a product with just acetaminophen, like Tylenol, instead of Excedrin to avoid this interaction. If your headaches continue, you should follow up with your doctor.
