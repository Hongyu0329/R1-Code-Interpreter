Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions ready here for Atorvastatin 20mg, Junel Fe 1.5/30mg, and Fluoxetine 20mg.

I noticed you mentioned taking Excedrin for your headache. I want to provide some important information about that. Your Fluoxetine 20mg can increase the risk of bleeding, and the Aspirin in Excedrin does the same. Taking them together can further increase your risk of stomach or intestinal bleeding.

For future headaches, I would recommend using a product with just acetaminophen, like Tylenol, instead of Excedrin to avoid this interaction. If your headaches continue, you should follow up with your doctor.
