    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we need to perform a case-by-case analysis of all possible structures and then identify the unique ones.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Basic Setup**: A category requires objects, morphisms, identity morphisms for each object, and an associative composition law.\n    *   Let the two objects be `A` and `B`.\n    *   Every category with these objects must include an identity morphism `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n    *   We are given a total of 4 morphisms. Since 2 are identities, this leaves 2 non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Distribution of Morphisms**: The non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among four possible `Hom-sets`:\n    *   `Hom(A, A)`: morphisms from `A` to `A`.\n    *   `Hom(A, B)`: morphisms from `A` to `B`.\n    *   `Hom(B, A)`: morphisms from `B` to `A`.\n    *   `Hom(B, B)`: morphisms from `B` to `B`.\n\n    Let `m_AA, m_AB, m_BA, m_BB` be the counts of non-identity morphisms in these sets, respectively. We must have `m_AA + m_AB + m_BA + m_BB = 2`.\n\n3.  **Enumerating Cases**: We list the integer solutions to the equation above. We can group these solutions by isomorphism. An isomorphism can swap the objects `A` and `B`. This corresponds to swapping `m_AA` with `m_BB` and `m_AB` with `m_BA`. This reduces the number of distinct structural cases to analyze.\n\n    The partitions of 2 are `2` and `1+1`. This leads to the following cases (up to isomorphism between `A` and `B`):\n    *   **Case 1**: `(2, 0, 0, 0)`: Two non-identity morphisms in `Hom(A, A)`.\n    *   **Case 2**: `(0, 2, 0, 0)`: Two non-identity morphisms in `Hom(A, B)`.\n    *   **Case 3**: `(1, 1, 0, 0)`: One non-identity in `Hom(A, A)` and one in `Hom(A, B)`.\n    *   **Case 4**: `(1, 0, 1, 0)`: One non-identity in `Hom(A, A)` and one in `Hom(B, A)`.\n    *   **Case 5**: `(1, 0, 0, 1)`: One non-identity in `Hom(A, A)` and one in `Hom(B, B)`.\n    *   **Case 6**: `(0, 1, 1, 0)`: One non-identity in `Hom(A, B)` and one in `Hom(B, A)`.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Each Case**: For each case, we determine the number of non-isomorphic ways to define the composition of morphisms that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity laws).\n\n    *   **Case 1: (2, 0, 0, 0)**\n        `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. The category is a disjoint union of two single-object categories. The structure is determined by the monoid structure on `Hom(A, A)`, which is a monoid of order 3. There are **7** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. This gives 7 distinct categories. This case covers `(0, 0, 0, 2)` as well.\n\n    *   **Case 2: (0, 2, 0, 0)**\n        `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`. All other `Hom-sets` contain only identities. There are no non-identity compositions possible (e.g., `h o k` where `h` and `k` are non-identities). The structure is fully determined. The specific labels `f` and `g` don't matter. This gives **1** category. This case covers `(0, 0, 2, 0)`.\n\n    *   **Case 3: (1, 1, 0, 0)**\n        `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(A, B) = {g}`. The structure of `Hom(A, A)` must be a monoid of order 2. There are 2 such monoids: the group `Z_2` (`f*f=id_A`) and the trivial semilattice (`f*f=f`). For composition, `g o f` must be `g`. In both monoid cases, associativity holds. These two structures are non-isomorphic. So, there are **2** categories. This covers `(0, 0, 1, 1)`.\n\n    *   **Case 4: (1, 0, 1, 0)**\n        `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`. Similar to Case 3, `Hom(A, A)` can be one of the 2 monoids of order 2. Composition `f o g` must be `g`. Both choices for the monoid lead to valid and non-isomorphic categories. This gives **2** categories. This covers `(0, 1, 0, 1)`.\n\n    *   **Case 5: (1, 0, 0, 1)**\n        `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}`. This is a disjoint union of two single-object categories, each with 2 morphisms. The structure on each `Hom-set` can be `Z_2` or the semilattice `S_2`. This gives four pairs: `(Z_2, Z_2)`, `(Z_2, S_2)`, `(S_2, Z_2)`, `(S_2, S_2)`. Since objects A and B can be swapped, `(Z_2, S_2)` is isomorphic to `(S_2, Z_2)`. This leaves **3** unique categories.\n\n    *   **Case 6: (0, 1, 1, 0)**\n        `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`. Composition `g o f` must be in `Hom(A, A)`, so `g o f = id_A`. Similarly, `f o g = id_B`. This structure describes the case where `A` and `B` are isomorphic objects. The composition table is fully determined, and it is associative. This gives **1** category.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Summing the counts from all unique cases.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the final sum based on this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms,\n    up to isomorphism, based on a case-by-case analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Case 1: The two non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object (e.g., Hom(A,A)).\n    # This reduces to counting the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.
