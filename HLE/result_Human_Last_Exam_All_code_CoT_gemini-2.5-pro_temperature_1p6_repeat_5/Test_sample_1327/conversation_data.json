    "My thinking process to solve this sequence puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence**: I will examine the given sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. I'll look for a simple arithmetic or geometric relationship between consecutive terms.\n    *   Differences: 11-2=9, 23-11=12, 51-23=28, 119-51=68. This is not a simple arithmetic progression.\n    *   Ratios: 11/2=5.5, 23/11≈2.1, 51/23≈2.2, 119/51≈2.3. A multiplicative pattern seems more likely.\n\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis for the pattern**: I'll hypothesize a recursive formula, such as `x_{n+1} = a * x_n + b`. Let's test a few values for `a`.\n    *   If `a=2`: `11 = 2*2 + 7`, `23 = 2*11 + 1`, `51 = 2*23 + 5`. The added term (7, 1, 5) doesn't have an obvious pattern.\n    *   If `a=3`: `11 = 3*2 + 5`, `23 = 3*11 - 10`, `51 = 3*23 - 18`, `119 = 3*51 - 34`. This looks more structured. It appears the rule (starting from the second term) is `x_{n+1} = 3 * x_n - C_n`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the new sequence `C_n`**: The sequence of subtracted numbers `C` (starting from the calculation for the 3rd term) is `10, 18, 34`.\n\n4.  **Find the pattern in `C_n`**: I will look at the differences between consecutive terms in the `C` sequence.\n    *   `18 - 10 = 8`\n    *   `34 - 18 = 16`\n    The differences are `8, 16`. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.\n\n5.  **Predict the next terms**:\n    *   The next difference will be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   The next term in the `C` sequence will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n    *   The next term in the original sequence will be `3 * 119 - 66`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer**:\n    *   `3 * 119 = 357`\n    *   `357 - 66 = 291`\n\n7.  **Construct the Python code**: I will write a Python script to automate these calculations and print out the reasoning step-by-step, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the sequence to find the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the sequence:\", s)\n    print(\"Let's test the hypothesis that each term is related to the previous term by a formula like: Term(n) = 3 * Term(n-1) - C\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # We establish the pattern starting from the 3rd term\n    # Term 3: 23\n    c2 = 3 * s[1] - s[2]\n    print(f\"For the 3rd term ({s[2]}): {s[2]} = 3 * {s[1]} - {c2}\")\n\n    # Term 4: 51\n    c3 = 3 * s[2] - s[3]\n    print(f\"For the 4th term ({s[3]}): {s[3]} = 3 * {s[2]} - {c3}\")\n\n    # Term 5: 119\n    c4 = 3 * s[3] - s[4]\n    print(f\"For the 5th term ({s[4]}): {s[4]} = 3 * {s[3]} - {c4}\")\n\n    # Now we have a sequence of the subtracted numbers C\n    c_sequence = [c2, c3, c4]\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"This reveals a sequence of subtracted numbers:\", c_sequence)\n\n    # Let's find the pattern in this new sequence by looking at the differences\n    diff1 = c_sequence[1] - c_sequence[0]\n    diff2 = c_sequence[2] - c_sequence[1]\n    print(f\"The differences in this subtraction sequence are {diff1} and {diff2}.\")\n    \n    # The differences are 8 and 16.
