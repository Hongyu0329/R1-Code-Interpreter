    "Based on my research, the premise of your question may be incorrect. \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" is the full name he was given at birth. \"Azikiwe\" is one of his middle names, not a name he adopted or started using at a specific point in his public life. Therefore, there is no specific year to report.\n\nI will provide a Python script to explain this.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Address the user's question about the year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as Azikiwe.\n# 2. Clarify that \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" is his full birth name.\n# 3. Explain that since \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his name, there isn't a specific year where he *began* to identify with it publicly.\n# 4. Print the explanation for the user.\n\nprint(\"This script addresses the question of when Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(\"Fact: His full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\")\nprint(\"Explanation: 'Azikiwe' is one of his given names from birth, not a name he adopted later.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion:\")\nprint(\"There is no specific year where he started to publicly identify himself as Azikiwe.\")\nprint(\"It has been part of his full name throughout his life.\")\n\n```\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is his full name from birth, so there is no specific year he started to publicly identify as Azikiwe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
