# Plan:
# 1. Address the user's question about the year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as Azikiwe.
# 2. Clarify that "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan" is his full birth name.
# 3. Explain that since "Azikiwe" has always been part of his name, there isn't a specific year where he *began* to identify with it publicly.
# 4. Print the explanation for the user.

print("This script addresses the question of when Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.")
