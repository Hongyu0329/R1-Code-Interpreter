In its frequency-domain representation, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The specific functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$, where the term $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary part required to enforce causality.
