    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to address your question:\n1.  First, I will state the context. The question refers to the \"bare\" Green's function ($G_0$), which describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system.\n2.  The most common and useful representation for this problem is in the frequency domain (as opposed to the time domain), obtained via a Fourier transform. I will provide the relationship in this domain.\n3.  The core of the relationship is that the Green's function has poles located at the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states. This means the functional form is an inverse relationship.\n4.  I will provide the standard formula for the bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, explaining each term, including the crucial $i\\delta$ term that enforces causality.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script that prints this formula and an example with specific numerical values to clearly show the structure of the equation and the dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$, fulfilling your request to output each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_green_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and displays the functional dependence of the bare\n    Green's function on single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
