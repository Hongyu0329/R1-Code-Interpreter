    Calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions.

    The logic is based on combinatorial analysis of permutation structures, as explained above.
    The number of such permutations is small and independent of n for n >= 6.

    The permutations with 3 inversions that avoid 1324 are those whose structure
    does not allow forming a 1324 pattern by picking elements before or after the
    main permuted block. This only occurs when the block is at the start or end of
    the permutation.

    1. Pattern '321' on a block of 3:
       - (3, 2, 1, 4, ..., n) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       - (1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       Total for this type: 2

    2. Pattern '4123' on a block of 4:
       - (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., n) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       - (1, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       Total for this type: 2

    3. Pattern '2341' on a block of 4:
       - (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ..., n) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       - (1, ..., n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3) avoids 1324. (1 permutation)
       Total for this type: 2

    Other types of permutations with 3 inversions can be shown to always contain a 1324 pattern.
