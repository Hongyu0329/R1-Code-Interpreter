    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems are combined, and the coupling between them is not strong enough to induce a topological phase transition (as is the case with a negligible tunneling barrier), the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. To find the Chern number of the junction, we add their individual Chern numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\n# The Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nc_junction = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is calculated by summing the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = C1 + C2 = {c1} + {c2} = {c_junction}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
