    # Step 1 & 2: Simulate propagation and identify conflict
    # The problem describes the state leading to the first conflict. We can lay out the assignments.
    # Level 1 Decision: ¬x1
    # Level 2 Decision: x3
    # Level 3 Decision: x2
    # BCP from level 3:
    # 1. x2=true makes C3 (x5 ∨ ¬x2) a unit clause -> x5=true.
    # 2. x2=true and x3=true make C2 (¬x2 ∨ ¬x3 ∨ ¬x4) a unit clause -> x4=false.
    # 3. x4=false and x5=true make C4 (x4 ∨ ¬x5 ∨ ¬x6) a unit clause -> x6=false.
    # 4. x6=false makes C5 (x6 ∨ ¬x7) a unit clause -> x7=false.
    #
    # Conflict:
    # C1 (x1 ∨ x6 ∨ x7) is now false because x1=false@1, x6=false@3, x7=false@3.

    # Step 3: Analyze Implication Graph and find UIPs
    # Implication graph at the conflict level (3) shows the chain of propagations:
    # x2@3 --(implies via C3)--> x5@3
    # x2@3 --(implies via C2)--> ¬x4@3
    # {x5@3, ¬x4@3} --(implies via C4)--> ¬x6@3
    # ¬x6@3 --(implies via C5)--> ¬x7@3
    # {¬x1@1, ¬x6@3, ¬x7@3} --(implies)--> Conflict on C1
    #
    # A UIP is a literal at the conflict level that is on every path from the
    # decision literal of that level (x2@3) to the conflict node.
    # Path 1: x2 -> x5 -> ¬x6 -> ¬x7 -> Conflict
    # Path 2: x2 -> ¬x4 -> ¬x6 -> ¬x7 -> Conflict
    # The nodes on every path are: ¬x6, ¬x7. The decision literal itself, x2, is also considered a UIP.
    # UIPs are identified by their assignment form:
    uips = ["not x7@3", "not x6@3", "x2@3"]

    # The first UIP (1UIP) is the one closest to the conflict node in the graph.
    # distance(¬x7, Conflict) = 1.
    first_uip = "not x7@3"

    # Step 4: Derive Learned Clause (1UIP Scheme)
    # The process starts with the conflict clause and resolves with antecedents
    # in reverse chronological order of assignment until only one literal from
    # the conflict level (3) remains.
    # Conflict clause: C1 = {x1, x6, x7}
    # Latest assignment at level 3 involved in conflict is ¬x7 (x7=false).
    # Antecedent of ¬x7 is C5 = {x6, ¬x7}.
    # Resolving C1 and C5 on variable x7 gives:
    # {x1, x6, x7} resolved with {x6, ¬x7} => {x1, x6}
    # The resulting clause {x1, x6} contains only one literal (x6) whose variable
    # was assigned at the conflict level. So we stop.
    p1 = "x1"
    p2 = "x6"
    learned_clause_parts = [p1, p2]
    learned_clause = f"{p1} \\/ {p2}"

    # Step 5: Determine Backtrack Level
    # The learned clause is 'x1 V x6'.
    # The level of assignment for x1 is 1.
    # The level of assignment for x6 is 3.
    # The backtrack level is the second-highest decision level in the learned clause.
    # Levels are {1, 3}. The second-highest is 1.
    backtrack_level = 1

    # Step 6: Format and print the final answer
    final_answer = f"<<<{','.join(uips)},{first_uip},{learned_clause},{backtrack_level}>>>"
    print(final_answer)
