    "My plan is to answer your biological question by identifying the key protein involved in the clearance of amyloid by macrophages. The process involves the immune system's complement cascade. A specific protein in this cascade is cleaved (broken down), and its fragments then \"tag\" the amyloid deposits. This tag acts as a signal for macrophages to engulf and destroy the amyloid. I will provide the name of this central protein in a simple Python script. The protein's name contains a number, which will be part of the final output.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the protein which, upon being broken down (cleaved),\n# helps macrophages engulf amyloid plaques. This protein is a central\n# component of the complement system, a part of the innate immune system.\n\n# The protein's name itself contains a number.\nprotein_name = \"Complement component C3\"\n\n# The breakdown of this protein into its active fragments (like C3b)\n# tags amyloid, signaling for engulfment by macrophages (or microglia in the brain).\n# Printing the name satisfies the requirement of outputting the number '3'\n# as part of the final answer.\nprint(f\"The protein is: {protein_name}\")\n```\n<<<Complement component C3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
