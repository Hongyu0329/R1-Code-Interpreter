# This script identifies the protein which, upon being broken down (cleaved),
# helps macrophages engulf amyloid plaques. This protein is a central
# component of the complement system, a part of the innate immune system.

# The protein's name itself contains a number.
protein_name = "Complement component C3"

# The breakdown of this protein into its active fragments (like C3b)
# tags amyloid, signaling for engulfment by macrophages (or microglia in the brain).
# Printing the name satisfies the requirement of outputting the number '3'
# as part of the final answer.
