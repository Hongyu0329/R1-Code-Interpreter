    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first determine the degree of unsaturation (DBE) from the molecular formula C7H14. This will tell me if the compound contains double/triple bonds or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal provided:\n    *   The chemical shift (the number in ppm) indicates the electronic environment of the carbon (e.g., alkane, alkene, near an electronegative atom).\n    *   The multiplicity (the letter in parentheses: s, d, t, q) tells how many hydrogens are directly attached to that carbon (s = 0H, t = 2H, d = 1H, q = 3H, a typo for doublet should be 'd'). I will assume (d) refers to a doublet for a CH group, and (t) to a triplet for a CH2 group.\n3.  **Account for All Atoms**: The formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 signals. As the hint suggests, this means one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons. I will use the multiplicities to count the total number of hydrogens accounted for by the signals and compare it to the molecular formula to determine which type of carbon is duplicated.\n4.  **Assemble Structural Fragments**: Based on the NMR data, I will build structural fragments. The alkene signals (typically >100 ppm) will define the core C=C bond structure. The alkane signals (< 50 ppm) will form the attached alkyl groups.\n5.  **Construct the Final Molecule**: I will connect the fragments in a way that is consistent with all the data to form a single, complete structure for C7H14.\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the final structure to determine its systematic name. This includes finding the longest carbon chain containing the double bond and naming/numbering the substituents correctly.\n7.  **Generate the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that explains the deduction and prints the assignment of each NMR signal to the corresponding carbon in the final structure, followed by the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical structure puzzle based on the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
