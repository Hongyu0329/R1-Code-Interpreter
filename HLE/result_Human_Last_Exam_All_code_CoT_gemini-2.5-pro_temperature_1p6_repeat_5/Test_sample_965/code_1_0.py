    This script calculates the rate of photon creation for a two-level atom

    The key steps are:
    1. Define the squared matrix element of the interaction.
    2. Define the density of final states for a lossy cavity.
    3. Calculate the rate Gamma using Fermi's Golden Rule.
    4. Re-scale the result by h-bar and express in terms of h to match the
