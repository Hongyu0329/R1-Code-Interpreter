At sunrise, when exposed to the UV light from the sun, the table should change its shape from a straight, elongated form (*trans*-isomer) to a bent, V-shape form (*cis*-isomer). At sunset, in the absence of UV light, the table should slowly and thermally relax back to the straight *trans*-isomer form overnight.
