    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves creating a composite matrix by stacking the two matrices and then applying elementary row operations to reduce this composite matrix to a simpler form (specifically, a row-echelon form). The remaining non-zero rows of the reduced matrix will form the GCRD.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using Python's `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n2.  Construct the augmented matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2: `M = [P1; P2]`.\n3.  Apply a series of elementary row operations to `M`. An elementary row operation consists of replacing a row with the sum of that row and a polynomial multiple of another row (e.g., `Ri -> Ri + p(s)*Rj`, where `p(s)` is a polynomial).\n4.  The goal of these operations is to introduce as many zero rows as possible.\n5.  After the reduction process, the remaining non-zero rows, collected into a matrix, represent the GCRD. We will normalize it to its simplest form, which is often the identity matrix if the original matrices are right coprime.\n\nLet's execute this plan with the given matrices.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1 =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2 =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    \n    # Step 1: Form the augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.vstack(P2)\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Form the augmented matrix M by stacking P1 and P2.\")\n    print(\"M =\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # Let's denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3\n    # M = [ R0 ]\n    #     [ R1 ]\n    #     [ R2 ]\n    #     [ R3 ]\n    # R3 is [-s-1, 1].
