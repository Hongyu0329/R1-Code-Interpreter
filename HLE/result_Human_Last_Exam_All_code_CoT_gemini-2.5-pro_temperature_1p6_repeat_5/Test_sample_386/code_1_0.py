# The task is to identify the correct statement for isolating a corneal fibroblast cell line.
# Based on biological principles, statement C is the most accurate. Let's break down why and extract the numerical data as requested.

# Statement C: "Debrided epithelium and endothelium induced proliferation of the stromal cells
# to myofibroblasts in the medium containing 10% of the FBS and 1% antibiotic,
# and they adhered to the bottom of the flask."

# 1. Debridement: Removing the epithelium and endothelium is the correct first step to isolate the stroma, which contains the fibroblasts (keratocytes).
# 2. Cell Proliferation and Differentiation: In a culture medium with serum (FBS), quiescent stromal keratocytes activate and differentiate into proliferative myofibroblasts. This is the expected and desired outcome for establishing a cell line.
# 3. Adherence: Fibroblasts are anchorage-dependent cells. "Adhered to the bottom of the flask" indicates the culture was successful.
# 4. Medium Composition: The medium described is standard for this type of cell culture.

# The numerical values mentioned in the correct option are the concentrations of supplements in the growth medium.
fbs_concentration = 10  # This is the percentage of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS).
antibiotic_concentration = 1 # This is the percentage of antibiotic solution.

print("The correct method involves a specific culture medium.")
print("The components mentioned in the correct procedure are:")

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# We will present the medium composition as a simple equation.
print(f"Final Medium = Base Culture Medium + {fbs_concentration}% FBS + {antibiotic_concentration}% Antibiotic")
