    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Mathematical Functions:** First, we'll represent the given supply and demand equations as Python functions.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** Market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D`). We'll set the two functions equal to each other and solve for the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`). This equation, `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`, is complex, so we will use a numerical solver from the `scipy.optimize` library to find `Q_E`.\n3.  **Calculate Equilibrium Price:** Once we have the equilibrium quantity `Q_E`, we can calculate the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` back into either the supply or the demand function.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves. However, the supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > ∛2`. Therefore, the total welfare is calculated as:\n    *Total Welfare = (Integral of Demand from 0 to Q_E) - (Integral of Supply from ∛2 to Q_E)*\n    We will use numerical integration from the `scipy.integrate` library to compute these values.\n5.  **Output the Results:** The final script will print the calculated equilibrium quantity, equilibrium price, the value of each integral, and the final total welfare, which represents the \"final equation\" for welfare calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef demand(q):\n    \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\ndef supply(q):\n    \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0, which means Q > cuberoot(2)\n    # To handle integration, we return a large number for values outside the domain\n    # This prevents errors but fsolve should find a root within the valid domain.\n    if isinstance(q, (np.ndarray, list)):\n        q_safe = np.array(q)\n        q_safe[q_safe**3 <= 2] = np.inf\n        return np.log(q_safe**3 - 2)\n    else:\n        if q**3 <= 2:\n            return np.inf # Not defined\n        return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium quantity (Q_E)\n# We need to solve the equation: demand(q) - supply(q) = 0\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n    \"\"\"Difference between demand and supply functions\"\"\"\n    return demand(q) - supply(q)\n\n# An initial guess is needed for the solver.
