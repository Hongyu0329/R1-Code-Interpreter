    "This is a knowledge-based question about cephalopod neuroanatomy. A direct computation or script cannot discover this information. However, I can provide a Python script that programmatically stores and presents the answer based on established biological knowledge.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the anatomical region of interest from your question.\n2.  Create a list containing the names of the brain regions located adjacent and posterior to it in the dwarf cuttlefish.\n3.  Print this information in a clear, human-readable sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the names of brain regions located\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The lobe mentioned in the query.\n    primary_lobe = \"palliovisceral lobe\"\n\n    # The brain regions located adjacent and posterior to the primary lobe.\n    # This information is based on cephalopod neuroanatomical studies.\n    adjacent_posterior_regions = [\n        \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\",\n        \"Giant fiber lobe\"\n    ]\n\n    # Print the answer in a formatted string.\n    print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {primary_lobe} in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for region in adjacent_posterior_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the Posterior chromatophore lobes and the Giant fiber lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
