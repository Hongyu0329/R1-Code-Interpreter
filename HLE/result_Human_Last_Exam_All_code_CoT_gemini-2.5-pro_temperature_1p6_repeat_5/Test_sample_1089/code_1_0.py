    1. The described repair method, 'TIG welding build-up of layers,' is an additive process used to replace lost material and restore the blade's geometry.

    2. We must find the damage mechanism that causes a predictable loss of material which is suitable for this type of repair.

    3. Damage like Creep (D) is deformation, not material loss. Cracking (A, E) is not primarily addressed by building up layers, although welding might be part of a more complex crack repair.

    4. This leaves material loss mechanisms: Foreign Object Damage (B), Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C), and Corrosion/Oxidation (F).

    5. Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is a very common issue where the rotating blade tip rubs against the engine casing, grinding away material. Restoring the blade tip's height and profile by welding layers of material is a standard and critical MRO procedure to maintain engine efficiency. This perfectly matches the description of the repair. While B and F can also be repaired with welding, C is the most characteristic and frequent reason for a geometric build-up repair on the blade tip.
