    This function explains the reasoning to find the minimal number of moves for White to win.
    
    The FEN provided is: 9k/5c1pb1/10/10/10/3Q6/PP5A2/K9 w - - 0 1

    Board State:
    - White: King(a1), Queen(d3), Archbishop(h2), Pawns(a2, b2)
    - Black: King(j8), Chancellor(f7), Bishop(i7), Pawn(h7)

    The problem asks for the number of moves in the shortest forced checkmate sequence for White, assuming optimal defense from Black.

    The solution is found by a deep analysis of White's candidate moves. The most powerful move is 1. Ad6.
