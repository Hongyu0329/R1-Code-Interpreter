    "The question asks for the Modern English word for \"sister\" if Norse (Old Norse) influence had not occurred. To solve this, we need to trace the native Old English word for \"sister\" through the historical sound changes of the English language.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the original words:** Find the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\" and the Old Norse word that replaced it.\n2.  **Analyze the replacement:** The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir,\" which displaced the native Old English term due to the significant interaction and settlement of Norse-speakers in England.\n3.  **Trace the native word's evolution:** The Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweoster.\" We need to project how this word would have changed into Modern English, following known patterns of sound evolution, without being replaced.\n4.  **Hypothesize the modern form:** By comparing the evolution of similar Old English words (like \"sweord\" -> \"sword\"), we can deduce the most likely modern form. The \"sw-\" sound at the beginning would likely have been simplified, and the \"-eo-\" vowel would have shifted. A common attested development of \"sweoster\" in Middle English was \"suster.\" This form is the most probable candidate for what would have survived into Modern English.\n5.  **Create a Python script:** Write a Python script that explains this linguistic journey and prints the final, hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the linguistic evolution and prints the\n    Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for 'sister'\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n\n    # 2. The Old Norse word that was adopted into English\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n\n    # 3. The hypothetical Modern English word from the Old English root\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"--- The Linguistic History of 'Sister' ---\")\n    print(f\"1. The current Modern English word '{current_word}' is not a native English word.\")\n    print(f\"   It was borrowed from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}' during the Viking Age.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"2. The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"3. Without Norse influence, '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally within English.\")\n    print(f\"   - Following patterns seen in other words (like 'sword' from 'sweord'), the 'w' sound would likely have been dropped.\")\n    print(f\"   - The vowel sounds would have shifted over centuries.\")\n    print(f\"   - Historical records from Middle English show that '{old_english_word}' did evolve into the form '{hypothetical_modern_word}' before being largely replaced by the Norse version.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Therefore, the most likely Modern English word for 'sister', had the Norse never invaded, would be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_modern_word}'\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
