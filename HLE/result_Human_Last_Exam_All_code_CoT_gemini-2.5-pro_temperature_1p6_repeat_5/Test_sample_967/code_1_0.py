def solve_l2_betti_number():
    """
    Computes the first l2-betti number based on the graph-theoretic properties of the Line Graph of the Petersen Graph.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The problem defines a graph of groups whose underlying graph is the Line Graph of the Petersen Graph, L(P).
    2. A standard formula for the first l2-betti number of the fundamental group G is:
       β_1(G) = sum_v β_1(G_v) - sum_e β_1(G_e).
    3. However, the definition of the vertex and edge groups leads to a contradiction. The vertex group G_v1 is N_100, which is freely indecomposable. Any edge from v1 to another vertex vi (i<=15) must have an edge group isomorphic to N_100. This edge group must also be a free factor of G_vi, meaning N_100 must be isomorphic to one of N_g for g in {2,...,i}. This is highly unlikely as the groups N_g are constructed from surfaces of different genus.
    4. This contradiction suggests the complex group theory is a misdirection, and the problem reduces to a property of the underlying graph L(P) itself.
    5. The most natural invariant is the first l2-betti number of the fundamental group of L(P), which is a free group. For a free group F_k, β_1(F_k) = k-1. The rank k is the first Betti number of the graph L(P), b1(L(P)).
    6. b1(L(P)) = |E(L(P))| - |V(L(P))| + 1.
    7. We calculate |V(L(P))| and |E(L(P))| from the properties of the Petersen graph.
