# The problem asks to select the correct expression for the liquid rise height (xi)
# and the voltage (V_0) required to achieve a rise of xi = s/2.

# Based on a detailed physical analysis, Option C provides the correct functional
# dependencies between the variables, even though the provided formulas contain
# dimensional inconsistencies.
# - xi is proportional to V_0^2.
# - V_0 is proportional to s^(3/2).
# - The structure of the surface tension correction term for V_0 matches the derived form.

# The equations for Option C are printed below.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# highlighting the numerical constants within the printed output strings.

# Numerical constants in the equations from Option C

c2 = 3
c3 = 4
c4 = 2
c5 = 1
c6 = 2 # The exponent is 1/2
