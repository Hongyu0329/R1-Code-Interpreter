    "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of the smallest algebraic structure that can be used to color the figure-eight knot. In the context of knot theory, this is known as finding the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the knot is \"n-colorable\".\n\nHere is the plan to determine this number:\n1.  The colorability of a knot is determined by a number called the knot determinant.\n2.  The knot determinant is calculated from the knot's Alexander polynomial, denoted as `Δ(t)`.\n3.  For the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁), the Alexander polynomial is a well-established formula: `Δ(t) = t² - 3t + 1`.\n4.  To find the determinant, we evaluate this polynomial at `t = -1`. The absolute value of this result, `|Δ(-1)|`, is the knot determinant.\n5.  A knot is `n`-colorable if `n` is a factor of the knot determinant. The smallest number of colors for a non-trivial coloring corresponds to the smallest prime factor of the determinant.\n6.  The Python code below will carry out the calculation of `Δ(-1)` and display the final equation that yields the answer.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure that can be used to color the figure-eight knot.\n# 2.

This number is determined by the knot's determinant, which is found by evaluating its Alexander polynomial, Δ(t), at t = -1.\n# 4. For the figure-eight knot (4_1), the Alexander polynomial is Δ(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1.\n# 5. The determinant is |(-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 1| = |1 + 3 + 1| = 5.\n# 6. Since 5 is a prime number, the smallest number of colors needed is 5.\n# 7.
