# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure that can be used to color the figure-eight knot.
# 2. In knot theory, this corresponds to finding the smallest integer n > 1 for which the knot is "n-colorable".
# 3. This number is determined by the knot's determinant, which is found by evaluating its Alexander polynomial, Δ(t), at t = -1.
# 4. For the figure-eight knot (4_1), the Alexander polynomial is Δ(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1.
# 5. The determinant is |(-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 1| = |1 + 3 + 1| = 5.
# 6. Since 5 is a prime number, the smallest number of colors needed is 5.
# 7. This script will perform the calculation and print the final equation as requested.

# Coefficients of the Alexander polynomial for the figure-eight knot, Δ(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1.
a = 1
b = -3
c = 1

# The determinant is calculated by substituting t = -1.
t = -1

# Calculate the individual terms of the polynomial evaluated at t = -1.
term1 = a * (t**2)
term2 = b * t
term3 = c

# Calculate the final result, which is the knot determinant.
result = term1 + term2 + term3

print("To find the number of elements, we calculate the determinant of the figure-eight knot.")
print("This is done by evaluating its Alexander polynomial, Δ(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1, at t = -1.")
print("\nThe final calculation is:")

# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is the simplified sum leading to the result, e.g., 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
