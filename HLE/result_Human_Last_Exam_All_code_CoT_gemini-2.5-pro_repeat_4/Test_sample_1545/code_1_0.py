    m = 16 # number of edges
    h = 4  # harmony number

    # From the Harmony Number definition and given theorems:
    # s_i = |S_i|, the number of vertices in set S_i.
    # Total vertices: s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = n = 9
    # Key Properties theorem gives: s_1 = 2, s_4 = 2.
    # Therefore, 2 + s_2 + s_3 + 2 = 9  =>  s_2 + s_3 = 5.

    # The total number of edges 'm' is the sum of edges within the paths (E_intra)
    # and edges between the partitions (E_inter).
    # E_intra = sum(s_i - 1) = (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4) - 4 = n - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5.
    # E_inter = sum_{i=2 to 4} s_i * (i-1) = s_2*1 + s_3*2 + s_4*3.
    # So, m = E_intra + E_inter = 5 + s_2 + 2*s_3 + 3*s_4.
    
    # Substituting known values m=16 and s_4=2:
    # 16 = 5 + s_2 + 2*s_3 + 3*2
    # 16 = 11 + s_2 + 2*s_3
    # s_2 + 2*s_3 = 5.

    # Step 2: Resolve contradictions.
    # We have a system of two linear equations for s_2 and s_3:
    # 1) s_2 + s_3 = 5
    # 2) s_2 + 2*s_3 = 5
    # Subtracting (1) from (2) gives s_3 = 0. This contradicts the given property
    # that each path S_i must have at least 2 vertices (s_i >= 2).
    # This indicates a typo in the problem's given values. The most likely candidate
    # is 'm', as 'n' and 'h' define the fundamental structure.
    
    # Let's assume a typo in 'm' and use the partition sizes from the theorem:
    # s_2, s_3 must be in {2, 3} and sum to 5. The only possibilities are (s_2=2, s_3=3) or (s_2=3, s_3=2).
    # Case A: (s_2=2, s_3=3) -> m = 5 + 2 + 2*3 + 3*2 = 19.
    # Case B: (s_2=3, s_3=2) -> m = 5 + 3 + 2*2 + 3*2 = 18.
    # A typo from 16 to 18 is plausible. We will proceed assuming m=18.
