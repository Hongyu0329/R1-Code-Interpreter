    # Step 1: Calculate K, the figure-eight knot's Jones polynomial at t=-1.
    # The Jones polynomial V(t) for the figure-eight knot is t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t².
    t = -1
    # Using python's ability to handle negative exponents in the float context
    K_val = (t**-2) - (t**-1) + 1 - t + (t**2)

    # The absolute value of K determines the upper bound of the range.

    # Step 3: Analyze the nature of Gödel numbers for the specified statements.
    # Gödel numbering assigns a unique natural number to every formula in a formal language.
    # The construction ensures that these numbers are extremely large for any non-trivial formula.
    # A "true Π₁ statement about prime twins" is a complex logical formula.
    # For instance, it requires symbols for universal quantification (∀), variables,
    # logical connectives, and a predicate for primality.
    # Under any standard Gödel numbering scheme, the encoding of such a sequence of
    # symbols results in a number far larger than any number in the calculated range.
    # The numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are too small to encode any meaningful statement.
    
    # Step 4: Conclude the count.
    # Therefore, there are no Gödel numbers of true Π₁ statements about prime twins
    # within the determined range.
    count = 0
