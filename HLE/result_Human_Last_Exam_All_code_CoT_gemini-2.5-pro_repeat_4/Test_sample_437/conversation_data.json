    "Of course. Here is a solution to evaluate the given integral.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  First, I will analytically solve the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ for the case where $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are identical, normalized $1s$ Slater-type orbitals (STOs) centered at the same origin. The normalized $1s$ STO is given by the function $\\phi_{1s}(r) = (\\zeta^3/\\pi)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent.\n2.  The integral is set up in spherical coordinates, where the volume element is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The integral separates into an angular part and a radial part. I will show the derivation for both parts.\n3.  The final analytical result of this integral is simply the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$.\n4.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates this calculation. The script will use a specific, realistic value for $\\zeta$ (e.g., $\\zeta=1.24$ for a hydrogen atom) and will walk through the calculation steps. As requested, it will print the numerical value for each component of the final equation to show how they combine to produce the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef evaluate_1s_integral(zeta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a Slater-type orbital.\n\n    This function follows the analytical derivation step-by-step and prints\n    the result for a given orbital exponent zeta.
