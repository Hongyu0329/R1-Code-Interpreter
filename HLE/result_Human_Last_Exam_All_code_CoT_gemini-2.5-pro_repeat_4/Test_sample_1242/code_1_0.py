    The task is to identify features that predict the complexity of individual WORDS. Let's analyze the options:

    1.  Features like 'word length', 'syllable count', 'word familiarity rating', and 'concreteness rating' are all intrinsic properties of a single word. They measure a word's physical size, phonetic structure, and its psycholinguistic difficulty.

    2.  Features like 'number of unique words' and 'number of word categories' are properties of a larger TEXT or passage, not a single word. They measure lexical diversity and syntactic variety, respectively.

    3.  Evaluating the choices based on this distinction:
        - A, B, C, and E all incorrectly include text-level features ('number of unique words' or 'number of word categories') in a list meant to assess single-word complexity.
        - Choice D is the only option that consists exclusively of well-established, word-level features. These features (structural, phonetic, and psycholinguistic) are known to be strongly correlated with word difficulty for both native and non-native speakers.
