def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves a problem in ZFC set theory concerning cardinal invariants.

    The problem asks for the minimal length δ of a tower ⟨x_α : α < δ⟩ of
    uncountable subsets of ω₁ such that:
    1. For α < β < δ, |x_β \setminus x_α| < ω₁ (i.e., the difference is countable).
    2. There is no uncountable set y ⊆ ω₁ such that for all α < δ,
       |y \setminus x_α| < ω₁ (the tower has no upper bound).

    This minimal length δ is the cofinality of the partial order of uncountable
    subsets of ω₁ ordered by "subset modulo a countable set" (⊆*).

    This is a standard result in ZFC set theory. It is a theorem that this
    cofinality is ω₂ (omega-2), the second uncountable cardinal. A proof is
    beyond the scope of a simple program and involves advanced techniques
    like Fodor's Lemma.

    The program's role is to state this established mathematical result.
