# This script explains the fundamental limit on the chemical potential for bosons
# in Bose-Einstein condensation, as derived from the grand canonical ensemble.

# Step 1: The Bose-Einstein Distribution Function
# The average number of bosons, n(ε), in a single-particle state with energy ε
# is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution function.
# n(ε) = 1 / [exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1]
# where μ is the chemical potential, T is the temperature, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.
print("1. The average number of bosons in a state with energy ε is given by: n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)")

# Step 2: The Physical Constraint
# For n(ε) to be a physically meaningful quantity (i.e., a positive number of particles),
# the denominator must be greater than zero.
# exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0
print("\n2. For n(ε) to be positive, the denominator must be positive: exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0")

# Step 3: Deriving the Mathematical Limit
# Solving the inequality from Step 2:
# exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) > 1
# Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
# (ε - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0
# Since T > 0, this simplifies to:
# ε - μ > 0  or  μ < ε
print("\n3. This inequality simplifies to the condition that for any energy state ε, the chemical potential μ must be less than it: μ < ε")

# Step 4: The Role of the Ground State
# This condition must hold for all possible energy states ε. The most stringent limit is therefore
# imposed by the lowest possible energy state, the ground state energy, ε_0.
# Thus, the chemical potential must satisfy:
# μ < ε_0
# Bose-Einstein condensation begins when μ approaches ε_0. For an ideal Bose gas at temperatures
# at or below the critical temperature (T ≤ T_c), the chemical potential becomes equal to the ground state energy.
# μ = ε_0 (for T ≤ T_c)
print("\n4. The most restrictive limit is set by the ground state energy, ε_0. Thus, μ must be less than or equal to ε_0.")
print("   At the condensation transition and below, μ becomes equal to ε_0.")

# Step 5: Connecting to the Answer Choices
# The question asks for the fundamental limit. This limit is the value ε_0.
# At zero temperature (T=0), all particles in a non-interacting Bose gas occupy the ground state.
# The chemical potential at T=0 is exactly the ground state energy, μ(T=0) = ε_0.
# Therefore, the limit is correctly described as the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0.
print("\n5. At T=0, the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas is exactly the ground state energy, μ(T=0) = ε_0.")

# Final Conclusion
print("\n---")
print("Conclusion: The fundamental limit on the chemical potential, μ, is that it must approach and, in the condensed phase, become equal to the ground state energy ε_0.")
print("This limit is physically equivalent to the statement:")
# The final print statement outputs the answer corresponding to the correct choice.
print("μ must be equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature.")
