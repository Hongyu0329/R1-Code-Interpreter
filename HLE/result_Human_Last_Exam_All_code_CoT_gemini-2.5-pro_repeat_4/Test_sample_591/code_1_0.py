The parameter kappa (κ) in the expression for the critical correlation c* is defined as the ratio of heterosynaptic to homosynaptic potentiation efficacy.

In the context of the model:

1.  **Homosynaptic Potentiation:** This refers to the strengthening of a synapse's weight (w_k) that is induced by its own presynaptic activity (x_k). It's the intrinsic ability of a synapse to strengthen itself based on its own input-output history.

2.  **Heterosynaptic Potentiation:** This refers to the strengthening of a synapse's weight (w_k) that is induced by the activity of neighboring synapses (x_l, where l is not equal to k). The postsynaptic accumulator (u_k) averages signals from nearby synapses, allowing the activity of one synapse to influence the plasticity of its neighbors.

Therefore, kappa is a dimensionless quantity that measures how effective neighboring synapses are at contributing to the stabilization and potentiation of a synapse, relative to the synapse's own self-strengthening capability.

κ = (Efficacy of Heterosynaptic Potentiation) / (Efficacy of Homosynaptic Potentiation)

# The final answer is the definition of kappa as a concept.
# Since the question asks for the definition of kappa, and the provided text does not contain
# an explicit formula for it, the answer is a conceptual explanation.
# The most accurate representation in the requested format is the name of the concept itself.
# Let's represent the answer as the ratio described.

# The problem asks for a formula, which is not derivable. The conceptual definition is the best answer.
# However, to conform to the output format, I'll provide a symbolic representation.
# Let A_het be the heterosynaptic potentiation efficacy and A_hom be the homosynaptic one.
# So, kappa = A_het / A_hom.
# The user wants a final answer in the format <<<...>>>.
# The definition itself is the answer.
