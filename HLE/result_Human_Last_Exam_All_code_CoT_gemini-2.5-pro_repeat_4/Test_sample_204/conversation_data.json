    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the vector field**: The vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined on R³ and maps every point to a point on the unit sphere S², since `nx² + ny² + nz² = 1`. This defines a map from R³ to S². The structure of this map is characterized by a topological invariant called the Hopf charge.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere S². A preimage of a point `p` on the sphere is the set of all points `(x,y,z)` in R³ that are mapped to `p`. For a field like this one, these preimages are typically closed curves in space.\n\n3.  **Find the Preimages**: I will choose two convenient points on S² to find their preimages:\n    *   **The South Pole, n_S = (0, 0, -1)**: The preimage is the set of points where `nz = cos(G) = -1`. This occurs when `G = π`. From the definition of `G`, this leads to `r2 = 0`, which defines a circle `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane. Let's call this curve `C_S`.\n    *   **An Equatorial Point, n_E = (1, 0, 0)**: The preimage is where `nz = cos(G) = 0`, `nx > 0`, and `ny = 0`. This occurs when `G = π/2` and `f = 0`. These conditions define a closed loop in the `y=0` half-plane. Let's call this curve `C_E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Linking Number**: The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C_S, C_E)`. I will compute this using the Gauss linking integral, which is a standard formula from vector calculus:\n    `Lk(C1, C2) = (1 / 4π) ∮_C1 ∮_C2 (r1 - r2) · (dr1 × dr2) / |r1 - r2|³`\n    This involves parameterizing both curves and then numerically computing the resulting double integral.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that uses the `scipy.integrate.dblquad` function to perform the numerical integration. The script will define the parameterized curves and the integrand of the Gauss formula to find the linking number. The final result should be an integer, which is the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import dblquad\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by computing the\n    linking number of the preimages of two points on the sphere S^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    pi = np.pi\n\n    # The vector field topology implies the Hopf charge is the linking number\n    # of the preimages of two points.
