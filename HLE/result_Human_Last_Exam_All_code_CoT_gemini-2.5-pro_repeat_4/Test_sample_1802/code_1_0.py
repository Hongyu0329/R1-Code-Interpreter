    # Step 1: Theoretical foundation
    # A Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system is defined as:
    # Lambda(rho) = sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_jk * U_jk * rho * U_jk^dagger
    # where U_jk are the d^2 generalized Pauli operators, and p_jk are probabilities.
    # The Kraus operators are E_jk = sqrt(p_jk) * U_jk.

    # Let's use a single index 'a' to represent the pair (j,k). The index 'a' runs
    # from 1 to d^2. The Kraus operators are E_a = sqrt(p_a) * U_a.

    # Step 2: The rank of the complementary channel Lambda^c
    # A known theorem states that rank(Lambda^c) is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix G
    # of the Kraus operators, where G_ab = Tr(E_a^dagger * E_b).

    # Let S be the set of indices 'a' for which p_a > 0. Let N = |S|.
    # The Gram matrix G will be an N x N matrix.

    # Step 3: Calculate the Gram matrix for the Pauli channel
    # G_ab = Tr( (sqrt(p_a)*U_a)^dagger * (sqrt(p_b)*U_b) )
    #      = sqrt(p_a * p_b) * Tr(U_a^dagger * U_b)
    # The generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal: Tr(U_a^dagger * U_b) = d * delta_ab.
    # So, G_ab = sqrt(p_a * p_b) * d * delta_ab = d * p_a * delta_ab.
    # This means G is a diagonal matrix of size N x N with diagonal entries {d*p_1, d*p_2, ...}.
    # Since p_a > 0 for all 'a' in S, all diagonal entries are non-zero.
    # The rank of this diagonal matrix is N.

    # Step 4: Determine the maximal rank
    # The rank of the complementary channel is N, the number of non-zero probabilities p_a.
    # To maximize the rank, we need to maximize N. The total number of generalized
    # Pauli operators for a d-dimensional system is d*d = d^2.
    # We can define a valid Pauli channel where all d^2 probabilities are non-zero
    # (e.g., the completely depolarizing channel where p_a = 1/d^2 for all a).
    # Therefore, the maximal value of N is d^2.
