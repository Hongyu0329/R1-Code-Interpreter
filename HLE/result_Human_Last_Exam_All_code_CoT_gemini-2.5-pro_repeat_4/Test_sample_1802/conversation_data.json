    "To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:** I will start by defining a general Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). The channel's operation is described by a set of Kraus operators, which are constructed from the generalized Pauli operators $U_{jk}$ and a set of probabilities $p_{jk}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Gram Matrix Theorem:** There is a theorem in quantum information theory stating that the rank of a complementary channel is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix of the original channel's Kraus operators. The Gram matrix $G$ is defined by the entries $G_{ab} = \\text{Tr}(E_a^\\dagger E_b)$, where $E_a$ and $E_b$ are Kraus operators.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank for a Pauli Channel:** I will apply this theorem to the Pauli channel. By using the orthogonality property of the generalized Pauli operators, I'll show that the Gram matrix becomes a diagonal matrix. The rank of this diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries, which corresponds to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$ used to define the channel. Let's call this number $N$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximal Rank:** The rank of the complementary channel is $N$. To find the maximal possible rank, we need to find the maximum value $N$ can take. This corresponds to a scenario where all possible Pauli operators are included in the channel's definition. The total number of generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional system is $d^2$. Thus, the maximum rank is $d^2$.\n\n5.  **Provide a Python Script:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that implements this logic. The script will take the dimension $d$ as an input and compute the maximal rank, printing the result and the equation used for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_maximal_rank_of_complementary_pauli_channel(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel\n    for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\n    Args:\n        d (int): The dimension of the quantum system (must be an integer >= 2).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The maximal rank of the complementary channel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Theoretical foundation\n    # A Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system is defined as:\n    # Lambda(rho) = sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_jk * U_jk * rho * U_jk^dagger\n    # where U_jk are the d^2 generalized Pauli operators, and p_jk are probabilities.\n    # The Kraus operators are E_jk = sqrt(p_jk) * U_jk.\n\n    # Let's use a single index 'a' to represent the pair (j,k).
