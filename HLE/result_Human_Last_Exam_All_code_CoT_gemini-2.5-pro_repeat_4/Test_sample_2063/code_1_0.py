def calculate_limiting_probability():
    """
    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.

    The problem states that replication halts if for any base x (from 0 to 7),
    the count of that base, N_x, satisfies N_x = x (mod 8).
    Successful replication means this condition is NOT met for any x.

    As the sequence length n approaches infinity, the count of any base N_x
    becomes uniformly distributed modulo 8. This means the probability that
    N_x is congruent to any specific value k (mod 8) approaches 1/8.

    1. The probability of the failure condition for a single base x, P(N_x = x mod 8),
       is therefore 1/8.

    2. The probability of success for a single base x, P(N_x != x mod 8),
       is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

    3. For large n, the counts of different bases are statistically independent.
       Therefore, the total probability of success for all 8 bases is the
       product of their individual success probabilities.

    4. The final limiting probability is (7/8)^8.
