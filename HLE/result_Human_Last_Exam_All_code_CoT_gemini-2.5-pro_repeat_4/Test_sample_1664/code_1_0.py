    # Step 1: Analyze the context provided by the poem.
    print("Step 1: Understand the context from the poem.")
    print("  - The poem describes moths in 'oval frames' that are now an 'inventory of eyes and dust.'")
    print("  - They are 'caught behind silvered dislocation,' suggesting they are preserved specimens, not living insects.")
    print("  - 'Silvered' could refer to a silver frame or the silver process in old photography, which tarnishes over time.\n")
    
    # Step 2: Break down the key phrase.
    print("Step 2: Deconstruct the phrase itself.")
    print("  - 'Discipline': This refers to the human practice or system of specimen collection and preservation.")
    print("  - 'Logic': The reasoning behind this practice, which is to preserve a creature for study or display.")
    print("  - 'Strange and Tarnished': The logic is 'strange' because it requires killing a living thing to preserve its form. It is 'tarnished' because the preservation is imperfect. The specimen decays to 'dust' and the 'silvered' frame or photo literally tarnishes, showing that the attempt to halt decay is flawed.\n")
    
    # Step 3: Conclude by selecting the best answer choice.
    print("Step 3: Evaluate the choices based on the analysis.")
    print("  - The phrase critiques the act of preservation itself, highlighting its inherent contradictions and eventual decay.")
    print("  - This directly matches the idea that the scientific process of preservation can paradoxically lead to degradation.\n")
    
    # Final Answer Output
    print("Final Answer:")
    print("The analysis shows that the most accurate meaning is captured by option B.")
    print("B. scientific specimen preservation can lead to degradation")
