    Solves for the smallest possible value of the union of the sets.

    Let n be the number of sets, so n = 2024.
    Let k be the size of each set, so k = 45.
    Let the union of the sets be U, and its size be v = |U|.

    The problem can be modeled using a dual structure where the sets A_i are 'points'
    and the elements of the union are 'lines'.
    - The number of points in this dual space is n = 2024.
    - The number of lines is v = |U|.
    - The condition |A_i intersect A_j| = 1 means any two points lie on exactly one line.
      This defines a linear space.

    The De Bruijn-Erdos theorem states that for a linear space, the number of lines
    is at least the number of points. Thus, v >= n, which means |U| >= 2024.

    The theorem also states that equality (v=n) holds only if the space is a
    projective plane or a near-pencil.
    - A projective plane with n points requires n = q^2 + q + 1 for some integer q.
      2024 is not of this form.
    - A near-pencil requires the point degrees to be 2 and n-1. In our dual space,
      the degree of a point A_i is |A_i| = k = 45. Since all degrees are 45,
      it cannot be a near-pencil.

    Since the case for equality does not hold, we must have a strict inequality: v > n.
    This implies v >= n + 1.
