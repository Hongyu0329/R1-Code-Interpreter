    "Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles for a 100 big blind, rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game, the opening range from the button is extremely wide due to the significant positional advantage. This range includes all suited Jack hands.\n\nMy plan to determine the \"worst\" suited jack to open is as follows:\n1.  List all suited jack hands (JXs) in descending order of strength.\n2.  A standard GTO opening strategy from the button includes all of these hands, from JTs down to J2s, as they are all profitable opens in this scenario.\n3.  The \"worst\" hand within this group is the one with the lowest raw equity and playability, which corresponds to the hand with the lowest-ranking kicker.\n4.  I will write a Python script to identify this hand from the list and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n    In a standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy for this scenario, the opening range\n    from the button is very wide.
