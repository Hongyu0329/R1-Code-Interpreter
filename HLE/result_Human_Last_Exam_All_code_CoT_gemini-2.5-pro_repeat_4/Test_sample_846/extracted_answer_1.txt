To be functionally accurate, the picnic table, shaped like an azobenzene molecule, must change its shape in response to sunlight. Upon sunrise, the UV rays from the sun should cause the table to isomerize from its stable, straight 'trans' form into a bent 'cis' form. As the sun sets and the UV light disappears, the table should relax back from the bent 'cis' form to its original, straight 'trans' configuration.
