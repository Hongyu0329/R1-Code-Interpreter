# The user wants to find the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of
# regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# Let's break down the mathematical reasoning step-by-step.

# Step 1: Understand the definitions.
# - Continuum: A compact, connected metric space.
# - Decomposable Continuum: A continuum X that is the union of two of its
#   proper subcontinua (i.e., X = A U B, where A and B are subcontinua
#   and A != X, B != X).
# - Regular Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum S that is the closure of its
#   interior, i.e., S = cl(int(S)).

# Step 2: Prove that the cardinality must be at least 2.
# Let X be a nondegenerate decomposable continuum. By definition, X = A U B,
# where A and B are proper subcontinua of X.

# Consider two sets:
# H = cl(X \ A)  (the closure of the complement of A)
# K = cl(X \ B)  (the closure of the complement of B)

# Based on established theorems in continuum theory, we can state the following:
# 1. For any proper subcontinuum S of a continuum X, cl(X \ S) is a continuum.
#    Therefore, H and K are continua.
# 2. Since X = A U B, we have (X \ A) subset B. Thus, H = cl(X \ A) is a subset of B.
#    Because B is a proper subcontinuum, H must also be a proper subcontinuum.
#    Similarly, K is a proper subcontinuum.
# 3. The closure of any open set is a regular closed set. Since A and B are closed,
#    (X \ A) and (X \ B) are open. Therefore, H and K are regular closed sets.
#    Combined with (1), this means H and K are regular subcontinua.

# So, we have two regular proper subcontinua, H and K. We must show they are distinct.
# Assume for contradiction that H = K.
# This means cl(X \ A) = cl(X \ B).
# From property (2), we know cl(X \ B) is a subset of A. So H is a subset of A.
# Since X = A U B and B is a proper subcontinuum, the set (B \ A) must be non-empty.
# Let p be a point in (B \ A). By definition, p is in B and p is not in A.
# Since p is not in A, p is in (X \ A).
# Therefore, p must be in the closure of (X \ A), which is H.
# So we have p is in H. But we also established that H is a subset of A.
# This implies p is in A.
# This contradicts our choice of p, which was explicitly not in A.
# The contradiction proves our assumption H = K was false. Thus, H and K are distinct.
# This completes the proof that there are always at least two regular proper subcontinua.

# Step 3: Show that a cardinality of 2 is achievable.
# We need an example of a continuum with exactly two regular proper subcontinua.
# Construct X by taking the union of two indecomposable continua, C1 and C2,
# which intersect at a single point {p}. (An indecomposable continuum is one that
# cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua).
# Let X = C1 U C2.
# - X is a non-degenerate decomposable continuum (its decomposition is C1 and C2).
# - The only regular proper subcontinua of X are C1 and C2 themselves.
#   - To see why C1 is regular, note that its interior in X is int(C1) = C1 \ {p}.
#     The closure of this set is cl(C1 \ {p}) = C1. So C1 is regular.
#   - A similar argument shows C2 is regular.
#   - Any other subcontinuum can be shown to not be regular. For example, any proper
#     subcontinuum of C1 has an empty interior in X and thus cannot be regular. Any
#     subcontinuum that properly contains C1 is not regular because its regularization
#     is C1 itself.

# Step 4: Final Conclusion.
# From Step 2, the cardinality is always at least 2.
# From Step 3, the cardinality can be exactly 2.
# Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.

smallest_cardinality = 2
