    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to understand its notation and how it applies to different atoms. The total number depends on the specific atom in question.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the basis set name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **6-311G**: This describes the contraction scheme for s and p orbitals.\n        *   **Core orbitals**: Represented by one contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n        *   **Valence orbitals**: Are of the triple-zeta type, split into three functions. The inner part is a contraction of **3** primitives, while the middle and outer parts are single, uncontracted primitives (**1** and **1**).\n    *   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. A set of d-functions consists of 6 primitives.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. A set of p-functions consists of 3 primitives.\n\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom Type:**\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H):** It only has a valence 1s orbital and added p-polarization functions.\n    *   **For a heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, C):** It has a 1s core orbital, 2s and 2p valence orbitals, and added d-polarization functions.\n\n3.  **Provide a Concrete Example:** I will calculate the total number of primitives for a simple molecule, methane (CHâ‚„), which contains both atom types.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the breakdown for each step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set\n    for Hydrogen, a representative heavy atom (Carbon), and Methane (CH4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom ---\n    print(\"1.
