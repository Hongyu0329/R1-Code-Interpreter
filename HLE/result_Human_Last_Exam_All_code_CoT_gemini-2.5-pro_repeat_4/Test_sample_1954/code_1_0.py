# Define symbolic variables
# 'n' is the number of i.i.d. observations, and also the number of trials in each observation.
# 'theta' is the parameter of the Binomial distribution we want to estimate.
# 'alpha' and 'beta' are the parameters for the Beta prior distribution.
n = sympy.Symbol('n', positive=True, integer=True)
theta = sympy.Symbol('theta')
alpha = sympy.Symbol('alpha', positive=True)
beta = sympy.Symbol('beta', positive=True)

# Step 1: Formulate the problem in terms of a sufficient statistic.
# We have n i.i.d. observations X_i ~ Bin(n, theta).
# The sufficient statistic is Y = sum(X_i), which follows a Bin(n*n, theta) distribution.
# Let N be the total number of trials in our equivalent single-observation problem.
N = n**2

# Step 2: Define the Bayes estimator for a Beta prior.
# Under squared error loss, the Bayes estimator for theta based on an observation Y from Bin(N, theta)
# and a Beta(alpha, beta) prior is the posterior mean:
# delta(Y) = (Y + alpha) / (N + alpha + beta)

# Step 3: Calculate the risk of the Bayes estimator.
# The risk R(delta, theta) = E[(delta(Y) - theta)^2] can be expanded into a polynomial in theta.
# The general form of the risk function is:
# R(theta) = [theta^2*((alpha+beta)^2 - N) + theta*(N - 2*alpha*(alpha+beta)) + alpha^2] / (N + alpha + beta)^2

# Step 4: Find alpha and beta that result in a constant risk (an "equalizer rule").
# For the risk to be independent of theta, the coefficients of theta^2 and theta in the numerator must be zero.
# From the coefficient of theta^2: (alpha + beta)^2 - N = 0  =>  alpha + beta = sqrt(N)
ab_sum = sympy.sqrt(N)
# From the coefficient of theta: N - 2*alpha*(alpha + beta) = 0
# Substituting alpha + beta = sqrt(N): N - 2*alpha*sqrt(N) = 0  =>  alpha = N / (2*sqrt(N)) = sqrt(N)/2
alpha_val = sympy.sqrt(N) / 2
# From this, we find beta: beta = (alpha + beta) - alpha = sqrt(N) - sqrt(N)/2 = sqrt(N)/2
beta_val = ab_sum - alpha_val

# Step 5: Calculate the minimax risk.
# With these specific values of alpha and beta, the risk becomes constant. The value is the constant part of the risk expression:
# Risk = alpha^2 / (N + alpha + beta)^2
minimax_risk = alpha_val**2 / (N + ab_sum)**2

# Simplify the risk expression and substitute N = n^2.
# Note that sqrt(N) = sqrt(n^2) = n for positive n.
minimax_risk_final = sympy.simplify(minimax_risk.subs(N, n**2))

# Step 6: Print the final equation and its components as requested.
print("The minimax risk, R_minimax, is found by using the specific prior that makes the risk constant.")
print("The resulting equation for the minimax risk is:")

# Using str() for clean, universally compatible output
final_equation = f"R_minimax = {str(minimax_risk_final)}"
print(final_equation)

print("\nIn the final equation, the numbers that appear are:")
# The final expression is 1 / (4*(n+1)**2).
