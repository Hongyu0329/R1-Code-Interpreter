    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish a Coordinate System:** First, we'll place one of the cubes in a convenient position. Let's define the first cube (C1) to occupy the space where its coordinates (x, y, z) are all between 0 and 1. This cube has a side length of 1.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The \"main diagonal\" for this cube connects the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite corner (1,1,1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most naturally interpreted as a translation by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the Second Cube:** Applying this shift to the first cube gives us the position of the second cube (C2). Its coordinates (x, y, z) will range from 0 + 1/2 to 1 + 1/2. So, C2 occupies the space where 1/2 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 3/2.\n\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region of space that belongs to *both* cubes. We can find this by determining the overlap for each coordinate axis:\n    *   For the x-axis, the overlap between [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1].\n    *   The same logic applies to the y and z axes, giving an overlap of [1/2, 1] for both.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube defined by 1/2 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1. The side length of this cube is the length of the interval [1/2, 1], which is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The volume is this side length cubed.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two shifted cubes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the side length of the cubes as a fraction for precise output.\n    side_length = Fraction(1, 1)\n\n    # Define the shift along each axis. A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\"\n    # is interpreted as a translation by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n    shift = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the coordinates of the two cubes.\n    # Let the first cube (C1) occupy the region [0, 1] on each axis.\n    c1_min = Fraction(0)\n    c1_max = side_length\n\n    # The second cube (C2) is shifted by `shift` from the first cube.\n    c2_min = c1_min + shift\n    c2_max = c1_max + shift\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the cubes in a coordinate system.\")\n    print(f\"Let the first cube be defined by the ranges: {c1_min} <= x,y,z <= {c1_max}.\")\n    print(f\"The second cube is shifted by {shift} along each axis, so it is defined by the ranges: {c2_min} <= x,y,z <= {c2_max}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the intersection.\n    # The intersection's range on each axis is the overlap of the two cubes' ranges.\n    intersection_min = max(c1_min, c2_min)\n    intersection_max = min(c1_max, c2_max)\n\n    # The side length of the resulting intersection cube.\n    intersection_side_length = intersection_max - intersection_min\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Find the region of intersection.\")\n    print(f\"The overlapping range for each axis is from max({c1_min}, {c2_min}) to min({c1_max}, {c2_max}), which is [{intersection_min}, {intersection_max}].\")\n    print(f\"This means the intersection is a cube with a side length of {intersection_max} - {intersection_min} = {intersection_side_length}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the volume of the intersection.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the volume of the intersection cube.\")\n    print(\"The volume is the side length cubed.\")\n    # The final equation with each number explicitly shown\n    print(f\"Volume = ({intersection_side_length}) * ({intersection_side_length}) * ({intersection_side_length}) = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n<<<1/8>>>\n```"
