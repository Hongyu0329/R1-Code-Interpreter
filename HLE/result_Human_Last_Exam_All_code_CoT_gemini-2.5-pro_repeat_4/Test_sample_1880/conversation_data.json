    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we'll verify that the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. A common method for this is Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant of the polynomial is a key invariant. Whether or not it is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ tells us if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial, which for $x^4 + px + q$ is $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$. We will then check if this cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots.\n4.  **Determine the Group:** The combination of the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic allows us to identify the Galois group from the list of possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ ($S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$).\n    *   If the resolvent is reducible with one rational root, the group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n    *   We can distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ by checking if the quadratic factor of the resolvent splits in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n5.  **State the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is the answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements these steps to compute the order.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_square_free_part(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the square-free part of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # The field is Q(sqrt(n)), so we can work with the absolute value.\n    n = abs(n)\n    i = 2\n    # Iteratively divide out square factors.\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % (i * i) == 0:\n            n //= (i * i)\n        i += 1\n    return n\n\ndef find_integer_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Finds all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    if n == 0:\n        return [0]\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_galois_quartic():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the Galois group for the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # Step 1: Check irreducibility (can be done manually)\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"p=2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\")\n    print(\"p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(\"p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the quartic\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant Δ.\")\n    discriminant = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\n    print(f\"The formula for a depressed quartic x^4+px+q is Δ = 256*q^3 - 27*p^4.\")\n    print(f\"Δ = 256*({q})^3 - 27*({p})^4 = 256*{q**3} - 27*{p**4} = {256 * q**3} - {27 * p**4} = {discriminant}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check if the discriminant is a perfect square in Q\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Check if Δ is a perfect square.\")\n    is_square = False\n    if discriminant > 0:\n        sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n        if sqrt_discriminant**2 == discriminant:\n            is_square = True\n\n    if is_square:\n        print(f\"Δ = {discriminant} is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is a subgroup of the alternating group A_4.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Δ = {discriminant} is not a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is not a subgroup of the alternating group A_4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 4: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic\n    print(\"Step 4: Analyze the resolvent cubic g(t).\")\n    # g(t) = t^3 - 4*q*t - p^2\n    c1 = -4 * q\n    c0 = -(p**2)\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic is g(t) = t^3 - 4*({q})*t - ({p})^2 = t^3 + {c1}t + {c0}.\")\n    \n    # Search for rational roots (which must be integer divisors of the constant term)\n    divisors = find_integer_divisors(c0)\n    rational_roots = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        if d**3 + c1 * d + c0 == 0:\n            rational_roots.append(d)\n\n    if not rational_roots:\n        is_resolvent_reducible = False\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic has no rational roots, so it is irreducible over Q.\")\n    else:\n        is_resolvent_reducible = True\n        print(f\"Found rational root(s): {rational_roots}.
