    1.  Reaction Analysis:
        The goal is to synthesize (2-bromo-4-chlorophenyl)boronic acid from 2-bromo-4-chloro-1-iodobenzene.
        - The first step uses 1.05 equivalents of n-BuLi at -78 degrees Celsius. This is a halogen-metal exchange reaction.
        - Given the halogen reactivity order for this exchange (Iodine > Bromine > Chlorine), the n-BuLi is expected to selectively replace the iodine atom at position 1 with lithium.
        - The second step uses 5 equivalents of trimethyl borate to trap the newly formed organolithium species, which after workup (hydrolysis) should yield the desired boronic acid.

    2.  Problem Identification:
        - The desired product, (2-bromo-4-chlorophenyl)boronic acid, should show only a single signal in the 11B NMR spectrum.
        - The observation of two different Boron signals indicates that a significant boron-containing byproduct was also formed.

    3.  Root Cause Diagnosis:
        - The most likely source of the byproduct is a non-optimal reaction condition.
        - The amount of n-BuLi (1.05 eq) and the temperature (-78 C) are standard for this type of reaction.
        - The most unusual condition is the very large excess of the trapping agent, trimethyl borate (5 eq). Standard laboratory procedures typically use a much smaller excess, around 1.2-1.5 equivalents.
        - A large excess of trimethyl borate can lead to side reactions. For example, it can lead to the formation of stable borate "ate" complexes that are difficult to hydrolyze completely during workup, resulting in a mixture of the desired boronic acid and a second boron-containing species.

    4.  Evaluating the Options:
        A. Decrease the temperature: The reaction is already very cold (-78 C) to ensure selectivity. Lowering it further is unlikely to solve a stoichiometry issue.
        B. Use triethylborate: Swapping the borate ester will not solve the fundamental problem caused by the large excess.
        C. Use more precise amount of n-BuLi: 1.05 eq is already a standard amount. The problem is not with the lithium reagent, but with the trapping step.
        D. Use less trimethyl borate: This is the most logical solution. Reducing the amount of trimethyl borate from 5 equivalents to a more standard 1.2-1.5 equivalents will minimize the potential for side reactions while still providing enough reagent to effectively trap the organolithium.
        E. Change the solvent: THF is an excellent and standard solvent for this reaction. Changing it is not a logical fix.
