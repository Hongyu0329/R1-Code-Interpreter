    "To find the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter cutoff that is both greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific, I will analyze the provided ROC curve data.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will represent the data from the ROC curve table, which contains Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter cutoffs, along with their corresponding sensitivity and specificity percentages.\n2.  The user has specified two conditions:\n    *   Sensitivity > 60%\n    *   Specificity > 80%\n3.  A strict interpretation of these conditions (e.g., specificity must be 80.1% or higher) against the discrete data points in the table reveals that no single cutoff value satisfies both criteria simultaneously. The cutoff `>8.0 mm` has 80.0% specificity (not strictly greater), and the next cutoff `>9.0 mm` has a sensitivity of 52.9% (not greater than 60%).\n4.  This indicates a likely ambiguity in the term \"greater than,\" which is common in such problems. I will proceed by interpreting \"greater than 80% specific\" as \"greater than or equal to 80% specific\" (`>= 80%`), as this is the most reasonable assumption that yields a solution from the given data. The condition for sensitivity remains strictly \"greater than 60%\" (`> 60%`).\n5.  I will write a Python script to iterate through all the data points and identify the cutoffs that satisfy these adjusted conditions (`Sensitivity > 60%` AND `Specificity >= 80%`).\n6.  The question asks for the \"at most\" diameter, which corresponds to the largest cutoff value found. The script will identify this maximum value.\n7.  Finally, the script will print the reasoning, the final check showing the numbers, and the resulting diameter.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_diameter_cutoff():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ROC curve data to find the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter cutoff\n    that satisfies the given sensitivity and specificity criteria.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the ROC curve table provided in the problem context.\n    # Format: (Cutoff_Value_in_mm, Sensitivity_%, Specificity_%)\n    roc_data = [\n        (2.0, 100.0, 0.0),\n        (3.0, 100.0, 0.0),\n        (4.0, 94.1, 13.3),\n        (5.0, 88.2, 26.7),\n        (6.0, 76.5, 46.7),\n        (7.0, 70.6, 60.0),\n        (8.0, 64.7, 80.0),\n        (9.0, 52.9, 93.3),\n        (10.0, 41.2, 100.0),\n        (11.0, 23.5, 100.0),\n        (12.0, 11.8, 100.0),\n        (13.0, 5.9, 100.0),\n        (14.0, 0.0, 100.0)\n    ]\n\n    # Target thresholds from the user's question.\n    target_sensitivity = 60\n    target_specificity = 80\n\n    print(\"Finding the maximum AM diameter cutoff (>X mm) with:\")\n    print(f\"1.
