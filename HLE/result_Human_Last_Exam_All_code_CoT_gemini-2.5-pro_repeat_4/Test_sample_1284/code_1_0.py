def solve_dimension_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible dimension n for which the given
    Fourier extension inequality does not always hold.

    The problem is a variant of the local Fourier restriction conjecture.
    - For n=2, the conjecture holds true. This is a classic result in harmonic analysis.
    - For n>=3, the conjecture is known to fail. The first counterexamples were constructed for n=3.

    The special condition on the set X (disjoint projections of the balls) complicates the
    construction of a counterexample but is not expected to change the fundamental dimension threshold
    where the failure first occurs. The geometric properties of R^n that lead to the failure of the
    conjecture begin at n=3.

    Therefore, the smallest dimension n for which the inequality is not guaranteed to hold is 3.
