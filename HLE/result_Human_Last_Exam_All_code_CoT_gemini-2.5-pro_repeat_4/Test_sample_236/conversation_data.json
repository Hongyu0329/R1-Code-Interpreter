    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify all knots with at most four crossings.** These are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n2.  **Determine which surgeries produce homology spheres.** A surgery on a knot K with coefficient `n` (an integer) produces a homology 3-sphere if and only if `|n| = 1`. Thus, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries.\n3.  **Analyze the results for each knot.** We need to account for the knot's chirality (whether it is distinct from its mirror image) and whether different surgeries on the same knot produce distinct elements.\n4.  **Count the unique elements.** Sum up the number of distinct elements obtained from all the knots.\n\nThe following Python code systematically performs this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to find the number of elements:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Knots with at most 4 crossings: Unknot (0_1), Trefoil (3_1), Figure-eight (4_1)\n    # We analyze the homology spheres from +1 and -1 surgery on each.\n\n    # 1.
