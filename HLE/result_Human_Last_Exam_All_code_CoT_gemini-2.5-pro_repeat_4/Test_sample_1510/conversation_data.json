    "My plan is to solve this problem by first establishing the relationship between the 17 wallpaper groups and their respective point groups. I will then identify which of these point groups have an order of 2. Finally, I will write a Python script that counts the wallpaper groups corresponding to these specific point groups and presents the result.\n\nHere are the steps for the script:\n1.  Create a dictionary to map each of the 17 wallpaper groups (e.g., 'p1', 'p2gg') to its crystallographic point group (e.g., '1', '2').\n2.  Identify the two point groups that have an order of 2: point group '2' (two-fold rotation) and point group 'm' (reflection).\n3.  Iterate through the wallpaper group dictionary, filtering for groups whose point group is either '2' or 'm'.\n4.  Collect these matching groups into two separate lists.\n5.  Print the lists of matching groups, explaining which point group they belong to.\n6.  Finally, print the total count as a sum of the number of groups in each list, showing the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A mapping of the 17 wallpaper groups to their respective point groups.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        \"p1\": \"1\",\n        \"p2\": \"2\",\n        \"pm\": \"m\",\n        \"pg\": \"m\",\n        \"cm\": \"m\",\n        \"p2mm\": \"2mm\",\n        \"p2mg\": \"2mm\",\n        \"p2gg\": \"2\",\n        \"c2mm\": \"2mm\",\n        \"p4\": \"4\",\n        \"p4mm\": \"4mm\",\n        \"p4gm\": \"4mm\",\n        \"p3\": \"3\",\n        \"p3m1\": \"3m\",\n        \"p31m\": \"3m\",\n        \"p6\": \"6\",\n        \"p6mm\": \"6mm\",\n    }\n\n    # The order for each of the 10 2D crystallographic point groups.\n    # The point groups with order 2 are '2' and 'm'.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        '1': 1,\n        '2': 2,    # Consists of {identity, 180-degree rotation}\n        'm': 2,    # Consists of {identity, reflection}\n        '2mm': 4,\n        '3': 3,\n        '3m': 6,\n        '4': 4,\n        '4mm': 8,\n        '6': 6,\n        '6mm': 12,\n    }\n\n    # Lists to hold the groups that match our criteria.\n    groups_with_pg_2 = []\n    groups_with_pg_m = []\n\n    # Iterate through all wallpaper groups and categorize them.\n    for group, point_group in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(point_group) == 2:\n            if point_group == '2':\n                groups_with_pg_2.append(group)\n            elif point_group == 'm':\n                groups_with_pg_m.append(group)\n\n    print(\"The 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2 are '2' (rotational) and 'm' (reflectional).\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"There are {len(groups_with_pg_2)} wallpaper groups with point group '2':\")\n    print(\", \".join(sorted(groups_with_pg_2)))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(f\"There are {len(groups_with_pg_m)} wallpaper groups with point group 'm':\")\n    print(\", \".join(sorted(groups_with_pg_m)))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    total = len(groups_with_pg_2) + len(groups_with_pg_m)\n    print(\"The total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is:\")\n    print(f\"{len(groups_with_pg_2)} + {len(groups_with_pg_m)} = {total}\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_order()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
