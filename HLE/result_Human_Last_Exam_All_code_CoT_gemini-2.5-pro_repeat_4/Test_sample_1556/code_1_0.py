# Step 1: Define the given probability of measuring the |0> state at the output.
p_out_0 = 0.36

# Step 2: Calculate the probability of measuring the |1> state at the output.
# According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the sum of probabilities for a complete set of outcomes is 1.
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0

# Step 3: Define the relationship based on the interpreted property.
# The interpreted property states that the output probability of measuring |1> is the square
# of the input probability of measuring |0>.
# P_out(1) = (P_in(0))²
# We are looking for P_in(0), which is |α|².

# Step 4: Construct the equation with the known values.
# This gives the equation: 0.64 = (|α|²)²
print(f"Based on the problem's data and a logical interpretation, we form the equation:")
print(f"{p_out_1} = (|α|²)²")

# Step 5: Solve for |α|².
# This requires taking the square root of P_out(1).
alpha_squared = math.sqrt(p_out_1)

# Step 6: Print the final calculation and result.
print(f"Solving for |α|²:")
print(f"|α|² = sqrt({p_out_1})")
print(f"|α|² = {alpha_squared}")
