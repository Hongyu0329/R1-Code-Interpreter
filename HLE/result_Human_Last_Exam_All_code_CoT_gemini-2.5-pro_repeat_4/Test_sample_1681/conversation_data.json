    "An optimal strategy in the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma can resolve the conflict of interest inherent in the classical game, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome. This is achieved by allowing players to access strategies beyond simple cooperation or defection, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically entanglement and superposition.\n\nHere is my plan to find the equilibrium point:\n1.  **Set up the Quantum Game:** I will define the game using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard framework for quantum games. This involves:\n    *   An initial state where the players' choices are quantumly entangled. I will use a maximally entangling operator `J`.\n    *   A set of strategies for each player, which are unitary transformations on their respective qubits. The strategy set will include the classical choices 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D), plus a new quantum-only strategy 'Q'.\n2.  **Define the Strategies:**\n    *   **Cooperate (C):** The 'do nothing' operation, represented by the Identity matrix `I`.\n    *   **Defect (D):** The classical choice to defect, represented by a bit-flip like operation `iσ_x`.\n    *   **Quantum (Q):** A \"miracle\" move that leverages the quantum nature of the game, represented by `iσ_z`.\n3.  **Calculate Payoffs:** I will write a function to compute the expected payoff for each player given their chosen strategies. This involves calculating the final state of the system after the players' operations and then determining the probability of each classical outcome (`CC`, `CD`, `DC`, `DD`).\n4.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:** I will analyze the payoffs to find the Nash Equilibrium (NE). A pair of strategies is a NE if neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. I will show that the classical equilibrium `(D, D)` is no longer stable, and a new, better equilibrium `(Q, Q)` emerges.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The code will print the analysis, including the payoff calculations that prove `(Q, Q)` is the unique and optimal Nash Equilibrium. Finally, it will print the equation for the equilibrium payoff and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum framework to find the equilibrium point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
