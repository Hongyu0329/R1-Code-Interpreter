    "In this task, I will analyze the technical characteristics of the reverse turn in each of the listed ballroom dances to determine which one has a fundamental rule that makes overturning impossible.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the dances and the concept of a \"reverse turn\" and \"overturning\".\n2.  Examine the core technique of each dance (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Quickstep).\n3.  Identify the specific technical rule in one of these dances that prevents overturning a reverse turn. In Tango, a fundamental principle is that the feet do not pass each other when moving backward. Overturning a reverse figure (like a Rock Turn) would require a pivot or foot action that violates this rule.\n4.  Contrast this with the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, etc.), where overturning is possible and often used, for example, to navigate corners.\n5.  Construct a Python script that programmatically presents this reasoning and identifies the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a ballroom dance technique question and provides a reasoned answer.\n    The question is: In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without\n    disregarding the technique?\n    \"\"\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # The correct answer is European Tango.\n    correct_answer_key = 'C'\n    correct_answer_value = options[correct_answer_key]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the dance technique question...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the concept of 'overturning' a turn.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Terms\")\n    print(\"'Reverse Turn' is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left.\")\n    print(\"'Overturning' means rotating more than the standard amount for that figure.\")\n    print(\"The question asks in which dance this is impossible without breaking a fundamental rule.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the dances.\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing each dance style\")\n    print(f\"Analysis for A, B, D, E ({options['A']}, {options['B']}, {options['D']}, {options['E']}):\")\n    print(\"These are 'swing' dances. They use techniques like CBM (Contra Body Movement), sway, and heel turns which allow for flexibility in the amount of turn. Overturning a Reverse Turn is possible and often done, for example to navigate a corner. It does not violate a core principle of these dances.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Analysis for C ({options['C']}):\")\n    print(\"The European Tango has a unique and rigid technique. A fundamental rule of the Tango 'walk' is that the feet are never supposed to pass each other while moving backward.\")\n    print(\"The man's part in a typical Reverse Turn figure (like a Rock Turn) involves stepping backward. To add extra rotation ('overturn' it), the man would be forced to pivot or cross his feet in a way that violates this core 'no passing feet backward' rule.\")\n    print(\"This makes overturning the turn technically impossible without disregarding a foundational technique of the Tango.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude the findings.\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(f\"Based on the analysis, the only dance where overturning a reverse turn is fundamentally against the technique is the {correct_answer_value}.\")\n\n    # Final Answer Output\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The correct option is {correct_answer_key}, {correct_answer_value}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_technique_question()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
