    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Inputs**: The values `alpha_p`, `beta_p`, and `gamma_p` are defined as sums involving a very large prime `p = 2^127 - 1`. Direct computation is infeasible. The key is to analyze these inputs in base `p`. The sums are structured in a way that gives the base-`p` digits of `alpha_p`, `beta_p`, and `gamma_p` directly. These digits repeat in a cycle of three.\n\n2.  **Use Lucas's Theorem Analogue**: The function `f(a,b,c)` has a structure related to multinomial coefficients, and its generating function `G(x,y,z) = 1 / (1 - x - y^2 - z^3)` satisfies the property `G(x,y,z)^p ≡ G(x^p, y^p, z^p) (mod p)`. This leads to a powerful simplification for `f` modulo `p`, similar to Lucas's Theorem for binomial coefficients:\n    `f(a, b, c) ≡ product_k f(a_k, b_k, c_k) (mod p)`\n    where `a_k`, `b_k`, `c_k` are the base-`p` digits of `a`, `b`, `c`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Component Values**: I will calculate `f(a_k, b_k, c_k)` for the three repeating digit vectors: `f(1, 8, 3)`, `f(3, 4, 9)`, and `f(4, 4, 12)`. The function `f(a,b,c)` can be calculated as the multinomial coefficient `(a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n4.  **Form the Product**: The final result will be a large product of these component `f` values. The overall product can be written as `P^E (mod p)`, where `P` is the product of the three unique `f` values, and `E` is an exponent related to `p`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Exponentiation**: I will simplify the exponent `E = (3p+1)/2` using modular arithmetic properties like Fermat's Little Theorem (`x^p ≡ x mod p`). This will reduce the calculation to `P^2 * (P/p) (mod p)`, where `(P/p)` is the Legendre symbol.\n\n6.  **Compute the Legendre Symbol**: I will calculate `(P/p)` using its properties and the law of quadratic reciprocity. This involves finding the prime factorization of `P` and computing `p` modulo small primes (3 and 4).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: I will combine all the pieces to find the final numerical value of `f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p`. The Python script will perform all these calculations and print the final equation and its result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by calculating f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the function f(a,b,c) and helpers ---\n    # f(a,b,c) is the number of paths from (0,0,0) to (a,b,c) using steps\n    # (1,0,0), (0,2,0), and (0,0,3).
