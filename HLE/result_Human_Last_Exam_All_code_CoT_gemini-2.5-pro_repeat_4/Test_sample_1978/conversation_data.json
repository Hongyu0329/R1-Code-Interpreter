    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system (n):** The dimension is the number of unknown functions in the vector `x(t)`.\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (m):** We need to examine the given boundary conditions and count how many of them are unique and not combinations of each other.\n3.  **Calculate the index (k):** The index of a boundary-value problem is defined as `k = m - n`.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given problem:\n\n1.  **Dimension (n):** The vector of unknown functions is given as `x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t), ..., x_2024(t))`. This vector has 2024 components. Therefore, the dimension of the system is `n = 2024`.\n\n2.  **Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions (m):** The given boundary conditions are:\n    *   `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0`  (dividing by 5 gives `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`)\n    *   `100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0` (dividing by 100 gives `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`)\n    *   `1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0` (dividing by -1000 gives `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`)\n    *   `100x_2024(T) - 100x_2024(0) = 0` (dividing by 100 gives `x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0`)\n\n    As we can see, the second, third, fourth, and fifth conditions are all multiples of each other, meaning they are linearly dependent and represent the same single constraint on `x_2(t)`. Therefore, the set of linearly independent conditions is:\n    *   `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0`\n\n    There are 3 linearly independent boundary conditions. So, `m = 3`.\n\n3.  **Index (k):** Now we can calculate the index using the formula `k = m - n`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).\n    # The system is defined for x(t) = (x_1(t), ..., x_2024(t)).\n    n = 2024\n    print(f\"The dimension of the system (n) is {n}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (m).\n    # The given conditions are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0\n    # 4. 100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0\n    # 5. 1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0\n    # 6. 100x_2024(T) - 100x_2024(0) = 0\n    # Conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are linearly dependent.\n    # The unique, linearly independent conditions are for x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n    m = 3\n    print(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions (m) is {m}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the index (k = m - n).\n    index = m - n\n    print(\"\\nThe index 'k' is calculated as the difference between the number of boundary conditions and the dimension of the system.\")\n    print(f\"k = m - n\")\n    print(f\"k = {m} - {n} = {index}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe final index of the problem is {index}.\")\n\nsolve_problem_index()\n```\n<<<-2021>>>"
