    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The `31` part describes the valence 1s orbital. It is a split-valence basis, meaning the 1s orbital is represented by two basis functions.\n        *   One inner function (contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   One outer function (contracted from 1 primitive Gaussian).\n        *   Total for H = 2 contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The `6` describes the core 1s orbital. It is represented by a single contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   The `31` describes the valence 2s and 2p orbitals. They are split into two sets of functions.\n            *   Inner set (from 3 primitives each): one 2s function and three 2p functions (px, py, pz). This is 4 functions.\n            *   Outer set (from 1 primitive each): one 2s function and three 2p functions. This is another 4 functions.\n        *   Total for C = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it contributes and then sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 valence-inner (2s, 2p) + 4 valence-outer (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 valence-inner (1s) + 1 valence-outer (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_functions_C = num_C * functions_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_functions_H = num_H * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_functions_C + total_functions_H\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final result\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_H}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal contracted Gaussian functions are calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} C atoms * {functions_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_H} H atoms * {functions_per_H} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions_C} + {total_functions_H}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_C} * {functions_per_C} + {num_H} * {functions_per_H} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
