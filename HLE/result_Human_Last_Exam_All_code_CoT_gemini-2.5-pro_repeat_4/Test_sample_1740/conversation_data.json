    "To accurately determine the number of human let-7 family members, I will write a script to query the authoritative microRNA database, miRBase. The let-7 family is defined by a common sequence motif, and membership includes not only miRNAs with \"let-7\" in their name but also other related miRNAs like \"mir-98\". The standard method for counting family members is to count the distinct precursor genes (also called hairpins).\n\nMy script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Fetch the HTML content from the official miRBase web page for the entire let-7 family.\n2.  Parse the fetched content to filter for and extract the names of all precursor genes belonging to humans (*Homo sapiens*, identified by the \"hsa\" prefix).\n3.  Print each unique human member identified.\n4.  Count the total number of members and display the final sum.\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script fetches and counts the number of human let-7 family members from miRBase.\n\n# URL for the let-7 family page in the miRBase database\nURL=\"https://www.mirbase.org/family/MIPF0000002\"\n\necho \"Querying miRBase to identify human members of the let-7 miRNA family...\"\necho \"\"\n\n# Use curl to download the page content silently (-s).\n# Use grep to find lines containing links to human (\"hsa-\") hairpin precursors.\n# Use sed with a regular expression to extract just the hairpin ID from the link.\n# Use sort -u to get a unique, sorted list of members.\n# The result is stored in the 'members' variable.\nmembers=$(curl -s \"$URL\" | grep 'href=\"/hairpin/hsa-' | sed -n 's/.*hairpin\\/\\([^\"]*\\)\">.*/\\1/p' | sort -u)\n\n# Check if the 'members' variable is empty, which would indicate a failed download.\nif [ -z \"$members\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: Could not retrieve or parse data from miRBase.\"\n    echo \"Please check your internet connection or if the URL is still valid: $URL\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Count the number of lines in the 'members' variable to get the total count.\ncount=$(echo \"$members\" | wc -l)\n\necho \"The following $count precursor miRNA genes were identified in the human let-7 family:\"\n# Print each member on a new line.\necho \"$members\"\necho \"\"\n\necho \"Final Calculation:\"\n# To fulfill the request to show the equation, we represent each found member as '1'.\n# We replace each line in 'members' with a '1', join them with '+', and remove the trailing '+'.\nequation=$(echo \"$members\" | sed 's/.*/1/' | tr '\\n' '+' | sed 's/+$//')\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\necho \"$equation = $count\"\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
