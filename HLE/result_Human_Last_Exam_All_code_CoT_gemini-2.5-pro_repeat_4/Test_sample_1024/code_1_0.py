# Step 1: Solve for Part (A).
# The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where a horse's shoes
# are manipulated to create misleading tracks resembling those of a cow.
# Thus, the answer corresponds to option 6.
part_a = 6

# Step 2: Solve for Part (C).
# Nabokov's most extensive and direct experience with "intricate back-referencing"
# came from his monumental scholarly work: the translation of and commentary on
# Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin."
# Thus, the answer corresponds to option 7.
part_c = 7

# Step 3: Use the sum constraint to solve for Part (B).
# The problem states the sum of the three numbers must be a multiple of 8.
# a + c = 6 + 7 = 13.
# To reach the nearest multiple of 8 (which is 16), part_b must be 3.
# The theme for option 3, "education vs mis-education," fits perfectly with the
# allusion to misleading clues and the novel's central theme of misinterpretation.
part_b = 3

# Step 4: Form the final equation and print the result.
# The final equation is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16.
# The code will now print the three numbers separated by spaces as requested.
print(f"{part_a} {part_b} {part_c}")
