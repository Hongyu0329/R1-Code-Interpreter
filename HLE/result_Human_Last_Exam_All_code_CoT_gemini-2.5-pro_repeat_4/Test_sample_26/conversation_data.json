    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use tools from algebraic topology, specifically the long exact sequence of homotopy groups and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Set up the long exact sequence:** We consider the pair of spaces $( \\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ and the associated long exact sequence of homotopy groups.\n2.  **Apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem:** This theorem relates the homotopy groups of the hypersurface $X$ to the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. For a complex submanifold $X$ of complex dimension $k$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. In our case, $X$ has complex dimension 2 in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so the map $i_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 2$ and a surjection for $i=2$.\n3.  **Simplify the sequence:** We'll show that the map on $\\pi_2$ is actually an isomorphism. This simplifies the long exact sequence into a short exact sequence involving $\\pi_3(X)$, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$, and the relative homotopy group $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n4.  **Use rank additivity:** For the resulting short exact sequence of groups $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$, the ranks are additive: $\\text{rank}(B) = \\text{rank}(A) + \\text{rank}(C)$. The rank of an abelian group is the size of a maximal linearly independent subset, or equivalently, the dimension of the group tensored with $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n5.  **Calculate the ranks of the known groups:**\n    *   We will determine the rank of $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. This is done by relating it to the homotopy groups of spheres.\n    *   We will determine the rank of the relative group $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ using the relative Hurewicz theorem, which connects it to the relative homology group $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n6.  **Solve for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$:** With the other ranks known, we can solve for our target quantity, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X))$.\n\nThe detailed reasoning leads to the following conclusion: both $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ and $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ are torsion groups, meaning their ranks are 0. This implies that the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ must also be 0.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes the final step of the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a\n# smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n\n# Step 1: From the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X)\n# and the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, we derive the following short exact sequence:\n# 0 -> pi_3(X) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> pi_3(CP^3, X) -> 0\n\n# Step 2: For this short exact sequence, the ranks of the groups are additive.\n# The rank of a group is the rank of the free part of its abelianization.\n# The equation for the ranks is:\n# rank(pi_3(CP^3)) = rank(pi_3(X)) + rank(pi_3(CP^3, X))\n\n# Step 3: We determine the ranks of the known terms.\n# For pi_3(CP^3): From the fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3, we know that\n# pi_3(CP^3) is isomorphic to pi_3(S^7).\n# pi_3(S^7) is the finite cyclic group Z_120.\n# A finite group consists only of torsion elements, so its rank is 0.\nrank_pi3_CP3 = 0\n\n# For the relative group pi_3(CP^3, X): By the relative Hurewicz theorem,\n# its rank is equal to the rank of the relative homology group H_3(CP^3, X).\n# By analyzing the long exact sequence of rational homology, it can be shown\n# that H_3(CP^3, X; Q) is the zero vector space.\n# Therefore, the rank of H_3(CP^3, X) is 0.\nrank_pi3_relative = 0\n\n# Step 4: We substitute these ranks into the equation to find the rank of pi_3(X).\n# Let rank_pi3_X be the unknown rank.\n# The equation is: rank_pi3_CP3 = rank_pi3_X + rank_pi3_relative\nrank_pi3_X = rank_pi3_CP3 - rank_pi3_relative\n\nprint(\"Based on the derived short exact sequence, the ranks of the homotopy groups are related by the equation:\")\nprint(\"rank(pi_3(CP^3)) = rank(pi_3(X)) + rank(pi_3(CP^3, X))\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The calculated rank of pi_3(CP^3) is: {rank_pi3_CP3}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated rank of the relative group pi_3(CP^3, X) is: {rank_pi3_relative}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Substituting the known values into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{rank_pi3_CP3} = rank(pi_3(X)) + {rank_pi3_relative}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Solving for the rank of pi_3(X):\")\nprint(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = {rank_pi3_CP3} - {rank_pi3_relative}\")\nprint(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = {rank_pi3_X}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
