# The problem is to find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a
# smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.

# Step 1: From the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X)
# and the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, we derive the following short exact sequence:
# 0 -> pi_3(X) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> pi_3(CP^3, X) -> 0

# Step 2: For this short exact sequence, the ranks of the groups are additive.
# The rank of a group is the rank of the free part of its abelianization.
# The equation for the ranks is:
# rank(pi_3(CP^3)) = rank(pi_3(X)) + rank(pi_3(CP^3, X))

# Step 3: We determine the ranks of the known terms.
# For pi_3(CP^3): From the fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3, we know that
# pi_3(CP^3) is isomorphic to pi_3(S^7).
# pi_3(S^7) is the finite cyclic group Z_120.
# A finite group consists only of torsion elements, so its rank is 0.
rank_pi3_CP3 = 0

# For the relative group pi_3(CP^3, X): By the relative Hurewicz theorem,
# its rank is equal to the rank of the relative homology group H_3(CP^3, X).
# By analyzing the long exact sequence of rational homology, it can be shown
# that H_3(CP^3, X; Q) is the zero vector space.
# Therefore, the rank of H_3(CP^3, X) is 0.
rank_pi3_relative = 0

# Step 4: We substitute these ranks into the equation to find the rank of pi_3(X).
# Let rank_pi3_X be the unknown rank.
# The equation is: rank_pi3_CP3 = rank_pi3_X + rank_pi3_relative
rank_pi3_X = rank_pi3_CP3 - rank_pi3_relative
