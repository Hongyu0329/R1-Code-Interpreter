    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the shape of the water's surface:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Icosahedron's Symmetry:** An icosahedron is a highly symmetric shape. It's one of the five Platonic solids, composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles. Crucially, it has a center of symmetry. This means that for any face, there is an identical, parallel face on the exact opposite side.\n2.  **Orient the Tank:** The problem states the icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This makes the bottom face a horizontal triangle. Its opposite, parallel face will be the top of the tank.\n3.  **Define \"Half-Filled\":** A half-filled tank means the water occupies exactly 50% of the total volume.\n4.  **Locate the Water Surface:** Because of the icosahedron's perfect symmetry, the plane that divides its volume into two equal halves is the one that passes through its center and is parallel to the base and top faces. Therefore, the water surface corresponds to this central cross-section.\n5.  **Identify the Cross-Sectional Shape:** This central plane intersects the icosahedron's edges. The vertices of the resulting cross-section are the 6 vertices of the icosahedron that are located on its \"equator,\" midway between the top and bottom faces. Connecting these 6 vertices forms a hexagon. Due to the regular structure of the icosahedron, this hexagon is a **regular hexagon** (all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees).\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer based on this reasoning.\n\n```python\n# This script determines and prints the shape of the water surface in a\n# half-filled icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces.\n\n# The reasoning is based on the symmetry of the icosahedron.\n# 1. An icosahedron has a center of symmetry.\n# 2. When standing on a face, the plane that divides the volume in half\n#    is the central plane parallel to the base face.\n# 3. This central cross-section of an icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n# The name of the resulting shape.\nsurface_shape = \"A regular hexagon\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(\"The shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on a face is:\")\nprint(surface_shape)\n```\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
