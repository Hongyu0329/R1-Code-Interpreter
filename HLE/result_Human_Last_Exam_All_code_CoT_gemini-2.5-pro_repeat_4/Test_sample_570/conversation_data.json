    "This problem is a classic question in convex geometry, closely related to a problem from the 1985 Putnam Mathematical Competition. The task is to find the minimum area of a convex set `K` that has a non-empty intersection with every line of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Identify the domain:** The condition that the convex set `K` intersects every line `px+qy=1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)` implies that `K` must contain a specific region. This minimal region is the intersection of all half-planes `px+qy <= 1`. The resulting shape is a convex polygon.\n2.  **Determine the shape and its vertices:** This polygon is a centrally symmetric hexagon with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, `(-1,-1)`, and `(0,-1)`. It is known that this hexagon is the convex domain with the minimal area that satisfies the condition.\n3.  **Calculate the area:** To calculate the area of this hexagon, I will decompose it into simpler geometric shapes whose areas are straightforward to compute. A convenient decomposition is:\n    *   A central square with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.\n    *   Two isosceles right triangles, one on top of the square and one below it.\n4.  **Sum the areas:** The total area is the sum of the areas of the square and the two triangles.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines\n    px+qy=1 for coprime integers p and q.\n\n    The minimal domain is a hexagon that can be decomposed into a square and two triangles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
