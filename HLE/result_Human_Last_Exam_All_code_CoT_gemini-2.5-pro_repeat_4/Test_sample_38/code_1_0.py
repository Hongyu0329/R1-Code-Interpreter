    Calculates the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom in a modified
    theory of linearized gravity.

    The theory is defined by the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian plus a mass term
    L_m = -m^2/2 * h_{\mu\nu} * h^{\mu\nu}.
    The 6 degrees of freedom correspond to a massive spin-2 particle (5 dof) and a
    massive spin-0 particle (1 dof). The problem asks for the mass of the spin-0
    (scalar) particle, which corresponds to the trace of the field, h.

    print("\nHere are the steps of the derivation:")

    # Step 1: EOM
    print("1. The equations of motion (EOM) derived from the Lagrangian are:")
    print("   E_{\mu\nu} - m^2 * h_{\mu\nu} = 0")
    print("   where E_{\mu\nu} is the kinetic operator from the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian.")

    # Step 2: Constraint
    print("\n2. The operator E_{\mu\nu} is divergence-free. Taking the four-divergence of the EOM gives a constraint on the field h_{\mu\nu}:")
    print("   \partial^\mu (E_{\mu\nu} - m^2 * h_{\mu\nu}) = 0  =>  -m^2 * \partial^\mu(h_{\mu\nu}) = 0")
    print("   For m != 0, this implies the constraint: \partial^\mu(h_{\mu\nu}) = 0")

    # Step 3: Trace of EOM
    print("\n3. Next, we take the trace of the original EOM:")
    print("   Tr(E_{\mu\nu}) - m^2 * Tr(h_{\mu\nu}) = 0")
    print("   Since h = Tr(h_{\mu\nu}), this becomes: Tr(E_{\mu\nu}) - m^2 * h = 0")

    # Step 4: Trace of kinetic operator
    print("\n4. The trace of the kinetic operator E_{\mu\nu} can be calculated. Using the constraint from step 2, it simplifies significantly:")
    print("   Tr(E_{\mu\nu}) = -2 * \Box(h)")
    print("   where \Box is the d'Alembert operator.")

    # Step 5: Equation for h
    print("\n5. Substituting this back into the traced EOM gives the equation of motion for the scalar mode h:")
    print("   -2 * \Box(h) - m^2 * h = 0")
    print("   Dividing by -2, we get:")
    print("   \Box(h) + (m^2 / 2) * h = 0")

    # Step 6: Identify mass
    print("\n6. This is a Klein-Gordon equation. We compare it to the standard form for a particle with squared mass M^2:")
    print("   (\Box - M^2) * h = 0")
    print("   By comparing the two forms, we find the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom.")
