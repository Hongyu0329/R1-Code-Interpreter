    This function provides the solution to the geology quiz.

    The statements are analyzed as follows:
    (1) Morrison formation as foredeep deposit: Consensus (C). This is a classic interpretation of foreland basin systems.
    (2) Metamorphic core complexes from slab window: Debated (D). A leading hypothesis, but others like gravitational collapse are also prominent.
    (3) "Nevadaplano" existence: Consensus (C). Strong paleoaltimetry and geologic evidence support a Late Cretaceous high plateau in Nevada/Utah.
    (4) "Arizonaplano" existence: Debated (D). A more recent and controversial idea than the Nevadaplano.
    (5) Laramide inboard of Sevier structures: Consensus (C). This is a fundamental spatial observation of North American Cordilleran tectonics.
    (6) Sierra Nevada/Idaho Batholiths from arc: Consensus (C). Textbook example of the roots of a continental magmatic arc.
    (7) SW-propagating Eocene ignimbrites: Consensus (C). This describes the well-established track of the Yellowstone hotspot.
    (8) Colorado Plateau uplift timing: Debated (D). One of the most significant and long-running debates in Cordilleran geology.
    (9) Cascades arc elevation history: Debated (D). The statement is inaccurate; the modern high peaks are much younger than the Oligocene.
    (10) Laramide caused by Shatsky conjugate: Debated (D). This is a specific, untestable hypothesis for the cause of flat-slab subduction, which itself is the leading but not sole theory for the Laramide orogeny.
