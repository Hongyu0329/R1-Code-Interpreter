# The final answer is derived from logical and mathematical reasoning rather than a complex computation.
# The code below outlines and prints the result of this reasoning.

# The problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes of 1000x1000
# invertible matrices A such that A^2 = I.

# Such a matrix is diagonalizable with eigenvalues +1 or -1.
# Its conjugacy class is uniquely determined by the number of -1 eigenvalues.
# Let k be the number of -1 eigenvalues.

# The matrix size determines the maximum possible value for k.
matrix_size = 1000

# k can range from 0 (for the identity matrix I) up to the matrix size
# (for the matrix -I).
min_k = 0
max_k = matrix_size

# The number of orbits is the number of possible integer values for k.
num_orbits = max_k - min_k + 1

# The final equation is based on counting the possible values for k.
print("The number of orbits is the number of possible values for k, the dimension of the (-1)-eigenspace.")
print(f"k can be any integer from {min_k} to {max_k}.")
print(f"The total number of possible values for k is calculated as:")
print(f"{max_k} - {min_k} + 1 = {num_orbits}")

# The final answer
print("\nThe number of orbits is:")
print(num_orbits)
