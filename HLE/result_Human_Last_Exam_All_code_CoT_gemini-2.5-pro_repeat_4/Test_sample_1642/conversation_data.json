    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number `m` of queens of each color (white and black) that can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard such that no white queen attacks a black queen. This means a white queen and a black queen cannot be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rephrase the Constraint**: The condition \"no white queen attacks a black queen\" means that the set of squares occupied by white queens and the set of squares occupied by black queens must be mutually non-attacking. This implies that for any white queen's position and any black queen's position, the corresponding row, column, main-diagonal, and anti-diagonal indices must be different.\n\n2.  **Partitioning Strategy**: We can partition the board's \"resources\" (rows, columns, and diagonals) between the two colors.\n    *   **Rows and Columns**: Let's assign the first half of rows and columns to white queens and the second half to black queens.\n        *   White Queens' Rows: {1, 2, ..., 8}\n        *   Black Queens' Rows: {9, 10, ..., 16}\n        *   White Queens' Columns: {1, 2, ..., 8}\n        *   Black Queens' Columns: {9, 10, ..., 16}\n        This ensures no white queen shares a row or column with a black queen. This confines white queens to the top-left 8x8 sub-board and black queens to the bottom-right 8x8 sub-board.\n\n    *   **Diagonals**: A queen at `(r, c)` occupies main-diagonal `r-c` and anti-diagonal `r+c`. The two diagonal indices (`r-c` and `r+c`) always have the same parity (both even or both odd). We can use this property. Let's color the chessboard squares. A square is \"white\" if `r+c` is even and \"black\" if `r+c` is odd.\n        *   Assign diagonals with even indices to White.\n        *   Assign diagonals with odd indices to Black.\n        This means white queens can only be placed on \"white\" squares (`r+c` is even), and black queens can only be placed on \"black\" squares (`r+c` is odd).\n\n3.  **Construct the Solution**:\n    *   **White Queens**: We can place white queens on squares `(r, c)` where `1 <= r, c <= 8` and `r+c` is even. The number of such squares in an 8x8 grid is half the total, which is `(8 * 8) / 2 = 32`.\n    *   **Black Queens**: We can place black queens on squares `(r, c)` where `9 <= r, c <= 16` and `r+c` is odd. The number of such squares in this 8x8 subgrid is also half the total, `(8 * 8) / 2 = 32`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on this construction, we can place 32 white queens and 32 black queens that satisfy the non-attacking condition. Therefore, the maximum value for `m` is 32.\n\n5.  **Verification Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this construction and verifies that no white queen attacks any black queen, then prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_peaceful_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m for the peaceful queens problem on a 16x16 board,\n    constructs a valid placement, and verifies it.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 16\n    \n    # According to our analysis, the maximum m is 32.\n    # Let's construct the placement for m=32 and verify it.\n    m = 32\n    \n    white_queens = []\n    black_queens = []\n    \n    # Place white queens on 'white' squares (r+c is even) in the top-left 8x8 subgrid.\n    for r in range(1, N // 2 + 1):\n        for c in range(1, N // 2 + 1):\n            if (r + c) % 2 == 0:\n                white_queens.append((r, c))\n\n    # Place black queens on 'black' squares (r+c is odd) in the bottom-right 8x8 subgrid.\n    for r in range(N // 2 + 1, N + 1):\n        for c in range(N // 2 + 1, N + 1):\n            if (r + c) % 2 != 0:\n                black_queens.append((r, c))\n\n    # Verify that we have found m queens of each color\n    if len(white_queens) != m or len(black_queens) != m:\n        print(f\"Error: Construction failed.
