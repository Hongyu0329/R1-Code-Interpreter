# This script calculates the maximum value of the expression:
# A = (d/dt + F1*d/dx)F11
# As outlined in the plan, the expression can be simplified to a function of
# u, u_plus, ubar, and ubar_plus.
# A = (G'''(u)G(u) - G''(u)G'(u))(u_plus - u) * exp(-2*ubar)
#     - G''(u)*G(u) * exp(-2*ubar)
#     + G''(u)*G(u_plus) * exp(-(ubar + ubar_plus))
# where G(v) = v*(1-v)**2.
# The state variables u, u_plus, ubar, ubar_plus are all in [0,1].
#
# Our analysis shows the maximum is achieved at u=0, u_plus=1, and ubar=0.
