    """
    This function calculates the number of distinct paths for the described problem.

    The problem is interpreted as finding the number of "trails" (paths with no repeated edges)
    in a graph representation of the space.

    The path must start at one end of the line segment (A) and end at the other (B).
    The line segment intersects the circle at two points (P1 and P2).

    Any path must consist of three parts:
    1. A single path from A to P1.
    2. A trail from P1 to P2.
    3. A single path from P2 to B.

    The core of the problem is to count the number of trails from P1 to P2.
    There are 3 edges connecting P1 and P2: the line segment, the upper arc, and the lower arc.

    # Category 2: Trails of length 3.
    # These trails use all three edges, following a P1 -> P2 -> P1 -> P2 pattern.
