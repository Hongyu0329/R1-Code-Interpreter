    "This task requires identifying the product of a Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reactants are pivalaldehyde and a phosphonium ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde (2,2-dimethylpropanal) has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   The ylide has the structure (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃.\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Mechanism**: The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone with the alkylidene group (the carbon part) of the ylide.\n    *   The `C=O` group from pivalaldehyde will be replaced.\n    *   The `=PPh₃` group from the ylide will be replaced.\n    *   A new C=C double bond forms between the carbon atoms from these two groups.\n3.  **Construct the Product**:\n    *   From pivalaldehyde, we get the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n    *   From the ylide, we get the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl-2)` fragment.\n    *   Combining them gives the alkene: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl-2)`.\n4.  **Name the Product**: We determine the IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene.\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible position (position 2) results in the name: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n    *   Wittig reactions with simple, unstabilized ylides (like the one given) typically yield the Z-isomer as the major product.\n    *   Therefore, the full name of the product is `(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be created to display the reaction equation and, as requested, explicitly print the numbers found in the product's chemical name.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the specified Wittig reaction,\n    prints the reaction equation, and lists the numbers in the product's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the reactants\n    aldehyde = \"Pivalaldehyde\"\n    ylide = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n\n    # 2. Determine the products based on chemical principles\n    # The main organic product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\n    # The byproduct is Triphenylphosphine oxide\n    product_alkene = \"(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    byproduct = \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n\n    # 3. Print the overall reaction\n    print(\"The Wittig reaction occurs as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{aldehyde} + {ylide} -> {product_alkene} + {byproduct}\\n\")\n\n    # 4. Fulfill the requirement to output each number in the final equation's product name\n    print(f\"The primary organic product is: {product_alkene}\")\n    \n    # Use regex to find all sequences of digits in the product name\n    numbers_in_name = re.findall(r'\\d+', product_alkene)\n    \n    print(\"The numbers in the product's IUPAC name are:\")\n    for num in numbers_in_name:\n        print(num)\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_wittig_reaction()\n```\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
