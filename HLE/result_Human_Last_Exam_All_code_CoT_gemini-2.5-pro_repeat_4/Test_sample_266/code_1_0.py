    The three statements represent different levels of explanation for the same phenomenon:
    1. Folk Psychology (the subjective experience)
    2. Behavioral Psychology (a process model, e.g., classical conditioning)
    3. Neuroscience (a potential physical implementation in the brain)

    These are not inconsistent; they are nested and complementary. However, they are distinct hypotheses.
    For instance, the psychological model (Explanation 2) could be correct, while the specific neurobiological mechanism proposed (Explanation 3) could be wrong (e.g., the key changes might occur in the amygdala instead of the PAG).
    Therefore, one hypothesis could be true while another is false.
