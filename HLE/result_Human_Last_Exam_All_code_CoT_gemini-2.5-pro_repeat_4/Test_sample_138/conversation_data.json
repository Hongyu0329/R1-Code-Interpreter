    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying a fundamental theorem from the theory of integral lattices. This approach avoids complex calculations like the Siegel mass formula and directly checks for the existence of such a lattice.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the key properties of the lattice from the user's request:\n    *   Dimension `n = 17`\n    *   Determinant `d = 2`\n    *   Type: Even\n    *   Form: Positive definite, which implies the signature `σ` (defined as `n_plus - n_minus`) is `17 - 0 = 17`.\n\n2.  Next, I will use a powerful non-existence theorem. For any even lattice `L`, its signature `σ` must be congruent to the signature of its discriminant quadratic form `q` modulo 8. This is written as: `σ ≡ signature(q) (mod 8)`.\n\n3.  Then, I will determine the possible values for `signature(q)`. The discriminant form `q` is defined on the discriminant group `L*/L`, which is an abelian group of order `d=2`. Thus, the group is `Z/2Z`. I will calculate the signature of `q` for all possible forms on this group.\n\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the check. The script will calculate `σ mod 8` and `signature(q) mod 8` and see if the condition from the theorem can be satisfied. If it cannot, no such lattice exists, and the answer is 0. The script will print out the reasoning and the numbers involved in the final check.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_lattice_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices of a given\n    dimension and determinant by checking a necessary existence condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the lattice.\n    n = 17  # Dimension\n    d = 2   # Determinant\n    # The lattice is positive definite, so its signature (n_plus - n_minus) is equal to its dimension.\n    sigma = 17\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the number of positive definite even lattices with:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Determinant d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"Signature sigma = {sigma}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: State the key theorem.\n    # Theorem: For an even lattice L, its signature (sigma) must be congruent\n    # to the signature of its discriminant quadratic form (q) modulo 8.\n    # The equation is: sigma_L ≡ signature(q_L) (mod 8)\n    print(\"We apply the theorem: sigma ≡ signature(q) (mod 8)\")\n    lhs_mod_8 = sigma % 8\n    print(f\"The left side of the congruence is sigma (mod 8):\")\n    print(f\"{sigma} mod 8 = {lhs_mod_8}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the discriminant form q and its signature.\n    # The discriminant group G = L*/L has order d.
