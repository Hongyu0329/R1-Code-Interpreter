    This function identifies the unique tau-tilting module for the path algebra
    A = C(1 -> 2 -> 3) that is not a slice module.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. For the hereditary algebra A, tau-tilting modules are the same as tilting modules.
    2. We list all indecomposable modules over A, denoted M(i,j) for the interval [i, j].
       - M(1,1): C -> 0 -> 0
       - M(2,2): 0 -> C -> 0
       - M(3,3): 0 -> 0 -> C
       - M(1,2): C -> C -> 0
       - M(2,3): 0 -> C -> C
       - M(1,3): C -> C -> C
    3. The Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver for this algebra is:
       M(1,1) -> M(1,2) -> M(1,3)
         \     /   \     /
          M(2,2) -> M(2,3)
            \     /
             M(3,3)
       An arrow from X to Y means there is an irreducible map. A path of arrows
       indicates a non-zero homomorphism.
    4. A module is a "slice module" if its indecomposable summands form a convex
       set in the AR quiver. A set S is convex if for any path X -> ... -> Y where
       X and Y are in S, all intermediate modules are also in S.
    5. There are 5 tilting (and thus tau-tilting) modules for this algebra.
       We test each one for the convexity property to determine if it is a slice.
       - T0 = M(1,1) + M(1,2) + M(1,3): This is a slice (the preprojective slice).
       - T1 = M(1,2) + M(1,3) + M(2,2): This is a slice.
       - T2 = M(1,3) + M(2,2) + M(2,3): This is a slice.
       - T3 = M(1,3) + M(2,3) + M(3,3): This is a slice (the preinjective slice).
       - T4 = M(1,1) + M(1,3) + M(2,3): This is NOT a slice.
         Why? There is a path M(1,1) -> M(1,2) -> M(1,3). The endpoints M(1,1)
         and M(1,3) are summands of T4, but the intermediate module M(1,2) is not.
         This violates the convexity property.
    6. T4 is the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice.
