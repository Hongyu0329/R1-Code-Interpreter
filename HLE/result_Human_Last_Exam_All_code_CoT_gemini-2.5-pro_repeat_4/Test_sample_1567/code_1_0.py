# The dimension d is given to be d >= 3.
# The problem asks for a single numerical answer for the maximal k.
# We will calculate the result for the minimal possible dimension, d = 3.

d = 3

# The maximal k such that the controlled random walk is guaranteed to be transient
# for any choice of k measures is given by the formula k = d - 1.
k = d - 1

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
