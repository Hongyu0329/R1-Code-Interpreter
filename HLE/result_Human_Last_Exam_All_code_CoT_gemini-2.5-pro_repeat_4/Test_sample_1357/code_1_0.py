    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves
    with good reduction Jacobians.

    This problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct stable,
    nodal curves of arithmetic genus 4 whose components' genera sum to 4
    and whose dual graph is a tree.

    A configuration is a pair (tree_type, genera_of_components).
    The genera correspond to the weights of the vertices in the dual graph.
    The stability condition requires that any component of genus 0 must be
    connected to other components at 2 or more points.
