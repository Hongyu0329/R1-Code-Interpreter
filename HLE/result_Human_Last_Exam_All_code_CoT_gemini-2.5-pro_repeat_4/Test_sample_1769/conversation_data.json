    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the Python code to derive the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the origin of the current word:** The modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir\". This influence is a direct result of the linguistic contact between the Norse invaders (Vikings) and the Anglo-Saxons.\n2.  **Find the original Anglo-Saxon word:** Before the Norse influence, Old English had its own native word for the concept, which was \"sweostor\".\n3.  **Hypothesize the evolution:** If the Norse invasion had never happened, \"sweostor\" would have undergone the natural sound changes that transformed Old English into Middle and then Modern English.\n    *   From Old to Middle English, the \"eo\" diphthong typically simplified to \"e\", and the word would have become \"swester\". This form is actually found in some Middle English texts, where it competed with the Norse-derived \"sister\" before eventually falling out of use.\n    *   From Middle to Modern English, \"swester\" would likely have retained its form and spelling, much like other words with a similar structure such as \"nest\", \"west\", and \"rest\".\n4.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script to print this explanation step-by-step and then display the final hypothetical word. To fulfill the requirement of showing the parts of an \"equation\", I will treat the linguistic transformation as a formula and print its components.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    would be without the historical influence of the Old Norse language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define the key terms in the linguistic history.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    norse_origin = \"systir\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    hypothetical_word = \"swester\"\n\n    # 2. Explain the logic.\n    print(f\"The current Modern English word '{current_word}' is derived from the Old Norse word '{norse_origin}'.\")\n    print(\"This was adopted due to the influence of Norse settlers in England between the 7th and 12th centuries.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the word without this influence, we must look at the original Old English word.\")\n    print(f\"The native Old English word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nFollowing the natural path of English linguistic evolution, this word would have changed over time.\")\n    print(f\"Old English '{old_english_word}' would have likely become '{hypothetical_word}' in Middle and Modern English.\")\n\n    # 3. Present the linguistic 'equation' and its components as requested.\n    # (Old English Word) - (Norse Influence) + (Natural Sound Change) = Hypothetical Modern Word\n    print(\"\\nThe linguistic transformation can be represented as an equation:\")\n    print(f\"Start: {old_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"Influence Removed: {norse_origin}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {hypothetical_word}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, if the Norse had never invaded, the Modern English word for 'sister' would be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_word}'\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n<<<swester>>>\n```"
