    explanation = """
The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory. It states that the anomaly associated with a global symmetry, calculated using the high-energy (UV) fundamental degrees of freedom, must be identical to the anomaly calculated using the low-energy (IR) effective degrees of freedom.

The primary physical implication of this powerful, non-perturbative principle is that it imposes a strong consistency check on the low-energy dynamics of a theory. Any proposed low-energy effective theory must have a particle spectrum and interactions capable of reproducing the UV anomaly. If it cannot, the proposed theory is invalid.

Therefore, the condition acts as a powerful **constraint on low-energy effective theories**. This constraint dictates how the symmetry can be realized at low energies, for example, by requiring the existence of certain massless composite fermions or by determining the specific interactions of Goldstone bosons if the symmetry is spontaneously broken.

Analyzing the choices, option (C) most accurately and generally describes this core consequence. While other options like (F), (G), (H), and (J) are also correct aspects of the condition, they can be seen as more specific instances or direct consequences of the main constraint described in (C).
