    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:** The expression is complex, so the first step is to break it down into smaller, manageable parts using the rules of SKI calculus. The expression has a clear recursive structure `S(I)(...)` which can be simplified.\n2.  **Identify Known Combinators:** The expression contains recurring patterns like `S(S(K(S))(K))` and `S(I)(I)`. These are standard combinators for arithmetic operations on Church numerals. I will identify what they represent (e.g., Successor, Addition, Multiplication).\n3.  **Identify the Operands:** The operators identified in the previous step are applied to arguments. I will evaluate these arguments, which are also Church numerals (e.g., `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`).\n4.  **Determine the Overall Operation:** By combining the operators and operands, I will determine the overall arithmetic function that the entire expression computes. It will turn out to be a repeated application of a single function.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Church Numeral `n`:** I will perform the arithmetic calculation derived from the previous steps to find the final integer value `n`.\n6.  **Calculate `log_2(n)`:** The final step is to compute the base-2 logarithm of the number `n`.\n7.  **Write Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform the calculation from step 5 and 6 and print the final equation and answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Deconstruction:**\n    Let the entire expression be `E`. It has the form `S(I)(A)(B)`, where:\n    *   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(C)))`\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n    *   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    The rule for `S(I)` is `S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\n    Applying this, `E = B (A B)`.\n    Now let's evaluate `A B`:\n    `A B = (S(I)(S(I)(K(C)))) B = B ((S(I)(K(C))) B)`.\n    The inner part is `(S(I)(K(C))) B = B ((K C) B) = B C`. (since `K C B = C`).\n    So, `A B = B (B C)`.\n    Let's re-check this part. Let's use lambda notation. `S(I) = λx.λy.y(xy)`.\n    `A = S(I)(S(I)(K C))`. Let `f_1=K C`. Let `f_2=S(I)f_1 = λy.y(f_1 y) = λy.y C`. Let `A=S(I)f_2 = λz.z(f_2 z) = λz.z(z C)`.\n    Wait, there are three `S(I)`s.\n    `A = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(C))))`.\n    Let `g_0 = K C`.\n    `g_1 = S(I) g_0 = λx. x C`.\n    `g_2 = S(I) g_1 = λy. y(y C)`.\n    `A = S(I) g_2 = λz. z(z(z C))`.\n    So `A B = (λz. z(z(z C))) B = B(B(B C))`.\n    Finally, `E = B (A B) = B(B(B(B C))) = B^4(C)`.\n\n2.  **Identifying Operators and Operands:**\n    *   Let `N = S(S(K(S))(K))`. In SKI calculus, this is the combinator for multiplication of Church numerals (`MULT`). `MULT m n` is equivalent to `m * n`.\n    *   Let `P = S(I)(I)`. This is the `omega` combinator (`ω = λx. x x`), which is not a Church numeral.\n    *   `C = N I = MULT I`. For any numeral `m`, `MULT I m = I . m = m`. Thus, `MULT I` is the identity function `I`, which represents the Church numeral `1`. So, `C=1`.\n    *   `B = N P = MULT(S(I)(I)) = MULT(OMEGA)`. This is the multiplication combinator applied to the `omega` combinator.\n\n3.  **Determining the `B` operator:**\n    We need to figure out what `B = MULT(OMEGA)` does to a Church numeral `m`.\n    `B m f x = (MULT OMEGA m) f x = OMEGA (m f) x`.\n    The definition of `OMEGA` is `OMEGA g = g g`. Here, `g` is `m f`.\n    So, `OMEGA(m f) = (m f) (m f)`.\n    The expression to evaluate is `((m f) (m f)) x`.\n    This means the function `(m f)` is applied to the argument `(m f)`, and the resulting function is applied to `x`.\n    Let's analyze the application `(m f) (m f)`. The function `m f` applies `f` for `m` times. So `(m f) (m f)` means applying `f` `m` times to the function `m f`.\n    `f^m(m f)`. When this is applied to `x`: `(f^m(m f))(x) = f^m((m f)(x)) = f^m(f^m(x)) = f^(m+m)(x) = f^(2m)(x)`.\n    So, `B(m)` is the Church numeral `2m`. The operator `B` is the **doubling operator**.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    We have established that `E = B^4(C)`, where `B` is the doubling operator and `C` is the numeral `1`.\n    *   `n_0 = C = 1`\n    *   `n_1 = B(n_0) = 2 * 1 = 2`\n    *   `n_2 = B(n_1) = 2 * 2 = 4`\n    *   `n_3 = B(n_2) = 2 * 4 = 8`\n    *   `n_4 = B(n_3) = 2 * 8 = 16`\n    So, the Church numeral `n` is `16`.\n\n5.  **Logarithm Calculation:**\n    The question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n    `log_2(16) = 4`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the value of n and log2(n) based on the logical\n    derivation from the SKI combinator expression.\n\n    The derivation shows that the expression computes n by starting with the number 1\n    and applying a \"doubling\" operator four times.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The initial value `C` is the Church numeral 1.\n    n = 1\n    print(f\"The calculation starts with the Church numeral C = {n}.\")\n\n    # The operator `B` is the doubling operator.
