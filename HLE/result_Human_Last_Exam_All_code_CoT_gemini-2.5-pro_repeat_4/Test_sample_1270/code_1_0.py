# Plan:
# 1. Define the number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
# 2. Define the number of substituents (the "points" of the Mercedes star).
# 3. Define the number of carbons in each substituent (a methyl group, -CH3).
# 4. Calculate the total number of carbons by adding the carbons from the ring and all substituents.
# 5. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.

# Number of carbons in a benzene ring
carbons_in_benzene_ring = 6

# The Mercedes logo has 3 points, so we assume 3 substituent groups.
num_substituents = 3

# The simplest carbon-based substituent is a methyl group (-CH3), which has 1 carbon.
carbons_per_substituent = 1

# Calculate the total carbons from the substituents
total_substituent_carbons = num_substituents * carbons_per_substituent

# Calculate the total number of carbons in the molecule
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene_ring + total_substituent_carbons

# Print the explanation and the final equation
print("The molecule 'mercedesbenzene' can be interpreted as a central benzene ring with three methyl groups attached, resembling the Mercedes logo.")
