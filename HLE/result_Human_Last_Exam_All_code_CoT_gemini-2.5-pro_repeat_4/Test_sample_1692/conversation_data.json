    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes a system called an elementary cellular automaton. In this system, a row of cells (like `01101001`) evolves into a new row. The state of each new cell (0 or 1) is determined by a simple rule based on its previous state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. There are 256 such rules, numbered 0 to 255.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Task:** We are given the starting row (`t1`) and the final row (`t3`). We need to find the unknown intermediate row (`t2`). The same rule must govern the transition from `t1` to `t2` and from `t2` to `t3`.\n\n3.  **Strategy:** The most straightforward way to solve this is to test every single one of the 256 possible rules.\n    *   For each rule from 0 to 255:\n        *   First, I'll apply the rule to the top row (`01101001`) to generate a potential middle row. For the cells at the edges, I will assume periodic boundary conditions (meaning the grid wraps around, so the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell).\n        *   Next, I'll apply the *same rule* to this newly generated middle row to produce a final row.\n        *   Then, I'll check if this final row matches the given bottom row (`10000111`).\n    *   If it matches, I have found the correct rule and the valid intermediate row. Since the problem states there is only one valid solution, this process should yield a single answer.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script to automate this search. The script will define a function to apply any given rule to a row and then loop through all 256 rules to find the one that satisfies the condition. Finally, it will print the full, correct sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 3-row elementary cellular automaton sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row = \"01101001\"\n    target_bottom_row = \"10000111\"\n\n    def apply_rule(row, rule_number):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given ECA rule to a row, assuming periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        new_row = []\n        n = len(row)\n        # Convert the string row to a list of integers for easier calculations\n        int_row = [int(cell) for cell in row]\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get the states of the left, center, and right cells for the neighborhood.\n            # The modulo operator (%) handles the periodic (wrapping) boundaries.\n            left = int_row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = int_row[i]\n            right = int_row[(i + 1) % n]\n\n            # Convert the 3-cell neighborhood pattern (e.g., 1,0,1) into a single\n            # integer value (e.g., 5 for '101').
