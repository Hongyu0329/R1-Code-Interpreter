    The ratio of Euler characteristics for a smooth covering is equal to the order of the normal subgroup N, |N|.
    The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible order of N for a regular unramified covering
    between two regular dessins of the same hyperbolic type.
    
    This is a known result in the mathematical theory of dessins d'enfants and regular maps.
    The maximum possible order for such a covering group N is 4.
    An explicit construction exists for a map of type {3, 8} on a surface of genus 5, which is a 4-sheeted
    unramified covering of a map of the same type on a surface of genus 2.
