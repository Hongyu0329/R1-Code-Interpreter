# Step 1 & 2: Decode the numbers from the haiku.
# "Twice fifteen"
num1 = 2 * 15
# "A divine one"
num2 = 1

# Step 3 & 4: The phrase "winds of change" suggests subtraction.
# Perform the calculation.
result = num1 - num2
print("The equation from the haiku is:")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")

# Step 5: Convert the numeric result to a letter of the alphabet.
# The phrase "in alphabetical order" suggests this conversion.
# We use the modulo operator to handle numbers larger than 26.
# The formula (result - 1) % 26 gives a 0-based index (A=0, B=1, ...),
# which we can use to find the character.
alphabet_index = (result - 1) % 26
# ord('A') gives the ASCII value of 'A'. Adding the index gives the
# ASCII value of the target letter. chr() converts it back to a character.
final_answer = chr(ord('A') + alphabet_index)

print(f"\nThe number {result} corresponds to the letter '{final_answer}' in the alphabet.")
print("This fits the title clue 'The Bays', which sounds like 'The C's' (Seas).")
