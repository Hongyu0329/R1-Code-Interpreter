    "This riddle is solved by deciphering the numbers and the mathematical operation hidden in the haiku.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Find the first number:** The line \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" translates to a simple multiplication: `2 * 15 = 30`.\n2.  **Find the second number:** The line \"A divine one yields\" points to the number `1`.\n3.  **Find the operation:** The phrase \"winds of change\" suggests finding the difference or \"change\" between the two numbers, which implies subtraction.\n4.  **Perform the calculation:** The equation becomes `30 - 1 = 29`.\n5.  **Convert the result to a letter:** The instruction \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\" implies we need to map our result (29) to a letter of the alphabet. Since there are 26 letters, we can use the modulo operator. The 29th letter would be the 3rd letter in a cycle (`29 mod 26 = 3`). The 3rd letter of the alphabet is 'C'.\n6.  **Confirm the answer:** The title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" acts as a final clue. Phonetically, this sounds like \"The C's,\" which could be interpreted as \"The Seas.\" Bays are coastal bodies of water connected to a larger sea or ocean, making 'C' a fitting answer.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: Decode the numbers from the haiku.\n# \"Twice fifteen\"\nnum1 = 2 * 15\n# \"A divine one\"\nnum2 = 1\n\n# Step 3 & 4: The phrase \"winds of change\" suggests subtraction.\n# Perform the calculation.\nresult = num1 - num2\nprint(\"The equation from the haiku is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n\n# Step 5: Convert the numeric result to a letter of the alphabet.\n# The phrase \"in alphabetical order\" suggests this conversion.\n# We use the modulo operator to handle numbers larger than 26.\n# The formula (result - 1) % 26 gives a 0-based index (A=0, B=1, ...),\n# which we can use to find the character.\nalphabet_index = (result - 1) % 26\n# ord('A') gives the ASCII value of 'A'. Adding the index gives the\n# ASCII value of the target letter. chr() converts it back to a character.\nfinal_answer = chr(ord('A') + alphabet_index)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe number {result} corresponds to the letter '{final_answer}' in the alphabet.\")\nprint(\"This fits the title clue 'The Bays', which sounds like 'The C's' (Seas).\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
