    "Answering this question requires finding the maximum possible density `c` of a set of integers `A` from `{1, ..., N}` (for large `N`) such that the sum of any two elements in `A` is not a perfect square. This is a known open problem in number theory. The exact value of `c` is not known, but we can find lower bounds for it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will explain the standard method for finding lower bounds for `c`, which involves modular arithmetic. This reduces the problem to finding a special subset `B` of residues modulo some integer `k`.\n2.  I will provide a Python script that implements a backtracking search to find the largest possible size of such a set `B` for a given modulus `k`. This demonstrates a computational approach to the problem.\n3.  I will run the script for `k=3` to establish the well-known lower bound of `c >= 1/3`.\n4.  Finally, I will state the best known lower bound for `c` from current mathematical research, as the problem asks for the largest such `c`.\n\n### Method Explained:\nLet `A` be a subset of `{1, ..., N}`. We are looking for the largest `c` such that `|A| ≈ cN` and for all `x, y ∈ A`, `x+y` is not a perfect square.\n\nA powerful method to construct such a set `A` is to use modular arithmetic. We choose an integer `k` (the modulus) and build `A` from numbers that belong to a specific set of residue classes modulo `k`.\n\nLet `S_k = {i^2 mod k | i ∈ Z}` be the set of square residues modulo `k`. Let `B` be a subset of `{0, 1, ..., k-1}`. We construct `A` as the set of all numbers `n ∈ {1, ..., N}` such that `n mod k ∈ B`. The density of this set `A` is `|B|/k`.\n\nIf we choose `B` such that for any `b_1, b_2 ∈ B`, their sum `(b_1 + b_2) mod k` is not in `S_k`, then for any `x, y ∈ A`, `x+y` cannot be a perfect square. This is because if `x ≡ b_1 (mod k)` and `y ≡ b_2 (mod k)`, then `x+y ≡ b_1+b_2 (mod k)`. Since `(b_1+b_2) mod k` is not a square residue, `x+y` cannot be a square number.\n\nThis means that `c >= |B|/k` for any such `k` and `B`. The problem of finding `c` is thus equivalent to finding `sup_k max(|B|/k)`. The exact value is not known, but we can find increasingly better lower bounds by searching for good pairs of `(k, B)`.\n\n### Python Code for Finding Optimal `B`:\nThe following Python script uses a backtracking algorithm to find the maximum size of a set `B` for a given modulus `k`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's recommended to increase recursion limit for larger k\n# sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef solve_for_k(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum size of a set B subset of {0,...,k-1}\n    such that B+B contains no squares modulo k.\n    \"\"\"\n    squares = {pow(i, 2, k) for i in range(k)}\n    \n    # We can prune the search space.
