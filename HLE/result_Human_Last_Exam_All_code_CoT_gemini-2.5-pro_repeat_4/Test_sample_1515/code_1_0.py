    # Step 1: Define the core concepts.
    print("1. The NSVZ (Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov) beta function is a proposed exact formula for the running of the gauge coupling in N=1 supersymmetric theories.")
    print("2. Non-renormalization theorems are powerful results in supersymmetry that forbid quantum corrections to certain quantities. These theorems are a direct consequence of the 'holomorphic structure' of the theory.")

    # Step 2: Explain the connection via holomorphy.
    print("\n3. The gauge coupling constant is part of the 'gauge kinetic function', which is a holomorphic function in the chiral superfields. The properties of the NSVZ beta function are intimately tied to this holomorphy.")

    # Step 3: Discuss the role of regularization.
    print("\n4. Any practical quantum field theory calculation requires a 'regularization scheme' to handle infinities. However, these schemes are mathematical tools and can sometimes break the fundamental properties of a theory.")

    # Step 4: Identify the exact condition.
    print("\n5. A direct calculation of the beta function will only yield the simple and exact NSVZ form if the chosen regularization scheme respects and preserves the underlying holomorphy of the theory. If a scheme breaks holomorphy, the result will differ by scheme-dependent terms.")

    # Step 5: Conclude and select the answer.
    print("\n6. Therefore, the exact condition for the NSVZ beta function to match the results expected from non-renormalization theorems is that the regularization scheme must preserve the holomorphy properties of the theory.")
