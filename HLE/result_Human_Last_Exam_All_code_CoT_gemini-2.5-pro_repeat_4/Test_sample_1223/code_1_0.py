### Step-by-Step Solution

1.  **Understanding the Question:** The question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.

    *   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space where every sub-part that is also a continuum is itself indecomposable (cannot be split into two smaller proper subcontinua). The **pseudo-arc** is the most famous example.
    *   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** For the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, its Stone-Cech remainder is what's "left over" when compactifying $Y$ to its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$. We denote it $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.
    *   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum, composants are specific dense subsets that partition the space. A decomposable continuum has only one composant (the space itself). To get a large number of composants, we need to investigate cases where the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.

2.  **Establishing a Lower Bound (An Achievable Maximum):** We can find a lower bound for the maximum by finding a concrete example that yields a high number of composants.

    *   Let's choose $X$ to be the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc fits the description of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.
    *   A key theorem by D. P. Bellamy (1971) states that for a chainable indecomposable continuum like the pseudo-arc, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc itself.
    *   Therefore, in this case, the remainder is a pseudo-arc. A pseudo-arc is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum.
    *   A standard theorem in continuum theory states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly **c** composants.
    *   **c** is the **cardinality of the continuum**, the "size" of the set of real numbers (defined as $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).
    *   This example demonstrates that the number of composants can be **c**. Thus, the maximum possible number is at least **c**.

3.  **Establishing an Upper Bound (Proving Nothing Larger is Possible):** We need a general theorem to show that no other choice of $X$ can produce a remainder with more than **c** composants.

    *   A theorem by Piotr Minc (2007) provides this exact bound. It states that for *any* continuum $X$, the number of composants of any non-degenerate subcontinuum of the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is **at most c**.
    *   This powerful theorem applies to our problem regardless of the specific choice of the hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   From the pseudo-arc example, we know the maximum number of composants is at least **c**.
    *   From Minc's theorem, we know the maximum number is at most **c**.
    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is exactly **c**.

The final equation is: Maximum Number of Composants = c.
