# Define symbols for the lengths of the segments.
# The problem is symbolic and does not require numerical input.
MA, MB, MG, MH = sympy.symbols('MA MB MG MH')

# Based on the geometric reasoning, we can deduce the relationship.
# The expression for MG - MH must be independent of the chords CD and EF chosen.
#
# By choosing a special case where the two chords are identical (CD = EF),
# we find that the circumcircles for G and H are the same.
# Let this circle be ω = circumcircle(△CMD).
#
# Circle ω intersects the line AB at M (by definition) and at another point, say P.
# G is an intersection point of ω and line AB, so G is either M or P.
# H is an intersection point of ω and line AB, so H is either M or P.
# This forces G and H to be the same point (G=H).
#
# If G=H, then their distances from M are equal: MG = MH.
# Therefore, MG - MH = 0.
#
# Since this must hold for any choice of chords, the relationship is universally:
# MG - MH = 0

# The value of the expression MG - MH
result_value = 0

# The equation representing the relationship
# We express it in a form that relates to MA and MB, showing it is 0.
# For example, 0 * MA + 0 * MB = 0. The simplest form is just 0.
