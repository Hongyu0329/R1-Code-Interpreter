def find_tiling_subset():
    """
    This function determines and prints the subset of integers t from the given set
    {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 15} for which the number of t-omino tilings of an n x n grid
    is always even for any positive integer n.

    The determination is based on mathematical properties of the tilings:
    - If t is even or composite, coloring arguments show strong divisibility
      properties on the number of horizontal and vertical tiles, which implies
      the total number of tilings is even. This applies to t = 2, 4, 9, 15.
    - If t is an odd prime, the general arguments do not apply.
      - For t=3, a known theorem confirms the number of tilings is always even.
      - For t=5 and t=7, no such general result is known, and they are
        believed to have an odd number of tilings for some n.
