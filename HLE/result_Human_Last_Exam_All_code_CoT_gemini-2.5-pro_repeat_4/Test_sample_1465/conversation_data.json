    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of its heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`). Different combinations of residues at these positions stabilize different oligomeric states (dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc.).\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that analyzes each provided sequence based on these established biophysical principles.\n\n1.  **Identify Core Residues**: For each sequence, the script will identify the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Based on typical coiled-coil structures, we will assume the second residue of each sequence is at the 'a' position (a 'b'-register).\n2.  **Apply Rules**: The script will apply a set of rules to predict the oligomeric state:\n    *   **Polar Core Residues**: A polar residue (like Asparagine 'N' or Glutamine 'Q') at a core 'a' or 'd' position is a very strong determinant for a **dimer**.\n    *   **Bulky Core Residues**: Packing two bulky, beta-branched residues like Isoleucine ('I') at both the 'a' and 'd' positions creates steric hindrance that is best accommodated by a **tetramer**.\n    *   **Specific Pairings**: Certain pairings are known to favor specific states. For example, Isoleucine ('I') at 'a' and Threonine ('T') at 'd' is a known motif for **trimers**.\n    *   **Default Cases**: Other combinations, like Isoleucine ('I') at 'a' and the small Alanine ('A') at 'd', tend to form **dimers**.\n3.  **Generate Output**: The script will process each sequence, determine its predicted state, and print the reasoning and the final list of states.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on\n    residues at the 'a' and 'd' core positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    oligomeric_states = []\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing coiled-coil sequences...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n        # Assume a 'b' register, where the first residue is 'b' and the second is 'a'.\n        # 'a' positions are at indices 1, 8, 15, 22, ...\n        # 'd' positions are at indices 4, 11, 18, 25, ...\n        a_positions = [seq[j] for j in range(1, len(seq), 7)]\n        d_positions = [seq[j] for j in range(4, len(seq), 7)]\n        \n        a_counts = collections.Counter(a_positions)\n        d_counts = collections.Counter(d_positions)\n\n        state = \"Unknown\"\n        reason = \"\"\n\n        # Rule 1: A polar residue (N or Q) in the core is a dominant dimer-specifying feature.\n        # This applies to Sequence 2 (N at 'a') and Sequence 4 (Q at 'd').\n        if 'N' in a_positions or 'Q' in d_positions:\n            state = 2\n            reason = \"A polar residue (N or Q) in a core position strongly specifies a dimer.\"\n        \n        # Rule 2: A core of Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions specifies a tetramer.\n        # This applies to Sequence 3.\n        elif a_counts.get('I', 0) >= 3 and d_counts.get('I', 0) >= 3:\n            state = 4\n            reason = \"A core of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions favors a tetramer due to sterics.\"\n            \n        # Rule 3: A core of Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Threonine (T) at 'd' is a known trimer motif.\n        # This applies to Sequence 5.\n        elif a_counts.get('I', 0) >= 3 and d_counts.get('T', 0) >= 3:\n            state = 3\n            reason = \"A core of Isoleucine at 'a' and Threonine at 'd' is a known trimer-forming motif.\"\n\n        # Rule 4: A core of Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Alanine (A) at 'd' favors a dimer.\n        # This applies to Sequence 1.\n        elif a_counts.get('I', 0) >= 3 and d_counts.get('A', 0) >= 3:\n            state = 2\n            reason = \"A core of Isoleucine at 'a' and the small Alanine at 'd' typically forms a dimer.\"\n        \n        oligomeric_states.append(state)\n        \n        print(f\"Sequence {i+1}: {seq}\")\n        print(f\"Core 'a' residues: {a_positions}\")\n        print(f\"Core 'd' residues: {d_positions}\")\n        print(f\"Prediction: {state} ({reason})\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Final predicted oligomeric states:\")\n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation\n    # We will format it as a simple list for clarity.\n    print(oligomeric_states)\n\n# The provided sequences\nprotein_sequences = [\n    \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\", # Expected: 2\n    \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\", # Expected: 2\n    \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\", # Expected: 4\n    \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\", # Expected: 2\n    \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\", # Expected: 3\n]\n\npredict_coiled_coil_state(protein_sequences)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
