# Step 1: Define all given parameters and physical constants.
# Given parameters from the problem
Io = 1e-9        # Reverse saturation current in Amperes
n = 1.5          # Diode ideality factor
T = 300          # Ambient temperature in Kelvin
V1 = 0.78        # Start voltage of the linear region in Volts
V2 = 0.98        # End voltage of the linear region in Volts
I2 = 0.445       # Current at V2 in Amperes
R_load = 50.0    # Actual load resistance in Ohms
margin = 0.20    # Startup margin of 20%

# Physical constants
k = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann's constant (J/K)
q = 1.60217663e-19  # Elementary charge (C)

# Step 2: Calculate the thermal voltage (Vt).
Vt = (k * T) / q

# Step 3: Calculate the current I1 at V1 using the diode equation.
# The problem implies that for V <= V1, the diode follows the standard equation.
# The linear region begins at the point (V1, I1).
I1 = Io * (math.exp(V1 / (n * Vt)) - 1)

# Step 4: Calculate the dynamic resistance (Rd) of the diode in the linear region.
# This resistance is the source impedance of the diode signal source.
# It is the slope of the I-V curve between (V1, I1) and (V2, I2).
Rd = (V2 - V1) / (I2 - I1)

# Step 5: Determine the target impedance for the diode.
# For optimum power transfer from a negative resistance source, the load impedance should match
# the magnitude of the source resistance. A 20% margin for startup is added.
R_target = abs(Rd) * (1 + margin)

# Step 6: Calculate the required impedance transformation ratio.
# The ratio is from the load to the diode, meaning Z_diode_side / Z_load_side.
# The transformer must make R_load appear as R_target to the diode.
# So, the ratio is R_target / R_load.
transformation_ratio = R_target / R_load

# --- Output the results step-by-step ---
