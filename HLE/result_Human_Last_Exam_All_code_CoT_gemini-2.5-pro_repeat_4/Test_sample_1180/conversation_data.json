    "To solve this problem, we need to find the \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The stable reduction is analyzed with respect to the 2-adic valuation, `v`, where `v(2)=1`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial**: The behavior of the curve's reduction is determined by the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are interested in how the roots cluster in the 2-adic sense.\n2.  **Locate potential root clusters**: We can use a Newton polygon for $P(x)$ to find the valuations of its roots. The points for the polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\n    -   $c_0=1 \\implies v(c_0)=0 \\implies (0,0)$\n    -   $c_3=2 \\implies v(c_3)=1 \\implies (3,1)$\n    -   $c_5=2 \\implies v(c_5)=1 \\implies (5,1)$\n    The Newton polygon has two segments: one from (0,0) to (3,1) with slope 1/3, and another from (3,1) to (5,1) with slope 0. This predicts three roots with valuation -1/3 and two roots with valuation 0.\n3.  **Investigate the double point**: A double point in the stable reduction arises from roots that are \"close\" to each other. The two roots with valuation 0 form such a cluster. The \"thickness\" is a measure of the 2-adic distance between these two roots.\n4.  **Zoom in on the roots**: The residual polynomial for the slope 0 segment indicates that these two roots are congruent to $1 \\pmod 2$. To study their separation, we perform a change of variables $x = 1+2y$. This transforms the problem of finding the distance between the two roots of $P(x)$ near 1 to finding the distance between the corresponding roots of the new polynomial in $y$.\n5.  **Analyze the transformed polynomial**: We'll define a new polynomial $Q(y) = P(1+2y)$ and analyze its coefficients.\n    $Q(y) = 2(1+2y)^5 + 2(1+2y)^3 + 1$.\n6.  **Calculate the thickness**: The Newton polygon of $Q(y)$ reveals the valuations of its roots. The two roots of $P(x)$ with valuation 0 correspond to two roots of $Q(y)$, say $y_1, y_2$, with a specific valuation determined by the polygon. The thickness of the double point is given by $v((e_1 - e_2)^2)$, where $e_1, e_2$ are the roots of $P(x)$. Since $e_i = 1+2y_i$, we have $(e_1-e_2)^2 = (2y_1-2y_2)^2 = 4(y_1-y_2)^2$. The thickness is $v(4) + v((y_1-y_2)^2)$. The term $v((y_1-y_2)^2)$ can be calculated from the coefficients of $Q(y)$ that define the relevant segment of its Newton polygon. For a quadratic equation $Ay^2 + B = 0$ defined by the dominant terms, this value is $v(4(-B/A))$.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef v(n, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\n    Returns -1 for v(0) which we treat as infinity.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return -1 # Represents infinity\n    count = 0\n    while n % p == 0 and n != 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the polynomial P(x)\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    P_x = 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1\n    \n    # Step 3 & 4: Perform the change of variables x = 1 + 2y\n    y = sympy.Symbol('y')\n    # The double point corresponds to roots near x=1.\n    # We substitute x = 1 + 2y to zoom in on this point.\n    Q_y = P_x.subs(x, 1 + 2*y)\n    \n    # Step 5: Expand the transformed polynomial Q(y) and get its coefficients\n    Q_y_expanded = sympy.expand(Q_y)\n    \n    # Extract coefficients of Q(y)\n    # Q(y) = c5*y^5 + c4*y^4 + c3*y^3 + c2*y^2 + c1*y + c0\n    coeffs = [Q_y_expanded.coeff(y, i) for i in range(6)]\n    c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 = [int(c) for c in coeffs]\n\n    # Step 6: Analyze the Newton Polygon of Q(y) and calculate the thickness\n    # We need the valuations of the coefficients of Q(y)\n    v_coeffs = [v(c, 2) for c in coeffs]\n    \n    # The Newton Polygon for Q(y) has points (i, v(ci)).\n    # (0, v(5)=0), (1, v(32)=5), (2, v(104)=3), ...\n    # The lower convex hull contains a segment from (0, v(c0)) to (2, v(c2)).\n    # This segment corresponds to two roots y1, y2.\n    # The dominant terms for these roots are c2*y^2 + c0.\n    # So y^2 is approximately -c0/c2.\n    \n    # The squared difference of the roots of Ay^2+B=0 is (2*sqrt(-B/A))^2 = -4B/A\n    # A = c2, B = c0\n    val_y_diff_sq = v(4, 2) + v(c0, 2) - v(c2, 2)\n    \n    # The thickness corresponds to the valuation of the squared difference of the x-roots.\n    # e1 - e2 = (1+2*y1) - (1+2*y2) = 2*(y1 - y2)\n    # (e1 - e2)^2 = 4 * (y1 - y2)^2\n    thickness = v(4, 2) + val_y_diff_sq\n    \n    # Print out the results and the final equation\n    print(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = {P_x}\")\n    print(f\"We perform the substitution x = 1 + 2y to get Q(y).\")\n    print(f\"Q(y) = {Q_y_expanded}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe coefficients of Q(y) are:\")\n    print(f\"c0 = {c0}, c1 = {c1}, c2 = {c2}, c3 = {c3}, c4 = {c4}, c5 = {c5}\")\n    print(\"\\nTheir 2-adic valuations are:\")\n    print(f\"v(c0) = {v_coeffs[0]}, v(c1) = {v_coeffs[1]}, v(c2) = {v_coeffs[2]}, ...\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Newton Polygon of Q(y) has a segment from (0,0) to (2,3).\")\n    print(\"This segment corresponds to two roots, y1 and y2.\")\n    print(\"The relevant terms are c2*y^2 and c0.\")\n    print(f\"We approximate the equation for these roots as {c2}*y^2 + {c0} = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nThe valuation of the squared difference of the y-roots is:\")\n    print(f\"v((y1 - y2)^2) = v(4 * (-c0/c2)) = v(4) + v(c0) - v(c2)\")\n    print(f\"v((y1 - y2)^2) = {v(4,2)} + {v(c0,2)} - {v(c2,2)} = {val_y_diff_sq}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe thickness is the valuation of the squared difference of the original x-roots (e1, e2).\")\n    print(\"e1 - e2 = 2*(y1 - y2)\")\n    print(\"(e1 - e2)^2 = 4*(y1 - y2)^2\")\n    print(\"v((e1 - e2)^2) = v(4) + v((y1 - y2)^2)\")\n    print(f\"Thickness = {v(4,2)} + {val_y_diff_sq} = {thickness}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
