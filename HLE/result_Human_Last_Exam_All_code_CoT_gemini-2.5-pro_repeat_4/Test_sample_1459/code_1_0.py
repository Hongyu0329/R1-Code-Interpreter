    The problem is to find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces:
    1. X: The interval [0, 1] with the standard absolute value metric, d_X(a, b) = |a - b|.
       The diameter of X is diam(X) = 1.
    2. Y: The 'unit circle'. In this context, to make a meaningful comparison with the
       interval of length 1, we consider a circle with the same diameter, which is 1.
       A circle with diameter 1 has a circumference of 2. The metric d_Y(a, b) is the
       shortest arc length (geodesic distance) between points a and b.

    This is a classic result in metric geometry. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between
    an interval of length L, [0, L], and a circle of circumference 2L is L/2.
    For L=1, the distance is 1/2.

    # Step 2: Justify the result
    justification = """
    To justify this, we establish a lower and an upper bound for the distance. Let d_GH be the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.

    Upper Bound (d_GH <= 1/2):
    We can construct a correspondence (a type of mapping) between the interval and the circle.
    Imagine folding the interval [0, 1] at its midpoint 1/2 and mapping it onto one half of the circle.
    More formally, consider a correspondence R that relates each point x in [0, 1] to two points on the circle:
    one on the 'front' arc and one on the 'back' arc. For example, R = {(x, x)} U {(x, 2-x)} for x in [0,1],
    where the circle is represented as [0, 2] with endpoints identified.
    The 'distortion' of this correspondence can be calculated to be 1.
    The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is half of the infimum of these distortions, which gives d_GH <= 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.

    Lower Bound (d_GH >= 1/2):
    This relies on the topological difference between the spaces. The interval has two endpoints (0 and 1),
    while the circle has none.
    Consider any correspondence R between the interval X and the circle Y.
    Let y_A and y_B be two antipodal points on the circle (e.g., at positions 0.5 and 1.5).
    The distance between them is d_Y(y_A, y_B) = 1.
    Let x_A and x_B be points in the interval [0, 1] that correspond to y_A and y_B.
    From the properties of correspondences, it can be shown that both x_A and x_B must be close to the
    midpoint of the interval, 0.5.
    This means the distance d_X(x_A, x_B) must be small.
    The distortion for this pair of points is |d_X(x_A, x_B) - d_Y(y_A, y_B)| = |small_value - 1|, which is close to 1.
    A formal analysis shows that the distortion must be at least 1.
    This implies d_GH >= 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.

    Conclusion:
    Since d_GH <= 1/2 and d_GH >= 1/2, the distance must be exactly 1/2.
