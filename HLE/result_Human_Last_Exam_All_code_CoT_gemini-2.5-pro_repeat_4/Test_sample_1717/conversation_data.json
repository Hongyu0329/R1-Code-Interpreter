    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** I will first find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode from the game's data.\n2.  **Identify Health Scaling Formula:** Next, I will find the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode. This formula dictates how boss health increases as more players join the game.\n3.  **Create the Equation:** I will combine the base health and the scaling formula to create a single algebraic equation that represents the boss's health for any given number of players, `N`.\n4.  **Analyze the Limit:** Finally, I will analyze what happens to this equation as the number of players (`N`) approaches infinity to find the theoretical maximum health. The python code will demonstrate this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    health_increase_per_player = 0.35  # This represents a 35% increase.\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the health scaling formula.\n    # The formula is: Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + HealthIncrease * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    # Let's represent the number of players with the variable 'N'.\n    print(\"The health scaling formula for an Expert Mode boss is:\")\n    print(\"Total Health = Base Health * (1 + Health Increase Per Player * (N - 1))\\n\")\n\n    print(\"For the Eye of Cthulhu, the specific formula is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health} * (1 + {health_increase_per_player} * (N - 1))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the formula into a linear equation (y = mx + b form).\n    # Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35)\n    # Total Health = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N)\n    # Total Health = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35 * N)\n    constant_part = base_health * (1 - health_increase_per_player)\n    scaling_part = base_health * health_increase_per_player\n    \n    print(\"This equation can be simplified to a linear equation of the form: y = mx + b\")\n    print(\"Where 'y' is the Total Health and 'x' is the number of players 'N'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The simplified final equation is:\")\n    # The numbers in the final equation are explicitly printed as requested.\n    print(f\"Total Health = {int(constant_part)} + {int(scaling_part)} * N\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the conclusion for an infinite number of players.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"As you can see from the final equation, the boss's health increases linearly with the number of players (N).\")\n    print(\"There is no upper limit or cap to this scaling in the game's code.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, as the number of players 'N' approaches infinity, the Total Health also approaches infinity.\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<Infinite>>>"
