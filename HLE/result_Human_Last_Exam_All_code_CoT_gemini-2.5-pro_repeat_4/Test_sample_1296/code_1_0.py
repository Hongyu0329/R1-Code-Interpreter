def solve_dessin_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the theoretical problem about dessins d'enfants.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The condition 'G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F' implies that the socle N is transitive on F.
        This means the quotient dessin D_N has only one face, i.e., it is unicellular. This holds regardless
        of the structure of G/N. Thus, the answer is Yes.
    (b) The condition that D is a 'smooth covering' of D_N implies that the orders of the standard generators
        (x, y, z) are preserved in the quotient G/N. This is equivalent to N having a trivial intersection
        with the cyclic subgroups generated by x, y, and z.
        - For Type HA (Holomorph of Abelian), this is possible.
        - For Type TW (Wreath Product) and Type AS (Almost Simple), this condition is too restrictive and it can be
          shown that the group G cannot be generated by such elements.
        Therefore, only Type HA is possible.
    (c) Since Type TW is never possible for a smooth covering, the statement that it's not possible
        for l <= 5 is True.
