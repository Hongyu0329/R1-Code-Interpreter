    print("   - This new structure models uncertainty about the secondary membership grades from the Type-2 set.")
    print("   - This is achieved by introducing a tertiary membership function that adds another layer to the model.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The transition from Type-2 to Type-3 is defined by the introduction of a tertiary membership function to model more complex, layered uncertainties.")
    print("Therefore, the answer option that best describes this structural addition is 'Tertiary membership functions introduced'.")
