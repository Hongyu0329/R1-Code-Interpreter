    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Represent the Group**: I will begin by representing the permutations $a, b, c$ in a format that Python can understand. The `sympy` library is ideal for this, as it has a powerful combinatorics module for working with permutation groups. I will map the given set of 12 symbols to integers from 0 to 11 for compatibility with `sympy`'s `Permutation` class.\n\n2.  **Construct and Identify the Group G**: Using the defined permutations as generators, I will construct the group $G$ using `sympy.combinatorics.PermutationGroup`. A crucial step is to identify what this group $G$ is. I'll compute its order and check if it is isomorphic to a known group of the same size. The order, 95040, strongly suggests it might be the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. I will use `sympy`'s `is_isomorphic` function to verify this.\n\n3.  **Find the Schur Multiplier A**: The problem asks for the Schur multiplier of $G$, denoted by $A$. The direct computation of the Schur multiplier is an advanced topic in computational group theory, and `sympy` does not provide a function for it. However, once $G$ is identified as the well-known sporadic simple group $M_{12}$, I can use the established mathematical result for its Schur multiplier. The Schur multiplier of $M_{12}$ is known to be the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$.\n\n4.  **Count Proper Subgroups of A**: With $A \\cong C_2$, the final step is to count its proper subgroups up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup of $A$ is any subgroup that is not equal to $A$ itself. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. I will analyze the possible subgroup orders for $C_2$ and determine how many of them correspond to proper subgroups and how many unique isomorphism classes they form.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The Python script will perform the computational steps (steps 1 and 2), and then use `print` statements to explain the logical steps (steps 3 and 4) to arrive at the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import MathieuGroup\n\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the given group theory problem by:\n    1.
