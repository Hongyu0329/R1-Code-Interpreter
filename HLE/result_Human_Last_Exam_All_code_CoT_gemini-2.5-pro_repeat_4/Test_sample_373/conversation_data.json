    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I'll determine the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A standard barbell graph consists of two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge (the \"bottleneck\"). With 10 nodes total, this means we have two cliques of 5 nodes each.\n2.  **Identify Key Nodes and Degrees:** The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique. Let's call them the \"bridge nodes\". I will calculate the degree of these bridge nodes. A node in a 5-node clique is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. The bridge node has an additional connection via the bottleneck edge, so its total degree is 4 + 1 = 5.\n3.  **Analyze the Gossiping Process:** In randomized uniform gossiping, a node `u` is chosen uniformly at random from all `N=10` nodes, and then `u` picks a neighbor `v` uniformly at random. The edge `(u, v)` is the one that is \"sampled\".\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   The bridge node from the first clique is chosen, and it then chooses its counterpart in the second clique.\n    *   The bridge node from the second clique is chosen, and it then chooses its counterpart in the first clique.\n5.  **Sum the Probabilities:** I will calculate the probability for each case and add them together to get the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. The script will then print the final equation and the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the graph parameters\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A standard barbell graph has two identical cliques.\n    # The size of each clique is half the total number of nodes.\n    clique_size = total_nodes / 2\n\n    # 2. Calculate the degree of the bridge nodes\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one \"bridge node\" from each clique.\n    # The degree of a bridge node is its connections within its own clique (clique_size - 1)\n    # plus its one connection across the bottleneck edge.\n    # Degree = (clique_size - 1) + 1 = clique_size\n    degree_of_bridge_node = clique_size\n\n    # 3. Calculate the probability of the two scenarios\n    # In randomized uniform gossiping, we first pick a node from all N nodes,\n    # then that node picks one of its neighbors.\n\n    # The probability of picking any single node is 1 / total_nodes.\n    # The probability of a bridge node picking the other bridge node is 1 / its degree.\n\n    # Scenario 1: Pick bridge node A, which then picks bridge node B\n    prob_scenario_1 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bridge_node)\n\n    # Scenario 2: Pick bridge node B, which then picks bridge node A\n    prob_scenario_2 = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_of_bridge_node)\n\n    # 4. The total probability is the sum of the two scenarios\n    total_probability = prob_scenario_1 + prob_scenario_2\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge:\")\n    print(f\"Total nodes (N): {int(total_nodes)}\")\n    print(f\"Size of each clique (m): {int(clique_size)}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of a bridge node (deg): (m-1) + 1 = {int(degree_of_bridge_node)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe probability is the sum of two scenarios (picking bridge node A first, or picking B first):\")\n    print(\"P = P(pick A) * P(A picks B) + P(pick B) * P(B picks A)\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P = (1 / {int(total_nodes)}) * (1 / {int(degree_of_bridge_node)}) + (1 / {int(total_nodes)}) * (1 / {int(degree_of_bridge_node)})\")\n    print(f\"P = {prob_scenario_1} + {prob_scenario_2}\")\n    print(f\"Total Probability = {total_probability}\")\n    print(f\"As a fraction, this is 1/{int(1/total_probability)}\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
