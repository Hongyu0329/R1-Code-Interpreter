    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction:** I will first identify the key features of the reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, and the reaction conditions (thermal). This involves determining the number of π-electrons in the conjugated system undergoing the electrocyclization.\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** Based on the number of π-electrons and the thermal condition, I will use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are a direct consequence of FMO theory, to determine whether the electrocyclic ring closure is conrotatory or disrotatory.\n3.  **Determine Substituent Positions:** I will analyze the stereochemistry of the terminal double bonds of the reacting polyene, (2Z) and (8E), to determine the relative initial positions of the methyl substituents ('in' or 'out' of the coiled chain).\n4.  **Predict Product Stereochemistry:** I will combine the results from steps 2 and 3. There is a clear rule that connects the mode of rotation (conrotatory/disrotatory) and the initial positions of the substituents to the final stereochemistry (*cis* or *trans*) of the product. This will identify which isomer, A or B, is the \"allowed\" product.\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** FMO theory predicts that the allowed reaction pathway is overwhelmingly favored, while the forbidden pathway is energetically inaccessible. Based on this, I will determine the theoretical ratio of product A to product B. The Python code will print out this step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_electrocyclization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory and Woodward-Hoffmann rules\n    to predict the product ratio of a thermal electrocyclization reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and Reaction ---\n    print(\"--- Step 1: System Analysis ---\")\n    reactant = \"(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\"\n    pi_bonds = 4\n    pi_electrons = pi_bonds * 2\n    condition = \"thermal\"\n    \n    print(f\"Reactant: {reactant}\")\n    print(f\"The reacting system is an octatetraene with {pi_electrons} π-electrons.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction condition: {condition}\")\n\n    if pi_electrons % 4 == 0:\n        system_type = \"4n\"\n        n = pi_electrons // 4\n        print(f\"This is a {system_type} system (where n={n}).\")\n    else:\n        system_type = \"4n+2\"\n        n = (pi_electrons - 2) // 4\n        print(f\"This is a {system_type} system (where n={n}).\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Determine Allowed Motion ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Determine Allowed Motion (Woodward-Hoffmann Rules) ---\")\n    allowed_motion = \"\"\n    if condition == \"thermal\":\n        if system_type == \"4n\":\n            allowed_motion = \"conrotatory\"\n        else: # 4n+2\n            allowed_motion = \"disrotatory\"\n    else: # photochemical\n        if system_type == \"4n\":\n            allowed_motion = \"disrotatory\"\n        else: # 4n+2\n            allowed_motion = \"conrotatory\"\n            \n    print(f\"For a {system_type} system under {condition} conditions, the rules predict a '{allowed_motion}' ring closure.\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Analyze Substituent Stereochemistry ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Analyze Substituent Stereochemistry ---\")\n    terminal_config = ('Z', 'E')\n    print(f\"The terminal double bonds of the conjugated system have {terminal_config} stereochemistry.\")\n    print(\"We can model the substituents (methyl groups) as being 'in' or 'out' of the coiled polyene chain.\")\n    print(\"- A 'Z' terminus places the substituent 'in' the coil.\")\n    print(\"- An 'E' terminus places the substituent 'out' of the coil.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the two methyl groups have an 'in, out' relationship.\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Predict Product Stereochemistry ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 4: Predict Product Stereochemistry ---\")\n    # Rules for stereochemical outcome:\n    # Conrotatory: in/out -> cis; in/in or out/out -> trans\n    # Disrotatory: in/out -> trans; in/in or out/out -> cis\n    predicted_product_isomer = \"\"\n    if allowed_motion == \"conrotatory\":\n        if \"in\" in terminal_config and \"out\" in terminal_config or \"Z\" in terminal_config and \"E\" in terminal_config:\n            predicted_product_isomer = \"cis\"\n        else:\n            predicted_product_isomer = \"trans\"\n    else: # disrotatory\n        if \"in\" in terminal_config and \"out\" in terminal_config or \"Z\" in terminal_config and \"E\" in terminal_config:\n            predicted_product_isomer = \"trans\"\n        else:\n            predicted_product_isomer = \"cis\"\n            \n    print(f\"The rule for a '{allowed_motion}' motion with 'in, out' substituents predicts a '{predicted_product_isomer}' product.\")\n    print(\"The problem states that isomer A is cis and isomer B is trans.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the predicted major product is Isomer A ({predicted_product_isomer}).\")\n    \n    # --- Step 5: Predict the Ratio ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 5: Predicting the Product Ratio ---\")\n    print(\"FMO theory predicts that the allowed pathway is overwhelmingly favored, while the forbidden pathway does not occur to a significant extent.\")\n    print(\"This means the reaction is expected to be highly stereospecific.\")\n    \n    percentage_A = 100\n    percentage_B = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Predicted Ratio:\")\n    print(\"Isomer A (cis) : Isomer B (trans)\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed out\n    print(f\"   {percentage_A}    :    {percentage_B}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio A/B\n    if percentage_B == 0:\n        ratio_val = math.inf\n    else:\n        ratio_val = percentage_A / percentage_B\n        \n    return ratio_val\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_ratio = predict_electrocyclization()\n    # The final answer is wrapped in <<<>>>. \n    # Since the ratio A:B is 100:0, the value A/B is infinite.\n    # print(f\"\\n<<< {final_ratio} >>>\")\n    # Let's provide the answer in the requested format\n    pass\n```\n<<<inf>>>"
