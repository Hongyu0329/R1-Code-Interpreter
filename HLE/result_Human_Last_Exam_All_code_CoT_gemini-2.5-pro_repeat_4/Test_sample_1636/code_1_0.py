    reason_1 = "1. The term 're-measures' points to a cyclical, repetitive action of the sea. The most fitting natural cycle is the ebb and flow of the tides, which constantly alters the shoreline, thus 're-measuring' the boundary between land and water."

    reason_2 = "2. The poem's overall tone, with phrases like 'grave edge of the world' and the speaker's static, stone-like identity ('I am agate, opaline'), evokes a mood of deep and quiet thought. The sea's repetitive action mirrors the process of introspective contemplation, where a thought or feeling is considered over and over."

    final_conclusion = "Therefore, the phrase serves two functions: a literal one (the physical movement of tides) and a metaphorical one (the process of contemplation)."
