    This function determines the number of homeomorphism classes for the space X.

    The logic is based on the following deductions:
    1.  The properties of X (metric, locally compact, one-to-one continuous
        image of R) imply that X must be homeomorphic to the real line R.
    2.  The real line R is then checked against the final separation property,
        which it satisfies.
    3.  Therefore, all spaces satisfying the conditions belong to a single
        homeomorphism class (the class of R).
