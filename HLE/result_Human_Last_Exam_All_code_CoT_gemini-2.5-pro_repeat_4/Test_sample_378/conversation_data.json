    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria, has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. The user is likely confusing these two distinct political figures.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that clarifies this confusion. The script will:\n1.  State that there are no records of Goodluck Jonathan identifying as Azikiwe.\n2.  Explain the likely confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n3.  To satisfy the user's request for an \"equation with numbers,\" the script will conclude by stating that the number of times this event occurred is 0.\n\n```python\ndef solve_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan identified as Azikiwe.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user's query is based on a false premise.\n    # Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has not publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\".\n    # This is likely a confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\n\n    # We will state this information clearly.\n    print(\"There are no public records of former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(\"His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\")\n    print(\"This may be a confusion with another prominent Nigerian leader, Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the event described in the query never occurred.\")\n\n    # To satisfy the request for an equation with numbers, we can represent the number of occurrences.\n    number_of_occurrences = 0\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of times Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as Azikiwe = {number_of_occurrences}\")\n\nsolve_query()\n```\n<<<This event never occurred.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
