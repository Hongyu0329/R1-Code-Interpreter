    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Factor the conductor $N$ into its prime power components.\n2.  A character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if it is a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^k}$ for each prime power $p^k$ in the factorization of $N$.\n3.  The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n4.  We will count the number of available primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6.\n5.  Using these counts and the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we will calculate the number of characters whose order is exactly 6.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef print_step(title, content):\n    \"\"\"Helper function for printing formatted steps.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"\\n--- {title} ---\")\n    print(content)\n\n# Step 1: Factorize N\nN = 36036\nfactors_str = \"2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\"\nprint_step(\"Step 1: Factorize the Conductor N\",\n           f\"The conductor is N = {N}.\\nIts prime factorization is N = {factors_str}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Theory of Primitive Characters\nprint_step(\"Step 2: Primitive Characters and Order\",\n           (\"A Dirichlet character chi modulo N is primitive if it is a product of primitive characters\\n\"\n            \"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13, where each chi_{p^k} is primitive for its modulus.\\n\"\n            \"The order of chi is lcm(ord(chi_4), ord(chi_9), ord(chi_7), ord(chi_11), ord(chi_13)).\\n\"\n            \"We need this lcm to be exactly 6.\"))\n\n# Step 3: Count component character choices\nprint_step(\"Step 3: Count Choices for Each Component Character\",\n           (\"We count the number of primitive characters for each prime-power modulus whose order divides k, for k=6, 3, and 2.\\n\"\n            \"Let n(p^k, d|k) be this number.\\n\"))\n\n# Modulo 4\np4_ord2 = phi(2)\nn_4_d6 = p4_ord2\nn_4_d3 = 0\nn_4_d2 = p4_ord2\nprint(\"Conductor 4 (2^2):\")\nprint(\"  - The group of characters is cyclic of order phi(4)=2.
