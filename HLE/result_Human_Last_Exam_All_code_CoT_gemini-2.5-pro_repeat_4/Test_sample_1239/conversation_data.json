    "Of course, I can help with that. This question involves the mathematical analysis of the symmetries of a system of partial differential equations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Equations:** The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) are the system we need to analyze.\n2.  **Understand Symmetries:** A symmetry of a differential equation is a transformation of its variables (time, space, velocity, pressure) that maps solutions to other solutions. These symmetries form a Lie group.\n3.  **Find the Lie Algebra:** The dimension of a Lie group is the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra, which consists of the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations. The task is to find the dimension of this algebra.\n4.  **Enumerate the Generators:** The full symmetry group for the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. The standard question, however, refers to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra. I will list the well-known generators of this finite-dimensional algebra, which correspond to fundamental physical principles.\n    *   Time translation\n    *   Space translations\n    *   Spatial rotations\n    *   Galilean boosts\n    *   A scaling transformation\n    *   A pressure shift\n5.  **Calculate the Dimension:** I will count the number of independent generators for each symmetry type and sum them up to find the total dimension.\n6.  **Code the Calculation:** I will provide a Python script that performs this summation and clearly prints out each component and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the dimension:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The dimension is found by summing the number of independent generators\n    for each type of symmetry in the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The symmetries are composed of several distinct transformations.\n    # We count the number of generators for each.\n\n    # 1.
