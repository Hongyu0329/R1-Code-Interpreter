    Solves the linear algebra problem by reasoning through its dual form.

    The problem asks for the smallest size of a set of subspaces Y,
    such that for any subspace V, the sum of intersections of V with
    subspaces from Y equals V.

    # n: dimension of the total vector space F_p^n
    n = 2023
    # k_dim: dimension of the subspaces in the sets X and Y
    k_dim = 2000

    # Step 1: Dualize the problem.
    # In the dual space, subspaces have dimension d = n - k_dim.
    d = n - k_dim
    # So we are looking for a set of 3-dimensional subspaces.

    # Step 2: Analyze the dual condition.
    # The original condition is equivalent to a condition on d-dimensional subspaces V'
    # and W' in the dual space: for any V', the intersection of all (V' + W')
    # must be equal to V'.

    # Step 3: Characterize the failure of the dual condition.
    # The condition fails if there exists a (d+1)-dimensional subspace H
    # (in our case, 4-dimensional) and a d-dimensional subspace V' inside H,
    # such that all subspaces W' in our chosen set Y' are also subspaces of H
    # and are not equal to V'.

    # Step 4: Reformulate the problem.
    # This leads to a criterion for our set Y': For any (d+1)-dimensional
    # subspace H, if all subspaces in Y' are contained in H, then Y' must be the
    # *entire* set of d-dimensional subspaces of H.

    # Step 5: Find the minimum size of Y'. Let this size be k.
    # The number of d-dim subspaces in a (d+1)-dim space is large. If k is smaller
    # than this number, Y' must *not* be contained in any (d+1)-dim subspace H.
    # So we need to find the minimum k for which we can construct a set of k
    # d-dimensional subspaces whose sum has a dimension greater than d+1.

    m_dim = d  # Dimension of subspaces W' is 3.
    container_dim = m_dim + 1  # Dimension of H is 4.

    # We need to find the minimum k such that dim(W'_1 + ... + W'_k) > container_dim.

    # For k=1: A single m_dim-subspace W'_1 has dimension m_dim, which is not
    # greater than container_dim. So k=1 is not the answer.

    # For k=2: We have two subspaces, W'_1 and W'_2.
    # The dimension of their sum is:
    # dim(W'_1 + W'_2) = dim(W'_1) + dim(W'_2) - dim(W'_1 intersect W'_2)
    # dim(W'_1 + W'_2) = m_dim + m_dim - dim(W'_1 intersect W'_2)
    #
    # We need dim(W'_1 + W'_2) > container_dim = m_dim + 1
    # m_dim + m_dim - dim(W'_1 intersect W'_2) > m_dim + 1
    # m_dim - 1 > dim(W'_1 intersect W'_2)
    #
    # With m_dim = 3, we need dim(W'_1 intersect W'_2) < 2.
    # It is possible to choose two 3-dimensional subspaces in a 2023-dimensional
    # space whose intersection has dimension 0 or 1.
    # For example, W'_1 = span(e_1, e_2, e_3) and W'_2 = span(e_4, e_5, e_6).
    # Their intersection is {0}, which has dimension 0. 0 < 2, so this works.
    # The sum W'_1 + W'_2 is 6-dimensional, which is > 4.
    # Therefore, a set of size 2 can be constructed that is not contained in any
    # 4-dimensional subspace.

    # Since k=1 fails and k=2 works, the minimum possible number is 2.
