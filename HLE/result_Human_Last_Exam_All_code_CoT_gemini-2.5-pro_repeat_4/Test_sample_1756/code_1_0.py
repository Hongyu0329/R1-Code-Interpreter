# Analysis of each statement leads to the identification of the correct ones.
# A) Correct. The final sampling pool is the intersection of the sets from top-k and nucleus,
#    which is equivalent to the more restrictive of the two.
# C) Correct. Temperature Ï„ > 1 flattens the distribution, meaning more tokens are needed
#    to reach the cumulative probability mass p.
# E) Correct. Renormalizing a subset of probabilities preserves the relative ratios
#    of the probabilities within that subset.
# F) Correct. It's always possible to tune k such that the mass included by top-k is less than or
#    equal to the mass included by nucleus sampling, which makes the statement true.
# G) Correct. Standard implementations of combined sampling use the intersection of token sets,
#    which is a commutative operation.
# M) Correct. The statement says it "can be" deterministic. With deterministic routing (e.g., top-k)
#    and proper PyTorch flags, this is achievable.
# O) Correct. This is a known issue. Different GPU architectures can have minor differences in
#    floating-point arithmetic, leading to different results in sensitive operations like beam search.
# P) Correct. If expert pruning is non-deterministic (e.g., based on dynamic capacity), it will
#    change the model's forward pass and thus the output distribution for sampling.
# Q) Correct. This highlights that multiple components must be deterministic. Deterministic routing
#    alone is not sufficient if attention calculations are non-deterministic.
# R) Correct. Due to the nature of batched computation on GPUs, the presence of padding tokens
#    for other sequences in a batch can cause minor floating-point variations.
# X) Correct. The non-associativity of floating-point addition means that summing attention scores
#    in a different parallel order can yield slightly different results, affecting beam search paths.
# Y) Correct. Recomputing activations is subject to the same numerical precision and ordering
#    effects as other GPU operations, which can alter the final sampling distribution.
