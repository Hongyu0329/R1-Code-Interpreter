    "To find the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will analyze the structure of its branch points.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the curve and its genus.** The given equation is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 5. For a curve $y^2=f(x)$ where $\\deg(f)=2g+1$ or $2g+2$, the genus is $g$. Here, $2g+1=5$, so the genus $g=2$.\n\n2.  **Identify the branch points.** The branch points of the map from the curve to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$ and, because the degree is odd, the point at infinity. This gives a total of $5+1=6$ branch points.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 2-adic valuations of the branch points.** The structure of the stable reduction is determined by how these branch points cluster together in the 2-adic metric. The first step is to find their 2-adic valuations.\n    The polynomial can be factored as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\n    *   One root is clearly $x=0$. Its 2-adic valuation is infinite.\n    *   The other four roots are the roots of the quartic polynomial $P(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. We can determine the valuations of these roots using the Newton Polygon method with respect to the prime $p=2$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Newton Polygon.** The Newton polygon of a polynomial $P(x) = \\sum c_i x^i$ is constructed by plotting the points $(i, v_p(c_i))$ for each coefficient $c_i$ and finding the lower convex hull of these points. The negative of the slopes of the segments of this hull gives the p-adic valuations of the roots.\n\n5.  **Determine the stable reduction structure.** The branch points will be partitioned into clusters based on their valuations. This partition determines the components of the stable reduction. The stable reduction will be a curve (possibly reducible) of arithmetic genus 2. The number of double points is the number of intersection points between these components.\n\n6.  **Calculate the number of double points.** Based on the structure, we can calculate the number of double points required to make the arithmetic genus equal to 2.\n\nThe Python code below will perform step 4 to find the valuations of the roots of the quartic polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    valuation = 0\n    while n % p == 0:\n        valuation += 1\n        n //= p\n    return valuation\n\ndef newton_polygon_slopes(coeffs, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the slopes of the Newton polygon for a polynomial with given coefficients.\n    Coeffs should be a list [c_0, c_1, ..., c_n].\n    \"\"\"\n    points = []\n    print(\"Polynomial coefficients and their 2-adic valuations:\")\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        if c != 0:\n            val = get_valuation(c, p)\n            points.append((i, val))\n            print(f\"  - Coeff of x^{i} (c_{i}): {c}, v_2(c_{i}) = {val}\")\n    \n    # Sort points by x-coordinate\n    points.sort()\n    \n    print(\"\\nPoints for the Newton Polygon (degree, valuation):\")\n    print(f\"  {points}\")\n\n    # Find the lower convex hull (Newton polygon)\n    hull = [points[0]]\n    for i in range(1, len(points)):\n        while len(hull) >= 2:\n            p1 = hull[-2]\n            p2 = hull[-1]\n            p3 = points[i]\n            # Check if p3 is to the left of the line p1-p2 (cross product)\n            # (p2[0]-p1[0])*(p3[1]-p1[1]) - (p2[1]-p1[1])*(p3[0]-p1[0])\n            if (p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p3[1] - p1[1]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p3[0] - p1[0]) >= 0:\n                hull.pop()\n            else:\n                break\n        hull.append(points[i])\n        \n    print(\"\\nPoints on the lower convex hull (Newton Polygon):\")\n    print(f\"  {hull}\")\n\n    slopes = []\n    print(\"\\nSegments of the Newton Polygon and their slopes:\")\n    for i in range(len(hull) - 1):\n        p1 = hull[i]\n        p2 = hull[i+1]\n        slope = (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n        length = p2[0] - p1[0]\n        print(f\"  - Segment from {p1} to {p2}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Slope = ({p2[1]} - {p1[1]}) / ({p2[0]} - {p1[0]}) = {slope}\")\n        print(f\"    - Horizontal length = {length}\")\n        slopes.append({'slope': slope, 'length': length})\n        \n    return slopes\n\n# Coefficients of P(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8\n# The list is [c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4]\ncoeffs = [8, 1, 4, 4, 8]\np = 2\n\nslopes = newton_polygon_slopes(coeffs, p)\n\nprint(\"\\nValuations of the roots of P(x):\")\nfor s in slopes:\n    num_roots = s['length']\n    valuation = -s['slope']\n    print(f\"  - There are {num_roots} root(s) with 2-adic valuation {valuation}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Analysis of the Stable Reduction ---\")\nprint(\"The 6 branch points of the curve y^2=f(x) are the 5 roots of f(x) and the point at infinity.\")\nprint(\"The valuations of the branch points are:\")\nprint(\"  - Root x=0: v_2(0) = infinity\")\nprint(\"  - Root from P(x) (alpha_1): v_2(alpha_1) = 3.0\")\nprint(\"  - Three roots from P(x) (beta_i): v_2(beta_i) = -1.0\")\nprint(\"  - Point at infinity: Effectively has valuation -infinity\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThese branch points form two clusters:\")\nprint(\"  - Cluster S1 = {0, alpha_1}: The two points 'close to 0'.

A component $C_1$ of genus 0 (a rational curve).\n2.  A component $C_2$ of genus 1 (an elliptic curve).\n\nThese two components intersect in two points to form a connected curve of arithmetic genus $g = g(C_1) + g(C_2) + \\delta - N + 1 = 0 + 1 + 2 - 2 + 1 = 2$, which matches the genus of the original curve. The two intersection points are the double points of the stable reduction.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
