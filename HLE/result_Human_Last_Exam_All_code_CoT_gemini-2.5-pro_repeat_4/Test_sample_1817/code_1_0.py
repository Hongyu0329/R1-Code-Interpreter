    This function determines the inappropriate implementations based on Domain-Driven Design principles.
    
    A. Inappropriate. "Fat Controller" anti-pattern. Business logic does not belong in the controller layer.
    B. Inappropriate. "God Object" anti-pattern. An Order should not be responsible for customer discounts or sending emails.
    C. Inappropriate. A domain entity like Order should not be coupled with infrastructure concerns like sending emails.
    D. Inappropriate. "Anemic Domain Model" anti-pattern. This moves all logic out of the domain objects, which contradicts the Domain Model pattern.
    E. Appropriate. This is a standard and effective DDD approach, combining rich domain objects with services for coordination and infrastructure.
    
    The question asks for all the inappropriate implementations.
