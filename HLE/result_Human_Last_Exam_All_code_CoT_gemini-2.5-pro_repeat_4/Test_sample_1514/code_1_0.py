# The problem is a theoretical question in topology.
# The reasoning leads to a specific integer value.
# This code simply prints the final answer derived from the mathematical logic.

# The smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications of the ray
# with a remainder X (where X is a nondegenerate locally-connected compact metric space)
# is found to be 2. This minimum is achieved when X is a simple closed curve (like a circle).
smallest_number = 2

# The problem does not involve an equation, but asks to output the number.
