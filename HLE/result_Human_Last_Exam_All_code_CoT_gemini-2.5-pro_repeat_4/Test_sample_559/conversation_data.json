    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the system and find equilibrium points:** First, I will write down the system of ODEs for the phase plane analysis. Then, I'll find the equilibrium points (also called fixed points or critical points) by setting both derivatives, $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$, to zero and solving for $(u, d)$.\n\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** To understand the behavior of trajectories near the equilibrium points, I will compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. By evaluating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each equilibrium point, I can classify them as nodes, saddles, etc. Saddle points are particularly important as their stable and unstable manifolds often form separatrices.\n\n3.  **Formulate and solve the phase plane equation:** I will derive the differential equation for the trajectories in the $(u, d)$ phase plane by computing $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. This will result in a first-order ODE for $d$ as a function of $u$, which happens to be a Riccati equation.\n\n4.  **Identify the separatrix:** I will look for a particular solution to the Riccati equation. Separatrices are often simple curves that connect equilibrium points. I will test a simple polynomial form, $d(u) = -u^2$, and verify if it is a solution.\n\n5.  **Verify the separatrix:** I will confirm that the found curve, $d = -u^2$, is indeed the separatrix. I'll do this by showing that it passes through the saddle point and that its slope at that point matches the direction of the unstable manifold calculated from the Jacobian's eigenvector.\n\n6.  **Generate the Python code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that presents the equation of the separatrix in a clear format, ensuring that all the numerical coefficients and exponents in the equation are explicitly shown in the output, as requested.\n\n### Execution of the Plan\n\nFollowing the plan:\n\n1.  The system of ODEs is:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    $u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\n2.  Equilibrium points ($d'=0, u'=0$):\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    -   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the point **(0, 0)**.\n    -   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n3.  The Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    -   At (1, 0): $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so this is an **unstable node (source)**.\n    -   At (1, -1): $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. They have opposite signs, so this is a **saddle point**.\n    -   At (0, 0): $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n4.  The phase plane equation is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2}$.\n    By testing a simple form, I found a particular solution: $d = -u^2$.\n\n5.  Let's verify this solution.\n    -   The curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1) since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n    -   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At the saddle point ($u=1$), the slope is -2.\n    -   The eigenvector for the unstable manifold (corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$) of the saddle point is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of this manifold near the saddle point is $\\frac{-2}{1} = -2$.\n    -   Since the curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the saddle point and its slope matches the slope of the unstable manifold, it represents the separatrix. This curve separates the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to display the equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\n# The separatrix is a curve in the (u, d) phase plane that separates\n# trajectories with different behaviors. Based on the analysis of the system's\n# dynamics, the separatrix is found to be a parabola.\n\n# The equation of the separatrix is d = -u^2.\n# To present this in the format d + f(u) = 0, we can write it as d + u^2 = 0.\n# The following code prints this equation, explicitly stating the coefficients and powers.\n\n# Coefficients and powers in the equation: 1*d + 1*u^2 = 0\ncoeff_d = 1\ncoeff_u_sq = 1\npower_u = 2\nconstant = 0\n\n# Print the equation with all its numbers\nprint(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"{coeff_d}*d + {coeff_u_sq}*u**{power_u} = {constant}\")\n\n```\n<<<$d + u^2 = 0$>>>"
