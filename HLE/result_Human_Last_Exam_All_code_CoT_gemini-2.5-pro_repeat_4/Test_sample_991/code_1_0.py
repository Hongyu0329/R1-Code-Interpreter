# This script solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its components.

# The riddle: "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center."

# 1. Deconstruct the riddle into radicals (character components).

# "A wooden stick" refers to the radical '木' (mù), which represents a tree or wood.
component_stick = "木"
desc_stick = "A wooden stick (a tree)"

# "a square box" refers to the radical '囗' (wéi), which represents an enclosure.
component_box = "囗"
desc_box = "A square box (an enclosure)"

# "a ladder placed in the center" refers to the shape at the base of the '木' radical.
# The '木' character has a shape '八' (bā) at its base, which looks like a ladder.
# This "ladder" is part of the "wooden stick" and sits in the center of the final character.
desc_ladder = "A ladder (the '八' shape at the base of '木')"

# 2. Assemble the final character from the components.
# The riddle describes putting the "wooden stick" ('木') inside the "square box" ('囗').
# The character formed by a tree inside an enclosure is '困' (kùn).
# It means "trapped", "stranded", or "difficult".
final_character = "困"

# 3. Print the explanation and the result.
