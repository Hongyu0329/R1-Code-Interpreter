    This function analyzes the legal scenario and determines the correct answer choice.

    The key points of the analysis are:
    1.  The contract is for the sale of a "good" (a painting), not a service. Thus, the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) applies.
    2.  Lewis made the specific purpose known to Marcel (a large, detailed centrepiece of a specific location).
    3.  Lewis relied on Marcel's skill as an artist.
    4.  The delivered painting did not match the description or the specified purpose.
    5.  This constitutes a breach of the implied condition of "fitness for purpose" under the SGA.
    6.  The remedy for a breach of a condition is the right to reject the goods and demand a full refund.

    Based on this analysis, choice D is the correct legal outcome.
