    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark:** We first need to determine the rank of the Danish flag. A flag's design can be represented as a matrix by assigning distinct numerical values to its different colors. The rank of this matrix depends on the number of linearly independent rows or columns, which corresponds to the number of unique, non-proportional patterns in the design. The Danish flag, with its Nordic cross, has two fundamental row patterns: a row with a color stripe and the white cross (`[red, white, red]`), and a row that is entirely the white horizontal bar of the cross (`[white, white, white]`). Since these two patterns are linearly independent, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flags:** We will model various African flags as matrices and calculate their ranks.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags:** These typically have simple designs like only horizontal or vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Botswana). All rows (or columns) in their matrix representations are multiples of each other.\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags:** These have more complex, two-dimensional patterns that result in exactly two linearly independent row/column patterns. We'll look for designs like cantons (a distinct rectangle in the corner, e.g., Liberia, Togo), crosses or saltires (e.g., Burundi), or central symbols that break up a simple field (e.g., Algeria).\n    *   **Rank 3+ Flags:** These have very complex designs with three or more independent patterns (e.g., South Africa).\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a Python script using the NumPy library to formalize this process. The script will define matrix representations for the flags, calculate the rank of each, and print a list of the African flags whose rank matches that of Denmark.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_flag_rank(name, matrix_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the rank of a flag's matrix representation.\n    The final equation for the rank is printed by showing the matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    matrix = np.array(matrix_list)\n    rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n    \n    print(f\"--- Analyzing: {name} ---\")\n    print(\"Matrix Representation:\")\n    for row in matrix_list:\n        # Each number in the final equation is printed here\n        print(f\"  {row}\")\n    print(f\"Result: The rank for {name} is {rank}.\\n\")\n    return rank\n\ndef find_flags_with_matching_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models flags as matrices, calculates their ranks, and finds matches to Denmark's rank.\n    To maximize rank, we assign distinct numerical values to distinct colors or symbols.\n    Example mapping: Red=1, White=2, Blue=3, Green=4, Yellow=5, Black=6, Symbol/Other=7\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. Analyze Denmark to establish the target rank.\n    # The Danish flag has two row patterns: [Red, White, Red] and [White, White, White].\n    denmark_matrix = [\n        [1, 2, 1],\n        [2, 2, 2],\n        [1, 2, 1]\n    ]\n    target_rank = analyze_flag_rank(\"Denmark\", denmark_matrix)\n    print(f\"The target rank, based on the flag of Denmark, is {target_rank}.\\n\")\n    \n    # 2.
