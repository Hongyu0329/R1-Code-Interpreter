No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric, meaning their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, which prohibits the SPDC process.
