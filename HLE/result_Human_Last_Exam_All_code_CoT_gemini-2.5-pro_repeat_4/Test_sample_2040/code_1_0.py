    # Step 1: Define the primary requirement for SPDC.
    # SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon splits into two.
    # It is known as a second-order process, and its efficiency depends on a material
    # property called the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as chi(2).

    # Step 2: Analyze the crystal symmetry of boron nanosheets.
    # A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that for a material to have a non-zero
    # chi(2), it must lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).
    # Materials with inversion symmetry are called centrosymmetric.
    # We must check the symmetry of boron nanosheets (borophene).

    # determine if boron nanosheets are suitable for SPDC.
