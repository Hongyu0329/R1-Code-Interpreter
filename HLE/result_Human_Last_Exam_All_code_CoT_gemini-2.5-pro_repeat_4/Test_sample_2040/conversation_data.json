    "This is a scientific question about a physical phenomenon rather than a computational task. However, I can use a Python script to outline the step-by-step logical reasoning that leads to the answer, as you requested.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  First, establish the fundamental physical requirement for a material to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n2.  Next, examine the relevant physical properties of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), specifically their crystal symmetry.\n3.  Finally, compare the properties of borophene against the requirement for SPDC to draw a conclusion.\n\nThe instruction to include an equation with numbers is not directly applicable here, as this is a qualitative question based on material properties (specifically, crystal symmetry) rather than a quantitative calculation. The most relevant \"equation\" in this context is the statement that the second-order susceptibility `χ⁽²⁾` is zero for a specific class of materials, which will be included in the code's output.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) by outlining the physical reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the primary requirement for SPDC.\n    # SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon splits into two.\n    # It is known as a second-order process, and its efficiency depends on a material\n    # property called the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as chi(2).\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Physical Requirement for SPDC ---\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"A material must possess a significant second-order susceptibility, chi(2), to exhibit SPDC.\")\n    print(\"If chi(2) is zero, SPDC cannot occur.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the crystal symmetry of boron nanosheets.\n    # A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that for a material to have a non-zero\n    # chi(2), it must lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n    # Materials with inversion symmetry are called centrosymmetric.\n    # We must check the symmetry of boron nanosheets (borophene).\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Material Properties of Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n    print(\"Physical Principle: In materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials), the second-order susceptibility is zero.\")\n    # This is the key \"equation\" for this problem.\n    print(\"For a centrosymmetric crystal, the governing equation is: chi(2) = 0\")\n    \n    # Scientific literature indicates that the common, stable phases of free-standing\n    # boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, similar to graphene.\n    borophene_symmetry = \"Centrosymmetric\"\n    print(f\"The crystal structure of common boron nanosheet phases is: {borophene_symmetry}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Draw a conclusion.\n    # By combining the requirement from Step 1 and the property from Step 2, we can\n    # determine if boron nanosheets are suitable for SPDC.\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Conclusion ---\")\n    if borophene_symmetry == \"Centrosymmetric\":\n        print(\"Because boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their bulk chi(2) is expected to be 0.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are NOT expected to be a good candidate for exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"If boron nanosheets were non-centrosymmetric, they might exhibit SPDC.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nanalyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets()\n```\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric, meaning their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, which prohibits the SPDC process.>>>"
