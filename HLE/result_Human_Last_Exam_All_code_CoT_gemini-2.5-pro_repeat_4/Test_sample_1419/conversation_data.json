    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in the study of the Renormalization Group in Quantum Field Theory.\n\nHere is my plan to derive the expression:\n1.  I will start by introducing the core concept for this problem: the beta function (`β`) in `ϕ⁴` theory. This function describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale.\n2.  The calculation is performed near four dimensions, so we will use dimensional regularization by setting the spacetime dimension `d = 4 - ϵ`, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n3.  A fixed point `u*` is a special value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`. The system becomes scale-invariant at a fixed point.\n4.  I will provide the well-established one-loop beta function for `ϕ⁴` theory.\n5.  Then, I will write a Python script that lays out the algebraic steps to solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` for the non-trivial fixed point `u*`.\n6.  The script will print the derivation and the final expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, clearly displaying each number in the formula as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the derivation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_phi4_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Derivation of the fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory.\")\n    print(\"============================================================\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
