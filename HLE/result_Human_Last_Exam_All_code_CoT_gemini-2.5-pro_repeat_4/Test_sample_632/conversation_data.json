    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question while fulfilling the request for a Python script.\n\n1.  First, I will identify the key information from your question: the location (Piazza della Rotonda), the year (1950), and the event (removal of an architectural feature).\n2.  I will then use my knowledge base to determine what this specific feature was.\n3.  Next, I will create a simple Python script. The script will use the year 1950 as a variable in a basic equation, as per your instructions.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a statement that answers your question directly, followed by the illustrative equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function answers a historical question about Rome's Piazza della Rotonda\n    and demonstrates a simple equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year the feature was removed.\n    year_removed = 1950\n    # An arbitrary number for our equation. Let's use the number of rails for a tram track.\n    number_of_rails = 2\n    \n    # An arbitrary calculation to fulfill the request for an equation.\n    result = year_removed - number_of_rails\n\n    # The answer to the user's question.\n    feature_description = \"A circular tram line that went around the square.\"\n    \n    print(\"The unique feature in Piazza della Rotonda, removed around 1950, was:\")\n    print(feature_description)\n    print(\"\\nTo fulfill the request for an equation, here is one using the year of removal:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {year_removed} - {number_of_rails} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<A circular tram line>>>"
