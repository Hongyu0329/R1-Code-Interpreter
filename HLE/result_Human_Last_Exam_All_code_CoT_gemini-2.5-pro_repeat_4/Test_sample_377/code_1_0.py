    Calculates the number of blocks for the group algebra kG.

    Let G = D \rtimes S, where D = (C_2)^2 and S = 3^{1+2}_+.
    The field k has characteristic 2.

    Step 1: Analyze the group structure.
    S is the extraspecial 3-group of order 27 and exponent 3.
    D is the Klein four-group, an abelian 2-group of order 4.
    The action of S on D factors through a quotient S/K, where K is a normal
    subgroup of S isomorphic to C_3 x C_3, and S/K is isomorphic to C_3.
    The kernel of the action, K, commutes with D. This gives rise to a
    normal subgroup H = D x K in G. H is abelian of order 4 * 9 = 36.
    The quotient group G/H is isomorphic to S/K, which is C_3.

    Step 2: Use Clifford theory for blocks.
    The number of blocks of kG can be determined from the blocks of the normal
    subgroup kH and the action of G/H on them.

    Step 3: Find the number of blocks of kH.
    H = (C_2 x C_2) x (C_3 x C_3). Let D = C_2 x C_2.
    Since char(k)=2, D is the Sylow 2-subgroup of H, and it is normal.
    By Fong's theorem, the number of blocks of kH is equal to the number of
    blocks of k[H/D].
    H/D is isomorphic to K = C_3 x C_3.
    The group algebra k[C_3 x C_3] is semisimple because char(k)=2 does not divide
    the order of the group, which is 9.
    For a commutative semisimple group algebra, the number of blocks is equal to the
    order of the group.

    """
    Step 4: Determine the action of G/H on the blocks of kH.
    The action of G/H ~= C_3 on the 9 blocks of kH is equivalent to the action
    of S/K ~= C_3 on the 9 irreducible characters of K ~= C_3 x C_3.
    This action is dual to the conjugation action of S/K on K.
    This action permutes the 9 characters of K. We need to find the orbits.
    
    Let the characters of K be represented by pairs (u, v) where u, v are in {0, 1, 2}.
    The action of a generator of C_3 on the character coordinates (u, v) is a linear
    transformation T(u,v) = ((u+v)%3, v). We find the orbits of this action.

    Step 5: Calculate the total number of blocks of kG.
