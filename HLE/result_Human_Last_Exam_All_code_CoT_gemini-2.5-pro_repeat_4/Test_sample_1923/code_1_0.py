    print("Analysis: This is a correct principle within General Relativity. However, it is a very general statement about the nature of the theory and does not provide a specific, falsifiable mechanism to explain the *forward shift* in question. It's a required property of the field, not the direct cause of this specific effect.")

    print("Choice C: Field strength varies inversely with apparent propagation time...")
    print("Analysis: Let's examine the assumption: Strength ∝ 1 / (Apparent Propagation Time).")
    print("Consider mass 2 moving. The parts of mass 2 on its 'leading' edge are moving slightly towards mass 1 compared to the parts on its 'trailing' edge.")
    print("Due to a Doppler-like effect, the time it takes for a signal to travel from the leading edge to mass 1 is slightly shorter than the time from the trailing edge.")
    print("If field strength is inversely proportional to this time, the gravitational pull from the leading edge would be stronger than the pull from the trailing edge.")
    print("This would cause the net force vector to be skewed forward, making the 'center of gravity' appear shifted in the direction of motion. This assumption directly produces the required result.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Choice D: The net product of field strength and propagation speed remains invariant...")
    print("Analysis: This implies: Strength × c = Constant. Since c is a universal constant, this means Strength must also be invariant across all reference frames. An invariant field strength would not produce any relativistic distortions and would result in the simple aberration lag, not a forward shift.")

    print("Choice E: The gravitational field adjusts its divergence to match the curvature...")
    print("Analysis: Like choice B, this is a correct but very general statement derived from General Relativity. It describes the fundamental relationship between matter and spacetime but does not isolate the specific, simplified mechanism that would cause the described forward shift. Choice C provides a much more direct and testable hypothesis for the effect in question.")
