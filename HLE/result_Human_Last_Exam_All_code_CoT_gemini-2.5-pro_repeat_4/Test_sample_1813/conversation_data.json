    "To compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we will follow a multi-step process derived from the theory of the Lagrange and Markov spectra.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{p/q}\\):** The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) associated with a rational number \\(p/q\\) is defined based on its simple continued fraction.\n2.  **Continued Fraction of \\(4/7\\):** First, we find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\). A rational number \\(p/q\\) between 0 and 1 has a continued fraction of the form \\([0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n3.  **Calculate the Markov Constant \\(C_{4/7}\\):** We then compute a value \\(C_{4/7}\\), which is defined as the maximum of the sums \\(\\lambda_k + \\mu_k\\) for \\(k=1, \\dots, n\\), where:\n    *   \\(\\lambda_k\\) is the value of the continued fraction \\([a_k; a_{k+1}, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n    *   \\(\\mu_k\\) is the value of the continued fraction \\([0; a_{k-1}, a_{k-2}, \\dots, a_1]\\).\n4.  **Calculate \\(m_{4/7}\\):** The generalized Markov number is then given by the formula \\(m_{4/7} = \\sqrt{C_{4/7}^2 + 4}\\).\n5.  **Compute the Continued Fraction of \\(m_{4/7}\\):** The resulting number, \\(m_{4/7}\\), will be a quadratic irrational. We can find its continued fraction using a standard algorithm for numbers of the form \\(\\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q}\\).\n6.  **Implementation:** The following Python script will execute these steps to find the coefficients of the continued fraction for \\(m_{4/7}\\) and print the result.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nimport math\n\ndef rational_to_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the simple continued fraction of a rational number p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if q == 0:\n        return []\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef evaluate_cf(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Evaluates a finite simple continued fraction from a list of coefficients.\"\"\"\n    if not coeffs:\n        return Fraction(0)\n    val = Fraction(coeffs[-1])\n    for i in range(len(coeffs) - 2, -1, -1):\n        val = coeffs[i] + 1 / val\n    return val\n\ndef cf_quadratic_irrational(D, P0, Q0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational of the form (P0 + sqrt(D)) / Q0.\n    The algorithm requires that Q0 divides (D - P0^2).
