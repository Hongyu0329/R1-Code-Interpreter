    "This is a problem in the representation theory of algebras, specifically concerning representations of posets (partially ordered sets). I will outline the steps to arrive at the answer and then provide a Python script that explains and prints the solution.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Interpret the Mathematical Terms:** The question involves specialized concepts from abstract algebra.\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$):** A poset where any two elements have a least upper bound. It's a known result that the category algebra $KJ$ associated with a finite upper semilattice is of **tame representation type**. This means its indecomposable representations can be classified and fall into discrete families and one-parameter families.\n    *   **Tame Functor ($f$):** In the context of a tame algebra, the term \"tame functor\" typically refers to an indecomposable representation that belongs to one of the one-parameter families. These are also known as **regular** modules/functors. They are distinct from the preprojective and preinjective representations.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable:** A module or functor $M$ is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n-1$. This is equivalent to the condition that its projective dimension, $\\text{pdim}(M)$, satisfies the inequality $\\text{pdim}(M) \\le n-1$.\n\n2.  **Rephrase the Question:** Based on the interpretations above, the question can be rephrased as: \"Let $f$ be a regular indecomposable representation of the category algebra $KJ$ of a finite upper semilattice $J$. What is the integer $n$ such that $\\text{pdim}(f) \\le n-1$?\"\n\n3.  **Apply Known Results:** For the class of tame algebras that includes algebras of upper semilattices (which are known to be quasi-hereditary), the regular indecomposable modules have a projective dimension of exactly 1.\n\n4.  **Solve for $n$:**\n    *   We have the result: $\\text{pdim}(f) = 1$.\n    *   From the definition of $n$-resolvable, we have the inequality: $\\text{pdim}(f) \\le n-1$.\n    *   Substituting the known value gives: $1 \\le n-1$.\n    *   Solving for $n$ gives $n \\ge 2$. The question asks for what $n$ it is resolvable, and the standard convention implies the minimal such universal integer. Thus, $n=2$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Script:** The script will print out this chain of reasoning step-by-step and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the mathematical problem regarding n-resolvable functors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThis problem asks for the value of 'n' for which a 'tame functor' over an upper semilattice is 'n-resolvable'. Here is a step-by-step logical derivation of the answer based on standard definitions in representation theory:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Terms\n- An 'upper semilattice' (J) gives rise to an algebra KJ which is of 'tame representation type'.\n- A 'tame functor' (f) refers to an indecomposable regular representation of this algebra. These are the representations that form the continuous families characterizing tame algebras.\n- A functor f is 'n-resolvable' if its projective dimension, pdim(f), is at most n-1. This gives us the key inequality:\n  pdim(f) <= n - 1\n\nStep 2: Stating the Key Result\nFor the algebras associated with upper semilattices, it is a known result in representation theory that their regular indecomposable modules (our 'tame functors') have a projective dimension of exactly 1.\n  pdim(f) = 1\n\nStep 3: Solving for n\nWe can now substitute the result from Step 2 into the inequality from Step 1.\nThe value of pdim(f) is 1.\nThe defining inequality is pdim(f) <= n - 1.\n\nSo, the final equation to solve is:\n1 <= n - 1\n\nSolving this inequality for the smallest integer n gives:\nn >= 1 + 1\nn >= 2\n\nThus, a tame functor f is 2-resolvable.\n\"\"\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_representation_theory_problem()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
