This problem asks for the value of 'n' for which a 'tame functor' over an upper semilattice is 'n-resolvable'. Here is a step-by-step logical derivation of the answer based on standard definitions in representation theory:

Step 1: Understanding the Terms
- An 'upper semilattice' (J) gives rise to an algebra KJ which is of 'tame representation type'.
- A 'tame functor' (f) refers to an indecomposable regular representation of this algebra. These are the representations that form the continuous families characterizing tame algebras.
- A functor f is 'n-resolvable' if its projective dimension, pdim(f), is at most n-1. This gives us the key inequality:
  pdim(f) <= n - 1

Step 2: Stating the Key Result
For the algebras associated with upper semilattices, it is a known result in representation theory that their regular indecomposable modules (our 'tame functors') have a projective dimension of exactly 1.
  pdim(f) = 1

Step 3: Solving for n
We can now substitute the result from Step 2 into the inequality from Step 1.
The value of pdim(f) is 1.
The defining inequality is pdim(f) <= n - 1.

So, the final equation to solve is:
1 <= n - 1

Solving this inequality for the smallest integer n gives:
n >= 1 + 1
n >= 2

Thus, a tame functor f is 2-resolvable.
