    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of size 3, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Automorphism Group**: An automorphism group of size 3 must be the cyclic group `C₃`. This means the graph must possess a 3-fold rotational symmetry, generated by an automorphism `g` of order 3. This symmetry `g` must not be accompanied by any other symmetries, such as reflections, which would increase the size of the automorphism group (e.g., to `S₃`, which has size 6).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Edge Orbits**: The automorphism `g` partitions the graph's edge set into orbits. The size of each orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, edges can either be in orbits of size 1 (fixed by `g`) or orbits of size 3. An edge can only be fixed by `g` if it connects two vertices that are both fixed by `g`. For a connected graph with a `C₃` symmetry, it can be shown that the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n\n3.  **Test Smallest Possible Values for `e`**:\n    *   **e = 3**: The only connected graphs with 3 edges are the path `P₄` (`|Aut(P₄)|=2`) and the star graph `K₁,₃` (`|Aut(K₁,₃)|=6`). Neither works.\n    *   **e = 6**: Several graphs with 3-fold symmetry and 6 edges can be constructed. For example, the wheel graph with 4 vertices, `W₄`, has `|Aut(W₄)|=6`. Other common constructions also possess unwanted reflectional symmetries, leading to an automorphism group of size 6 (isomorphic to `S₃` or `D₃`), not 3.\n    *   **e = 9**: To eliminate the reflectional symmetries, we need to introduce \"chirality\" (handedness) into the graph structure. We can construct a graph with 9 edges that has the desired `C₃` symmetry but lacks reflectional symmetry.\n\n4.  **Construct the Graph with e = 9**: A minimal graph with the desired properties can be constructed with 7 vertices and 9 edges. The edges are formed from three distinct orbits of size 3. The code below defines this graph and calculates its number of edges. This construction demonstrates that `e=9` is achievable.\n\nSince `e=3` and `e=6` are not possible, the smallest number of edges is 9.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a graph with an automorphism group of size 3\n    and determines the smallest possible number of edges 'e'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The graph is constructed with 7 vertices: a central fixed point 'c',\n    # an inner ring {v1, v2, v3}, and an outer ring {u1, u2, u3}.\n    # The 3-fold symmetry operation g rotates the vertices in the rings,\n    # i.e., g(vi) = v(i+1 mod 3) and g(ui) = u(i+1 mod 3), while g(c) = c.\n\n    # The edges are defined in three orbits of size 3.\n    \n    # Orbit 1: Connects the center 'c' to the inner ring.\n    edge_orbit_1 = [('c', 'v1'), ('c', 'v2'), ('c', 'v3')]\n    \n    # Orbit 2: Forms a triangle on the outer ring.\n    edge_orbit_2 = [('u1', 'u2'), ('u2', 'u3'), ('u3', 'u1')]\n    \n    # Orbit 3: A \"chiral\" connection between the inner and outer rings.\n    # This specific wiring breaks reflectional symmetry.\n    edge_orbit_3 = [('v1', 'u2'), ('v2', 'u3'), ('v3', 'u1')]\n\n    # The total number of edges 'e' is the sum of the sizes of these orbits.\n    num_edges_orbit_1 = len(edge_orbit_1)\n    num_edges_orbit_2 = len(edge_orbit_2)\n    num_edges_orbit_3 = len(edge_orbit_3)\n    \n    e = num_edges_orbit_1 + num_edges_orbit_2 + num_edges_orbit_3\n\n    print(f\"The constructed graph has {e} edges, formed from 3 orbits.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the number of edges e is:\")\n    print(f\"e = {num_edges_orbit_1} + {num_edges_orbit_2} + {num_edges_orbit_3}\")\n    print(f\"e = {e}\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on analysis, this is the smallest possible number of edges.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
