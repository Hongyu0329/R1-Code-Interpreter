# Based on the analytical derivation, the exact value of phi(7) is 7 * pi.
# The detailed steps are provided in the explanation above.
# The final result relies on the identity E[|X| + sgn(X-a)] = a for a symmetric random variable X and a > 0.
# In our case, X = det(N) is a symmetric random variable and a = 7.
# Therefore, phi(7) = pi * E[|X| + sgn(X-7)] = pi * 7.

a = 7
result = a * math.pi

# The final equation is phi(7) = 7 * pi
