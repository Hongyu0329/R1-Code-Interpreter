# Step 1: Determine c1
# The reciprocal/inverse concept of logical "depth" is "Complexity".
# The third letter of "Complexity" is 'm'.
c1 = 'm'
print(f"The inverse of logical depth is 'Complexity'. The 3rd letter, c1, is: {c1}")

# Step 2: Determine c2
# The full Murray Gell-Mann quote is "the two options didn't commute."
# The third character of "options" is 't'.
c2 = 't'
print(f"The missing word in the quote is 'options'. The 3rd character, c2, is: {c2}")

# Step 3 & 4: Determine c3 and c4
# The paper "Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)" was authored by Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel.
# The last author's last name is "Gimpel". The last letter, c3, is 'l'.
c3 = 'l'
# We apply ROT13 to c3 to get c4. ROT13('l') -> 'y'.
c4 = codecs.encode(c3, 'rot_13')
print(f"The GELU's last author's last name is Gimpel. The last letter is '{c3}'. ROT13('{c3}') gives c4: {c4}")

# Step 5: Determine c5
# Comparing masses: Earth (~5.97e24 kg), Mars (~0.64e24 kg), Moon (~0.07e24 kg).
# Mars is closer in mass to the Moon.
# The second letter of "Moon" is 'o'.
c5 = 'o'
print(f"Mars is closer in mass to the 'Moon'. The 2nd letter, c5, is: {c5}")

# Final Step: Concatenate and print the result
final_string = c1 + c2 + c4 + c5
print(f"\nThe final equation is c1 + c2 + c4 + c5.")
print(f"Substituting the characters: {c1} + {c2} + {c4} + {c5}")
print(f"The final concatenated string is: {final_string}")
