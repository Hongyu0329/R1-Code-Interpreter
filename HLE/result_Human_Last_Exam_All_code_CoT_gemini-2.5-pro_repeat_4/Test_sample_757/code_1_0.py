# The final formula for the minimal Cheeger constant is a fraction
# determined by our analysis. Let's define the numbers in this formula.
# The formula is of the form: numerator / (coefficient_of_n * n - constant)

numerator = 1
coefficient_of_n = 2
constant_term = 1

# Now, we print the final equation for the minimal possible value.
# The f-string formatting allows us to explicitly show how each number
# is used in the final equation, as requested.
