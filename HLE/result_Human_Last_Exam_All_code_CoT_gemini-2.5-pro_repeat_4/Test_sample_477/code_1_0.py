    Explains the role of LIG1 in CTG somatic instability in Myotonic Dystrophy.

    explanation = """
    Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is characterized by the expansion of a CTG repeat sequence. This repeat is unstable in somatic cells and tends to expand over time, a phenomenon called somatic instability, which worsens the disease.

    This expansion process is linked to DNA replication and repair. The CTG repeat can form stable hairpin structures, and when the cellular DNA replication/repair machinery processes these hairpins, it can lead to the addition of more repeats.

    DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) is a critical enzyme that seals nicks in the DNA backbone. This function is essential for joining Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and for completing DNA repair pathways.

    For a CTG expansion to be permanently incorporated into the genome, the final nick must be sealed by a DNA ligase. LIG1 is the key enzyme that performs this step during DNA replication.

    Scientific studies using mouse models of DM1 have shown that reducing the amount or function of LIG1 leads to a significant reduction in the somatic expansion of CTG repeats. By preventing the final ligation step, the expansion process is effectively aborted.

    Therefore, the impact of knocking out LIG1 is a reduction in CTG somatic instability.
