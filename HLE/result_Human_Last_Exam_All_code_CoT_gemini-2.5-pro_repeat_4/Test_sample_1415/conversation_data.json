    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand**: The integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard logarithmic derivative form. The antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x)` is `F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 will be `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which simplifies to `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)**:\n    *   First, I'll determine the expression for `F₃(x)` by composing the given functions: `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`.\n    *   Then, I'll calculate `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n    *   And `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`.\n    *   I will also check if `F₃(x)` is positive over the interval `[0, 1]` to safely remove the absolute value signs.\n4.  **Calculate the Value (V)**: I will substitute the values from the previous step into the formula `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: I will compute `10000 * V` and find the closest integer to this result.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out each step of the evaluation, including the intermediate values, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the definite integral problem and reports the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    # The integral is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n    # The antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n    # By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the function F₃(x) and evaluate it at the limits of integration (x=1 and x=0).\")\n    \n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    def F3(x):\n        return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n    # Evaluate at x = 1\n    F3_at_1 = F3(1)\n    \n    # Evaluate at x = 0\n    F3_at_0 = F3(0)\n    \n    print(f\"The upper limit value is F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {F3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"The lower limit value is F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {F3_at_0}\\n\")\n    \n    # Since F₃(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1], we can drop the absolute value in ln|F₃(x)|.\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the value of the integral V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    \n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n    \n    # Print the equation with the calculated numbers\n    print(f\"V = ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0})\")\n    print(f\"V = {V}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the final result as the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\n    \n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n    \n    print(f\"10000 * V = 10000 * {V} = {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
