    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This could be a double bond (an alkene) or a ring (a cycloalkane).\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal's chemical shift and multiplicity (s=singlet, t=triplet, d=doublet, q=quartet) to determine the type of carbon atom it represents (quaternary, CH2, CH, or CH3).\n    *   Shifts > 100 ppm typically indicate carbons in a double bond or aromatic ring.\n    *   Multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogens attached to that carbon: s=0H, t=2H, d=1H, q=3H.\n3.  **Deduce Key Structural Features**: The alkene-region signals (145 ppm and 112 ppm) will confirm the presence of a C=C double bond and provide information about its substitution pattern.\n4.  **Account for All Atoms**: The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This means two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal. I will use the multiplicity data to determine which type of carbon is duplicated.\n5.  **Assemble the Structure**: I will piece together the identified fragments like a puzzle to form a coherent structure that matches all the data. I will consider different possible arrangements and use chemical shift logic (e.g., allylic effects) to select the most plausible structure.\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is identified, I will apply the IUPAC nomenclature rules to find its official name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script deduces the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon C7H14\n    from its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    # The general formula CnH2n indicates one degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring).\n\n    # --- Step 2 & 3: Analyze NMR Data to Find Key Features ---\n    # NMR Data: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing molecular formula and NMR data...\")\n    print(f\"Molecular formula is {molecular_formula}, indicating one degree of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the 13C NMR signals:\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A chemical shift of 145 ppm in the alkene region and a singlet (s) multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached H) that is part of a C=C double bond.
