    "To determine which ballet step has the same starting and ending leg position, I will analyze the definition of each movement. My plan is to break down the mechanics of each step listed in the answer choices.\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Step:** I will examine the starting position, the action, and the resulting ending position for `Entrechat six`, `Échappé battu changé`, `Assemblé`, `Glissade derrière`, and `Gargouillade`.\n2.  **Identify Non-Changing Step:** I will look for the step that, by its core definition, concludes in the exact same fifth position it began in (i.e., the same foot is in front).\n3.  **Construct Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically prints this analysis, explaining why each option is correct or incorrect, and then prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the ballet steps to find the one with the same start and end position:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Analysis of each step\n    analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'step': 'Entrechat six',\n            'explanation': 'An \"entrechat\" is a vertical jump where the legs beat and cross.
