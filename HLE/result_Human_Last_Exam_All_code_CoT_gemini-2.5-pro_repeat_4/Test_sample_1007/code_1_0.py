Even-numbered entrechats (like two, four, or six) always start and end in the same fifth position with the same foot in front. Therefore, an Entrechat six is a non-changing step.',

            'step': 'Échappé battu changé',
            'explanation': 'The word "changé" in French means "changed." This term explicitly states that the step finishes with the feet in the opposite position from where they started (e.g., if the right foot was in front, it ends with the left foot in front).',

            'step': 'Assemblé',
