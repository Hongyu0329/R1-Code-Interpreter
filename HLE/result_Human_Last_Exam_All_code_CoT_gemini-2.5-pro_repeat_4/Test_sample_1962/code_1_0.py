def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function explains and prints the solution to the mathematical problem.
    The problem is to find min({X_f}) where X_f is the cardinality of the set of functions
    g: κ⁺ → κ such that f(⟨α,β⟩) ≤ max({g(α),g(β)}) for all α, β < κ⁺.

    The solution relies on two key insights:
    1. If the set of solutions for a given f, S_f, is non-empty, its cardinality must be κ^(κ⁺).
       This is because if g₀ is a solution, any function h where h(α) ≥ g₀(α) for all α
       is also a solution. The number of such functions h is κ^(κ⁺).
    2. A theorem in set theory guarantees that the set of solutions S_f is never empty.

    Combining these, X_f is always κ^(κ⁺), so the minimum is also κ^(κ⁺).
