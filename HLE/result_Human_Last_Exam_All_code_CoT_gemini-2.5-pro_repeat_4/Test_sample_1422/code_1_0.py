    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.

    This function uses the topological relations for Feynman diagrams to derive
    a formula for the number of vertices (V) based on the number of loops (L)
    and the vertex type (n, the number of lines per vertex). It then evaluates
    this for common scalar theories to find the minimum.
