    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the general topological relations for Feynman diagrams.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the two fundamental equations that relate the number of loops (L), vertices (V), internal lines (I), external lines (E), and the number of lines meeting at each vertex (n).\n2.  I will combine these equations to derive a general formula for the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of loops (L) and the vertex type (n).\n3.  To find the absolute minimum, I will assume a vacuum diagram (E=0), which typically requires the fewest components.\n4.  I will apply this formula to the two most common types of interacting scalar field theories: $\\phi^4$ theory (where n=4) and $\\phi^3$ theory (where n=3).\n5.  By calculating the number of vertices for a two-loop diagram (L=2) in both cases, I will find the minimum possible value.\n6.  The final python code will print out this entire derivation and present the final calculation that yields the minimum number of vertices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\n\n    This function uses the topological relations for Feynman diagrams to derive\n    a formula for the number of vertices (V) based on the number of loops (L)\n    and the vertex type (n, the number of lines per vertex).
