    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the infinite sum inside the integral, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\n2.  Using the logarithm property $\\log a + \\log b = \\log(ab)$, this sum can be converted into the logarithm of an infinite product: $\\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\n3.  This infinite product has a well-known identity. By repeatedly using the sine double-angle formula $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$, we can show that $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n4.  Therefore, the original integral becomes $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$.\n5.  This is a famous definite integral in mathematical analysis. Its evaluation is non-trivial and requires methods such as complex analysis, as the integral does not converge absolutely. However, its value is a standard result.\n6.  The value of this integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n7.  The Python code will present this derivation and print the final result, showing each component of the final expression as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the integral by simplifying the sum and using a known mathematical result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is to evaluate the integral:\n    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum_{n=1 to infinity} log(cos(x/2^n)) dx\n\n    # Step 1: Simplify the sum inside the integral.\n    # The sum is S(x) = sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)).\n    # Using the logarithm property log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), the sum becomes:\n    # S(x) = log( product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) )\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the infinite product.\n    # The infinite product is a known identity:\n    # product_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) = sin(x)/x.\n    # This identity is derived from the sine double-angle formula, sin(a) = 2*sin(a/2)*cos(a/2).\n    # So, the integrand simplifies to log(sin(x)/x).\n\n    # Step 3: The integral becomes:\n    # I = integral from 0 to infinity of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral.\n    # This is a known, non-trivial integral in mathematical analysis.
