    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework:** I will start from the principles of statistical mechanics for a gas of bosons (photons). The core idea, which connects to large deviation theory (like Sanov's theorem), is the principle of maximum entropy. This principle states that the equilibrium state of a system is the one that maximizes its entropy `S` for a given mean energy `U`.\n2.  **Derivation of the Distribution:** I will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy, which yields the Bose-Einstein distribution function `n(ε)`. This function gives the average number of photons in a state with energy `ε`.\n3.  **Calculation of Mean Energy (U):** Using the Bose-Einstein distribution and the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a three-dimensional volume, I will calculate the total mean energy `U` by integrating `ε * n(ε) * g(ε)` over all possible energies. This will result in the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n4.  **Calculation of Entropy (S):** I will then calculate the corresponding equilibrium entropy `S`. For a photon gas, a simple relationship `S = (4/3) * U / T` can be derived.\n5.  **Implementation:** I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to define these physical quantities, perform the necessary integrations, and present the final derived expressions for `U`, `S`, and their relationship. The final equation will be printed out piece by piece as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_bose_light_quanta():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the equilibrium values of mean energy (U) and entropy (S)\n    for a gas of light quanta (photons) using principles of statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define physical constants and variables symbolically ---\n    # We use sympy for symbolic mathematics.\n    epsilon, T, V = sp.symbols('epsilon T V', positive=True, real=True)\n    k, h, c = sp.symbols('k h c', positive=True, real=True) # Boltzmann, Planck, speed of light\n    \n    # The Lagrange multiplier beta is related to temperature T\n    beta = 1 / (k * T)\n\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Values for Light Quanta (Bose Case)\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # --- Step 2: State the Bose-Einstein Distribution ---\n    # The equilibrium occupation number n(epsilon) for a state with energy epsilon is found\n    # by maximizing the system's entropy for a fixed mean energy.
