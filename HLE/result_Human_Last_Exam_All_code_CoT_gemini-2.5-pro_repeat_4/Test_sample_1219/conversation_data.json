    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to follow a specific plan because the number 10^100 (a googol) is far too large for standard calculators or programming language data types.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Problem Analysis**: The core challenge is calculating `tan(x)` for a very large number, `x = 10^100`. Standard floating-point types (like Python's `float`) lack the necessary precision to handle such a number and will lead to incorrect results.\n2.  **Mathematical Insight**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of `π`. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The problem, therefore, reduces to finding the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π` and then calculating the tangent of that small remainder.\n3.  **Tool Selection**: This high-precision calculation requires a specialized library. Python's `mpmath` library is perfectly suited for this task. It supports arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic, and its trigonometric functions are designed to correctly handle very large arguments by performing the necessary argument reduction (`x mod π`) internally.\n4.  **Execution Plan**:\n    *   We will use the `mpmath` library in a Python script. If you don't have it, you can install it via pip: `pip install mpmath`.\n    *   We must set the precision (`mpmath.mp.dps`) to a value high enough to handle `10^100`. Since `10^100` has 101 digits, a precision of 110 decimal places is a safe choice to ensure the calculation is accurate.\n    *   The script will then compute `tan(10^100)` using `mpmath` functions.\n    *   Finally, the script will format the result as a string and extract the first three digits following the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision for mpmath. The number 10^100 has 101 digits.\n# To compute its value mod pi accurately, we need a working precision\n# slightly greater than 100. We'll use 110 decimal places for safety.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# Define the numbers in the equation: tan(base^exponent)\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\n\n# Calculate x = base^exponent using mpmath's power function\nx = mpmath.power(base, exponent)\n\n# Calculate tan(x). mpmath's tan function automatically and accurately\n# handles the necessary argument reduction (x mod pi) for large numbers.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# Extract the first 3 digits after the decimal point.\n# We convert the result to a string to find and slice the digits.\n# mpmath.nstr() is used to get a string representation of the number.\nresult_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 10) # Format with 10 decimal places for slicing\npoint_index = result_str.find('.')\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[point_index + 1 : point_index + 4]\n\n# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"Calculating tan({base}^{exponent})\")\n# mpmath.nstr() provides a nice string representation of the high-precision result.\nprint(f\"The full result is approximately: {mpmath.nstr(result, 20)}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\n```\n<<<537>>>"
