    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. That is, $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(x', y')$, where $\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = T \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T$ is an invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrix with entries in $R$. The set of all such matrices forms the general linear group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of all quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nMy plan is to solve this using a Python script that performs the following steps:\n1.  **Generate all quadratic forms:** Create a list of all possible quadratic forms. Since $a, b, c$ can each take any of the 8 values in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, there are $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ distinct forms. Each form is represented by a tuple `(a, b, c)`.\n2.  **Generate the transformation group:** Create a list of all matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e., the determinant is in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  **Count the equivalence classes (orbits):**\n    *   Start with a set containing all 512 forms.\n    *   Repeatedly pick a form from the set, find all other forms equivalent to it by applying every transformation in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ (this is its orbit), and remove the entire orbit from the set.\n    *   Each orbit found corresponds to one equivalence class.\n    *   The process stops when the set of forms is empty. The number of orbits found is the answer.\n4.  **Output the result:** The script will print the total number of classes, a representative for each class, and finally, it will print the theoretical formula and result for this problem to fulfill the user's request.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # Generate all quadratic forms Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2.\n    # A form is represented by the tuple (a, b, c).\n    all_forms = []\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Generate the group GL_2(Z/8Z) of invertible 2x2 matrices.\n    gl2_zN = []\n    units = {x for x in range(N) if x % 2 != 0} # Units in Z/8Z are {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    # A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit.\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_zN.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Use a set for efficient lookup and removal of forms.\n    remaining_forms = set(all_forms)\n    class_representatives = []\n\n    # Partition the set of all forms into equivalence classes (orbits).\n    while remaining_forms:\n        # Pick a representative for the next class.\n        q_rep = remaining_forms.pop()\n        class_representatives.append(q_rep)\n        \n        a, b, c = q_rep\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of the representative under the action of GL_2(Z/8Z).\n        orbit = {q_rep}\n        for T in gl2_zN:\n            p, q = T[0]\n            r, s = T[1]\n            \n            # The transformation rule for coefficients is derived from\n            # Q'(x,y) = Q(px+qy, rx+sy).\n            a_new = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % N\n            b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % N\n            c_new = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % N\n            \n            orbit.add((a_new, b_new, c_new))\n            \n        # Remove all forms in the computed orbit from the set of remaining forms.\n        remaining_forms.difference_update(orbit)\n\n    num_classes = len(class_representatives)\n    print(f\"Found {num_classes} equivalence classes.\")\n    \n    # Sort representatives for a consistent, readable output.\n    class_representatives.sort()\n    \n    print(\"\\nA set of representatives for these classes is (in the form ax^2 + bxy + cy^2):\")\n    for a, b, c in class_representatives:\n        terms = []\n        if a != 0:\n            terms.append(f\"{a}x^2\")\n        if b != 0:\n            terms.append(f\"{b}xy\")\n        if c != 0:\n            terms.append(f\"{c}y^2\")\n        \n        if not terms:\n            print(\"0\")\n        else:\n            # Format negative coefficients correctly for modulo arithmetic.\n            print(\" + \".join(terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \"))\n\n    # There is a known formula for the number of classes for Z/(2^k)Z when k>=3.\n    # For Z/8Z, we have k=3.
