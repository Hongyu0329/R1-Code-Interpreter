    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams**: First, I need to identify all the distinct Feynman diagrams for a vacuum-to-vacuum transition at the second order in the coupling constant λ for the φ⁴ theory. The interaction Lagrangian is proportional to λφ⁴, so each vertex has four lines. A second-order process involves two vertices. This means we have a total of 8 line \"stubs\" (4 from each vertex) that must be connected to each other to form propagators, as there are no external lines in a vacuum bubble diagram. I have identified three distinct topologies for these diagrams.\n\n2.  **Calculate Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram**: The symmetry factor (S) of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of ways its lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's structure. I will calculate this for each of the three diagrams.\n    *   **Diagram 1 (The \"Melon\" Diagram)**: This diagram consists of two vertices connected directly to each other by four propagators. Its symmetries come from swapping the two vertices and permuting the four identical propagators.\n    *   **Diagram 2 (The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram)**: This diagram has two vertices, where each vertex has one self-loop (a propagator starting and ending at the same vertex), and the two vertices are connected to each other by two propagators. Its symmetries arise from swapping the vertices, permuting the connecting propagators, and the internal symmetry of the self-loops.\n    *   **Diagram 3 (The Disconnected \"Figure-8s\" Diagram)**: This diagram consists of two separate components, where each component is a single vertex forming two self-loops (a \"figure-8\"). The total symmetry factor involves the internal symmetries of each component and the symmetry of swapping the two identical components.\n\n3.  **Sum the Factors**: Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors calculated for the three diagrams to get the total result.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that calculates each symmetry factor step-by-step, prints out the reasoning and the intermediate values, and then computes and prints the final sum. The final output will include the full equation with the calculated numbers.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for each second-order vacuum bubble diagram\n    in phi^4 scalar field theory and sums them together.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the symmetry factors for the three distinct second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"The total symmetry factor is the sum of the factor for each diagram.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Melon\" Diagram ---\n    # Two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Symmetries:\n    # 1.
