    # Choice A
    print("Analysis of A: Duration of interaction (4-3) >> Duration of feeding (6-5)")

    print("Analysis of B: Duration of feeding (6-5) >> Duration of interaction (4-3)")
    print("Meaning: When the insect is in contact with the plant, it is primarily for feeding.")
    print("Conclusion: Long feeding times maximize the chance of pollen transfer. This is the most effective pattern for pollination. High fitness benefit.\n")

    # Choice C
    print("Analysis of C: Duration of interaction (4-3) >> Duration of investigation (2-1)")
    print("Meaning: The insect spends more time in contact than not in contact.")
    print("Conclusion: This is good, but doesn't specify the contact is for feeding. Moderate fitness benefit.\n")

    # Choice D
    print("Analysis of D: Number of feeding starts per hour (n(5)/hr) >> Number of interaction starts per hour (n(3)/hr)")
    print("Meaning: More feeding events than interaction events.")
    print("Conclusion: This is logically impossible, as feeding (5) is a type of interaction (3). A feeding event cannot occur without an interaction event.\n")
    
    # Choice E
    print("Analysis of E: Number of investigation starts per hour (n(1)/hr) >> Number of interaction starts per hour (n(3)/hr)")
    print("Meaning: The insect investigates far more often than it makes contact.")
    print("Conclusion: An inefficient pollinator that rarely touches the plant. Low fitness benefit.\n")
    
    # Choice F
    print("Analysis of F: Number of interaction starts per hour (n(3)/hr) >> Number of investigation starts per hour (n(1)/hr)")
    print("Meaning: The insect makes contact almost every time it approaches.")
    print("Conclusion: This describes an efficient visitor, but choice B (long feeding duration) is a better indicator of successful pollination than high contact frequency alone.\n")
