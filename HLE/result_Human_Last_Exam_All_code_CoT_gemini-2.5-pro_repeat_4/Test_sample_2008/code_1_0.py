# Given parameters
alpha = 10**16
R = math.log(100 / 99)

# The solvability condition leads to the formula for t_0^2.
# We assume the version of the problem that leads to a real, positive t_0.
# t_0^2 = (2 * alpha) / (R * (e^R - 1))

# Calculate e^R
e_R = math.exp(R)

# Calculate e^R - 1
e_R_minus_1 = e_R - 1

# Calculate t_0^2
t_0_squared_numerator = 2 * alpha
t_0_squared_denominator = R * e_R_minus_1
t_0_squared = t_0_squared_numerator / t_0_squared_denominator

# Calculate the positive value of t_0
t_0 = math.sqrt(t_0_squared)

# The problem asks to output the final equation with numbers
# Let's print the components of the calculation as well for clarity.
