            "required": False,
            "explanation": "This is a measure of overall culture growth and is not a direct input for calculating the specific intracellular flux distribution at a given steady state. Instead, measured rates of substrate uptake and product secretion (e.g., in mmol/gDCW/h) are used."

        "Biomass composition of the organism (i.e. fraction of protein, lipids, and carbohydrates)": {
            "required": True,
            "explanation": "Cellular growth is a major consumer of metabolic precursors. The biomass composition is used to create a 'biomass equation' that quantifies the drain of metabolic building blocks (e.g., amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids) from the central metabolism, which is a critical flux constraint."

        },
        "Regulatory networks": {
            "required": False,
            "explanation": "Similar to kinetics, regulatory networks describe the control logic that leads to a particular metabolic state. They are not required to determine the flux map of that single steady state."
        },
        "Isotope labeling patterns of metabolic intermediates": {
            "required": True,
            "explanation": "This is the core experimental data in 13C MFA. By feeding the cells a 13C-labeled substrate and measuring the resulting labeling patterns in metabolites (like amino acids), we gain powerful constraints that make it possible to resolve fluxes through complex and parallel pathways."
