    Solves the theoretical question about the vertex algebra V(p).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The vertex algebra V(p) is not simple for all p >= 1. A well-known counterexample is for p=1. In this case, the level k = -1, and the resulting algebra V(1) (the so-called triplet model) is a prime example of a logarithmic conformal field theory, which is not simple. It possesses a non-trivial ideal.

    (b) In a vertex algebra like V(p), which has a highest-weight structure, a non-trivial ideal is a proper submodule. Any such submodule is generated by at least one "singular vector" (a highest-weight vector of the submodule). Therefore, a non-trivial ideal must contain a singular vector. This is the fundamental condition for the existence of the ideal.

    (c) Simplicity of V(p) as a vertex algebra means it has no proper ideals (i.e., no V(p)-submodules). Irreducibility as an L_k(sl_2)-module means it has no proper L_k(sl_2)-submodules. Since L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p), the set of V(p)-submodules is a subset of the L_k(sl_2)-submodules. It is possible for V(p) to be reducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module (decomposing into a direct sum of irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules) while still being simple as a vertex algebra, because the action of fields in V(p) but not in L_k(sl_2) can map between these submodules, preventing any of them from being an ideal of V(p). This is indeed the case for V(p) when p >= 2.
