    # 2. The "where" pathway (dorsal stream) is for spatial processing.
    #    Key areas: V3A, MT (V5), Parietal Cortex.
    # 3. Connections can be bidirectional, allowing for feedback loops (e.g., V4 -> V2/V3).
    # 4. A primary information route for one stream does not detour through a core area of the other.
