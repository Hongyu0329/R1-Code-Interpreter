    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we will analyze it by representing the complex number $z$ as $z = x + yi$ and using the definitions of complex arithmetic and exponentiation.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Express the equation in terms of $x$ and $y$.**\n    Let $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The left side of the equation is:\n    $z \\cdot i = (x + yi) \\cdot i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\n\n    The right side of the equation is $i^z$. We use the definition $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\n    The complex logarithm $\\ln(i)$ is multi-valued:\n    $\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Let's denote $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, $\\ln(i) = i\\theta_k$.\n    Now, $i^z = e^{z \\ln i} = e^{(x+yi)(i\\theta_k)} = e^{xi\\theta_k + yi^2\\theta_k} = e^{-y\\theta_k + ix\\theta_k}$.\n    Using Euler's formula, $e^{a+bi} = e^a(\\cos b + i \\sin b)$:\n    $i^z = e^{-y\\theta_k}(\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i\\sin(x\\theta_k))$.\n\n2.  **Equate the real and imaginary parts.**\n    By setting $-y + xi = e^{-y\\theta_k}(\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i\\sin(x\\theta_k))$, we get a system of two real equations:\n    (1) Real part: $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(x\\theta_k)$\n    (2) Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(x\\theta_k)$\n\n3.  **Solve for real solutions ($y=0$).**\n    If $y=0$, the system becomes:\n    (1) $0 = \\cos(x\\theta_k)$\n    (2) $x = \\sin(x\\theta_k)$\n    From (1), $x\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n    This implies $\\sin(x\\theta_k) = \\pm 1$.\n    Substituting this into (2), we get $x = \\pm 1$.\n    -   If $x=1$: From (2), we need $\\sin(\\theta_k)=1$. This requires $n$ to be even ($n=2m$), so $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$. Substituting $\\theta_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we get $k=m$. This holds for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n    -   If $x=-1$: From (2), we need $\\sin(-\\theta_k)=-1$, which is $-\\sin(\\theta_k)=-1$ or $\\sin(\\theta_k)=1$. This again holds for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    We can verify these:\n    -   $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. Correct.\n    -   $z=-1$: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. Correct.\n\n4.  **Solve for purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$).**\n    If $x=0$, the system becomes:\n    (1) $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(0) = e^{-y\\theta_k}$\n    (2) $0 = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(0)$, which is $0=0$.\n    We need to solve $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}$. This can be solved using the Lambert W function, which is defined by $W(c)e^{W(c)}=c$.\n    Rearranging the equation: $-y e^{y\\theta_k} = 1 \\implies y\\theta_k e^{y\\theta_k} = -\\theta_k$.\n    This is in the form $X e^X = C$ with $X=y\\theta_k$ and $C=-\\theta_k$.\n    So, $y\\theta_k = W(-\\theta_k)$, which gives $y = \\frac{W(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$.\n    For $y$ to be a real number, the argument of the Lambert W function, $-\\theta_k$, must be $\\ge -1/e$.\n    -   For $k \\ge 0$, $\\theta_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k) > 0$. Then $-\\theta_k < 0$. The condition is $-\\theta_k \\ge -1/e$, or $\\theta_k \\le 1/e$. This is not satisfied for any $k \\ge 0$ since $\\pi/2 \\approx 1.57 > 1/e \\approx 0.368$. So no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n    -   For $k \\le -1$, $\\theta_k < 0$, so $-\\theta_k > 0$. The Lambert W function $W(c)$ has a single real value for any $c>0$. Therefore, a unique real solution for $y$ exists for each negative integer $k$.\n\n5.  **Other solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$).**\n    A more detailed analysis (which is beyond the scope of this explanation but can be found in mathematical literature) shows that there are no other solutions.\n\nThe solutions are therefore $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$. The following Python code calculates the first few imaginary solutions and verifies all found solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and verifies solutions to the equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the complex equation: z * i = i^z\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"Found two real solutions:\")\n    \n    # Solution z = 1\n    z1 = 1.0\n    lhs1 = z1 * 1j\n    # For z=1 or z=-1, the principal value of i^z is sufficient\n    rhs1 = 1j**z1\n    print(f\"\\n1.
