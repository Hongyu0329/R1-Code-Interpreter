The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k=iy_k$ for each integer $k \le -1$. The values of $y_k$ are given by the formula $y_k = W(\pi(2|k| - 1/2)) / (\pi(1/2 - 2|k|))$, where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. The provided Python code calculates and verifies the first few of these imaginary solutions.
