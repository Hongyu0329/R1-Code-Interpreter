    "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of duality. This principle states that finding an observer canonical form for a system `(A, C)` is dual to finding the controller canonical form for the system `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)`. Once we find the controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` for the dual system, the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` for the original system is given by `A_o = A_cᵀ` and `C_o = B_cᵀ`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: Given the original system matrices `A` and `C`, we define the dual system with matrices `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\n2.  **Determine Controllability Indices**: We will check the controllability of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` by forming the controllability matrix `W_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...]`, where `b1` and `b2` are the columns of `B_d`. By selecting linearly independent columns in order, we determine the controllability indices, `μ₁` and `μ₂`.\n3.  **Construct the Transformation Matrix**: A transformation matrix `T` is constructed that will transform the dual system into controller canonical form. This matrix is built using specific rows from the inverse of a reordered controllability matrix `S = [b1, A_d*b1, ..., b2, ...]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Canonical Form**: We compute the new input matrix for the dual system in controller canonical form using `B_c = T * B_d`.\n5.  **Find the Observer Canonical `C_o`**: Using duality, the new output matrix `C_o` for the original system in observer canonical form is the transpose of `B_c`, i.e., `C_o = B_cᵀ`.\n6.  **Output the Result**: Finally, we will print the resulting matrix `C_o` and the corresponding output equations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_observer_canonical_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Original system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    print(\"Original System Matrices:\")\n    print(\"A = \\n\", A)\n    print(\"C = \\n\", C)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 1.
