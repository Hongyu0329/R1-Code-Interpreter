# Description of the Task:
# The user wants to find the "True Avalanche" for the description: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# The avalanche must use the word "computer".
# A true avalanche involves repeating a pattern of syllables.

# Step 1: Analyze the core components.
# - The word to be repeated phonetically is "computer" (com-pu-ter).
# - The description requires the phrase to mean a computer is instructing a bird to relieve itself.

# Step 2: Evaluate the options based on phonetics and meaning.
# A. Computers comp few urns
#    - Phonetics: "comp few urns" is a weak match for "computer".
#    - Meaning: Does not match the description.
#
# B. Computer: "Come poo, tern!"
#    - Phonetics: "Come poo, tern" is a very strong phonetic match for "com-pu-ter".
#    - Meaning: Perfectly matches the description. A computer tells a "tern" (a bird) to "poo".
#
# C. Computer: "Come, pee you turkey!"
#    - Phonetics: "Come, pee you turkey" does not sound like "computer".
#    - Meaning: The theme is correct, but the phonetic requirement is not met.
#
# D. Comb pewter computer
#    - Phonetics: "Comb pewter" is a strong match for "computer".
#    - Meaning: Does not match the description about software and birds.
#
# E. Computer needs bird relieves
#    - Phonetics: Not an avalanche.
#    - Meaning: Does not match the description.

# Step 3: Conclude the best choice.
# Choice B is the only one that satisfies both the phonetic puzzle and the meaning given in the description.

# The final answer is B.
print("The chosen answer is B because 'Come poo, tern!' is a strong phonetic repetition of 'computer' and its meaning perfectly matches the description of a computer telling a bird where to relieve itself.")
