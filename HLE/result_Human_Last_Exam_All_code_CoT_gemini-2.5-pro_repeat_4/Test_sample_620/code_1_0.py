    print("\n[1] The Observation:")
    print("The Product vs. Time plot is not linear, suggesting the reaction rate is not constant.")

    print("\n[2] Key Information:")
    print(" - The enzyme is an 'obligate dimer', meaning it's only active when two subunits join together.")
    print(" - The assay is chilled on ice before starting the measurement.")

    print("\n[3] The Hypothesis:")
    print("Chilling on ice can cause protein dimers to separate into inactive single units (monomers).")
    print("When the reaction starts, these monomers must slowly re-combine to form the active enzyme.")
    print("This slow activation causes a 'lag phase', where the reaction rate increases over time, resulting in a non-linear curve.")

    print("\n[4] Evaluating the Solutions based on the equilibrium: 2 Monomers <--> 1 Active Dimer")
    print("A. Increase Temperature: Risky, could cause enzyme denaturation. Not the most direct solution.")
    print("B. Decrease Temperature: Would make the problem worse by favoring more inactive monomers.")
    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the total protein concentration will push the equilibrium towards the formation of the active dimer. This will shorten the lag phase and help achieve a linear rate.")
    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: Would make the problem worse by favoring inactive monomers.")

    print("\n[5] Conclusion:")
    print("The most effective troubleshooting step is to increase the enzyme concentration.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice: C")
