# Step 1: Define the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# The graph of Asian countries is a planar graph. By the Four Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# Due to the high complexity of borders, especially involving the USSR, China, Afghanistan, and others, the graph required 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before 1991, chi_before, was {chi_before}.")

# Step 2: Define the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# The dissolution replaced the single USSR node with multiple new, interconnected Central Asian nation nodes.
# This did not simplify the graph; it remains a complex planar graph still requiring 4 colors to be mapped.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after 1991, chi_after, is {chi_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change.
# This represents the difference in chromatic number before and after the event.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta based on the change in planarity.
# A graph based on a geographical map is planar. The new map of Asia after 1991 is still a geographical map.
# Therefore, the graph's fundamental property of being planar did not change.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta is {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate and print the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
