    "The primary difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips.\n\n*   **Vaganova Method:** This method emphasizes maintaining square hips throughout the cambré. The goal is to isolate the bend in the upper and middle back, demonstrating pure spinal flexibility and control while keeping the pelvis stable and facing forward.\n\n*   **Balanchine Method:** In the Balanchine style, the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift and open. This \"breaking\" at the hip creates a more dynamic and angular line, often allowing for what appears to be a deeper or more extreme backbend. This is a characteristic feature of the Balanchine aesthetic, which prioritizes speed, length of line, and visual dynamics over the strict anatomical alignment of the Vaganova method.\n\nWhile other elements like the degree of the backbend or head placement might look different as a result, the foundational, technical difference is the action of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
