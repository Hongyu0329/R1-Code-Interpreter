    "To find the number of triangles on the outer hull of a great icosahedron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the outer hull:** The outer hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is the smallest convex shape that contains all of its vertices. The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Count the faces of the outer hull:** The question asks for the number of triangles needed for triangulating this outer hull. Since the outer hull is a regular icosahedron, and a regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 triangular faces, the surface is already perfectly triangulated.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The minimal number of triangles is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe following Python code defines this value and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces.\n# The faces of a regular icosahedron are equilateral triangles.\nnum_faces_icosahedron = 20\n\n# The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# Therefore, the number of visible triangles on the surface of the great icosahedron's\n# outer-hull is equal to the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Number of triangles = {num_faces_icosahedron}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
