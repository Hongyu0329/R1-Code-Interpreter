def find_first_oscar_winner_with_luxor_obelisk():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the first Best Picture Oscar winner
    to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.
    2. Reviewing the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, we look for the first film
       set in either of these cities.
    3. The film 'The Life of Emile Zola' won the award for the year 1937.
    4. This film is a biopic about the French writer and is set in Paris. It features
       scenes at the Place de la Concorde, where the Paris Luxor Obelisk is located.
    5. No earlier Best Picture winner features either Luxor or Paris.
