    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a composite system made by joining two topological systems (like the two Chern insulators), the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, assuming the gap doesn't close at the interface.\n2.  **Define the given values:** We have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n3.  **Perform the calculation:** Add the Chern numbers of the two insulators together to find the Chern number of the junction.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** Write a simple script to declare the individual Chern numbers, calculate their sum, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators.\nchern_insulator_1 = 1\nchern_insulator_2 = 1\n\n# Step 2: The Chern number of a junction of two topological systems is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_insulator_1 + chern_insulator_2\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\n# The final equation will show the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is calculated by summing the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {chern_insulator_1} + {chern_insulator_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
