    "Here is a plan to solve the integral $I=\\int_0^{\\pi}{(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})}dx$:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Integrand**: The term $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ looks complex. I will simplify it using trigonometric identities. A key insight is to show that this term is equal to $\\arctan(\\sin x)$.\n2.  **Rewrite the Integral**: With the simplified term, the integral becomes $I = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc(x) \\arctan(\\sin x) dx$.\n3.  **Apply Feynman's Trick**: To solve this new integral, I will use the technique of differentiation under the integral sign (also known as Feynman's trick). I will define a parameterized integral $I(a) = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\csc(x) \\arctan(a \\sin x) dx$. The original integral $I$ is the value of $I(1)$.\n4.  **Differentiate and Integrate**: I will differentiate $I(a)$ with respect to the parameter `a`. This results in a simpler integral, $I'(a) = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{1}{1+a^2\\sin^2 x} dx$, which can be solved using standard integration techniques.\n5.  **Solve for I(1)**: After finding a closed-form expression for $I'(a)$, I will integrate it from $a=0$ to $a=1$ to find the value of $I(1)$. Since $I(0) = 0$, we have $I(1) = \\int_0^1 I'(a) da$.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The resulting integral for $I(1)$ is $\\pi \\int_0^1 \\frac{da}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}$, which evaluates to a well-known logarithmic form.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral I = integral from 0 to pi of csc(x) * acsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) dx.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, a = sp.symbols('x a')\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Simplify the integrand\n    # We will show that acsc(sqrt(1 + csc(x)^2)) = atan(sin(x)).\n    # Let alpha = atan(sin(x)).
