**Reaction Analysis and Product Identification**

**1. Starting Material to Product A**

*   **Starting Material:** [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene
*   **Reaction:** The starting material is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base. The reaction conditions (strong base, secondary alkyl halide) favor an E2 elimination reaction.
*   **Mechanism & Product A:** The bulky t-BuOK base preferentially abstracts a proton from the least sterically hindered β-carbon. In this case, the primary hydrogens on the terminal methyl group (C4) are more accessible than the secondary hydrogen on C2. This regioselectivity leads to the formation of the Hofmann (less substituted) product.
*   **Product A is 4-phenylbut-1-ene.** The reaction eliminates HBr and forms a double bond, destroying the original stereocenter. Product A is achiral.
    *   **Structure:** Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂

**2. Product A to Product B**

*   **Reaction:** Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane in THF (1. BH₃·THF) followed by oxidation (2. H₂O₂, NaOH). This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction.
*   **Mechanism & Product B:** This reaction adds H and OH across the double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) adds to the less substituted carbon of the alkene.
*   **Product B is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.** The OH group adds to the terminal carbon (C1) of the butene chain. This product is a primary alcohol and is achiral.
    *   **Structure:** Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-OH

**3. Product B to Product C**

*   **Reaction:** Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr₃).
*   **Mechanism & Product C:** PBr₃ is a standard reagent for converting primary and secondary alcohols into alkyl bromides. The hydroxyl group is substituted with a bromine atom.
*   **Product C is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.**
    *   **Structure:** Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Br

**Conclusion: Identity and Chirality of Final Product C**

*   **IUPAC Name:** The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.
*   **Chirality:** The final product is **achiral**. The original chiral center in the starting material was destroyed in the first elimination step. No new chiral centers were created in the subsequent reactions. The resulting molecule, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, does not have any stereocenters.
