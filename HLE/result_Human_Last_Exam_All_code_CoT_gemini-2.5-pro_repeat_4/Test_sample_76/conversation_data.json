    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  The problem asks for the number of integer values of `x` for which the expression `P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056` is a perfect square.\n2.  Let `P(x) = y^2` for some non-negative integer `y`. We need to find the number of integer solutions `x`.\n3.  I will analyze the behavior of the polynomial `P(x)` for large positive and negative values of `x`.\n    *   For large negative `x` (e.g., `x < -10`), the `x^3` term dominates and is negative, making `P(x)` negative. A negative number cannot be a perfect square.\n    *   For large positive `x`, it can be shown that `P(x)` lies strictly between two consecutive squares of polynomials, and thus cannot be a perfect square itself. While the full proof is complex, it gives confidence that we only need to search up to a certain limit.\n4.  Based on this analysis, the integer solutions for `x` must be within a finite range.\n5.  I will write a Python script to search for these integer solutions within a reasonable range (e.g., from -100 to 10000). This range is chosen to be safely large enough to contain all solutions.\n6.  For each integer `x` in this range, the script will:\n    a. Calculate the value of `P(x)`.\n    b. Check if `P(x)` is non-negative.\n    c. If it is, check if it is a perfect square. A number `n` is a perfect square if its square root is an integer.\n7.  The script will collect all values of `x` that satisfy the condition and print them.\n8.  Finally, the script will print the total count of such integers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    # We search in a range.
