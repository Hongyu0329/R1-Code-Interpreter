    print("1. A 'ring graph' is a cycle graph (e.g., a triangle, square, etc.). A cycle graph must be connected, and every vertex in it must have a degree of exactly 2. By standard definition, a cycle must have at least 3 vertices.")
    
    print("\n2. The associate graph AG(Z_n) has the nonzero elements {1, 2, ..., n-1} as vertices. Two vertices a and b are adjacent if they are associates, meaning a = b*u (mod n) for some unit u in Z_n.")
    
    print("\n3. The 'associate' relation is an equivalence relation. This means the graph AG(Z_n) is partitioned into equivalence classes, where each class forms a clique (a complete subgraph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex). Therefore, AG(Z_n) is a disjoint union of cliques.")
    
    print("\n4. For AG(Z_n) to be a ring graph, it must be connected. Since it's a disjoint union of cliques, this is only possible if there is exactly one clique. This happens if and only if all non-zero elements of Z_n are associates of each other. This is true if and only if Z_n is a field, which requires n to be a prime number.")
    
    print("\n5. If n is a prime number, AG(Z_n) is a single clique with n-1 vertices, which we denote as K_{n-1}.")
    
    print("\n6. For this graph to also be a ring graph, every vertex must have a degree of 2. In a clique K_{n-1}, every vertex has a degree of (n-1)-1 = n-2.")
    
    print("\n7. Setting the degree equal to 2 gives the equation: n - 2 = 2, which implies n = 4.")
    
    print("\n8. We have a contradiction: Step 4 requires n to be a prime number. Step 7 requires n to be 4. However, 4 is not a prime number. Therefore, there is no integer n that can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.")
    
    print("\nConclusion: There are no integer values of n for which the graph AG(Z_n) is a ring graph.")
