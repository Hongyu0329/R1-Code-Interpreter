    "My plan is to solve this multi-part query by first addressing the trivia question and then incorporating the answer into a script that follows all the user's specific formatting rules.\n\n1.  **Identify the Film:** The user is asking for an Oscar-nominated film where a character says \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which seals their fate. The film that matches this specific scene is **L.A. Confidential** (1997). In the movie, Detective Ed Exley is searching for a witness and calls a number. The witness, a male prostitute, is leaving town and answers the phone while boarding a bus. When Exley ends the call, the witness reflexively says \"Thank you,\" confirming his identity to the detective.\n\n2.  **Adhere to Coding Constraints:** The user requires the answer to be delivered within a Python code block. The code must use the `print` function for output.\n\n3.  **Incorporate the \"Equation\" Rule:** The user has a unique rule: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". To satisfy this, I will create a simple equation related to the film's release year (1997). The script will print this equation, making sure to show each number.\n\nBy combining these steps, I will provide a correct answer to the trivia question while strictly following the user's instructions for the format of the response.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film based on the user's query and\n    prints the answer along with an equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the information about the film.\n    movie_title = \"L.A. Confidential\"\n    release_year = 1997\n\n    # Step 2: Print the answer to the user's trivia question.\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is '{movie_title}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Fulfill the requirement to output an equation with numbers.\n    # The equation will be based on the film's release year.\n    num1 = 1900\n    num2 = 97\n    result = release_year  # 1900 + 97 = 1997\n\n    # The final code must output each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"As requested, here is an equation featuring the film's release year:\")\n    print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nsolve_movie_riddle()\n```\n<<<L.A. Confidential>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
