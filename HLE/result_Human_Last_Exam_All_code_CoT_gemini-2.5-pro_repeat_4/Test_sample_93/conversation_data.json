    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach. The strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find Unique Combinations:** We first search for all unique sets of 5 non-negative integers `{x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}` whose squares sum to 2024. To avoid duplicates and to make the search efficient, we enforce an ordering `0 <= x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5`.\n\n2.  **Optimize the Search:** The search space can be significantly reduced by calculating tight upper bounds for each variable within the loops. For instance, since `5 * x1^2 <= x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024`, `x1` cannot be larger than `sqrt(2024/5)`. Similar bounds are applied to `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Permutations:** For each unique combination found, the numbers are not necessarily distinct. For example, a combination could be `{a, a, b, c, d}`. Since the original equation involves distinct variables ($x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$), the order matters. We need to calculate the number of distinct permutations for each combination. This is done using the formula for permutations with repetitions: `n! / (c1! * c2! * ... * ck!)`, where `n` is the total number of items (5 in our case) and `c1, c2, ...` are the counts of each unique number in the combination.\n\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all unique combinations found.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will iterate through the possibilities, print the equation for each unique combination found, and finally output the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_sum_of_squares_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to\n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n    found_combinations = []\n\n    # Iterate to find unique combinations (x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5)\n    # The upper bounds of the loops are optimized for efficiency.\n    for x1 in range(int(math.sqrt(target / 5)) + 1):\n        s1 = x1**2\n        for x2 in range(x1, int(math.sqrt((target - s1) / 4)) + 1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2**2\n            for x3 in range(x2, int(math.sqrt((target - s2) / 3)) + 1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3**2\n                for x4 in range(x3, int(math.sqrt((target - s3) / 2)) + 1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4**2\n                    \n                    # Check if the remainder is a perfect square\n                    x5_squared = target - s4\n                    if x5_squared >= 0:\n                        x5 = math.sqrt(x5_squared)\n                        if x5 == int(x5):\n                            x5 = int(x5)\n                            # Ensure the non-decreasing order\n                            if x5 >= x4:\n                                combination = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                                found_combinations.append(combination)\n                                \n                                # Calculate the number of distinct permutations\n                                counts = Counter(combination)\n                                denominator = 1\n                                for count in counts.values():\n                                    denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n                                \n                                permutations = math.factorial(5) // denominator\n                                total_solutions += permutations\n\n    print(\"The unique non-decreasing combinations (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) found are:\")\n    for sol in found_combinations:\n        print(f\"{sol[0]}^2 + {sol[1]}^2 + {sol[2]}^2 + {sol[3]}^2 + {sol[4]}^2 = 2024\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of non-negative integer solutions is: {total_solutions}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_sum_of_squares_solutions()\n```\n<<<840>>>"
