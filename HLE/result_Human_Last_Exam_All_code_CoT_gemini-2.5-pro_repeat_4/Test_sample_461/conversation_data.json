    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  Identify the key elements of the question: \"polycyclic hydrocarbon,\" \"named after a creature,\" and \"extinct for over 65 million years.\"\n2.  The time frame \"over 65 million years\" strongly suggests a creature from the Mesozoic Era, like a dinosaur or a related reptile.\n3.  I will search for polycyclic hydrocarbons with names derived from such creatures.\n4.  The most famous example that fits this description is Pterodactyladiene, named after the Pterodactyl.\n5.  I will write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the creature, a flying reptile from the Mesozoic Era.\n    creature_name = \"Pterodactyl\"\n\n    # The name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon is derived from the creature's name.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n\n    # The extinction event that wiped out these creatures happened around 66 million years ago.\n    extinction_age_in_millions = 65\n\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon you're looking for is named {hydrocarbon_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It is named after the {creature_name}, a creature that has been extinct for over {extinction_age_in_millions} million years.\")\n\nfind_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
