# The problem is to compute the partial derivative D_x rho(alpha, beta).
# Based on the analysis, this derivative at a point (x,y) is given by the formula:
# D_x rho = -5*u^4 / (1 + 5*u^4),
# where u is the x-coordinate of the nearest point on the curve y=x^5.

# For the point (alpha, beta), the nearest point on the curve is (1,1).
# So, we need to evaluate the expression at u=1.
u = 1

# Calculate the numerator of the fraction.
numerator = -5 * u**4

# Calculate the denominator of the fraction.
denominator = 1 + 5 * u**4

# Use the fractions module to represent the result as a fraction of two integers.
result_fraction = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator)
