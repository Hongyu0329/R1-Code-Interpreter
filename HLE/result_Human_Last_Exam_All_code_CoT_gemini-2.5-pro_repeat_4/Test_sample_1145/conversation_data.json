    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional box. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the Formula:** The probability of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval. For a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wave function is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`. Therefore, the probability density is `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n\n2.  **Set Up the Integral:** We are given:\n    *   The quantum state `n = 2`.\n    *   The interval `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n    The integral to solve is:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx`\n\n3.  **Simplify and Solve:** The length of the box, `a`, cancels out during the integration. We can let `y = x/a`, which transforms the integral into `∫[from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(2*π*y) dy`. This is a standard definite integral.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to compute this definite integral numerically.\n    *   Import the necessary libraries: `numpy` for mathematical functions and `scipy.integrate.quad` for high-precision numerical integration.\n    *   Define the integrand function `2 * sin²(2*π*y)`.\n    *   Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to calculate the integral over the interval `[0.495, 0.505]`.\n    *   Print the equation with the specific values and the final calculated probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the parameters for the calculation\nn = 2\nx1_factor = 0.495\nx2_factor = 0.505\n\n# The probability density function for a particle in a 1D box is P(x) = (2/a)*sin^2(n*pi*x/a).\n# To calculate the probability of finding the particle in the interval [x1, x2],\n# we integrate P(x) from x1 to x2.\n# By substituting y = x/a, the integral becomes independent of 'a':\n# Probability = Integral from y1 to y2 of 2*sin^2(n*pi*y) dy\n# where y1 = x1/a and y2 = x2/a.\n\ndef integrand(y, n_val):\n  \"\"\"\n  The integrand for the probability calculation, 2 * sin^2(n*pi*y).\n  y is the normalized position x/a.\n  n_val is the quantum state n.\n  \"\"\"\n  return 2 * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * y))**2\n\n# Perform the numerical integration\n# quad returns a tuple (integral_value, error_estimate)\nprobability, error = quad(integrand, x1_factor, x2_factor, args=(n,))\n\n# Output the results, showing the equation being solved\nprint(\"For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a':\")\nprint(f\"The probability for the state n={n} in the interval [{x1_factor}a, {x2_factor}a] is calculated by the definite integral:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1_factor}a to {x2_factor}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nThis evaluates to:\")\nprint(f\"{probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579739543058867e-06>>>"
