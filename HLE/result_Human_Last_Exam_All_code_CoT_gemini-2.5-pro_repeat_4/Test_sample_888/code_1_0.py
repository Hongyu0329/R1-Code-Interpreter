# Constants determined from the problem analysis
# K is inferred to be 1 as the function being expanded is f(x)=1
K = 1
# K1, K2, K3, K4 are determined by comparing the derived formula for the coefficient A_m with the given one.
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# Calculate the product
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Print the final equation with all the numbers
print(f"The calculation is: {K} * {K1} * {K2} * {K3} * {K4} = {product}")
