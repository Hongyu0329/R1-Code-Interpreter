    "My plan is to address the two problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems, by demonstrating them conceptually using a Python script. The script will be divided into two parts:\n\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification:** I will simulate the process of justification with a recursive function. This will show how requiring every belief to be justified by another belief can lead to an infinite regress, where no belief is ever truly grounded, making the 'Justified' condition problematic.\n\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of Truth:** I will model two distinct perspectives: the subjective agent who holds beliefs, and an objective reality which they cannot directly access. The script will show that an agent can have a perfectly 'justified' belief that is nonetheless false. This highlights that the 'Truth' condition of JTB is an external requirement that the agent can never be certain they have met.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates two fundamental problems with the\n    Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier-style problems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification ---\n    print(\"--- Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification ---\")\n    print(\"JTB requires a belief to be 'Justified'.

If every justification needs another justification, it leads to an infinite regress where no belief is ever fundamentally grounded. JTB does not solve how to end this chain. 2. **The Inaccessibility of Truth**: The 'Truth' condition is an objective, external requirement. However, a person can only form subjective justifications for a belief and has no independent, infallible method to confirm that their belief perfectly corresponds to objective reality. A very strong justification can still support a false belief, and from the believer's perspective, this is indistinguishable from knowledge.>>>"
