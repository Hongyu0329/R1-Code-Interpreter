The two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge (ignoring Gettier cases) are: 1. **The Regress Problem of Justification**: The requirement for justification is not self-sufficient. If every justification needs another justification, it leads to an infinite regress where no belief is ever fundamentally grounded. JTB does not solve how to end this chain. 2. **The Inaccessibility of Truth**: The 'Truth' condition is an objective, external requirement. However, a person can only form subjective justifications for a belief and has no independent, infallible method to confirm that their belief perfectly corresponds to objective reality. A very strong justification can still support a false belief, and from the believer's perspective, this is indistinguishable from knowledge.
