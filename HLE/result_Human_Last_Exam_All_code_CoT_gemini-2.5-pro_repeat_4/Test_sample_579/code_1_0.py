    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's key clinical information.
    # - Age/Sex: 64-year-old woman
    # - Risk Factors:
    #   - BMI of 39 (Class II Obesity) - a major risk factor for skin fold issues and HS.
    #   - Smoker (for 15 years) - a strong, independent risk factor for Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
    #   - History of type 2 diabetes and immunosuppressant use (cyclophosphamide) can complicate skin conditions.
    # - Physical Examination Findings:
    #   - Location: Lesions are in classic intertriginous (skin fold) areas: axillary (armpits), inframammary (under breasts), and inguinal (groin).
    #   - Morphology (Lesion Type):
    #     - Axilla: Large bullae (blisters, but in this context could be large, tense abscesses).
    #     - Inframammary: Erythematous skin regions with plaques.
    #     - Inguinal: Purulent nodules (pus-filled lumps).

    # Step 2: Evaluate the differential diagnoses based on the findings.

    # A. Malignant Intertrigo: This is a rare malignancy mimicking intertrigo. While the patient has cancer history, this diagnosis does not typically account for purulent nodules across multiple sites.

    # B. Allergic contact dermatitis: This would present as an itchy, eczematous rash (vesicles, erythema, scaling). It does not cause deep, purulent nodules.

    # C. Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): This is the most likely diagnosis.
    #    - Location: HS classically affects apocrine gland-bearing skin in the axillary, inguinal, and inframammary regions. The patient's lesions are in all three of these areas.
    #    - Morphology: The hallmark of HS is recurrent, deep-seated, painful, and purulent nodules and abscesses. The "purulent nodules" in the inguinal region are a classic sign. The "large bullae" in the axilla are likely large abscesses, and the "plaques" in the inframammary folds can result from chronic, coalescing inflammation.
    #    - Risk Factors: The patient's obesity and smoking history are major risk factors for HS.

    # D. Atopic dermatitis: This is a form of eczema, usually starting in childhood. It does not present with purulent nodules.

    # E. Psoriasis: Inverse psoriasis affects skin folds, but it presents as well-demarcated, shiny red plaques, typically without scales. It does not cause purulent nodules.

    # Step 3: Conclude based on the evidence.
    # The clinical picture, including the specific locations (axillary, inguinal, inframammary), the key lesion type (purulent nodules), and the patient's significant risk factors (obesity and smoking), strongly points to a diagnosis of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.

    # Step 4: Output the final answer.
