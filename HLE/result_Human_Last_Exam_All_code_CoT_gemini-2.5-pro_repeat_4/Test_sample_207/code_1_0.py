    # The original C code is unstable because it prints a memory address that

    # format string ("%d...") and the address of `n` as the argument.
    
    # The minimal fix is to add a single character to the source code.
    # By changing `printf(s, s);` to `printf(s, *s);`, we dereference the pointer.
    
    # The new call becomes `printf("%d", *s)`.
    # The `process` function sets the first byte of `n` (which is `*s`) to 37.
    # Therefore, the program will stably print the value 37.

    The problem is fixed by adding {z} character to the `printf` call.
    The added character is '{C}'.
    The original line `printf(s, s);` becomes `printf(s, *s);`.
    This changes the argument from the unstable memory address `s` to the stable value `*s`, which is 37.
