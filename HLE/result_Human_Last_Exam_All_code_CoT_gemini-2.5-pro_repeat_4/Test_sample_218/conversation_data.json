    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Theory**: The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For this problem, we are interested in $S_{25}$, so we need to consider the partitions of 25.\n\n2.  **Dimension Formula**: The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n    $$ \\dim(\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{i,j}} $$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Algorithm**: My approach will be to:\n    a. Generate every unique partition of the integer 25.\n    b. For each partition, construct its corresponding Young diagram conceptually.\n    c. For each cell in the diagram, calculate its hook length.\n    d. Compute the product of all hook lengths.\n    e. Calculate the dimension using the formula: $25! / (\\text{product of hook lengths})$.\n    f. Check if this dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    g. Count the number of partitions that satisfy this condition.\n\n4.  **Implementation**:\n    *   I will write a Python function to generate all partitions of 25. A recursive generator is a clear and suitable choice for this.\n    *   I will write another function that takes a partition and calculates the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the hook-length formula. Python's `math.factorial` and arbitrary-precision integers are well-suited for handling the large numbers involved (like $25!$).\n    *   The main part of the script will loop through all partitions, calculate their dimensions, and count how many are below the 500,000 threshold.\n    *   To fulfill the prompt's request to \"output each number\", I will print the details of each qualifying partition and its dimension before printing the final total count.\n\nThis plan will systematically find all the required irreps and provide the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the \n    symmetric group S_25 with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    n = 25\n    dimension_limit = 500000\n\n    def partitions_generator(target, max_val=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates all integer partitions of 'target' in non-increasing order.\n        This is a recursive generator, which is clear and sufficient for n=25.\n        \"\"\"\n        if max_val is None:\n            max_val = target\n        \n        if target == 0:\n            yield []\n            return\n        \n        # Iterate from the largest possible part down to 1\n        for i in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            # Find partitions for the remainder, with parts no larger than the current part 'i'\n            for p in partitions_generator(target - i, i):\n                yield [i] + p\n\n    def calculate_dimension(partition):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimension of the irrep for a given partition using the\n        hook-length formula: dim(lambda) = n! / product_of_all_hook_lengths.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Python's math.factorial can handle large numbers.\n        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n        \n        hook_product = 1\n        for i, part_len in enumerate(partition):\n            for j in range(part_len):\n                # Calculate the hook length for the cell (i, j) in the Young diagram.\n                # The indices i and j are 0-based.\n                \n                # Number of boxes to the right in the same row\n                boxes_right = part_len - (j + 1)\n                \n                # Number of boxes below in the same column\n                boxes_below = 0\n                for l in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                    if partition[l] >= j + 1:\n                        boxes_below += 1\n                    else:\n                        # Since the partition parts are sorted, we can stop early.\n                        break\n                \n                # The hook length is the sum of boxes to the right, boxes below,\n                # plus 1 for the cell itself.\n                hook_length = boxes_right + boxes_below + 1\n                hook_product *= hook_length\n                \n        # The dimension is n! divided by the product of all hook lengths.\n        # We use integer division // as the result is always an integer.\n        dimension = n_factorial // hook_product\n        return dimension\n\n    count = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Finding irreps of S_{n} with dimension < {dimension_limit}...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for p in partitions_generator(n):\n        dim = calculate_dimension(p)\n        if dim < dimension_limit:\n            count += 1\n            # \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as showing\n            # the details for each irrep that meets the criteria.\n            print(f\"Irrep for partition {str(p):<78} has dimension: {dim}\")\n            \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Total number of irreducible representations of S_25 with dimension less than {dimension_limit} is: {count}\")\n\nsolve_s25_irreps()\n<<<38>>>"
