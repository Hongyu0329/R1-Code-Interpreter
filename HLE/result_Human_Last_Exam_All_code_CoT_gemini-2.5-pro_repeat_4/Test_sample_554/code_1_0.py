# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar (C86H56).
num_hydrogen_atoms = 56

# Step 2: In a perfluorinated compound, every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms

# Step 3: Print the logic and the final answer.
# The hypothetical chemical formula would change from C86H56 to C86F56.
