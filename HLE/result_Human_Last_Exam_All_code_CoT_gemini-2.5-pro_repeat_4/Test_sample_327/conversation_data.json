    "To determine the number of pieces required to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we will follow the standard method for representing dyadic rational numbers (fractions where the denominator is a power of 2).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Decompose the Number**: First, we separate the number into its integer part and its fractional part.\n    *   Number = Integer Part + Fractional Part.\n2.  **Calculate Pieces for the Integer Part**: The number of pieces needed to represent the integer part `I` is simply its absolute value, `|I|`. If `I` is positive, these pieces are red; if negative, they are blue. If `I` is zero, no pieces are needed for the integer part.\n3.  **Calculate Pieces for the Fractional Part**: The fractional part is a value between 0 and 1. For a fraction of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$ (in its simplest form), its representation requires `n` pieces. The value of `n` can be found by taking the base-2 logarithm of the denominator. Each of these `n` pieces corresponds to a digit in the binary expansion of the fraction.\n4.  **Sum for Total Pieces**: The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces required for the integer and fractional parts.\n\n### Applying the Plan to $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n1.  **Decomposition**:\n    *   Integer Part: $\\lfloor \\frac{13}{16} \\rfloor = 0$.\n    *   Fractional Part: $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  **Pieces for Integer Part**: The integer part is 0, so the number of pieces is `0`.\n3.  **Pieces for Fractional Part**: The denominator is $16$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we will need `4` pieces for the fractional part. (This corresponds to the four digits in the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$, which is $0.1101_2$).\n4.  **Total Pieces**: Total = (Pieces for integer part) + (Pieces for fractional part) = $0 + 4 = 4$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces needed to represent a dyadic rational\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given number is 13/16.\n    num = 13\n    den = 16\n\n    # 1. Calculate the number of pieces for the integer part.\n    # This is the absolute value of the integer part of the number.\n    integer_part = num // den\n    integer_pieces = abs(integer_part)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the number of pieces for the fractional part.\n    # For a fraction m/(2^n), this is 'n'. 'n' is the base-2 log of the denominator.\n    # We first verify the denominator is a power of two.\n    if not (den > 0 and (den & (den - 1) == 0)):\n        print(f\"Error: The denominator {den} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    fractional_pieces = int(math.log2(den))\n\n    # 3. The total number of pieces is the sum of the two parts.\n    total_pieces = integer_pieces + fractional_pieces\n    \n    # Print the final equation showing how the total is calculated.\n    print(f\"To represent the number {num}/{den}:\")\n    print(f\"Pieces for integer part ({integer_part}) + Pieces for fractional part (from denominator {den}) = Total Pieces\")\n    print(f\"{integer_pieces} + {fractional_pieces} = {total_pieces}\")\n\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
