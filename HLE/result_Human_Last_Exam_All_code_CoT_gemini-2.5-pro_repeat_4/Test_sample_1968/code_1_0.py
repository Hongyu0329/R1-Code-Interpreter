    print("the following equation holds:")
    print("    |f''[x]^2| = kappa")
    print("(where f''[x]^2 is the set of values f({alpha, beta}) for pairs in x).")

    print("\nProof by Contradiction")
    print("----------------------")
    print("1. Assumption: Let's assume such a function 'f' does exist for some infinite cardinal kappa.")

    print("\n2. Applying the ErdÅ‘s-Rado Canonization Theorem:")
    print("   This theorem states that for any function on pairs of elements from a successor cardinal like kappa+,")
    print("   we can find a very large 'homogeneous' subset where the function behaves in a structured, canonical way.")
    print("   Specifically, for our f: [kappa+]^2 -> kappa, there must exist a subset X of kappa+ with cardinality |X| = kappa+,")

    print("     c) Right-variant: f({alpha, beta}) = F(beta)")
    print("     d) Injective: f is one-to-one on the pairs from X.")

    print("\n3. Analyzing the Canonical Forms:")
    print("   Case (d) is impossible. If f were injective on the pairs from X, its image size would be |[X]^2| = kappa+.")
    print("   However, the function's codomain is kappa, so its image size cannot exceed kappa. This is a contradiction since kappa+ > kappa.")
    print("\n   In cases (a), (b), and (c), we can always find a large subset on which f is constant.")
    print("   - Case (a) is already constant.")
    print("   - In cases (b) and (c), the helper function F maps a set of size kappa+ (X) to a set of size kappa (kappa).")
    print("     By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be some element 'c' in kappa for which the preimage F^-1(c) has size kappa+.")
    print("     Let's call this subset X'. On any pair from X', f will be constant with value 'c'.")

    print("\n4. Finding the Contradiction:")
    print("   So, in all possible scenarios, we have shown that for any function 'f', there must exist a subset X' of kappa+ with size kappa+,")
    print("   on which f is constant. Let's say f({alpha, beta}) = c for all pairs in X'.")
    print("\n   Now, from this large set X', we can certainly select a subset 'x' that has the required order type of kappa+1.")
    print("   (This is possible because |X'| = kappa+ is much larger than the cardinality of x, which is kappa).")
    print("\n   For this specific set x, every pair of its elements is also in X'.")
    print("   Therefore, f assigns the same value 'c' to every pair from x.")
    print("   This means the image set is f''[x]^2 = {c}, and its cardinality is 1.")

    print("\n5. Conclusion:")
    print("   Our initial assumption was that for EVERY set x of order type kappa+1, the equation |f''[x]^2| = kappa holds.")
    print("   But we have just found a set x for which the equation gives |f''[x]^2| = 1.")
    print("   Since kappa is an infinite cardinal, 1 is never equal to kappa.")
    print("   This is a contradiction.")
    print("\n   The assumption that such a function 'f' exists must be false. This logic holds for any infinite cardinal kappa.")
    print("   Therefore, such a function can never exist.")
