    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as *induced subgraphs* in any graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   A **graph** `G` on `n` vertices.\n    *   A **clique** of size `k` (denoted `K_k`) is a set of `k` vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** `G[S]` for a vertex subset `S` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Let a graph `G` have `n=128` vertices.\n    *   If `K_k` is an induced subgraph of `G`, it must be induced by a subset of `k` vertices.\n    *   By definition, the size `k` of any induced subgraph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the original graph. So, `k <= n`.\n    *   This means any possible clique size must be an integer between 1 and 128.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of *different* clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n\n4.  **Explore Construction Methods to Achieve the Maximum:**\n    The main question is whether it's possible to construct a graph that actually contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. Let's consider two main strategies for constructing a graph with many different clique sizes.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Disjoint Cliques**\n        *   One way to get cliques of different sizes is to create them separately within the graph. To maximize the number of different clique sizes, `m`, we should choose the smallest possible sizes to be efficient with vertices: `1, 2, 3, ..., m`.\n        *   Let's make our graph `G` a disjoint union of `K_1, K_2, ..., K_m`. The total number of vertices `V` needed is the sum of the sizes of these cliques: `V = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m`.\n        *   This sum has a well-known formula: `V = m * (m + 1) / 2`.\n        *   We have a constraint that the total vertices cannot exceed `n=128`. So, we must solve the inequality: `m * (m + 1) / 2 <= 128`.\n        *   `m * (m + 1) <= 256`.\n        *   By testing values:\n            *   If `m = 15`, `15 * 16 = 240 <= 256` (This works).\n            *   If `m = 16`, `16 * 17 = 272 > 256` (This fails).\n        *   So, with this construction, the maximum number of different clique sizes we can get is 15. The set of clique sizes would be `{1, 2, ..., 15}`.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Overlapping (Nested) Cliques**\n        *   The previous strategy assumed the cliques don't share vertices. What if they do? The most efficient way to \"pack\" cliques is to nest them.\n        *   Consider the **complete graph** on `n=128` vertices, `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n        *   Let's look for its induced subgraphs. If we select any subset of `k` vertices from `K_{128}`, the subgraph induced by them will contain all possible edges between those `k` vertices. By definition, this induced subgraph is a `K_k`.\n        *   Since we can choose any number of vertices `k` from `1` to `128`, we can find an induced clique `K_k` for every `k` in `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n        *   This single graph, `K_{128}`, contains induced cliques of 128 different sizes.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   Strategy 1 (disjoint cliques) yields a maximum of 15 different clique sizes.\n    *   Strategy 2 (single complete graph) yields 128 different clique sizes.\n    *   The problem asks for the *maximum possible* number over *all* graphs. Comparing the results, `128` is clearly better.\n    *   Since we established an upper bound of 128 and found a construction that achieves it, the maximum possible number is 128.\n\nThis detailed plan will now be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximum_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n    on n = 128 vertices.\n\n    It analyzes two constructions and shows which one yields the maximum.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze two main strategies for constructing such a graph.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Strategy 1: Disjoint Cliques ---\n    print(\"Strategy 1: A graph made of disjoint cliques.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the number of clique sizes, 'm', we can use the smallest sizes: 1, 2, 3, ..., m.\")\n    print(\"The total number of vertices needed is V = 1 + 2 + ... + m.\")\n    print(\"The equation for this sum is: V = m * (m + 1) / 2.\")\n    print(f\"We need to find the largest 'm' such that the vertices used are no more than n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This gives the inequality: m * (m + 1) / 2 <= {n}\")\n    print(f\"Multiplying by 2, we get: m * (m + 1) <= {2 * n}\")\n\n    # Solve for m\n    m_disjoint = 0\n    while (m_disjoint + 1) * (m_disjoint + 2) / 2 <= n:\n        m_disjoint += 1\n    \n    vertices_used = m_disjoint * (m_disjoint + 1) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"\\nSolving the inequality, we find the largest integer m is {m_disjoint}.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the vertices used in this construction is:\")\n    print(f\"1 + 2 + ... + {m_disjoint} = {vertices_used}\")\n    print(f\"This construction results in {m_disjoint} different clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Strategy 2: A Single Complete Graph ---\n    print(\"Strategy 2: A single complete graph (K_n).\")\n    print(f\"Let's consider the complete graph on n = {n} vertices, which is K_{n}.\")\n    print(\"In a complete graph, every subset of k vertices induces a clique of size k (K_k).\")\n    print(f\"By choosing subsets of size k = 1, 2, 3, ..., {n}, we can generate induced cliques of all these sizes.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the graph K_{n} contains {n} different clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Conclusion ---\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"We are looking for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes.\")\n    print(f\"Strategy 1 (disjoint cliques) yields {m_disjoint} different sizes.\")\n    print(f\"Strategy 2 (single complete graph) yields {n} different sizes.\")\n    \n    # The maximum is determined by the best construction\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    print(f\"\\nComparing the two results, {n} > {m_disjoint}.\")\n    print(\"Furthermore, the size of any induced clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices, n.\")\n    print(f\"This means the number of different clique sizes can be at most {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Since Strategy 2 achieves this upper bound, it is the maximum possible.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is derived from the properties of a complete graph:\")\n    print(f\"Maximum number of different clique sizes = {max_sizes}\")\n\n\nsolve_maximum_clique_sizes()\n\n<<<128>>>\n```"
