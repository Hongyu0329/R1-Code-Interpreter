    "To find the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze its stability region. The boundary of the stability region is given by the curve $\\mu(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})/\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, where $\\rho(z)$ and $\\sigma(z)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method.\n\nFor BDF4, these are:\n*   $\\rho(z) = \\frac{25}{12}z^4 - 4z^3 + 3z^2 - \\frac{4}{3}z + \\frac{1}{4}$\n*   $\\sigma(z) = z^4$\n\nThe stability region for BDF methods is the exterior of the curve traced by $\\mu(\\theta)$. A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{w \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-w)| \\le \\alpha \\}$. The largest such $\\alpha$ is found when the boundary of this sector, the rays $\\arg(-w) = \\pm\\alpha$, are tangent to the stability boundary $\\mu(\\theta)$. This is equivalent to finding the minimum of $|\\arg(-\\mu(\\theta))|$ over $\\theta$.\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ where the argument of $\\mu(\\theta)$ is extremal can be found by solving the condition $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{z\\rho'(z)-4\\rho(z)}{\\rho(z)}\\right) = 0$ for $z=e^{i\\theta}$. This condition leads to a polynomial equation in $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. After algebraic simplification, the equation for $x = 2c = 2\\cos(\\theta)$ is:\n$25x^3 - 60x^2 - 51x + 116 = 0$\n\nThis cubic equation has two real roots in the interval $[-2, 2]$, which correspond to the values of $2\\cos(\\theta)$ where the argument of $\\mu(\\theta)$ is extremal. We need to find these roots, calculate the corresponding values of $\\mu(\\theta)$, and then find the minimum of $|\\arg(-\\mu(\\theta))|$. This minimum value will be our stability angle $\\alpha$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these steps to find the exact value of the argument of the arctan function that defines $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact value for the A(alpha)-stability angle of the BDF4 method.\n    The angle alpha is given by arctan(Num / Den).
