    "My plan is to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) by consulting established entomological knowledge. I will write a Python script that programmatically evaluates the provided answer choices based on these facts. The script will print its reasoning, explaining why certain food sources are correct and others are not, ultimately identifying the most comprehensive correct answer from the list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    # They are primarily predatory but also supplement their diet.\n    predatory_on = [\"aphids\", \"mites\", \"insect eggs\", \"other small soft-bodied insects\"]\n    supplementary_diet = [\"pollen\", \"nectar\"]\n\n    # The answer choices provided\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Nectar\",\n        \"E\": \"Totara Aphids\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Evaluate Choice A: Nectar\n    is_a_correct = choices[\"A\"].lower() in supplementary_diet\n    print(f\"Checking Choice A: {choices['A']}\")\n    if is_a_correct:\n        print(f\"Result: CORRECT.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
