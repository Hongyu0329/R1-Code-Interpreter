    "To identify the Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant conflict:** Mu Sheng was a commander during the Ming dynasty's campaigns in Vietnam. His most notable campaigns were the initial invasion (1406-1407) and the later attempt to suppress the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427).\n2.  **Pinpoint the specific battle:** While the initial invasion was successful, Mu Sheng's return to Vietnam to fight the Lam Sơn rebels led to a significant military disaster for the Ming. In 1427, he led a large relief army to aid the besieged Ming fortress of Xương Giang.\n3.  **Locate the battle site:** Mu Sheng's army was ambushed and routed by Lê Lợi's forces at the Battle of Cần Trạm (also known as the Battle of Kép). This was a decisive defeat that shattered his army and sealed the fate of the Ming forces in Vietnam.\n4.  **Map the historical site to a modern province:** The site of the Battle of Cần Trạm/Kép is located in what is today the Lạng Giang District, which belongs to **Bắc Giang Province** in Vietnam.\n\nThe following Python script will print this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    battle = \"Battle of Cần Trạm (Kép)\"\n    year = 1427\n    modern_province = \"Bắc Giang Province\"\n\n    print(f\"The first major defeat for {general} in Vietnam occurred at the {battle} in the year {year}.\")\n    print(f\"The location of this battle is in modern-day {modern_province}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Bắc Giang Province>>>"
