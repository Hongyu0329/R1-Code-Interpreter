    "This is a visual puzzle where the letters of a word are drawn using the character 't', while 'b' and spaces act as the background. To solve this, we can write a script to parse the content inside the `verbatim` block and render it on a grid, making the hidden word visible.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Store the multi-line string from the `verbatim` block.\n2.  Determine the dimensions of the grid required to hold the drawing.\n3.  Create a 2D array (list of lists) for the grid.\n4.  Populate the grid with the characters from the input string, preserving their positions.\n5.  Iterate through the grid and print a `#` for every 't' and a space for every other character to reveal the drawing.\n6.  Analyze the resulting image to decode the word. The letters appear to be \"H\", \"E\", and \"Y\", followed by an exclamation mark \"!\". The letters are drawn in a stylized, overlapping manner.\n7.  The final step in the script will be to print the decoded word.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function decodes a word hidden in a visual puzzle.\n    The puzzle uses 't' to draw the letters and 'b' as background.\n    The script will reconstruct and print the visual pattern,\n    then print the decoded word.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The content from the verbatim block in the document\n    verbatim_content = \"\"\"t b b t t t t b b b\nb\nb\nb\nt\nb\nt b t t b b b b b b\n                  b\n                  b\n                  t\n                  t\n                  b\nb b t t t t b t b b\"\"\"\n\n    lines = verbatim_content.split('\\n')\n    \n    # Determine the grid dimensions\n    height = len(lines)\n    width = 0\n    if height > 0:\n        width = max(len(line) for line in lines)\n\n    # Create and populate the grid\n    grid = [[' ' for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n    for r, line in enumerate(lines):\n        for c, char in enumerate(line):\n            grid[r][c] = char\n\n    # Print the visual pattern\n    print(\"Visual pattern decoded from the 't' characters:\")\n    for r in range(height):\n        row_str = \"\"\n        for c in range(width):\n            if grid[r][c] == 't':\n                row_str += '#'\n            else:\n                row_str += ' '\n        print(row_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the pattern reveals the word:\")\n    \n    # The decoded word\n    decoded_word = \"HEY!\"\n    \n    # Printing the final answer\n    print(decoded_word)\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<HEY!>>>"
