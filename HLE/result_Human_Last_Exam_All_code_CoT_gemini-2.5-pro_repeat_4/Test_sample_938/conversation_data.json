    "An explanation of the method to solve the problem is as follows:\n1.  First, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the sequence $a_n$. The sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$. The behavior for large $n$ is determined by the root of the characteristic equation with the largest absolute value.\n\n2.  The characteristic equation is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. We can factor this polynomial. By trying integer factors for the coefficients of quadratic factors, we find the factorization:\n    $(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = x^4 -4x^3 -3x^2 + 4x^3 +16x^2 +76x -3x^2 -12x -57 = x^4 +10x^2+64x-57$. This is not correct.\n    Let's recheck the factorization:\n    $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+c) = x^4 + (b+c-a^2)x^2 + a(c-b)x + bc$.\n    Comparing coefficients with $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$:\n    $b+c-a^2 = 0$\n    $a(c-b) = -88$\n    $bc = -57$\n    Trying $a=4$ gives $c-b=-22$ and $b+c=16$. This gives $c=-3$ and $b=19$.\n    $bc = 19 \\times (-3) = -57$. This is correct.\n    So the factorization is $(x^2 + 4x + 19)(x^2 - 4x - 3) = 0$.\n\n3.  The roots of the equation are:\n    - From $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$, the roots are $x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    - From $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$, the roots are $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n\n4.  We find the magnitudes of these roots to identify the dominant root:\n    - $|2 + \\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n    - $|2 - \\sqrt{7}| \\approx |2 - 2.646| = 0.646$\n    - $|-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4+15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\n    The dominant root is $\\lambda = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n\n5.  For large $n$, the term $a_n$ can be approximated by $a_n \\sim C \\cdot \\lambda^n$ for some non-zero constant $C$. The initial conditions ensure $C \\neq 0$.\n\n6.  Now we analyze the expression for $s_n$:\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$.\n    We need to find the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Let's examine the dominant terms.\n    The first sum contains terms like $a_{2k-3}$. For $k=n$, this is $a_{2n-3} \\sim C\\lambda^{2n-3}$. Other terms in the first sum are of the order $\\lambda^{n+100}$ which is much smaller than $\\lambda^{2n-3}$ for large $n$.\n    The second sum consists of products of sequence terms. The dominant part for a given $k$ is $a_{k+3}a_{k-4} \\sim (C\\lambda^{k+3})(C\\lambda^{k-4}) = C^2\\lambda^{2k-1}$.\n    The sum is dominated by its last term, where $k=n-1$. This term behaves like $\\lambda^{2(n-1)-1} = \\lambda^{2n-3}$.\n    Let's analyze the entire expression for $s_n$ more carefully. We can write $s_n$ as:\n    $s_n = (a_{2n-3}+2a_{n+100}+7a_{n+51}) + \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} [ (a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}) - (a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}) ]$.\n    The term outside the sum, $a_{2n-3}$, grows as $\\lambda^{2n-3}$. The terms inside the summation grow at a lower rate (the largest exponent for $k=n-1$ would be $2(n-1)-3 = 2n-5$ from $a_{2k-3}$).\n    Therefore, the term $a_{2n-3}$ dominates the entire expression for $s_n$ for large $n$.\n    $s_n \\sim a_{2n-3} \\sim C\\lambda^{2n-3}$.\n\n7.  Now we can compute the limit:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(C\\lambda^{2n-3})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{C} + (2n-3)\\ln{\\lambda}}{n}$\n    As $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, this simplifies to:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\ln{C}}{n} - \\frac{3\\ln{\\lambda}}{n} + 2\\ln{\\lambda}\\right) = 2\\ln{\\lambda}$.\n\n8.  The limit is $L = 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$. We need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The dominant root of the characteristic equation x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0 is lambda = 2 + sqrt(7).\n# The limit is L = 2 * ln(lambda).\n# We need to compute the integer part of 10^4 * L.\n\ndom_root_lambda = 2 + math.sqrt(7)\nlimit_L = 2 * math.log(dom_root_lambda)\nvalue = 10000 * limit_L\n\n# The final result is the integer part of the calculated value.\ninteger_part = int(value)\n\nprint(f\"The characteristic equation is x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0.\")\nprint(f\"The roots are 2+sqrt(7), 2-sqrt(7), -2+i*sqrt(15), -2-i*sqrt(15).\")\nprint(f\"The dominant root is lambda = 2 + sqrt(7) = {dom_root_lambda}\")\nprint(f\"The limit is L = 2 * ln(lambda) = {limit_L}\")\nprint(f\"The value to compute is 10^4 * L = {value}\")\nprint(f\"The integer part of the value is {integer_part}.\")\n```\n<<<30719>>>"
