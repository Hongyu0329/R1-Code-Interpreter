# Step 2: Identify the number Y.
# Tram route number 2 is a well-known route that formerly passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
# before the tracks were removed.
Y = 2

# Step 3: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = math.pow(X, Y)

# Step 4: Print the final equation with the result.
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {int(result)}")
