    # The problem describes an Optimized Schwarz Waveform Relaxation (OSWR) method.
    # For the 1D wave equation, u_tt = c^2 * u_xx, perfect "absorbing" or
    # "transparent" transmission conditions can be formulated. These conditions
    # allow waves to pass through the interfaces between subdomains without any
    # artificial reflection, leading to very fast convergence.

    # Let's trace the flow of information (waves) over the iterations.
    # The general solution is a superposition of left-traveling and right-traveling waves.

    # Iteration 1:
    # In the first iteration, each subdomain solves its local wave equation
    # and sends information about its outgoing waves to its neighbor.
    # - Subdomain Omega_1 ([0, b]) correctly computes its right-traveling waves and sends them to Omega_2.
    # - Subdomain Omega_2 ([a, L]) correctly computes its left-traveling waves and sends them to Omega_1.
    # After one iteration, each subdomain has corrected one of the two wave components (either the left- or right-traveling part).

    # Iteration 2:
    # In the second iteration, the process is repeated.
    # - Omega_1 receives the left-traveling wave information from Omega_2, which was corrected in the first step.
    # - Omega_2 receives the right-traveling wave information from Omega_1, which was also corrected in the first step.
    # After this second exchange, both the left- and right-traveling wave components are correct in both subdomains.
    # The solution has converged to the exact solution everywhere.

    # The number of iterations required is therefore fixed.
    num_iterations = 2

    # The question asks to output the final number.
    # There is no complex equation; the result is a constant based on the method's properties.
