# Define the propositions based on the chosen correct answer.
P = "The dog detects an intruder."
Q = "The dog barked."
R = "The dog was asleep."

# Explain the logical setup.
print("The problem is to explain how a dog could detect an intruder (P) but not bark (¬Q),")
print("even though it is trained to bark at intruders (implying P→Q).")
print("This means the initial rule 'P→Q' must be incomplete.")
print("\nAnswer choice C provides the most logical resolution:")
print(f"Let P = '{P}'")
print(f"Let Q = '{Q}'")
print(f"Let R = '{R}'")

print("\nStep 1: Refine the initial premise.")
print("The original rule 'If the dog detects an intruder, it barks' is too simple.")
print("A more accurate rule is: 'If the dog detects an intruder AND is not asleep, then it will bark.'")
print("Symbolically, this is: (P ∧ ¬R) → Q")

print("\nStep 2: State the known facts from the problem.")
print("We have verifiable proof that 'The dog detected an intruder, but the dog did not bark.'")
print("Symbolically, this is: P ∧ ¬Q")
print("This means we know for a fact that P is TRUE and ¬Q is TRUE (so Q is FALSE).")

print("\nStep 3: Deduce the conclusion using these pieces.")
print("We have two true statements:")
print("  1. (P ∧ ¬R) → Q")
print("  2. P ∧ ¬Q")
print("We want to determine if R is true or false.")

print("\nLet's use the contrapositive of the first statement.")
print("The contrapositive of '(A → B)' is '(¬B → ¬A)'.")
print("So, the contrapositive of '(P ∧ ¬R) → Q' is '¬Q → ¬(P ∧ ¬R)'.")
print("By De Morgan's laws, ¬(P ∧ ¬R) is equivalent to (¬P ∨ R).")
print("So, our contrapositive statement is: ¬Q → (¬P ∨ R)")

print("\nNow let's apply our known facts:")
print("We know ¬Q is TRUE (from 'The dog did not bark').")
print("Applying Modus Ponens to '¬Q → (¬P ∨ R)', we can conclude that (¬P ∨ R) must be TRUE.")
print("We also know that P is TRUE (from 'The dog detected an intruder').")
print("If P is TRUE, then ¬P must be FALSE.")
print("Looking at our conclusion '(¬P ∨ R)', if the first part (¬P) is FALSE, the only way for the whole statement to be TRUE is if the second part (R) is TRUE.")

print("\nConclusion:")
print("Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that R is TRUE. The dog was asleep.")
print("This resolves the paradox without contradicting the given evidence.")

print("\nThe final logical expression is:")
# Printing each symbol and operator separately as requested
print("[(P ∧ ¬R) → Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P), ∴ R")
