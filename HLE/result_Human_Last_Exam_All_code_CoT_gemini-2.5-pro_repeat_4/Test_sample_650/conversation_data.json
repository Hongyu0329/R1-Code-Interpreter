    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the algorithm's time complexity and a Python implementation.\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis\n\nThe computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm is determined by the number of times the `while` loop is executed, as the operations inside the loop are elementary.\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** The operations `i := 0`, `x := n`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_0 := x — qc` are all fundamental arithmetic operations. Assuming they can be performed in constant time, this step has a time complexity of O(1).\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's analyze how the value of `q` changes with each iteration.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations, `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\n3.  **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `q ≤ 0`. This happens when `n/c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1, or `n < c^(k+1)`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`. This means the number of iterations `(k+1)` is approximately `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Work per Iteration:** The operations inside the loop (`i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `a_i := x — qc`) are all constant time operations, O(1).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the work done per iteration. Therefore, the complexity is `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`. The time it takes to run the algorithm grows logarithmically with the input value `n`.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nHere is a Python function that implements the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm. It takes two integers, `n` and `c`, and prints the base-`c` representation of `n`, along with the equation that verifies the result.\n\n```python\ndef represent_in_base(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the IMAG(n, c) algorithm to find the representation of a number n\n    in a given base c.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to convert (n >= 0).\n        c (int): The base to convert to (c >= 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(c, int) or n < 0 or c < 2:\n        print(\"Error: Input must be integers where n >= 0 and c >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    original_n = n\n    \n    # Handle the edge case n = 0\n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"The base\", c, \"representation of 0 is: (0)\")\n        print(\"Check: 0 = 0 * 2^0\")\n        return\n\n    digits = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Initialization\n    x = n\n    q = x // c\n    a0 = x - q * c  # This is equivalent to x % c\n    digits.append(a0)\n\n    # Step 2: Loop while q > 0\n    while q > 0:\n        # Step 2.1: Update variables\n        x = q\n        q = x // c\n        ai = x - q * c # This is equivalent to x % c\n        digits.append(ai)\n\n    # The algorithm produces digits from least significant to most significant.\n    # We reverse the list to get the correct representation (a_i, a_i-1, ..., a_0).\n    representation = digits[::-1]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return/Output the result\n    print(f\"The base {c} representation of {original_n} is: {tuple(representation)}\")\n    \n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final equation to verify the result\n    equation_parts = []\n    for power, digit in enumerate(reversed(digits)):\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{digit} * {c}^{power}\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"Check: {original_n} = {equation_str}\")\n\n\n# Example: Find the representation of n=25 in base c=3.\n# The algorithm should produce (2, 2, 1) because 25 = 2*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 18 + 6 + 1.\nrepresent_in_base(25, 3)\n\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*20 + \"\\n\")\n\n# Another example: Represent n=100 in base c=2 (binary).\nrepresent_in_base(100, 2)\n```\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
