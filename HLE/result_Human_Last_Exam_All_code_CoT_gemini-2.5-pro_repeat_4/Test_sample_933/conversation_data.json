    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review its common production methods.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The most common method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Conditions:** This reaction is exothermic, but it requires a significant activation energy to proceed at an efficient rate. This means the reactants must be heated.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Temperature Options:**\n    *   Very low temperatures (like -78 °C, 0 °C, or 78 °C) will not provide enough energy for the reaction to occur efficiently, if at all.\n    *   The standard, well-established industrial and laboratory method involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to prevent the formation of XeF₂) in a nickel vessel.\n    *   The optimal temperature for this synthesis is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds efficiently to yield XeF₄.\n    *   Higher temperatures (e.g., 600 °C) would begin to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard synthesis methods, 400 °C is the coldest temperature among the choices where XeF₄ can be produced efficiently.\n\nI will now write a Python script to display this information and identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine the\n    coldest efficient production temperature from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The primary synthesis reaction for Xenon tetrafluoride\n    synthesis_reaction = \"Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\"\n    \n    print(\"Synthesizing Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The most common method for synthesizing XeF₄ is the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases.\")\n    \n    # Printing the reaction equation with stoichiometric numbers as requested\n    print(\"\\nThe chemical equation is:\")\n    print(\"1 Xe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → 1 XeF₄(s)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAnalysis of Reaction Conditions:\")\n    print(\"This reaction requires heating to proceed at an efficient rate.\")\n    \n    # Available temperature choices\n    choices = {\n        'A': 600,\n        'B': 400,\n        'C': 200,\n        'D': 78,\n        'E': 0,\n        'F': -78\n    }\n    \n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the temperature choices (in degrees Celsius):\")\n    print(f\" - {choices['A']}°C: Too high.
