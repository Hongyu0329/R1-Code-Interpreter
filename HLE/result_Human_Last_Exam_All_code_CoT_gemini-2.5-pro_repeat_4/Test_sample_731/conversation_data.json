    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the general form $SD_{2^n}$, the size is $2^n$, so for 512, we have $n = \\log_2(512) = 9$. The group is defined by the presentation $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Term \"Power Subgroup\":** In group theory, a subgroup generated by the powers of a single element is called a **cyclic subgroup**. It is the most standard interpretation of the term \"power subgroup\". Therefore, the task is to find the number of cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Counting:** We can count the cyclic subgroups by categorizing them into two types:\n    a. Subgroups that are entirely contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    b. Subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$, which are of the form $sr^i$.\n\n4.  **Count Subgroups of Type (a):** The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order $2^{n-1} = 256$. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$. For a number of the form $2^k$, it has $k+1$ divisors. Here, the order is $2^{n-1}$, so it has $(n-1)+1 = n$ subgroups. For $n=9$, this is 9 subgroups.\n\n5.  **Count Subgroups of Type (b):** These are subgroups generated by elements of the form $g = sr^i$. We need to find their orders and see how many distinct subgroups they generate.\n    *   **Order 2 subgroups:** An element $sr^i$ has order 2 if $i$ is even. There are $2^{n-1}/2 = 2^{n-2}$ even values for $i$. Each of these elements generates a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. For $n=9$, this is $2^{9-2} = 128$ subgroups.\n    *   **Order 4 subgroups:** An element $sr^i$ has order 4 if $i$ is odd. There are $2^{n-2}$ odd values for $i$. These elements form pairs that generate the same subgroup of order 4. Thus, the number of distinct subgroups is $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$. For $n=9$, this is $2^{9-3} = 64$ subgroups.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** The subgroups of type (b) are distinct from those of type (a) because they contain elements outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$. Therefore, the total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from all categories: $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_semidihedral(group_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power (cyclic) subgroups in a semidihedral group.\n    \n    The formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is\n    n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3).\n    \n    Args:\n        group_size (int): The size of the semidihedral group, must be a power of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a positive power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # For a semidihedral group of size 2^n, find n.\n    # n = log2(group_size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    \n    if n < 3:\n        print(f\"Error: Semidihedral group SD_{group_size} is not defined for n < 3.\")\n        return\n\n    # 1.
