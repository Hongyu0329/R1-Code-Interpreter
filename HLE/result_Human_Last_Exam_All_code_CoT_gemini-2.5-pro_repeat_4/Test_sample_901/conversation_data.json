    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and the reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) are anti-periplanar. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial arrangement (both in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down).\n3.  **Evaluate Substrate Conformations:** The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, will adopt a chair conformation that allows the reaction to proceed. The leaving group, Bromine, must be in an axial position. In the reactive conformation of this specific molecule, the Bromine is axial, and there are two different beta-hydrogens that are also axial and thus available for elimination: one on Carbon-2 (next to the methyl group) and one on Carbon-6.\n4.  **Determine Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev):**\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from C2 would lead to the more substituted alkene, **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from C6 would lead to the less substituted alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product).\n5.  **Consider the Base:** Since potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, it will preferentially remove the less sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is hindered by the adjacent methyl group). Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n6.  **Final Product:** The major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is the python code that presents the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"1.
