    "To determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: We must be precise about what \"continuum,\" \"indecomposable,\" and \"composant\" mean in topology.\n2.  **Analyze the simplest case**: We'll examine the most basic possible example of a continuum.\n3.  **Apply the definitions**: We'll check if this simple case fits the definition of an indecomposable continuum and then count its a composants.\n4.  **Formulate the conclusion**: Based on this analysis, we will state the smallest possible number. For completeness, we will also mention the case for more complex continua.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this logical reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and answers the question about the smallest number of\n    composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the definitions\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\" - Continuum: A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.\")\n    print(\" - Indecomposable Continuum: A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"   (A proper subcontinuum is a subset that is a continuum itself but is not the entire space).\")\n    print(\" - Composant: For a given point x in a continuum, its composant is the set of all points y such that there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both x and y.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the simplest case\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Let's consider the most trivial continuum possible: a space consisting of a single point, X = {p}.\")\n    print(\" - It is a continuum: It is non-empty, compact, connected, and Hausdorff.\")\n    print(\" - It is indecomposable: To be decomposable, X would have to be the union of two proper subcontinua.
