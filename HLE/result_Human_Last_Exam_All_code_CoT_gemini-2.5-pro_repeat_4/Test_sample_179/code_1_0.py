# The ODE is X0'(t) = -lambda * X0(t) + A, where lambda = B + 1
lambda_val = B + 1

# where K is the particular solution A / lambda
K = A / lambda_val

# Step 3: Use the boundary condition X0(0) - X0(T) = alpha1 to find C
# C * (1 - exp(-lambda * T)) = alpha1
# C = alpha1 / (1 - exp(-lambda * T))
# The term exp(-lambda * T) will be exp(-(1e-5) * 1e20) = exp(-1e15), which is effectively 0
# However, we can calculate it directly.

    # It could also happen if the problem was ill-posed, but here we can solve for C.

# X0(t) = K + C * exp(-lambda * t)
# Since C=0, the solution simplifies to X0(t) = K
