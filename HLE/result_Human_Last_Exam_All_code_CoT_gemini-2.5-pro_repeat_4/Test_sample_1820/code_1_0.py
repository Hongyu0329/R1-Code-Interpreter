    """
    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for an ontology mapping scenario.

    This calculation is based on the principle that completeness is limited by the
    ratio of the information content per level (related to the branching factor 'b')
    to the structural depth 'd' over which logical consistency must be maintained.
    The "mergeable siblings" constraint in the source ontology causes information loss
    when mapped to a strict target ontology, and this loss is exacerbated at greater depths.

    The formula used is ln(b) / d.

    Args:
        b (int): The branching factor of the source ontology.
        d (int): The depth of the source ontology.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated theoretical completeness bound.
