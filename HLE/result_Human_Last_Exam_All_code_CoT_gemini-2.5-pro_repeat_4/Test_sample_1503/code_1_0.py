    # Answer for (a)
    # The Pohozaev identity P(u, v) = 0 is a necessary condition for (u, v) to be a critical
    # point of the energy functional J, but it is not sufficient. The set of solutions
    # is a subset of the Pohozaev manifold { (u,v) | P(u,v)=0 }, but the manifold can be larger.
    answer_a = "False"

    # Answer for (b)
    # Yes, for a typical nonlinear system, the kinetic and nonlinear terms in the Pohozaev identity
    # scale differently with a scaling parameter t. This allows the equation P(u_t, v_t) = 0
    # to be solved uniquely for t > 0, effectively projecting any function (u, v) onto the manifold.
    answer_b = "Yes"

    # Answer for (c)
    # Yes, a minimizer of J on the Pohozaev manifold is typically found using a mountain pass argument.
    # The manifold is constructed as the set of points that maximize the energy functional J along
    # scaling paths. For a function (u, v) on this manifold, this means the energy J(u_t, v_t)
    # is maximum at t=1, which implies the second derivative is negative.
