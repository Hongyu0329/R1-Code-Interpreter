    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze constraints and design an efficient interpreter.
    # The most efficient interpreter avoids storing entire lines. It reads character by character.
    # The C code would need variables for:
    # 1. n: The total number of statements.
    # 2. x: The value of the X++ variable, initialized to 0.
    # 3. i: A loop counter to iterate n times.
    # 4. c: A temporary character variable to read from the tape.

    # Step 3: Determine the maximum number of statements (n).
    # A program's length = (digits in n) + 1 (newline) + n * (3 chars/statement + 1 newline)
    # Length = len(str(n)) + 1 + 4*n
    # We need to find the max n such that Length <= 366.
    # Let's test n = 90: len("90") + 1 + 4*90 = 2 + 1 + 360 = 363. (<= 366, OK)
    # Let's test n = 91: len("91") + 1 + 4*91 = 2 + 1 + 364 = 367. (> 366, Not OK)
    # So, the maximum number of statements is 90.
    max_n = 90

    # Step 4: Select minimal data types based on the range of each variable.
    # - Variable 'n' stores the number of statements. Max value is 90.
    #   An 8-bit signed integer (int8_t), which holds -128 to 127, is sufficient.
    mem_n = 1  # byte

    # - Variable 'x' is the accumulator. Its value can range from -90 to +90.
    #   An 8-bit signed integer (int8_t) is also sufficient for this.
    mem_x = 1  # byte

    # - Variable 'i' is the loop counter. It will go from 0 to 89 (n-1).
    #   An 8-bit unsigned integer (uint8_t) or signed (int8_t) is sufficient.
    mem_i = 1  # byte

    # - Variable 'c' holds a single character from the input.
    #   The standard 'char' type in C is used for this.
    mem_c = 1  # byte

    # Step 5: Calculate the total memory.
    total_memory = mem_n + mem_x + mem_i + mem_c

    # Step 6: Print the detailed explanation and the final equation.
