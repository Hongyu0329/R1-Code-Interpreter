# Step 1: Define the initial values from the problem description.
initial_total_curves = 360
undisturbed_curves = 90

# Step 2: Calculate the number of curves that were disturbed.
# These are the curves the master must redraw.
curves_to_draw = initial_total_curves - undisturbed_curves

# Step 3: Present the logic and the final calculation.
# The question asks "how many total curves must the master draw", which corresponds
# to the number of curves that were disturbed and need replacement.
# The information about the golden ratio and the specific types of new curves
# (parabolic, elliptical, circular) describes the nature of the new curves,
# but does not change the total number of curves that must be drawn.

print("The problem is solved by determining how many curves need to be replaced.")
print(f"The pattern started with a total of {initial_total_curves} curves.")
print(f"After the disruption, {undisturbed_curves} curves remained unchanged.")
print("The number of curves the master must draw is the difference.")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"{initial_total_curves} (Initial Curves) - {undisturbed_curves} (Undisturbed Curves) = {curves_to_draw} (Curves to Draw)")

# The final answer is the number of curves to be drawn.
# print(f"\nTherefore, the master must draw {curves_to_draw} curves to restore the pattern.")
