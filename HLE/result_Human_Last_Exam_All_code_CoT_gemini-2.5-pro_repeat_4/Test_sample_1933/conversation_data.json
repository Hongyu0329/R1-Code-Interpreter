    "To determine the VC dimension of the given class of first-order logic formulas, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Query:** First, we need to understand what \"VC dimension of a class of formulas\" means. In this context, it refers to the VC dimension of the collection of *concepts* that can be defined by these formulas. A formula with one free variable, say `phi(x)`, defines a concept, which is the set of all elements `a` in a model for which `phi(a)` is true.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Formula Structure:** The logic is specified as $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A formula `phi(x)` with one free variable `x` in this logic can be constructed using existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$), and atomic formulas from the schema $S$. The schema $S$ has 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n    A typical formula `phi(x)` will have the structure:\n    `exists y_1, ..., y_k . psi(x, y_1, ..., y_k)`\n    where `psi` is a quantifier-free formula built with conjunctions of literals (e.g., $P_i(z)$ or $\\neg P_i(z)$). This simplifies to:\n    `psi_x(x) AND (exists y_1 . psi_{y_1}(y_1)) AND ... AND (exists y_k . psi_{y_k}(y_k))`\n    The part in the parentheses is a sentence (it has no free variables), so for any given database model, it's either true or false. If it's false, the entire formula is false, defining an empty set. If it's true, the formula is equivalent to `psi_x(x)`.\n    `psi_x(x)` is simply a conjunction of literals involving `x`, also known as a **monomial**. For example, $P_1(x) \\land \\neg P_3(x)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Concept Class:** From the analysis above, the concepts we can define are the empty set, the whole domain (from the formula `TRUE`), and any concept definable by a monomial over the 4 predicates. The VC dimension of a class is not affected by adding the empty set or the whole domain. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by monomials over 4 attributes.\n\n4.  **Determine the VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of the concept class of monomials over $d$ boolean attributes is a standard result in learning theory: the VC dimension is exactly $d$.\n    *   **Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge d$):** We can show that a set of $d$ points can be shattered.\n    *   **Upper Bound (VC-dim $\\le d$):** We can show that no set of $d+1$ points can be shattered. This is typically proven using linear dependency over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (an extension of Radon's theorem).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** In our case, the number of unary predicates is $d=4$. Therefore, the VC dimension is 4.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that demonstrates the lower bound by explicitly constructing the formulas needed to shatter a set of 4 points.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the VC dimension for the given problem.\n    The task is to find the VC dimension of formulas in FO[exists, AND] over a\n    schema with 4 unary predicates.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of unary predicates in the schema S\n    num_predicates = 4\n\n    print(f\"The schema has {num_predicates} unary predicates (P1, P2, P3, P4).\")\n    print(\"The problem is equivalent to finding the VC dimension of concepts defined by monomials (conjunctions of literals) over these 4 predicates.\")\n    print(f\"The VC dimension of this class is known to be equal to the number of predicates, which is {num_predicates}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"--- Proof of VC Dimension >= {num_predicates} ---\")\n    print(f\"We prove this by showing that a specific set of {num_predicates} points can be 'shattered'.\")\n    print(\"To shatter a set means we can use our formulas to select any possible subset of it.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's define a set of 4 points: {u1, u2, u3, u4}.\")\n    print(\"Let's define a model where P_i(u_j) is TRUE if and only if i = j.\")\n    print(\"This makes the points independent, like basis vectors in a 4D space:\")\n    print(\"u1 satisfies (P1=T, P2=F, P3=F, P4=F)\")\n    print(\"u2 satisfies (P1=F, P2=T, P3=F, P4=F)\")\n    print(\"u3 satisfies (P1=F, P2=F, P3=T, P4=F)\")\n    print(\"u4 satisfies (P1=F, P2=F, P4=T, P4=T)\\n\")\n\n\n    print(f\"We will now show how to generate all 2^{num_predicates} = {2**num_predicates} subsets of {{u1, u2, u3, u4}} using a monomial formula.\\n\")\n\n    points = [f\"u{i+1}\" for i in range(num_predicates)]\n\n    # Iterate through all 2^d possible subsets\n    num_subsets = 2**num_predicates\n    for i in range(num_subsets):\n        target_subset_points = []\n        target_indices = set()  # Use 1-based indexing for predicates\n        for j in range(num_predicates):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                target_subset_points.append(points[j])\n                target_indices.add(j + 1)\n\n        # Format the target subset for printing\n        if not target_subset_points:\n            target_subset_str = \"{}\"\n        else:\n            target_subset_str = \"{\" + \", \".join(target_subset_points) + \"}\"\n\n        # The general formula to select a target subset S is: AND_{k where u_k is NOT in S} (NOT P_k(x))\n        all_indices = set(range(1, num_predicates + 1))\n        indices_for_negated_literals = all_indices - target_indices\n\n        literals = [f\"NOT P{k}(x)\" for k in sorted(list(indices_for_negated_literals))]\n\n        if not literals:\n            formula = \"TRUE\" # The empty conjunction is TRUE\n        else:\n            formula = \" AND \".join(literals)\n\n        print(f\"To select the subset {target_subset_str:<22} use the formula: {formula}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSince every possible subset can be isolated, the set {u1, u2, u3, u4} is shattered.\")\n    print(f\"This proves that the VC dimension is at least {num_predicates}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"--- Proof of VC Dimension <= {num_predicates} ---\")\n    print(f\"It's a known result that for monomials over d attributes, no set of d+1 points can be shattered.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, with d={num_predicates}, no set of {num_predicates + 1} points can be shattered.\")\n    print(\"This provides the upper bound on the VC dimension.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"Since the VC dimension is >= {num_predicates} and <= {num_predicates}, it must be exactly {num_predicates}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The VC dimension is {num_predicates}.\")\n\nsolve_vc_dimension()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
