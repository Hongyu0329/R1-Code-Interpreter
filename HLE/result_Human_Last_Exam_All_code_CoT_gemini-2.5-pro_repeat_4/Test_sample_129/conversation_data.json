    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written with exactly 5 symbols, we will systematically count them by breaking down the problem based on the expressions' structure.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Categorize Expressions:** We'll classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 into disjoint sets based on their top-level syntactical form, respecting operator precedence (`! > & > |`). The main categories are:\n    *   Parenthesized expressions: `(E)`\n    *   Negated expressions: `!E`\n    *   OR expressions: `A | B`\n    *   AND expressions: `A & B`\n\n2.  **Count True Expressions in Each Category:** For each category, we will count how many unique, valid expressions of length 5 evaluate to `True`. This requires knowing the number of true/false expressions of shorter lengths.\n    *   **Length 1:** 1 True (`T`), 1 False (`F`).\n    *   **Length 2:** 1 True (`!F`), 1 False (`!T`).\n    *   **Length 3:** 5 True (`(T)`, `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`), 5 False.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number is the sum of the counts from each category.\n\n### Execution\n\nThe following Python code implements this counting strategy. It calculates the number of true expressions for each category and then sums them to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n    The method is to categorize expressions by their top-level structure\n    and count the number of true expressions in each category.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Category 1: Expressions of the form (E), where E is an expression of length 3.\n    # For (E) to be true, E must be a true expression of length 3.\n    # From analysis, there are 5 true expressions of length 3: (T), T&T, T|T, T|F, F|T.\n    # These lead to ((T)), (T&T), (T|T), (T|F), (F|T).\n    cat1_paren = 5\n    print(f\"Category 1: Expressions of the form (E) like ((T)), (T&T), etc.\")\n    print(f\"Count = {cat1_paren}\\n\")\n\n    # Category 2: Expressions of the form !E, where E is an expression of length 4.\n    # For !E to be true, E must be false.
