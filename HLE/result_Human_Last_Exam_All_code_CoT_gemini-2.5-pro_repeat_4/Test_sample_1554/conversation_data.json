    "My plan is to first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on the provided concepts. The key terms are \"hallmark,\" \"symptoms,\" and \"signals.\" This is a question about epistemology and semiotics within that specific philosophical tradition. After researching and identifying the correct philosopher, I will write a simple Python script. The script's purpose will be to print the name of this philosopher as the answer, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher\n    who distinguished between symptoms and signals as components of a hallmark.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The concepts of hallmark (oznaka), symptom (symptom), and signal (sygna≈Ç)\n    # were notably analyzed by this Polish philosopher and logician.\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {philosopher}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
