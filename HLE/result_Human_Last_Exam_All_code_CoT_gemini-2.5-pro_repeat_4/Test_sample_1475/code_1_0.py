    # The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection
    # of countably many open dense subsets of P(X).
    #
    # Step 1: P(X) is a Baire Space.
    # The space X is a compact metric space, so the hyperspace 2^X is a complete metric space.
    # The space P(X) of convergent sequences is a G-delta subset of 2^X.
    # A G-delta subset of a complete metric space is a Baire space.
    #
    # Step 2: An intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X), let's call it G,
    # is dense in P(X) by the Baire Category Theorem.
    #
    # Step 3: Determine the cardinality of P(X).
    # A compact connected metric space X with more than one point has cardinality c
    # (the cardinality of the continuum).
    # The number of distinct convergent sequences in X, |P(X)|, can be shown to also be c.
    #
    # Step 4: P(X) is a perfect space.
    # The space P(X) has no isolated points. Any element can be perturbed to yield
    # a distinct, nearby element.
    #
    # Step 5: Conclude the cardinality of G.
    # A dense subset of a perfect space must have at least the cardinality of the space.
    # So, |G| >= |P(X)| = c.
    # Since G is a subset of P(X), |G| <= |P(X)| = c.
    # Thus, the cardinality of G is exactly c.
    # This is the only possible cardinality, so it is also the smallest.

    # The symbol 'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum.
    final_answer = "c"
