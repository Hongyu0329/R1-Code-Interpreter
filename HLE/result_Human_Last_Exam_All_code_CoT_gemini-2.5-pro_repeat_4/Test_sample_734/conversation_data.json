    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the key elements of your query:\n1.  **Christian theologian**: This specifies the field.\n2.  **first developed**: This points to an early, foundational figure in Christian thought, likely a Church Father.\n3.  **specialized terminology**: The figure must be known for creating a specific conceptual framework, not just general commentary.\n4.  **describe changes in the laws of nature**: The terminology must address how the regular, observable patterns of the world can be altered or superseded.\n5.  **applicable to both the virgin birth... and... the Fall**: The framework must be robust enough to explain both a specific miracle and a theorized systemic change in the natural order.\n\nBased on these points, the most prominent candidate is Augustine of Hippo. He developed a sophisticated theory of miracles and divine action that fits all the criteria. I will write a Python script to print his name and a brief explanation of his relevant concepts, such as the *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons).\n\n```python\ndef identify_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the theologian who developed\n    specialized terminology for changes in the laws of nature applicable\n    to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD) was the first major Christian theologian to develop a \"\n        \"specialized vocabulary for this purpose. He introduced the concept of 'seminal reasons' \"\n        \"(in Latin, 'rationes seminales'), which are the latent, causal principles of all things \"\n        \"that God embedded within creation from the beginning.\\n\\n\"\n        \"According to Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature \"\n        \"('contra naturam'), but rather an event that goes against the *known* course of nature \"\n        \"('contra quam est nota natura'). It is the activation by God of a potential that was \"\n        \"always present in creation but not part of its ordinary operation. This same framework \"\n        \"can be applied to understand the changes in the natural world after the Fall, viewing them \"\n        \"not as God rewriting laws, but as the consequences of sin activating different potentials \"\n        \"within the created order.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The theologian who first developed this terminology is: {theologian}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Concepts ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nidentify_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
