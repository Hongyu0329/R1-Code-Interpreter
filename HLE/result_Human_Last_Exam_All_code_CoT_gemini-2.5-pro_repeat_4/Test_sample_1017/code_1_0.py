# Step 1: Define the rotation numbers of g and h.
# g is translation by 2/27, so its rotation number is 2/27.
# h is translation by 16/27, so its rotation number is 16/27.
rot_g = Fraction(2, 27)
rot_h = Fraction(16, 27)

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the stable commutator length (scl).
# Based on the reasoning that the intended element is the commutator [g_1, h_2],
# we use the formula scl([g_1, h_2]) = (1/2) * |rot(g_1) * rot(h_2)|.
product_of_rots = rot_g * rot_h
scl_value = Fraction(1, 2) * abs(product_of_rots)

# Step 3: Print the final equation with all its components as requested.
print("We compute the scl for the commutator [g_1, h_2] using the formula involving rotation numbers.")
