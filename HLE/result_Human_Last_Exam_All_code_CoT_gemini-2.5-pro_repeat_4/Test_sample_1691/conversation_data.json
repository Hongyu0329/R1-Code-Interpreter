    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the integral**: The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$, where $P(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near the point where the denominator is smallest. The denominator, $\\epsilon + P(x)$, is smallest when $P(x)$ is smallest. For the given range $x \\in [0, 15]$, $P(x)$ has its minimum at $x=0$, where $P(0)=0$. Thus, the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Leading Term Approximation**: For very small $x$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is dominated by its lowest power term, i.e., $P(x) \\approx 9x^5$. The integral can be approximated by $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$. This integral can be solved exactly and gives the leading term of the asymptotic expansion, which is proportional to $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n3.  **Higher-Order Correction**: To get a more accurate approximation, we need to consider the next term in $P(x)$, which is $5x^6$. The influence of this and subsequent terms can be systematically calculated using a change of variables. Let's define a new variable $y$ such that $y^5 = P(x)$. For small $x$, we can find the series expansion for $x$ in terms of $y$.\n    $y(x) = (9x^5 + 5x^6 + \\dots)^{1/5} = (9x^5)^{1/5} (1 + \\frac{5}{9}x + \\dots)^{1/5} \\approx 9^{1/5}x (1 + \\frac{1}{5}\\frac{5}{9}x) = 9^{1/5}x + 9^{-4/5}x^2$.\n    Inverting this gives $x$ as a series in $y$: $x(y) \\approx 9^{-1/5}y - 9^{-7/5}y^2$.\n    The original integral can be rewritten as $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{y(15)} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + y^5} \\frac{dx}{dy} dy$.\n\n4.  **Asymptotic Expansion**: We expand the Jacobian $\\frac{dx}{dy} \\approx 9^{-1/5} - 2 \\cdot 9^{-7/5}y$ and integrate term by term. The integrals are of the form $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{y^k dy}{\\epsilon+y^5}$, which can be evaluated using standard formulas. This process yields an asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$ in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. We will compute the first two terms of this series.\n    - The first term (from the constant part of $dx/dy$) will be $C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n    - The second term (from the linear part of $dx/dy$) will be $C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n\n5.  **Final Formula**: The resulting analytical formula will be of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$. I will write a Python script to calculate the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ and print the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic expansion of the integral I(epsilon).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients and powers from the polynomial in the denominator\n    # P(x) = p1*x**n1 + p2*x**n2 + p3*x**n3\n    p1 = 9.0\n    n1 = 5.0\n    p2 = 5.0\n    n2 = 6.0\n    p3 = 9.0\n    n3 = 8.0\n\n    # The powers of epsilon in the expansion are determined by the powers of x in P(x).\n    # The first term in the expansion has power -(n1-1)/n1\n    # The second term has power -(n1-2)/n1 (since n2 = n1 + 1)\n    power1 = -(n1 - 1.0) / n1\n    power2 = -(n1 - 2.0) / n1\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient C1 for the leading term\n    # C1 = (pi / n1) / (p1**(1/n1) * sin(pi/n1))\n    C1 = (math.pi / n1) / (p1**(1.0/n1) * math.sin(math.pi/n1))\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient C2 for the second term\n    # The formula is derived from the change-of-variable method explained in the plan.\n    # C2 = -2 * (p2/p1) * (1/p1**(2/n1)) * (pi / n1) / sin(2*pi/n1)\n    # This simplifies to:\n    # C2 = -2 * pi * p2 / (n1 * p1**(1 + 2/n1) * sin(2*pi/n1))\n    # From the detailed derivation: C2 = 2*d2 * (pi / (n1*sin(2*pi/n1)))\n    # where d2 = -c2/c1**3, c1 = p1**(1/n1), c2 = p2/(n1*p1**(1-1/n1))\n    # This leads to C2 = -2 * (p2 * pi) / (n1 * p1**((n1+2)/n1) * math.sin(2*math.pi/n1))\n\n    # Based on the manual derivation: \n    # C2_coeff = 2*d2 * (pi / (n1*sin(2*pi/n1)))\n    # d2 = -9**(-7/5)\n    C2 = -2 * p1**(- (n1+2)/n1) * (p2/n1) * (math.pi / math.sin(2*math.pi/n1))\n    \n    # A simpler way to write the coefficient C2 is based on the derivation:\n    # C2 = -2 * p1**(-7.0/5.0) * (math.pi/(n1 * math.sin(2*math.pi/n1)))\n    # The coefficient of x**(n1+1) is p2.\n    # The general formula for the coefficient involves 2*d2, where d2 = -c2/c1**3\n    # c1 = p1**(1/n1), c2 = p2 / (n1 * p1**((n1-1)/n1))\n    # d2 = -(p2 / (n1 * p1**((n1-1)/n1))) / p1**(3/n1) = -p2 / (n1 * p1**((n1+2)/n1))\n    # Term is 2 * d2 * Integral(...)\n    # Integral is (pi / (n1*sin(2pi/n1))) * eps**((2-n1)/n1)\n    # So C2 = 2 * (-p2 / (n1 * p1**((n1+2)/n1))) * (pi / (n1 * math.sin(2*math.pi/n1)))\n    # Let's recalculate and simplify\n    term_in_d2 = p2/n1\n    d2_denom_p1_power = (n1-1)/n1 + 3/n1\n    \n    # Let's stick to the manually verified coefficients from the plan\n    # C1 = (pi / (5 * 9**(1/5) * sin(pi/5)))\n    # C2 = -2 * 9**(-7/5) * (pi / (5 * sin(2*pi/5)))\n    \n    C1_val = (math.pi / (n1 * p1**(1.0/n1) * math.sin(math.pi/n1)))\n    C2_val = -2 * p1**(- (n1+2.0)/n1) * p2 * (math.pi / n1) / math.sin(2.0*math.pi/n1)\n\n    # Let's output the values and the formula\n    print(f\"The integral can be approximated by the formula: I(eps) = C1 * eps**(-4/5) + C2 * eps**(-3/5)\")\n    print(f\"where the coefficients are:\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {C1_val:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {C2_val:.10f}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final formula with the numerical coefficients is:\")\n    final_formula = f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 {C1_val:.4f} * epsilon**(-{n1-1:.1f}/{n1:.1f}) + ({C2_val:.4f}) * epsilon**(-{n1-2:.1f}/{n1:.1f})\"\n    print(final_formula)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) â‰ˆ 0.6889 * epsilon**(-4.0/5.0) + (-0.0609) * epsilon**(-3.0/5.0)>>>"
