def solve():
    """
    This function explains the solution to the topological problem.
    The problem cannot be solved by a numerical calculation, as it involves
    reasoning about the properties of topological spaces and infinite sets.

    The analysis of the space's path-components shows that:
    1. The set of identified points, Q x {1}, forms a single path-component, P*.
    2. No other point in the space can be connected to P* by a path.
    3. Any path confined to the rest of the space must be a constant path (a single point).
    4. Therefore, every point other than P* is its own path-component.

    The task is to count these components. This means counting the number of points in the resulting space.
    - The set A = Q x D is countable.
    - The set B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D) is a product of two sets of continuum cardinality.
      Thus, B has continuum cardinality.
    - The total space X = A U B has continuum cardinality.
    - Identifying a countable number of points to a single point does not change the
      cardinality of the set. The resulting space Y still has continuum cardinality.

    The number of path-components is equal to the number of points in Y, which is
    the cardinality of the continuum.
