    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the structure of the Lie algebra**: The given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional and nilpotent. It can be seen as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^5$, where $\\mathbb{R}$ is spanned by $e_1$ and $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{h}$ spanned by $\\{e_2, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is given by the adjoint operator $D = \\text{ad}_{e_1}|_{\\mathfrak{h}}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**: For a semi-direct product like this, the spectral sequence provides a powerful tool to compute the cohomology $H^*(\\mathfrak{g})$. For this specific case, the sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page, which simplifies the calculation of the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\n3.  **Relate Betti numbers to a simpler problem**: The Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be expressed as $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker D^*_k) + \\dim(\\ker D^*_{k-1})$, where $D^*_k$ is the operator induced by $D$ on the $k$-th exterior power $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ of the dual space of $\\mathfrak{h}$. Let $k_j = \\dim(\\ker D^*_j)$. The formula becomes $b_k = k_k + k_{k-1}$ (with $k_{-1}=0$).\n\n4.  **Compute kernel dimensions**: The task is now reduced to computing the dimensions of the kernels of the linear maps $D^*_k: \\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h}^*) \\to \\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ for $k=0, \\ldots, 5$. This can be done computationally:\n    *   Represent the basis of the exterior algebra $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$.\n    *   Construct the matrix representation of the operator $D^*_k$ for each $k$.\n    *   Compute the rank of this matrix. The dimension of the kernel is then `dimension_of_space - rank`.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Poincaré polynomial**: Once the Betti numbers $b_0, \\ldots, b_6$ are calculated, the Poincaré polynomial is given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this plan to compute the coefficients and print the final polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef get_basis_map(dim, k):\n    \"\"\"Creates a basis for the k-th exterior power and a map to indices.\"\"\"\n    basis = list(combinations(range(dim), k))\n    basis_map = {b: i for i, b in enumerate(basis)}\n    return basis, basis_map\n\ndef apply_d_star(basis_element, d_star_on_h_star):\n    \"\"\"Applies the derivation D* to a basis element of the exterior algebra.\"\"\"\n    # basis_element is a tuple of sorted indices, e.g., (0, 2, 3)\n    result = {}\n    if not basis_element:\n        return {} # D*(1) = 0\n    \n    for i, elem_index in enumerate(basis_element):\n        # Apply Leibniz rule: D*(a^b) = (D*a)^b + (-1)^deg(a) a^(D*b)\n        # For D*(e_i1 ^ ... ^ e_ik), this is sum_j (-1)^(j-1) e_i1 ^ ... ^ D*(e_ij) ^ ...\n        \n        # Get the image of the basis vector under D*\n        image = d_star_on_h_star.get(elem_index, {})\n        \n        # Create the rest of the wedge product\n        remaining_elements = basis_element[:i] + basis_element[i+1:]\n        \n        for basis_vec, coeff in image.items():\n            # Add the new element and sort to get canonical form\n            new_wedge_list = sorted(list(remaining_elements) + [basis_vec])\n            \n            # Check for zero product (repeated elements)\n            if len(set(new_wedge_list)) != len(new_wedge_list):\n                continue\n\n            # Calculate sign from sorting\n            # This is a bit tricky, but for D* it's simpler.\n            # D*(a ^ b) = D*a ^ b + a ^ D*b\n            # D*(e_i1 ^ ... ^ e_ik) = sum_j e_i1 ^ ...
