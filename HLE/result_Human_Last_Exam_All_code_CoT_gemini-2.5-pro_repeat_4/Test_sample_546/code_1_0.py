# The problem simplifies to calculating 2 to the power of 81.
# Let's define the base and exponent.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result. Python handles large integers automatically.
result = base ** exponent

# As requested, output the numbers in the final simplified equation.
print(f"The simplified expression is {base} ** {exponent}.")
print(f"The calculated value is: {result}")
