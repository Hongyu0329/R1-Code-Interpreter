    # The board state:
    # Black pieces:  (2, 6), (4, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2)
    # White pieces: (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3,3), (2,2)

    # The goal is to eliminate all White stones.

    # Step 1: Analyze the situation.
    # The white stones are separated into several weak groups.
    # - Group 1: W(2, 5)
    # - Group 2: W(1, 4)
    # - Group 3: W(3, 4) and W(3, 3)
    # - Group 4: W(2, 2)
    # A single move that attacks multiple groups is ideal.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the options.
    # Move (2, 4) is the vital point. It is adjacent to three of the four white groups.
    # Let's analyze the consequences of Black playing at (2, 4).

    # Step 3: The sequence after Black plays at (2, 4).
    # 1. Black plays at (2, 4).
    #    - This immediately puts the white stone at (2, 5) into "atari" (it has only one liberty left, at (1, 5)).
    #    - White must play at (1, 5) to save it.
    # 2. White plays at (1, 5).
    #    - This connects W(2, 5) with W(1, 4). However, the new combined group {W(1,4), W(1,5), W(2,5)} is immediately in atari. Its only liberties are (1, 3) and (1, 6).
    # 3. Black can play at (1, 3) or (1, 6) to continue the attack. Let's say Black plays at (1, 3).
    #    - The white group now has only one liberty left at (1, 6).
    # 4. White must play at (1, 6) to save the group.
    #    - The group expands, but it is still in atari with only one liberty at (1, 7).
    # 5. Black plays at (1, 7).
    #    - This takes the last liberty, capturing the entire white group {W(1,4), W(1,5), W(1,6), W(2,5)}.

    # Step 4: Capturing the remaining stones.
    # After the first capture, the remaining white stones are at (3, 4), (3, 3), and (2, 2).
    # Black can continue the attack, forcing these stones into a "ladder".
    # This ladder is ultimately broken by the pre-existing Black stone at (4, 2), ensuring the remaining white stones are also captured.

    # Conclusion: The move (2, 4) is the only one that initiates a sequence to capture all white stones.
