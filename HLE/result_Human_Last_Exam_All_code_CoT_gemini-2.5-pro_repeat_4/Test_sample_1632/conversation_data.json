    "To find the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), we can use a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Lattice and Walk**: A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan (or square) lattice is a path that starts at the origin (0,0) and moves up, down, left, or right at each step, without visiting the same point more than once.\n2.  **Recursive Approach**: We can define a recursive function that explores all possible paths. This function will keep track of the current position `(x, y)`, the number of steps remaining, and the set of points already visited.\n3.  **Base Case**: The recursion stops when the number of steps remaining is zero. If a walk has successfully taken `n` steps without self-intersecting, it is a valid walk, and we count it as 1.\n4.  **Recursive Step**: From the current position, the function will try to move to each of the four adjacent neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, the function calls itself recursively for that new position, with the step count decreased by one and the visited set updated to include the new point. The results from these recursive calls are summed up.\n5.  **Symmetry Optimization**: A walk of `n` steps must start by moving in one of the four cardinal directions. Due to the grid's symmetry, the number of valid walks starting with a move to the right is the same as starting up, left, or down. Therefore, we can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., from (0,0) to (1,0)) and then multiply the final count by 4. This significantly reduces the computation.\n6.  **Memoization**: To further optimize, we can cache the results of our recursive function. The state of any sub-problem is uniquely defined by the current position, the steps remaining, and the path taken so far. We can use a dictionary to store the results for each state, avoiding redundant calculations for identical sub-paths.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate a(10).\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    # Memoization cache to store results of subproblems.\n    # The key is a tuple: (current_x, current_y, steps_left, frozenset_of_visited_points)\n    memo = {}\n\n    def count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        # Create a key for the memoization cache.\n        # The set of visited points must be converted to an immutable frozenset to be used as a dictionary key.\n        state = (x, y, steps_left, frozenset(visited))\n        if state in memo:\n            return memo[state]\n\n        total = 0\n        # Explore the four possible directions: up, down, left, right.\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # If the next point has not been visited, explore from there.\n            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                new_visited = visited.copy()\n                new_visited.add((nx, ny))\n                total += count_walks(nx, ny, steps_left - 1, new_visited)\n\n        # Cache the result for the current state and return it.\n        memo[state] = total\n        return total\n\n    # Initial setup:\n    # Start at the origin (0,0).\n    # Use symmetry: calculate for one initial direction and multiply by 4.\n    # We take the first step from (0,0) to (1,0).\n    # This leaves n-1 = 9 steps to be calculated.\n    start_x, start_y = 0, 0\n    first_step_x, first_step_y = 1, 0\n    \n    initial_visited = {(start_x, start_y), (first_step_x, first_step_y)}\n    steps_remaining = n - 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of walks for one initial direction.\n    walks_one_direction = count_walks(first_step_x, first_step_y, steps_remaining, initial_visited)\n\n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this result.\n    total_walks = 4 * walks_one_direction\n\n    print(f\"For a walk of length n={n}:\")\n    print(f\"Number of paths starting with a single direction (e.g., right): {walks_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of self-avoiding walks a({n}) = 4 * {walks_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<259140>>>\n```"
