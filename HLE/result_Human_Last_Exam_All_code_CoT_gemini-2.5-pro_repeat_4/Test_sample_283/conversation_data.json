    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of submatrices accessed when multiplying two matrices represented by a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree structure of depth 4.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Model the Multiplication:** The multiplication of two HSS matrices, `C = A * B`, can be defined by a recursive formula. At each level of the hierarchy, the matrices are treated as `2x2` block matrices.\n2.  **Define Sub-blocks:** For a matrix `M` at a given node in the tree, its `2x2` block representation consists of two diagonal sub-blocks (`M_11`, `M_22`) and two off-diagonal sub-blocks (`M_12`, `M_21`).\n3.  **Recursive Formula:** The standard block matrix multiplication formulas are:\n    *   `C_11 = A_11 * B_11 + A_12 * B_21`\n    *   `C_12 = A_11 * B_12 + A_12 * B_22`\n    *   `C_21 = A_21 * B_11 + A_22 * B_21`\n    *   `C_22 = A_21 * B_12 + A_22 * B_22`\n4.  **Derive Recurrence for Accesses:** Let `T(d)` be the total number of submatrix accesses for multiplying two HSS matrices of depth `d`.\n    *   The multiplication of diagonal blocks (`A_11 * B_11` and `A_22 * B_22`) are recursive calls on HSS matrices of depth `d-1`. The number of accesses for each is `T(d-1)`.\n    *   The other six multiplications involve at least one off-diagonal block. An off-diagonal block is a low-rank product, not a full HSS matrix. We'll count the access of any block (diagonal or off-diagonal) as a single access. Therefore, a product like `A_12 * B_21` involves accessing two submatrices.\n    *   Summing the accesses for the four `C` blocks:\n        *   Accesses for `C_11`: `T(d-1)` (for `A_11*B_11`) + 2 (for `A_12, B_21`)\n        *   Accesses for `C_12`: 2 (for `A_11, B_12`) + 2 (for `A_12, B_22`) = 4\n        *   Accesses for `C_21`: 2 (for `A_21, B_11`) + 2 (for `A_22, B_21`) = 4\n        *   Accesses for `C_22`: `T(d-1)` (for `A_22*B_22`) + 2 (for `A_21, B_12`)\n    *   Total accesses `T(d) = T(d-1) + 2 + 4 + 4 + T(d-1) + 2 = 2 * T(d-1) + 12`.\n5.  **Base Case:** For a tree of depth `d=0`, the matrices are single dense blocks (leaves of the tree). The multiplication `A * B` requires accessing two matrices. So, `T(0) = 2`.\n6.  **Calculation:** We will write a Python script to solve this recurrence relation for `d=4`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication_access():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two matrices represented by an HSS tree of depth 4.\n\n    The calculation is based on a recurrence relation derived from the\n    block matrix multiplication algorithm applied hierarchically.\n\n    Let T(d) be the number of submatrix accesses for a tree of depth d.\n    The recurrence relation is: T(d) = 2 * T(d-1) + 12\n    The base case (a leaf node, d=0) is: T(0) = 2\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n    \n    # Base case: T(0) for a leaf node (depth 0)\n    t_prev = 2\n    print(\"For a tree of depth d=0 (a single leaf block):\")\n    print(f\"T(0) = {t_prev}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Iteratively solve the recurrence for d = 1, 2, 3, 4\n    for d in range(1, depth + 1):\n        # Apply the recurrence relation: T(d) = 2 * T(d-1) + 12\n        t_current = 2 * t_prev + 12\n        \n        print(f\"Calculating for a tree of depth d={d}:\")\n        print(f\"T({d}) = 2 * T({d-1}) + 12\")\n        print(f\"T({d}) = 2 * {t_prev} + 12 = {2 * t_prev} + 12 = {t_current}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        \n        t_prev = t_current\n\n    print(f\"\\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with depth {depth}, the total number of submatrices accessed is {t_prev}.\")\n\nsolve_hss_multiplication_access()\n```\n<<<212>>>"
