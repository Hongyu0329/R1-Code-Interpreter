    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology. The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is determined by a well-known classification theorem. My plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  States the classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua.\n2.  Lists the specific, distinct classes of these mathematical objects according to the theorem.\n3.  Counts the number of items in this list to arrive at the final answer.\n4.  Prints the explanation and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the number of\n    homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    This is a known result from topology, not a problem that is solved via computation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the definitions.\")\n    print(\" - A 'continuum' is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\")\n    print(\" - 'Planar' means it can be embedded in the plane (ℝ²).\")\n    print(\" - 'Homogeneous' means the space looks the same from every point.\")\n    print(\" - A 'homeomorphism class' is a set of all spaces that are topologically equivalent.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: State the classification theorem.\")\n    print(\"A major theorem in topology classifies all homogeneous planar continua.\")\n    print(\"According to this theorem, every such continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: List the distinct classes.\n    classes = [\n        \"The point (this is the only degenerate case)\",\n        \"The circle\",\n        \"The pseudo-arc\",\n        \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The distinct homeomorphism classes are:\")\n    for i, desc in enumerate(classes, 1):\n        print(f\"  {i}. {desc}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Count the classes to find the final answer.\n    final_count = len(classes)\n\n    print(\"\\nBy counting the items in the list above, we get the total number of classes.\")\n    print(f\"The final count is {final_count}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_topology_question()\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
