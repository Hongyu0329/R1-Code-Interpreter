    This script models the evolutionary factors that allow a bacterium with a stable genome 
    to acquire drug resistance at a pace comparable to one with lateral gene transfer.
    
    The solution lies in a multi-step evolutionary process as described in answer B:
    1. A rare mutation confers resistance but may come with a fitness cost.
    2. A subsequent compensatory mutation alleviates this cost, making the resistant strain highly competitive.
    3. If the mutation also confers cross-resistance (resistance to multiple drugs), its selective advantage is magnified.
    
    This model calculates a conceptual "final fitness" for such an evolved strain.
