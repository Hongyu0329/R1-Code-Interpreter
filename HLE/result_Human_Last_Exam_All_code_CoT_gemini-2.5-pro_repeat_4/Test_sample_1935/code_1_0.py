    Solves for the ratio of the area of triangle KMN to the area of triangle ABC.

    The derivation shows that the ratio S_KMN / S_ABC can be expressed as:
    (S_DEF / S_ABC)^2

    Since S_DEF = r * s_DEF and S_ABC = R * s_ABC, where s denotes the semi-perimeter,
    the ratio can be written in terms of r, R, and the semi-perimeters.
