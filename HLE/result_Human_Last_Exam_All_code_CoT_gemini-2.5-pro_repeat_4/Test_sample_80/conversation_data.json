    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Number of Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has four edges. I will calculate the total number of squares along these edges, being careful not to double-count the corners.\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Bishops:** The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these edge squares so that no bishop can attack another. A key rule of chess is that bishops can only attack other pieces on squares of the same color. This means we can solve the problem for light-colored squares and dark-colored squares independently and then add the results.\n3.  **Calculate Bishops per Color:** I will determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the light-colored edge squares and the maximum number for the dark-colored ones.\n4.  **Calculate Empty Squares:** Finally, I will subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many are empty. The script will print this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many edge squares lack bishops when the maximum number of\n    non-attacking bishops are placed on the edge of an 8x8 chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An 8x8 board has 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom row,\n    # and 6 unique squares on each of the side columns (the corners are already counted).\n    squares_top_row = 8\n    squares_bottom_row = 8\n    squares_left_side_inner = 6\n    squares_right_side_inner = 6\n    total_edge_squares = squares_top_row + squares_bottom_row + squares_left_side_inner + squares_right_side_inner\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # Bishops can only attack pieces on the same color square. The 28 edge squares\n    # are split into 14 light squares and 14 dark squares. We can maximize\n    # the bishops on each color set independently.\n\n    # Through analysis of the attack patterns, the maximum number of non-attacking\n    # bishops that can be placed on the 14 light-colored edge squares is 7.\n    max_bishops_light_squares = 7\n\n    # Similarly, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed\n    # on the 14 dark-colored edge squares is 7.\n    max_bishops_dark_squares = 7\n\n    # The total maximum number of bishops is the sum from both color sets.\n    max_placed_bishops = max_bishops_light_squares + max_bishops_dark_squares\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares without bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_placed_bishops\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board is {total_edge_squares}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these squares is {max_placed_bishops}.\")\n    print(\"The number of squares lacking bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of placed bishops.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_placed_bishops} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
