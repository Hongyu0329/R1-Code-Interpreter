    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the formula:** The number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single planar surface code patch is determined by the number of holes (`h`) it has. The formula is `k = 1 + h`.\n2.  **Define the system:** We have a system composed of two separate surface code patches. The total number of logical qubits in the system is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n3.  **Apply the constraints:** We are given a total of two holes to distribute between the two patches. Let `h1` be the number of holes in the first patch and `h2` be the number of holes in the second. This gives us `h1 + h2 = 2`.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of logical qubits will be `k_total = (1 + h1) + (1 + h2)`. By simplifying, this becomes `k_total = 2 + (h1 + h2)`. Since `h1 + h2` is fixed at 2, the total number of logical qubits is always `2 + 2 = 4`, regardless of how the holes are distributed (e.g., 2 holes in one patch and 0 in the other, or 1 hole in each).\n5.  **Code the calculation:** Write a Python script to perform and display this calculation, showing the numbers in the final equation as requested.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the maximum number of logical qubits based on this logic.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the system\nnum_patches = 2\ntotal_holes = 2\n\n# The formula for logical qubits 'k' in a single patch with 'h' holes is k = 1 + h.\n# The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all patches.\n# k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = (1 + h1) + (1 + h2)\n# Since h1 + h2 must equal total_holes, the result is constant.\n# We can demonstrate this by choosing one possible distribution for the holes.\n# Let's put all holes in the first patch.\nholes_in_patch1 = 2\nholes_in_patch2 = 0\n\n# Calculate the number of logical qubits for each patch\nqubits_in_patch1 = 1 + holes_in_patch1\nqubits_in_patch2 = 1 + holes_in_patch2\n\n# Calculate the total number of logical qubits\ntotal_logical_qubits = qubits_in_patch1 + qubits_in_patch2\n\nprint(\"To find the maximum number of logical qubits, we calculate the total based on the number of patches and holes.\")\nprint(\"We have 2 patches and 2 holes in total.\")\nprint(\"\\nLet's use one possible distribution: {} holes in Patch 1 and {} holes in Patch 2.\".format(holes_in_patch1, holes_in_patch2))\nprint(\"The number of logical qubits for each patch is calculated as '1 + number_of_holes'.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation to calculate the total is:\")\nprint(\"Total Logical Qubits = (1 + {}) + (1 + {}) = {}\".format(holes_in_patch1, holes_in_patch2, total_logical_qubits))\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
