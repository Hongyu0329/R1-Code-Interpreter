    "My plan is to find the answer by consulting my knowledge base, which includes information from paleontological research papers describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The primary source for this anatomical detail is the 2002 paper by Sues et al. titled \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\". I will then create a Python script that stores this number in a variable and prints the answer in a clear sentence as you requested.\n\n```python\n# The information about the anatomy of Irritator challengeri is derived from scientific papers.\n# Specifically, the description of the holotype skull (SMNS 58022) notes the features of the lacrimal bone.\n\n# According to the scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), the lacrimal recess contains two accessory pneumatic foramina, which are depressions.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The following code will print the final answer.\nprint(f\"Based on paleontological findings, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
