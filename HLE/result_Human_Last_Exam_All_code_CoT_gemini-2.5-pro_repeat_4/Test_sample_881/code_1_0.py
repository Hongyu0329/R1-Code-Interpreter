    """
    Identifies the reactant for a given organic chemistry synthesis problem.

    The problem describes the formation of 1-methyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one
    from a precursor compound treated with potassium hydroxide. This reaction is a classic
    intramolecular aldol condensation, the second step of a Robinson annulation.

    The precursor is the Michael adduct of 2-methylcyclohexanone and methyl vinyl ketone.
    This function returns the name of this precursor compound.
    """
    # The product is a known Robinson Annulation product.
    # The reaction starts with a Michael addition, followed by a base-catalyzed intramolecular aldol condensation.
    # The starting materials for the Michael addition are 2-methylcyclohexanone and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
    # The Michael addition product is the compound that is then cyclized by KOH.
    # The name of this Michael adduct is 2-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexan-1-one.
