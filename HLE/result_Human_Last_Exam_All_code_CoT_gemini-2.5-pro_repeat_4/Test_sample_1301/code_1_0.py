    This function provides the SMILES string for a molecule that meets all the specified criteria.
    The molecule with the formula C12H18O6 is designed as a rigid, tricyclic ketone.

    The properties of the designed molecule are:
    - Molecular Formula: C12H18O6
    - Molecular Weight: 258.1104 g/mol (matches target)
    - Heavy Atom Count: 18 (12 Carbon, 6 Oxygen)
    - Valence Electron Count: 102 (12*4 + 18*1 + 6*6 = 48 + 18 + 36 = 102)
    - Formal Charge: 0
    - Degree of Unsaturation: 4 (3 rings + 1 carbonyl)
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (1 carbonyl oxygen, 5 ether oxygens)
    - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors: 6 (all oxygens)
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 0
    - Rings: 3 saturated heterocycles, forming a fused tricyclic system.
    - Rotatable Bonds: 0 (all heavy atoms are part of the rigid ring system)
    - Functional Groups: Contains 1 ketone and 5 ethers, with no forbidden groups.
