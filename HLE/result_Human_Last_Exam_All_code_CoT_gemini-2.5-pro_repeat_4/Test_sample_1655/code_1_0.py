    # --- 1. Define Symbolic Representations ---

    # Let 'r' be a symbol for spatial coordinates (x, y).
    r = sympy.Symbol('r')

    # u(r) is the complex scalar field of the input beam. It has a fixed linear
    # polarization, so it's our single channel of control.
    u = sympy.Function('u')(r)

    # A(r) and B(r) are the two arbitrary, independent complex scalar fields
    # for the x and y polarization components of our target arbitrary vector beam.
    A = sympy.Function('A')(r)
    B = sympy.Function('B')(r)

    # --- 2. Model the Linear Optical System ---

    # The entire optical system is linear. We can represent its action with
    # symbolic linear operators, L_xx and L_yx.
    # L_xx(u) gives the output x-component from input u.
    # L_yx(u) gives the output y-component from input u.
    L_xx = sympy.Function('L_xx')
    L_yx = sympy.Function('L_yx')

    # The output vector beam [E_out_x, E_out_y] is generated from the input u.
    E_out_x = L_xx(u)
    E_out_y = L_yx(u)

    # --- 3. Test if an Arbitrary Output is Possible ---

    # To get our desired output [A, B], we must satisfy two conditions:
    # Condition 1: E_out_x = A(r)  =>  L_xx(u) = A(r)
    # Condition 2: E_out_y = B(r)  =>  L_yx(u) = B(r)

    # From Condition 1, we must choose our input `u` to satisfy the equation.
    # Let's represent the inverse operator of L_xx as L_xx_inv.
    L_xx_inv = sympy.Function('L_xx_inv')
    # To get the target output A, the required input u must be:
    u_required = L_xx_inv(A)

    # Now, let's see what the resulting y-component is when we use this specific input.
    # We substitute u_required into the expression for the output y-component.
    y_component_resulting = L_yx(u_required)

    # For our output to be the arbitrary vector beam [A, B], this resulting
    # y-component must be equal to our arbitrary target B. This imposes a constraint:
    constraint_equation = sympy.Eq(B, y_component_resulting)

    # --- 4. Conclusion and Output ---

    print("An arbitrary vector beam requires two independent spatial fields, A(r) and B(r), for its orthogonal polarization components.")
    print("The input to the system is a single scalar field, u(r), as the polarization is fixed.")
    print("\nAs shown by the derivation below, the two output components are not independent. The choice of the input field `u` to create the desired x-component `A(r)` fully determines the resulting y-component. Therefore, an arbitrary field B(r) cannot be chosen independently.")
