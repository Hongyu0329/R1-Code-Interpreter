The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.

The Formula:
Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])

Explanation of each component:

1.  Z:
    The partition function of the system, which encodes its statistical properties at a given temperature.

2.  ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ]:
    This represents the Feynman path integral. It is a sum (integral) over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ and its conjugate ψ̄ throughout spacetime. These fields are not ordinary functions but are valued in a Grassmann algebra, which mathematically captures the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g., ψ_i * ψ_j = -ψ_j * ψ_i).

3.  exp:
    The exponential function. The term it contains is often called the "Boltzmann weight" for a given field configuration.

4.  S_E[ψ̄, ψ]:
    This is the Euclidean action of the system. It is obtained from the standard Minkowskian action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). It is defined as an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (L_E) over imaginary time (τ) and space (x):
    S_E = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ ∫ d³x L_E(ψ̄, ψ, ∂ψ̄, ∂ψ)

5.  β (Implicit in S_E and boundary conditions):
    This is the inverse temperature, defined as β = 1 / (k_B * T), where T is the temperature and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. The imaginary time coordinate τ runs from 0 to β.

Boundary Conditions:
A crucial aspect for fermions is that the path integral is performed over fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This arises from the anti-commuting nature of fermionic operators.
ψ(τ = β, x) = -ψ(τ = 0, x)
ψ̄(τ = β, x) = -ψ̄(τ = 0, x)
