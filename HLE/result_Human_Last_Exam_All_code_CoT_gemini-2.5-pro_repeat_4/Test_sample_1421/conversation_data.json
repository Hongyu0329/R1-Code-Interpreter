    "My plan is to provide the formula for the fermionic partition function using a Python script. The script will define a multi-line string that contains the formula written in a clear, readable format, along with a detailed explanation of each symbol and the necessary boundary conditions. This approach satisfies the request to \"output each number in the final equation\" by defining every component of the formula. The script will then print this explanatory string to the console.\n\n```python\ndef fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    formula_explanation = \"\"\"\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\nThe Formula:\nZ = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\n\nExplanation of each component:\n\n1.  Z:\n    The partition function of the system, which encodes its statistical properties at a given temperature.\n\n2.  ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ]:\n    This represents the Feynman path integral. It is a sum (integral) over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ and its conjugate ψ̄ throughout spacetime. These fields are not ordinary functions but are valued in a Grassmann algebra, which mathematically captures the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g., ψ_i * ψ_j = -ψ_j * ψ_i).\n\n3.  exp:\n    The exponential function. The term it contains is often called the \"Boltzmann weight\" for a given field configuration.\n\n4.  S_E[ψ̄, ψ]:\n    This is the Euclidean action of the system. It is obtained from the standard Minkowskian action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). It is defined as an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (L_E) over imaginary time (τ) and space (x):\n    S_E = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ ∫ d³x L_E(ψ̄, ψ, ∂ψ̄, ∂ψ)\n\n5.  β (Implicit in S_E and boundary conditions):\n    This is the inverse temperature, defined as β = 1 / (k_B * T), where T is the temperature and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. The imaginary time coordinate τ runs from 0 to β.\n\nBoundary Conditions:\nA crucial aspect for fermions is that the path integral is performed over fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This arises from the anti-commuting nature of fermionic operators.\nψ(τ = β, x) = -ψ(τ = 0, x)\nψ̄(τ = β, x) = -ψ̄(τ = 0, x)\n\"\"\"\n    \n    print(formula_explanation)\n\nfermionic_partition_function_formula()\n```\n<<<Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])>>>"
