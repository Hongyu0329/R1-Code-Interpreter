    This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem about ultrafilters.
    The problem is not computational, so this code simply prints the answer
    derived from set-theoretic arguments.

    The question asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of
    nonprincipal ultrafilters on N, all of which are below a fixed nonprincipal
    ultrafilter V with respect to the Rudin-Keisler order restricted to
    finite-to-one nondecreasing functions.

    The cardinality is 2 to the power of aleph-null, also known as the
    cardinality of the continuum.
