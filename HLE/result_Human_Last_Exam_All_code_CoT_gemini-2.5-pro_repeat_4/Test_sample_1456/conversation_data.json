    "This is a problem from the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. To solve it, we don't need to perform a numerical calculation but rather follow a logical deduction based on established theorems. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: I will start by clarifying the definitions of a continuum, a nondegenerate continuum, and a composant.\n2.  **Connect Composants to Decomposability**: I will explain the fundamental relationship between the number of composants a continuum has and its property of being decomposable or indecomposable.\n3.  **Analyze the Product Space**: The core of the problem is to determine if the product of two nondegenerate continua, let's call them `X` and `Y`, is decomposable or can be indecomposable.\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Theorem**: I will state a key theorem from continuum theory about the decomposability of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: Based on the theorem, I will determine the number of composants for the product space `X x Y` and thus find the largest possible value.\n6.  **Provide a Python Script**: Finally, I will encapsulate this reasoning into a Python script that prints the step-by-step explanation and the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the largest possible number of\n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the terms\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the problem's definitions.\")\n    print(\"  - A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\")\n    print(\"  - A nondegenerate continuum is one with more than one point.\")\n    print(\"  - A composant of a continuum is a maximal set of points that can be connected by proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Relate the number of composants to decomposability\n    print(\"Step 2: Linking the number of composants to a key property.\")\n    print(\"  The number of composants of a continuum depends on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\")\n    print(\"  - A decomposable continuum (can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) has exactly 1 composant.\")\n    print(\"  - An indecomposable continuum has uncountably many (c, the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Posing the central question\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the product space X x Y.\")\n    print(\"  The problem asks for the largest possible number of composants for the product space Z = X x Y,\")\n    print(\"  where X and Y are two nondegenerate continua.\")\n    print(\"  This means we need to determine if Z is always decomposable or if it can be indecomposable.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Stating the decisive theorem\n    print(\"Step 4: Applying a fundamental theorem from continuum theory.\")\n    print(\"  A well-established theorem states: The product of any two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable.\")\n    print(\"  This holds true even if the individual continua, X and Y, are themselves indecomposable.\")\n    print(\"  The reason, in short, is that one can always decompose one of the factor spaces (e.g., Y)\")\n    print(\"  into two proper subcontinua Y1 and Y2 whose union is Y.
