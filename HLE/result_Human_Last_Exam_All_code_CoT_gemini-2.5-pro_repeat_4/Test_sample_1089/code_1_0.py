    # This process is specifically for adding material where it has been lost.
    # Blade Tip Rub and Wear is the direct loss of material from the blade's tip due to contact with the engine casing.
    # The standard repair is to weld material back onto the tip to restore its length and proper clearance.
    # This makes it the most fitting answer for a "build-up" repair process.
