# The problem is to find the number of tuples of sets (S1, S2, S3, S4)
# that satisfy the given conditions.
# Based on the analysis, we determine the number of choices for each set.

# Step 1: Determine the number of choices for S1.
# |S1| = 1 and 1 in S1 implies S1 = {1}.
choices_for_s1 = 1

# Step 2: Determine the number of choices for S2.
# |S2| = 2, S1 subset S2, and 2 in S2 implies S2 = {1, 2}.
choices_for_s2 = 1

# Step 3: Determine the number of choices for S3.
# |S3| = 3, S2 subset S3, and 3 in S3 implies S3 = {1, 2, 3}.
choices_for_s3 = 1

# Step 4: Determine the number of choices for S4.
# |S4| = 4 and S3 subset S4. S4 must be S3 union {k} where k is in {4, 5}.
# This gives two possibilities for S4: {1, 2, 3, 4} or {1, 2, 3, 5}.
choices_for_s4 = 2

# The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices at each step.
total_count = choices_for_s1 * choices_for_s2 * choices_for_s3 * choices_for_s4

# Print the breakdown of the calculation.
print(f"Number of choices for S1: {choices_for_s1}")
print(f"Number of choices for S2: {choices_for_s2}")
print(f"Number of choices for S3: {choices_for_s3}")
print(f"Number of choices for S4: {choices_for_s4}")
print("The final equation for the total number of sets is:")
print(f"{choices_for_s1} * {choices_for_s2} * {choices_for_s3} * {choices_for_s4} = {total_count}")
