    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, we will follow a plan that reduces the problem from an infinite group to a simple finite group calculation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Utilize Group Theory Properties:** A subgroup `H` of a group `G` with index 4 means the quotient group `G/H` has an order of 4. A key fact is that all groups of order 4 are abelian.\n2.  **Connect to Abelianization:** If the quotient `G/H` is abelian, then the subgroup `H` must contain the commutator subgroup of `G`, denoted `[G, G]`. This allows us to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Œì) and the subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, `Œì/[Œì, Œì]`.\n3.  **Use Known Result for Grigorchuk Group:** The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is a well-established result in group theory: `Œì/[Œì, Œì]` is isomorphic to the group `(‚Ñ§/2‚Ñ§)¬≥`. This is a finite group of order 8.\n4.  **Solve the Simpler Problem:** The problem is now simplified to finding the number of subgroups of index 4 in `(‚Ñ§/2‚Ñ§)¬≥`.\n5.  **Calculate Subgroup Order:** A subgroup of index 4 in a group of order 8 must have an order of `8 / 4 = 2`.\n6.  **Count Subgroups of Order 2:** The task is now to count the number of subgroups of order 2 in `(‚Ñ§/2‚Ñ§)¬≥`. This is equivalent to counting 1-dimensional subspaces in a 3-dimensional vector space over the finite field with two elements, ùîΩ‚ÇÇ.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over a field ùîΩ_q is given by the formula `(q^n - 1) / (q - 1)`. We will apply this formula with `n=3` and `q=2`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, explaining the steps and printing the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_subgroups_index_4_grigorchuk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group\n    by reducing the problem to counting subgroups in its abelianization.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Œì).\")\n    print(\"The solution relies on the following group-theoretic arguments:\")\n    print(\"1.
