    "My plan is to address this classic mycology trivia question. A truly sky-blue or distinctly blue spore print is not known to exist in the fungal kingdom; this is a common misconception. However, there is one genus that is famously associated with the color blue due to a strong blue-staining reaction when bruised, and it produces a spore print of a dark purplish-black color, which is the closest to a \"blue\" spore print found in mushrooms. I will identify this genus and provide a Python script to print its name.\n\n```python\n# The question refers to a common piece of mycology trivia.\n# While no known mushroom genus produces a truly sky-blue spore print,\n# the genus Psilocybe is famous for its blue-staining reaction upon bruising.\n# Its spore print is typically a dark purple-brown to purplish-black,\n# which is the closest and most commonly cited answer for a \"blue\" spore print.\n\ngenus_name = \"Psilocybe\"\nprint(genus_name)\n```\n<<<Psilocybe>>>"
