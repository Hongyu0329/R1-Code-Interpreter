    "To solve this problem, we will use a fundamental result from topology and differential geometry called Morse Theory. Morse Theory relates the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the topological properties of the manifold itself.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the manifold:** The problem is about a function on the 2-torus, $T^2$.\n2.  **Recall Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold, $b_k$. That is, $c_k \\ge b_k$.\n3.  **Determine Betti Numbers for the Torus:** We need to find the Betti numbers ($b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$) for the 2-torus.\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components is 1.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of independent non-bounding loops (or \"holes\") is 2.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of enclosed \"voids\" is 1.\n4.  **Calculate the Lower Bound:** The total number of critical points for a Morse function must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers: $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$.\n5.  **Confirm the Minimum:** We need to confirm that this theoretical lower bound can actually be achieved by a smooth function. A standard example is the height function on a torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has exactly one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum, for a total of 4 critical points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number based on the Betti numbers of the torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse Theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem can be solved using Morse Theory, which relates the topology of a manifold to the critical points of a smooth function on it.\")\n    print(\"The manifold is the 2-torus (T^2).\\n\")\n\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    b0 = 1\n    # b_1: number of 1-dimensional holes (genus * 2 for a surface)\n    b1 = 2\n    # b_2: number of 2-dimensional voids\n    b2 = 1\n\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers of the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"According to the Morse inequalities, for any Morse function, the number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(\"c_0 >= b_0, c_1 >= b_1, c_2 >= b_2\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimal total number of critical points is the sum of the Betti numbers.\")\n\n    # The minimal number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    # This is also the minimum for any smooth function.\n    min_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n\n    # Output the final equation as requested\n    print(\"\\nThe minimal number of critical points is given by the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
