    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Feynman Diagram:** Based on your description, the Feynman diagram consists of two vertices and four lines (propagators) resulting from four field contractions. The most common topology that fits this description, especially in a theory like $\\lambda\\phi^4$, is a vacuum diagram where two vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators. This is sometimes called a \"double-scoop\" or \"setting-sun\" vacuum diagram.\n\n2.  **Determine the Sources of Symmetry:** The symmetry factor, `S`, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. In simpler terms, it's the number of ways you can permute the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) without changing the diagram's overall structure. For this specific diagram, we have two sources of symmetry:\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices arise from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian, making them identical. We can swap their positions without changing the diagram.\n    *   **Line Permutations:** The four propagators connect the same two vertices, making them topologically equivalent. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of permutations from each source of symmetry.\n    *   The number of permutations for `n` identical items is `n!` (n factorial).\n    *   Symmetry from `2` identical vertices = `2!`.\n    *   Symmetry from `4` identical lines = `4!`.\n    *   Total Symmetry Factor `S = 2! * 4!`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that calculates this value and prints out each step of the calculation, including the final equation and result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two identical\n    vertices connected by four identical lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices in the diagram\n    num_identical_vertices = 2\n    \n    # Number of identical lines (propagators) connecting the vertices\n    num_identical_lines = 4\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry contribution from permuting the vertices\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_identical_vertices)\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetry contribution from permuting the lines\n    line_symmetry = math.factorial(num_identical_lines)\n    \n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these contributions\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * line_symmetry\n\n    print(\"This calculation is for a Feynman diagram with 2 identical vertices and 4 identical lines.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1.
