    Solves for the largest real number r based on the problem description.

    The problem asks for the largest real number r such that for a specific
    decomposition of a 4x4 square into 16 unit-area polygons, any axis-aligned
    unit square S within the 4x4 square intersects at least one polygon in an
    area of at least r.

    Let the 4x4 square be the region [0, 4] x [0, 4].
    Let the decomposition be P_1, P_2, ..., P_16, each with Area(P_i) = 1.
    Let S be any unit square [x, x+1] x [y, y+1] with 0 <= x, y <= 3.

    The condition is: For any S, max_i(Area(S ∩ P_i)) >= r.
    The value of r for a given decomposition is r = min_S(max_i(Area(S ∩ P_i))).
    We want to find the decomposition that maximizes r.
