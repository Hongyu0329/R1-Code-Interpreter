    "A robust and secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed using BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures. The core idea is that partial signatures created by individual participants can be mathematically combined to form a valid signature for the group's master public key, without ever reconstructing the master private key.\n\nHere is the plan for the scheme:\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Key Generation (One-time Setup)**\n    *   A trusted dealer (or a Distributed Key Generation protocol, for a trustless setup) is used to create a secret polynomial `f(x)` of degree `t-1`.\n    *   The master secret key is `sk = f(0)`. The master public key is `PK = sk * G`, where `G` is a generator point on an elliptic curve.\n    *   Each of the `n` participants receives a unique private key share `sk_i = f(i)` for their index `i`. From this, a public verification key `PK_i = sk_i * G` can be computed for each participant.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Signing Protocol (Two Rounds)**\n    *   **Round 1: Partial Signature Broadcast**\n        *   When a message `m` needs to be signed, a group of at least `t` participants agrees to sign.\n        *   Each participant `i` computes a partial signature `σ_i = sk_i * H(m)`, where `H(m)` is the hash of the message mapped to a point on the curve.\n        *   Each participant then broadcasts their partial signature `σ_i` to the other signers or to a designated combiner.\n    *   **Round 2: Signature Aggregation and Finalization**\n        *   A combiner (who can be one of the participants or an external party) collects at least `t` partial signatures.\n        *   The combiner verifies each partial signature `σ_i` against the sender's public key `PK_i`. This provides robustness against malicious signers submitting invalid data.\n        *   The combiner then computes Lagrange coefficients (`L_i`) for the indices of the `t` valid signers.\n        *   The final signature is calculated by combining the partial signatures: `σ = Σ (L_i * σ_i)`. This final `σ` is a valid signature for the master public key `PK`.\n\nThis design is highly secure because no single party ever knows the master secret key. It's robust because the combiner can discard invalid partial signatures and still succeed as long as `t` valid ones are available. The signing process is completed in just two rounds of communication.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this scheme. It uses the `py_ecc` library for the underlying elliptic curve cryptography (BLS12-381).\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Dict\n\n# py_ecc is required.
