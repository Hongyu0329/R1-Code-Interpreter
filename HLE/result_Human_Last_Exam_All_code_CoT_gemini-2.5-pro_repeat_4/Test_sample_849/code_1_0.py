def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The problem states that the set of successful predictors is uncomputable.
    This means that a priori proof of predictive success is not possible.
    Therefore, the model M cannot have "predictive success" as its goal.

    A safe goal must be something that is achievable under these conditions.
    The model receives information at each step about whether its predictions
    were correct or incorrect. This information stream is 'feedback'.

    The model is capable of 'in-context learning', meaning it can adapt its
    prediction strategy based on the ongoing feedback. This process of
    'learning how to learn' or optimizing a learning strategy based on
    performance is called 'Meta-learning'.

    Thus, the safe goal is to perform Meta-learning from the available feedback.
