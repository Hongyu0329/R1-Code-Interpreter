    This function calculates the two requested values based on the physics of continuum crystal models.

    A. What is the dimension of pi's fibers?
    B. How many coefficients specify E?
    """

    # Part A: The dimension of the fiber.
    # The connection C represents the local crystal structure. In continuum mechanics, this is
    # the distortion tensor, a field of 3x3 matrices. The fiber of the bundle is the
    # space of possible values at a single point, which is the space of 3x3 matrices.
    # The dimension of this space is 3 * 3 = 9.
    dimension_of_fiber = 9

    # Part B: The number of coefficients in the energy functional E.
    # The energy E must be a quadratic form to produce linear dynamics. To detect dislocations,
    # it must depend on the curl of the distortion tensor C, which is the dislocation density
    # tensor alpha. The lowest degree homogeneous polynomial satisfying these conditions is
    # quadratic in alpha (E ~ alpha^2).
    #
    # We need to find the number of independent coefficients in a general quadratic form of a
    # 3x3 tensor alpha that is invariant under cubic crystal symmetry.
    # This is equivalent to finding the number of independent quadratic invariants.
    # A general 3x3 tensor (9 components) can be split into a symmetric part (6 components)
    # and an antisymmetric part (3 components). Under cubic symmetry, these parts transform
    # independently.
    #
    # 1. For the symmetric part, the number of independent quadratic invariants is equal to the
    #    number of elastic constants for a cubic crystal, which is 3.
    # 2. For the antisymmetric part (an axial vector), a quadratic form must be isotropic
    #    (proportional to the vector's magnitude squared), giving 1 independent coefficient.
    #
    # The total number of coefficients is the sum of these.
    num_coefficients = 3 + 1

    # The final answer is the pair of numbers.
    print(f"{dimension_of_fiber} {num_coefficients}")
