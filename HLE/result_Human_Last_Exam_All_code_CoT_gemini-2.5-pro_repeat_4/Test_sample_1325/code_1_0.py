    print("The presence of dominance variance (Vd) in one species but not the other represents a fundamental difference in genetic architecture. This directly impacts the calculation of phenotypic variance (Vp) and thus changes the value of narrow-sense heritability (h^2). It also creates a meaningful distinction between H^2 and h^2, which did not exist in the purely additive rabbit model. Therefore, choice E is the best explanation.")
