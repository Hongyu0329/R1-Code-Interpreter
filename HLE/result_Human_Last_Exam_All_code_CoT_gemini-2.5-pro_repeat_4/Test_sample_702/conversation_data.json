    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This requires a step-by-step analysis of the homotopy groups of the source and target spaces and the homomorphism induced by the map.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the spaces**: Let $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ be the source space and $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ be the target space. We'll simplify the expression for $B$.\n2.  **Define Connectivity**: A map $f: A \\to B$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n3.  **Compute Connectivity of Spaces**: We'll find the connectivity of $A$ and $B$. The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted `conn(X)`, is the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(X)=0$ for all $i \\le n$. This will give us a baseline for the connectivity of the map $f$.\n4.  **Analyze the First Non-Trivial Homotopy Groups**: We'll compute the first non-trivial homotopy groups of $A$ and $B$ and analyze the map $f_*$ between them. This relies on a standard result in homotopy theory regarding this specific map.\n5.  **Analyze the Next Homotopy Groups**: We will compute the homotopy groups of $A$ and $B$ in the next dimension to determine if the map is surjective, which will give us the final connectivity. This step involves using the James splitting theorem for loop spaces.\n6.  **Conclude**: Based on the definition of connectivity, we will determine the final integer value.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the reasoning based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    It prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Step 1: Identify the spaces and define connectivity ###\")\n    print(\"Let the source space be A = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n    print(\"The target space is B = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    s4_dim = 4\n    s6_dim = 6\n    smash_dim = s4_dim + s6_dim\n    print(f\"Since S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^{s4_dim + s6_dim} = S^{smash_dim},\")\n    print(f\"the target space B is homotopy equivalent to Omega S^{smash_dim}.\")\n    print(\"\\nDefinition: A map f: A -> B is k-connected if f_* on pi_i is an\")\n    print(\"isomorphism for i < k and a surjection for i = k.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n### Step 2: Compute the connectivity of the spaces A and B ###\")\n    conn_omega_s4 = s4_dim - 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of Omega S^{s4_dim} is {s4_dim} - 2 = {conn_omega_s4}.\")\n    conn_omega_s6 = s6_dim - 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of Omega S^{s6_dim} is {s6_dim} - 2 = {conn_omega_s6}.\")\n    \n    conn_smash_omega = conn_omega_s4 + conn_omega_s6 + 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of a smash product X wedge Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\")\n    print(f\"So, conn(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) = {conn_omega_s4} + {conn_omega_s6} + 1 = {conn_smash_omega}.\")\n\n    conn_A = conn_smash_omega + 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of a suspension Sigma(X) is conn(X) + 1.\")\n    print(f\"So, conn(A) = {conn_smash_omega} + 1 = {conn_A}.\")\n\n    conn_B = smash_dim - 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the target space B = Omega S^{smash_dim} is {smash_dim} - 2 = {conn_B}.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nBoth A and B are {conn_A}-connected.
