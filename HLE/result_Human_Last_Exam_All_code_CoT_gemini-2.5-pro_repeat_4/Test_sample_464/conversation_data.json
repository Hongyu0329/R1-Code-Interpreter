    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation for the solution, presented as a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The problem asks whether a Schwartz function $f(x)$ must be zero if all its moments, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$, are zero for $k=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n2.  I will first show that this condition implies that the integral of $f(x)$ against *any* polynomial $P(x)$ is also zero.\n3.  Next, using the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, I will extend this result from polynomials to any continuous function with compact support, let's call it $\\phi(x)$. I'll show that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\phi(x) f(x) dx = 0$.\n4.  Finally, I will use a proof by contradiction. If we assume $f(x)$ is not zero everywhere, we can construct a specific continuous function $\\phi_0(x)$ for which the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\phi_0(x) f(x) dx$ is non-zero. This contradiction will prove that $f(x)$ must be zero.\n5.
