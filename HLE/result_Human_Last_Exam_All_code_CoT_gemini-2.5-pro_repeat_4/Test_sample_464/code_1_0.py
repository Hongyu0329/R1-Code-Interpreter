    print("--------------------")

    print("\nStep 1: Integrals against Polynomials")
    print("The given condition is that for all k in {0, 1, 2, ...}, we have:")
    print("  Integral(x^k * f(x) dx) = 0")
    print("Any polynomial P(x) can be written as a sum: P(x) = c_0 + c_1*x + c_2*x^2 + ... + c_n*x^n.")

    print("  Integral(P(x) * f(x) dx) = Sum_{k=0 to n} [c_k * Integral(x^k * f(x) dx)]")
    print("Since each integral term is 0, the sum is:")
    print("  = Sum_{k=0 to n} [c_k * 0] = 0")
    print("Thus, the integral of f(x) against any polynomial is zero.")

    print("\nStep 2: Extending to Continuous Functions with Compact Support")
    print("Let phi(x) be any continuous function with compact support (i.e., phi(x) = 0 outside some interval [-M, M]).")
    print("The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem states that we can find a sequence of polynomials, P_n(x), that converges uniformly to phi(x) on [-M, M].")
    print("This means that max|phi(x) - P_n(x)| on [-M, M] approaches 0 as n -> infinity.")

    print("\nStep 3: Proving the Integral is Zero")
    print("We want to show that Integral(phi(x) * f(x) dx) = 0.")
    print("From Step 1, we know Integral(P_n(x) * f(x) dx) = 0 for all n.")
    print("Let's look at the limit:")
    print("  |Integral(phi(x)f(x) dx) - Integral(P_n(x)f(x) dx)| = |Integral([phi(x) - P_n(x)]f(x) dx)|")

    print("  <= max|phi(x) - P_n(x)| * Integral(|f(x)| dx) (over the interval [-M, M])")
    print("As n -> infinity, max|phi(x) - P_n(x)| -> 0. Since f(x) is a Schwartz function, it is integrable, so Integral(|f(x)| dx) is a finite number.")
    print("Therefore, the expression goes to 0. This implies:")
    print("  Integral(phi(x) * f(x) dx) = lim_{n->inf} Integral(P_n(x) * f(x) dx) = 0")

    print("\nStep 4: Proof by Contradiction")
    print("We have shown that Integral(phi(x) * f(x) dx) = 0 for ALL continuous functions phi(x) with compact support.")
    print("Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that f(x) is NOT identically zero. This means there is some point x_0 where f(x_0) is not 0.")
    print("Let's say f(x_0) > 0. Since f(x) is continuous (as a Schwartz function), there must be a small open interval (x_0 - d, x_0 + d) where f(x) > 0.")
    print("Now, we can construct a continuous 'bump' function, phi_0(x), that is positive inside this interval and zero everywhere else.")
    print("Let's consider the integral with this specific phi_0(x):")
    print("  Integral(phi_0(x) * f(x) dx) = Integral from (x_0 - d) to (x_0 + d) of (phi_0(x) * f(x) dx)")
    print("Inside this interval, both f(x) and phi_0(x) are positive. Therefore, their product is positive, and the integral must be strictly greater than 0.")
    print("This is a contradiction! We proved in Step 3 that the integral must be 0, but we found a case where it must be greater than 0.")
    print("The contradiction arises from our assumption that f(x) was not identically zero.")

    print("      CONCLUSION")
    print("--------------------")
    print("The assumption that f(x) is not identically zero must be false. Therefore, f(x) must be 0 for all x.")

    print("\n--- Alternative Perspective (Fourier Transform) ---")

    print("  d^k/d(xi)^k [f_hat(xi)] at xi=0  =  (-2*pi*i)^k * Integral(x^k * f(x) dx)")
    print(f"In our case, the integral is 0 for all k, so all derivatives of the Fourier transform at xi=0 are zero.")
    print("This implies that the Taylor series of the Fourier transform around 0 is identically zero. While this doesn't immediately prove f_hat is zero for all Schwartz functions (as they are not guaranteed to be analytic), it strongly suggests the result, which is confirmed by the main argument above.")
