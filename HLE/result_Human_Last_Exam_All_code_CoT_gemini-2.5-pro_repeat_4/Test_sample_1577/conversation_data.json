    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to find the number of logical qubits `k` that can be encoded. The GSD will then be `2^k`.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Topological Setup**: The problem describes a 2D surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. A \"hole\" in this context is best understood as a boundary or a puncture. A standard assumption for such a setup is that these holes exist on an infinite plane.\n2.  **Boundaries**: An infinite plane is topologically equivalent to a disk, which has one boundary at infinity. We can, without loss of generality, assume this boundary at infinity is of the \"smooth\" type.\n3.  **Counting Total Boundaries**: With `n` specified smooth holes and `m` specified rough holes on the plane, the total number of boundaries of each type are:\n    *   Number of smooth boundaries (`n_s`): The `n` given holes plus the 1 boundary at infinity = `n + 1`.\n    *   Number of rough boundaries (`n_r`): The `m` given holes = `m`.\n    *   The total number of boundaries is `b = n_s + n_r = (n + 1) + m`.\n4.  **GSD Formula**: For a topological code like the toric code on a surface with genus `g` and a total of `b` boundaries (where `b > 0`), the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the well-established formula:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n5.  **Applying the Formula**: A plane has a genus `g=0`. Substituting the values of `g` and `b` into the formula:\n    `k = 2*0 + ((n + 1) + m) - 1`\n    `k = 0 + n + m + 1 - 1`\n    `k = n + m`\n6.  **Calculating Degeneracy**: The ground space degeneracy is `2^k`. Therefore, the GSD is:\n    `GSD = 2^(n + m)`\n\nThis result corresponds to option A. The following Python code calculates this value for given `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of logical qubits 'k' is n + m based on the topological interpretation.\n    k = n + m\n    \n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    degeneracy = 2**k\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(f\"For a toric code with n={n} smooth holes and m={m} rough holes:\")\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits is k = n + m = {n} + {m} = {k}.\")\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is GSD = 2^k.\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m}) = {degeneracy}\")\n\n\n# Example values for demonstration\nnum_smooth_holes = 3\nnum_rough_holes = 2\n\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(num_smooth_holes, num_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
