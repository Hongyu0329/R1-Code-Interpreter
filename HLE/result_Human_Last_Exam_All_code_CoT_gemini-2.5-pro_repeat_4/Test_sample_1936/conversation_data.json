    "To find the smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` of `n` elements and a binary operation `.` such that `(G, .)` is not a group, we need to check values of `n` starting from the smallest possible size for a set.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Recall the definition of a group:** A set `G` with a binary operation `.` is a group if it satisfies four axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** For any `a, b` in `G`, `a . b` is also in `G`. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation).\n    *   **Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for any `a` in `G`, `a . e = e . a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an inverse element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a . a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ . a = e`.\n    A structure that fails any of these (except closure, which is a prerequisite) is not a group.\n\n2.  **Case n=0:** The set `G` is the empty set. It's not a group because it fails the identity element axiom, which requires that there *exists* an identity element `e` in `G`. The empty set contains no elements. While technically correct, group theory conventionally deals with non-empty sets. Let's proceed assuming `n > 0`.\n\n3.  **Case n=1:** Let `G = {a}`. The only possible binary operation on `G` is `a . a = a`. Let's check the axioms:\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a . a) . a = a . a = a`, and `a . (a . a) = a . a = a`. They are equal. It is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** `a` acts as the identity element since `a . a = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `a` is `a` itself since `a . a = a`, which is the identity element.\n    Since all axioms are satisfied, any structure of size 1 is a group (the trivial group). Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n4.  **Case n=2:** Let `G = {x, y}`. We need to see if we can define a binary operation that fails one of the axioms. Let's test the associativity axiom.\n    We can define an operation on a set of two elements, say `{True, False}`, and check if it's associative. The logical `NAND` operation is a good candidate.\n    *   Let `G = {True, False}`.\n    *   Let the operation `.` be `NAND`. So `a . b` is `NOT (a AND b)`.\n    *   The associativity law is `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n    *   Let's pick a counterexample: `a = True`, `b = True`, `c = False`.\n        *   Left side: `(True NAND True) NAND False` = `False NAND False` = `True`.\n        *   Right side: `True NAND (True NAND False)` = `True NAND True` = `False`.\n    *   Since `True ≠ False`, the associativity axiom fails. Therefore, `(G, NAND)` is not a group.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that any structure of size 1 is a group, but we can construct a structure of size 2 that is not a group. Thus, the smallest `n` (for a non-empty set) is 2.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the failure of associativity for `n=2` using the `NAND` operation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef check_non_group_of_size_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that a set of size 2 can form a non-group structure.\n    It checks the associativity of the logical NAND operation on the set {True, False}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let our set G have two elements. We use {True, False} for convenience.\n    G = [True, False]\n    n = len(G)\n    print(f\"Checking for a set G of size n = {n}.
