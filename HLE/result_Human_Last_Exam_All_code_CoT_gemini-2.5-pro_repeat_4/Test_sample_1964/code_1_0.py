def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function explains the reasoning and prints the solution to the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the order type of the set Y \ (w U {w}), where Y is a specific set of cardinals.

    Step 1: Characterize the set Y.
    Y is the union of Y_A over all valid sequences A. A sequence A = <a_alpha : alpha < omega_1>
    is valid if each a_alpha is a countable subset of omega_1 and there is a countable ordinal gamma
    such that |a_alpha intersect gamma| is infinite for all alpha.
    Y_A is the set of cardinals kappa for which there is a subset of indices X with |X| = kappa
    such that <a_alpha : alpha in X> is a Delta-system with a FINITE root.

    Step 2: Establish an upper bound for cardinals in Y.
    Since X is a subset of omega_1, its cardinality kappa must be less than or equal to omega_1.
    So, Y is a set of cardinals, all of which are less than or equal to omega_1.

    Step 3: Show that omega_1 is in Y.
    To show omega_1 is in Y, we only need to construct ONE valid sequence A for which
    omega_1 is in Y_A.
    - We construct a sequence A from a family of omega_1 pairwise almost disjoint infinite subsets of omega.
      Let a_alpha be such a set for each alpha < omega_1. This sequence A is valid.
    - This family {a_alpha} has the property that any two sets have a finite intersection.
    - By the Erdos-Rado theorem (specifically, the partition relation omega_1 -> (omega_1)^2_aleph_0),
      any coloring of pairs from omega_1 with countably many colors yields an uncountable monochromatic subset.
    - We color the pair {alpha, beta} with the finite set a_alpha intersect a_beta. There are only
      countably many such finite sets (colors).
    - The theorem guarantees there's an uncountable index set X (so |X| = omega_1) and a single finite set r
      such that for all distinct alpha, beta in X, a_alpha intersect a_beta = r.
    - This is a Delta-system of size omega_1 with a finite root. Thus, omega_1 is in Y.

    Step 4: Characterize Y completely.
    Since we found a Delta-system of size omega_1, any sub-collection (indexed by a subset of X)
    is also a Delta-system with the same root. We can form sub-collections of any cardinality
    kappa <= omega_1.
    Therefore, Y contains all cardinals up to and including omega_1.
    Y = {n | n is a natural number} U {aleph_0, aleph_1}.

    Step 5: Compute the final set and its order type.
    The problem asks for the order type of Y \ (omega U {omega}).
    In cardinal notation, this is Y \ ({n | n < omega} U {aleph_0}).
    Y \ ({n | n < omega} U {aleph_0}) = {aleph_1}.
    This is a set with a single element.

    Step 6: Final Answer.
    The order type of a singleton set is 1.
    """
    # The final equation is: OrderType = 1
    final_answer = 1
    print(f"The final answer is the order type of the set.")
    print(f"The set is Y \\ (omega U {{omega}}) = {{aleph_1}}.")
    print(f"A set with one element has order type 1.")
    print(f"The number in the final equation is: {final_answer}")
