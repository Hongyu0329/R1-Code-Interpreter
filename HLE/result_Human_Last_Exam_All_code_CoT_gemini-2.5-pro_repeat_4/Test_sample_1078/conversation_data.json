    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition the integer 4 and, for each partition, counting the distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  First, we list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. We must account for low-rank isomorphisms (e.g., W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃)).\n2.  Next, we consider all partitions of the number 4:\n    *   4 (irreducible groups of rank 4)\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  For each partition, we will count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups that can be formed by combining the irreducible groups from step 1.\n4.  Finally, we will sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this counting process step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef count_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4\n    by considering all partitions of 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This program calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the classification of finite Weyl groups and partitions of the rank.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: List the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for relevant ranks\n    # Note: We account for isomorphisms like W(A1)≅W(B1), W(B2)≅W(C2), W(A3)≅W(D3)\n    rank_1_groups = ['A1']\n    rank_2_groups = ['A2', 'B2', 'G2']\n    rank_3_groups = ['A3', 'B3']\n    rank_4_groups = ['A4', 'B4', 'D4', 'F4']\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4\n\n    # Partition 1: 4 (irreducible groups)\n    # These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    count_part_4 = len(rank_4_groups)\n    print(f\"Partition 4 (irreducible): {rank_4_groups}\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 4: {count_part_4}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2: 3 + 1\n    # Formed by W(rank 3) x W(rank 1)\n    count_part_3_1 = len(rank_3_groups) * len(rank_1_groups)\n    print(f\"Partition 3+1: Combinations of {rank_3_groups} with {rank_1_groups}\")\n    print(f\"Count for partition 3+1: {count_part_3_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 3: 2 + 2\n    # Formed by W(rank 2) x W(rank 2).
