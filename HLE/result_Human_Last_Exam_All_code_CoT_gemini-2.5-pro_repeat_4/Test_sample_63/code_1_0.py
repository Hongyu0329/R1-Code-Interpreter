# The clue from Kurt Vonnegut describes Albert Einstein, who was famous
# for his untamed, spiky hair, making him look like a "porcupine."
# The task is to find a two-word name where both words start with the same letter.

# A fitting descriptive name that follows the rule.
first_word = "Spiky"
second_word = "Scientist"

# Print the final two-word name.
print(f"{first_word} {second_word}")
