    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. As it is an electron, its spin angular momentum quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, results from the coupling of orbital and spin angular momenta. Its possible values range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate $J^2$ Eigenvalues:** For each possible value of $j$, the eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$. For simplicity and as is common practice, we will calculate the value in units of $\\hbar^2$, so the eigenvalue is $j(j+1)$.\n4.  **Calculate $J_z$ Eigenvalues:** For each value of $j$, there is a set of possible magnetic quantum numbers, $m_j$, which range from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps. The eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator is given by $\\hbar m_j$. We will calculate this value in units of $\\hbar$, so the eigenvalue is $m_j$.\n5.  **Combine and Display:** The code will iterate through each possible $j$ value and its corresponding $m_j$ values to calculate and print all the common eigenvalue pairs $(J^2, J_z)$. The script will explicitly show the formulas and the numbers used in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron subject to spin-orbit coupling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for a p-electron\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\n    print(f\"A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l = {l}.\")\n    print(f\"An electron has spin angular momentum quantum number s = {Fraction(s)}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible j values\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number, j, can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The total angular momentum quantum number, j, can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\")\n    print(f\"This results in possible j values of: {', '.join([str(Fraction(j)) for j in j_values])}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print eigenvalues for each j\n    for j_val in j_values:\n        j = Fraction(j_val)\n        \n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_plus_1 = j + 1\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * j_plus_1\n        \n        print(f\"--- For the state with j = {j} ---\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as j(j+1).\")\n        print(f\"Eigenvalue of J^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j} * {j_plus_1} = {j2_eigenvalue} (in units of h_bar^2)\")\n        \n        # Determine m_j values\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j_val, j_val + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For j = {j}, the magnetic quantum number m_j can be: {', '.join([str(Fraction(m)) for m in m_j_values])}.\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J_z is simply m_j (in units of h_bar).\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe common eigenvalue pairs (J^2 eigenvalue, J_z eigenvalue) are:\")\n        for m_j_val in m_j_values:\n            m_j = Fraction(m_j_val)\n            print(f\"  For m_j = {str(m_j).rjust(4)}:  ({str(j2_eigenvalue).rjust(4)}, {str(m_j).rjust(4)})\")\n        print(\"-\" * 40 + \"\\n\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<The common eigenvalues for (J^2, J_z) are: For j=3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is 15/4 with J_z eigenvalues of 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2.
