    "To determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death, we need to cross-reference their timelines.\n\n1.  **Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** We need to find the specific year she passed away.\n2.  **Identify Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in that year:** We will check historical records and biographical information to see where Chaucer was during that period.\n3.  **Synthesize the information:** Based on the findings, we can conclude his most probable location.\n\nI will now write a Python script that lays out these facts to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died\n    by presenting key historical facts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the date and location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    person_of_interest = \"Blanche of Lancaster\"\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    location_of_death = \"Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire, England\"\n\n    print(f\"Fact 1: {person_of_interest} died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\n    print(f\"Her place of death was {location_of_death}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Establish Geoffrey Chaucer's location and occupation around that time.\n    historical_figure = \"Geoffrey Chaucer\"\n    chaucer_status_1367 = \"An esquire in the household of King Edward III.\"\n    chaucer_location_1368 = \"England, as part of the royal court.\"\n    supporting_evidence_poem = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n    poem_context = \"An elegy for Blanche, likely written in 1369 or 1370 for her husband, John of Gaunt.\"\n\n    print(f\"Fact 2: In {year_of_death}, {historical_figure} was serving the English royal court.\")\n    print(f\"His role since 1367 was as '{chaucer_status_1367}'\")\n    print(f\"Biographical records place him in {chaucer_location_1368} during this time.
