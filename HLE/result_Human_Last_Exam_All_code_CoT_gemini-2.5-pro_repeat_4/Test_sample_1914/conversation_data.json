    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic ways to define a category structure on a set of 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Mandatory Morphisms:** A category with two objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each object. So, two of the four morphisms are fixed as `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n\n2.  **Distribute the Remaining Morphisms:** This leaves us with 2 non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four possible `Hom` sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. Let `m_XY` be the number of non-identity morphisms from `X` to `Y`. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to `m_AA + m_AB + m_BA + m_BB = 2`.\n\n3.  **Enumerate Structural Cases:** We list all possible distributions of these 2 morphisms. Then, we group these distributions by isomorphism (i.e., if one distribution can be turned into another by swapping the labels of objects `A` and `B`, we consider them as one structural type).\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Structural Case:** For each unique structural type, we determine how many distinct, non-isomorphic category structures can be defined by specifying the composition rules for the morphisms. The composition must satisfy the associative and identity laws.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each unique structural case.\n\n### Analysis of Cases:\n\nThere are 6 non-isomorphic structural types for distributing the two non-identity morphisms:\n\n1.  **Both morphisms are `A -> A`**:\n    *   `Hom(A,A)` has 3 morphisms, and `Hom(B,B)` has 1. This structure is defined by the monoid structure on `Hom(A,A)`. There are 5 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    *   Count: **5**\n\n2.  **Both morphisms are `A -> B`**:\n    *   `Hom(A,B)` has 2 morphisms. There are no non-trivial compositions possible (e.g., for `f:A->B` and `g:A->B`, compositions like `f o g` are not defined). The specific identities of the two morphisms don't matter up to isomorphism.\n    *   Count: **1**\n\n3.  **One morphism `A -> A` and one `B -> B`**:\n    *   `Hom(A,A)` has 2 morphisms, and `Hom(B,B)` has 2. Each forms a monoid of order 2. A monoid of order 2 can be a group (`Z_2`) or have an idempotent element. The combinations are (`Z_2`, `Z_2`), (idempotent, idempotent), and (`Z_2`, idempotent). The case (idempotent, `Z_2`) is isomorphic to the last one.\n    *   Count: **3**\n\n4.  **One morphism `A -> B` and one `B -> A`**:\n    *   Let the morphisms be `f: A -> B` and `g: B -> A`. The compositions `g o f` (in `Hom(A,A)`) and `f o g` (in `Hom(B,B)`) must be defined. Since `Hom(A,A) = {id_A}` and `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`, the compositions are forced: `g o f = id_A` and `f o g = id_B`. This defines a single, rigid structure where objects A and B are isomorphic.\n    *   Count: **1**\n\n5.  **One morphism `A -> A` and one `A -> B`**:\n    *   Let them be `f: A -> A` and `g: A -> B`. `Hom(A,A)` is a monoid of order 2 (`Z_2` or idempotent). The composition `g o f` must be `g`. These two choices for the monoid on `Hom(A,A)` lead to two distinct categories.\n    *   Count: **2**\n\n6.  **One morphism `A -> A` and one `B -> A`**:\n    *   This case is the dual of the previous case (arrows are reversed). It is not isomorphic to it. Similar analysis shows there are 2 possible structures.\n    *   Count: **2**\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nSumming the counts from all the unique, non-isomorphic cases gives the total number of categories.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Count categories where both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on A.\n# This corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\ncase_1 = 5\n\n# Step 2: Count categories where both non-identity morphisms are from A to B.\n# There are no compositions to define, so there's only one such category up to isomorphism.\ncase_2 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one on B.\n# This corresponds to combinations of monoids of order 2. (Z2, Z2), (Idem, Idem), (Z2, Idem).\ncase_3 = 3\n\n# Step 4: Count categories with one morphism from A to B and one from B to A.\n# This forces an isomorphism between A and B, giving one rigid structure.\ncase_4 = 1\n\n# Step 5: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one morphism from A to B.\n# The monoid on Hom(A,A) can be Z2 or idempotent, giving 2 structures.\ncase_5 = 2\n\n# Step 6: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one morphism from B to A.\n# This is the dual of case 5 and gives 2 distinct structures.\ncase_6 = 2\n\n# The total number of categories is the sum of these cases.\ntotal_categories = case_1 + case_2 + case_3 + case_4 + case_5 + case_6\n\nprint(f\"The number of categories is the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic structure:\")\nprint(f\"{case_1} (from Hom(A,A)-only) + {case_2} (from Hom(A,B)-only) + {case_3} (from one Hom(A,A) and one Hom(B,B)) + {case_4} (from one Hom(A,B) and one Hom(B,A)) + {case_5} (from one Hom(A,A) and one Hom(A,B)) + {case_6} (from one Hom(A,A) and one Hom(B,A))\")\nprint(f\"= {total_categories}\")\n\n```\n<<<14>>>"
