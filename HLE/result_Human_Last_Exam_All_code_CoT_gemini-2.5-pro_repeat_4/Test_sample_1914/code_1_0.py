# Step 1: Count categories where both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on A.
# This corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.
case_1 = 5

# Step 2: Count categories where both non-identity morphisms are from A to B.
# There are no compositions to define, so there's only one such category up to isomorphism.
case_2 = 1

# Step 3: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one on B.
# This corresponds to combinations of monoids of order 2. (Z2, Z2), (Idem, Idem), (Z2, Idem).
case_3 = 3

# Step 4: Count categories with one morphism from A to B and one from B to A.
# This forces an isomorphism between A and B, giving one rigid structure.
case_4 = 1

# Step 5: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one morphism from A to B.
# The monoid on Hom(A,A) can be Z2 or idempotent, giving 2 structures.
case_5 = 2

# Step 6: Count categories with one endomorphism on A and one morphism from B to A.
# This is the dual of case 5 and gives 2 distinct structures.
case_6 = 2

# The total number of categories is the sum of these cases.
