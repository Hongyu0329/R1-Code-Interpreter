    explanation = """
    The core problem is that a birth-death model with time-varying speciation λ(t) and extinction μ(t) rates is unidentifiable from a phylogeny of only extant species. This means multiple combinations of λ(t) and μ(t) can result in the same likelihood for the observed tree, making it impossible to uniquely determine the true rates. Information about extinction is lost because we only see the lineages that survived.

    Let's analyze each strategy:

    A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This is a form of regularization. By simplifying the rate functions into a smaller number of parameters (20 total), it constrains the model and can make inference more stable. This HELPS mitigate the issue by reducing model complexity.

    B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external information to the model. If the data (likelihood) cannot distinguish between different parameter values, the prior can help resolve this ambiguity. This is a standard method to deal with identifiability issues. This HELPS.

    C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This strategy dramatically increases model complexity (120 parameters), making the model extremely flexible. With limited, non-identifiable data, this high flexibility exacerbates the problem, allowing for an even wider range of λ(t) and μ(t) functions to fit the data equally well. This DOES NOT HELP; it makes the problem worse.

    D. & F. Incorporating fossils: Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages. This is precisely the information missing from an extant-only phylogeny. The timing of these fossil occurrences provides the data needed to disentangle speciation from extinction rates. This is one of the most effective ways to solve the problem. This HELPS.

    E. & G. Reparametrizing the model: The 'pulled diversification rate' and 'pulled speciation rate' are parameters that are known to be identifiable from extant-only phylogenies. By changing the model to infer these identifiable parameter combinations instead of the non-identifiable λ(t) and μ(t), one focuses on what can be robustly concluded from the data. This is a valid way to handle the identifiability problem. This HELPS.

    Conclusion: Making the model significantly more complex and over-parameterized (Option C) is the only strategy listed that does not mitigate the identifiability issue and will, in fact, make it more severe.
