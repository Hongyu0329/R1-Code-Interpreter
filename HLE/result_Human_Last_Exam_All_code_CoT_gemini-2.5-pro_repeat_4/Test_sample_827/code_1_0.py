    This function analyzes the provided reaction scheme and NMR data to deduce the starting material.
    
    1. Analysis of NMR data points to a final product with the following key features:
       - A tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
       - A benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph)
       - A pyrimidinone core substituted at positions 4 and 6.
       - Total proton count of 19 and 5 quaternary carbons.
    
    2. The structure that fits all data is 6-(benzylamino)-4-((E)-tert-butyldiazenyl)pyrimidin-2(1H)-one.
       - The tert-butyl hydrazine is oxidized to an azo group (-N=N-tBu).
       - One of the initial leaving groups on the pyrimidine ring is hydrolyzed to a carbonyl (pyrimidin-2-one).
    
    3. To form a product substituted at positions 2, 4, and 6, the starting material must have leaving groups at all three positions.
    
    4. The most common and logical starting material (Compound A) is therefore 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine.
