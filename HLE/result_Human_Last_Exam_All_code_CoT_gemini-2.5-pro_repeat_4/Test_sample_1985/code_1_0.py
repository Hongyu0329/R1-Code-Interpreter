# Plan:
# 1. Use the two boundary conditions Mx(0) - Nx(1) = alpha and x(0) = (1/2)alpha
#    to find a direct formula for x(1).
# 2. Substitute x(0) into the first equation: M(alpha/2) - Nx(1) = alpha.
# 3. Solve for x(1): x_n(1) = (1/N_n) * (M_n/2 - 1) * alpha_n.
# 4. Use the given alpha, which is non-zero only for n = k = 2^2024.
#    This means x_n(1) is zero for all n != k.
# 5. Calculate ||x(1)||^2 = |x_k(1)|^2.
# 6. For k = 2^2024 (an even index), M_k = 1. N_k = exp(-2^k). alpha_k = 1.
# 7. x_k(1) = exp(2^k) * (1/2 - 1) * 1 = -1/2 * exp(2^k).
# 8. ||x(1)||^2 = (-1/2 * exp(2^k))^2 = 1/4 * exp(2 * 2^k) = 1/4 * exp(2^(k+1)).
# 9. Since k = 2^2024, the expression becomes 1/4 * exp(2^(2024+1)) = 1/4 * exp(2^2025).

# Define the numbers in the final expression
coeff_numerator = 1
coeff_denominator = 4
exp_base = 2
exp_power = 2025

# Print the final result step-by-step
