    "The problem asks for the value of a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables. I will solve this by writing a Python script that programmatically finds this value for n=4.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent a Boolean Function**: A Boolean function of 4 variables is defined by its truth table, which has `2^4 = 16` entries. We can represent any such function by the set of input combinations (minterms) for which the function's output is 1. There are `2^16 = 65,536` possible functions of 4 variables, which is a number small enough to check exhaustively.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through All Functions**: The script will loop through all 65,536 possible functions. Each function is identified by an integer from 0 to 65,535, where the bits of the integer correspond to the truth table outputs.\n\n3.  **Find Prime Implicants**: For each function, the script will calculate all of its prime implicants. This will be done using the first part of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, which is a standard method for logic minimization. The algorithm works by:\n    *   Grouping minterms by the number of '1's in their binary form.\n    *   Systematically combining terms that differ by only one bit to form simpler terms (implicants).\n    *   An implicant that cannot be combined further is a prime implicant.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum**: The script will count the number of prime implicants for each of the 65,536 functions and keep track of the highest count found. This maximum count is the value of a(4).\n\n5.  **Output the Result**: Finally, the script will print the result in the format `a(4) = [value]`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants\n    for a Boolean function of 4 variables.
