    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The information regarding \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is not relevant to the calculation of the determinant for the explicitly provided matrix A.\n\nI will follow these steps:\n1.  Define the matrix A using the NumPy library in Python.\n2.  Use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  I will print out each step of the calculation, substituting the numerical values from the matrix into the formula, as requested.\n4.  Finally, I will print the computed determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given matrix A\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # Extract elements for the determinant formula\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    print(\"The given matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the expansion formula for a 3x3 matrix:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from the matrix into the formula:\")\n    # Print the equation with all numbers\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n    # Calculate intermediate values within the parentheses\n    sub_term1 = e * i - f * h\n    sub_term2 = d * i - f * g\n    sub_term3 = d * h - e * g\n    print(f\"       = {a} * ({sub_term1}) - ({b}) * ({sub_term2}) + ({c}) * ({sub_term3})\")\n\n    # Calculate the products\n    term1 = a * sub_term1\n    term2 = -b * sub_term2\n    term3 = c * sub_term3\n    print(f\"       = {term1} + ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\n\n    # Calculate the final determinant\n    determinant = term1 + term2 + term3\n    print(f\"       = {determinant}\")\n\n    # Verify with numpy's built-in function\n    final_determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n    print(f\"\\nThe final computed determinant is {int(round(final_determinant))}.\")\n\nsolve_determinant()\n<<<0>>>\n```"
