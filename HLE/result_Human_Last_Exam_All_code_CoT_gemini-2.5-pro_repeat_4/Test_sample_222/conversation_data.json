    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship:** The problem asks for the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, denoted as `X(k)` and `H(k)`, are given.\n2.  **Formulate the problem:** The new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   The even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)`.\n    *   The odd-indexed elements of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)`.\n3.  **Apply the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT Algorithm:** The 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, let's call it `Y(k)`, can be computed from the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts (`X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively). The formula, which is the core of the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, is as follows:\n    *   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n        *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n        *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n    *   Here, `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` is the \"twiddle factor\".\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` as complex number arrays.\n    *   Iterates from `k = 0` to `3`.\n    *   In each step, it calculates the twiddle factor `W_8^k`, then computes `Y(k)` and `Y(k+4)` using the formulas above.\n    *   The script will print out each step of the calculation, showing the values used in the formulas, to satisfy the requirement \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    *   Finally, it will print the complete 8-point DFT `Y(k)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_complex(c, precision=4):\n    \"\"\"A helper function to format complex numbers for printing.\"\"\"\n    real = c.real\n    imag = c.imag\n    if np.isclose(imag, 0):\n        return f\"{real:.{precision}f}\"\n    if np.isclose(real, 0):\n        # Handle -0.0j case for cleaner output\n        if np.isclose(imag, -0.0):\n            return f\"{-imag:.{precision}f}j\"\n        return f\"{imag:.{precision}f}j\"\n    sign = \"+\" if imag > 0 else \"-\"\n    return f\"({real:.{precision}f} {sign} {abs(imag):.{precision}f}j)\"\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence based on the\n    4-point DFTs of the original sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    N = 8  # The size of the final DFT\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the 8-point DFT Y(k) using the formula:\")\n    print(\"Y(k)   = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\\n\")\n\n    # Loop for k from 0 to N/2 - 1 (which is 3)\n    for k in range(N // 2):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_N^k\n        twiddle_factor = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # The term to be added/subtracted\n        term = twiddle_factor * H[k]\n        \n        # Calculate Y(k) and Y(k + N/2)\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k + N//2] = X[k] - term\n\n        print(f\"--- k = {k} ---\")\n        print(f\"W_8^{k} = {format_complex(twiddle_factor)}\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({k}) + W_8^{k}*H({k}) = {format_complex(X[k])} + {format_complex(twiddle_factor)} * {format_complex(H[k])} = {format_complex(Y[k])}\")\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = X({k}) - W_8^{k}*H({k}) = {format_complex(X[k])} - {format_complex(twiddle_factor)} * {format_complex(H[k])} = {format_complex(Y[k+N//2])}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Final Result ---\")\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT for the sequence {x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),...} is Y(k):\")\n    \n    # Create a nicely formatted string for the final array\n    final_Y_str = \"[\" + \", \".join([format_complex(y) for y in Y]) + \"]\"\n    print(final_Y_str)\n    \n    # This part is for the final answer block as per instructions\n    # Note: The '<<<...>>>' block should be the very last thing in the response.\n    # The print statement below generates the content for that block.\n    # print(f\"\\n<<<{final_Y_str}>>>\")\n\nsolve_dft()\n\n```\n<<<[1.0000, (1.4142 + 1.0000j), (-1.0000 - 1.0000j), (-1.4142 - 1.0000j), 1.0000, (-1.4142 + 1.0000j), (-1.0000 + 1.0000j), (1.4142 - 1.0000j)]>>>"
