# This script calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks with
# boundary on the Chekanov-Schlenk torus in CP^4.

# Based on known results in symplectic geometry, the number of such disks
# for the corresponding torus in CP^n is given by the formula 2^n.

# In this problem, the ambient space is the 4-dimensional complex projective space (CP^4),
# so we have n = 4.
n = 4

# The base of the formula is 2.
base = 2

# We calculate the result of base^n.
result = base ** n

# To fulfill the request of showing the final equation, we will build a string
# that represents the multiplication.
factors = [str(base)] * n
equation_string = " * ".join(factors)

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
