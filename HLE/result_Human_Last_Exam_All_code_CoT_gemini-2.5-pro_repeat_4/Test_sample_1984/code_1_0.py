# Step 1: Define m, the number of stable equilibrium points.
# Based on the analysis of the differential equation, we found m = 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the second term in the expression.
# This is 2 to the power of 4048. Python handles large integers automatically.
second_term = 2**4048

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
result = m - second_term

# Step 4: Print the final equation as requested.
# The instruction is to "output each number in the final equation".
# The equation is m - 2^4048 = result.
# The numbers are m, the value of 2^4048, and the final result.
# We print these numbers in the context of the equation.
print(f"{m} - {second_term} = {result}")
