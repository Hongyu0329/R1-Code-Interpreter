# The user wants to compute the dimension of the homology group H_31(G, R).
# Based on the theoretical analysis of the group G, we concluded that its virtual cohomological dimension is 3.
# The group G can be described as an amalgamated product of two copies of Thompson's group F over the Baumslag-Solitar group BS(1,2).
# G = F *_{BS(1,2)} F.
# Thompson's group F acts cocompactly on a 3-dimensional CAT(0) space.
# The group BS(1,2) has a classifying space of dimension 2.
# A space for G can be constructed by gluing these spaces, resulting in a 3-dimensional CAT(0) space on which G acts cocompactly.
# This implies that the virtual cohomological dimension of G, vcd(G), is at most 3.
# For any group G with finite virtual cohomological dimension d, the homology with real coefficients H_k(G, R) is zero for all k > d.
# In our case, d=3 and we are interested in k=31.
# Since 31 > 3, the homology group H_31(G, R) is trivial.
# Therefore, its dimension is 0.

dimension = 0

# The problem asks to output the final equation.
# The equation is dim(H_31(G, R)) = 0.
# I will print the numbers involved in this equation.
homology_degree = 31
final_dimension = 0

print(f"The dimension of the homology of G with trivial real coefficients in degree {homology_degree} is {final_dimension}.")
# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
# The final equation is "dimension = 0". The numbers are 0.
# I'll also just print the number itself as the result.
print(f"dimension = {dimension}")
