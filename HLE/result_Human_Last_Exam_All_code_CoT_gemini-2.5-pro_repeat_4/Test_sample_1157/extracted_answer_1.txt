Management involves immediate glycemic control and antibiotics due to the 7.5% HbA1c and 28-hour delay. Key cells are immune and healing cells (neutrophils, fibroblasts), which are impaired. A Cobalt-Chromium removable partial denture is recommended after healing, using the left second premolar and right canine/premolar as abutments. The SNB of 88 degrees indicates a Class III skeletal pattern, influencing long-term planning.
