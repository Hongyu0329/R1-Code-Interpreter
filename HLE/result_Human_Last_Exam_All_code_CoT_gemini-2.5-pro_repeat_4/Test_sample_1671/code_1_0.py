# --- Reasoning ---
# The question asks for the NCCN-recommended treatment for HER2+ MBC that has progressed after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane.
# This is effectively asking for the recommended second-line treatment.

# The text provides the sequence of recommended treatments.
# 1. First-line treatment: "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines with category 1 evidence recommend THP as the preferred first-line regimen for HER2+ MBC." THP (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane) is the regimen patients would have progressed on.

# 2. Second-line treatment: The text then specifies the next step: "Upon disease progression TDXd is recommended in the second-line setting."

# 3. Identification of the drug: The text defines TDXd as "famtrastuzumab deruxtecan".

# 4. Comparison with other options:
#    - Trastuzumab emtansine (Option B) was replaced by TDXd as second-line therapy.
#    - Tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine (Option A) is mentioned as a preferred "third-line" therapy.

# Based on this, Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan is the correct answer.
