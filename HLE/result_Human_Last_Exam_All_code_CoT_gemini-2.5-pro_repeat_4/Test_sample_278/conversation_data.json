    "To find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure, we first need to determine the bounding box of the figure. This means we need to find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates.\n\n**1. Analyzing the x-coordinate:**\nThe x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2*pi]`. The cosine function over this interval ranges from -1 to 1.\n- `x_max = 1`\n- `x_min = -1`\nThe width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the y-coordinate:**\nThe y-coordinate has two definitions depending on the interval of `t`.\n\n- **For `t` in `[0, pi]`:** `y = 1 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y is 1 and the minimum y is 0.\n- **For `t` in `(pi, 2*pi)`:** `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 down to -1 and back to 0. Therefore, `y` ranges from 0 down to -5 and back to 0. The maximum y is 0 and the minimum y is -5.\n\nCombining both intervals:\n- The overall maximum y-value is `y_max = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n- The overall minimum y-value is `y_min = min(0, -5) = -5`.\nThe height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**3. Determining the Outcircling Square:**\nThe figure has a width of 2 and a height of 6. To enclose this figure in a square, the side of the square must be at least as large as the largest dimension.\n- Side of the square = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Area:**\nThe area of a square with a side length of 6 is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints these values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The curve is given by x = cos(t), y = b*sin(t)\n# where b=1 for t in [0, pi] and b=5 for t in (pi, 2*pi).\n\n# 1. Find the range of x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2*pi]\nx_max = 1\nx_min = -1\n\n# 2. Find the range of y\n# For t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). The range is [0, 1].\ny_max_part1 = 1\ny_min_part1 = 0\n\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). The range is [-5, 0).\ny_max_part2 = 0\ny_min_part2 = -5\n\n# The overall range for y is the union of the ranges from the two parts.\ny_max = max(y_max_part1, y_max_part2)\ny_min = min(y_min_part1, y_min_part2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the width and height of the bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# 4. Determine the side of the smallest enclosing square\nside_of_square = max(width, height)\n\n# 5. Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_of_square * side_of_square\n\nprint(\"To find the area of the smallest outcircling square, we first find the dimensions of the figure.\")\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is max(x) - min(x) = {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is max(y) - min(y) = {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The side of the smallest square that encloses the figure must be equal to the larger dimension.\")\nprint(f\"Side of square = max({width}, {height}) = {side_of_square}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The area of this square is side * side.\")\nprint(f\"Area = {side_of_square} * {side_of_square} = {area}\")\n\n<<<36>>>\n```"
