# This script calculates the global labeling number of the graph K(1,100).
# As derived from the problem's conditions, this number is the maximum
# value in an optimally chosen set of 100 edge labels.
# This optimal set is {2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^99}, which requires that no label can be
# represented as a sum of a subset of the other labels.
# The global labeling number is therefore the maximum value in this set, 2^99.

# The calculation is of the form: Result = Base ** Exponent
base = 2
exponent = 99

# Perform the calculation
result = base ** exponent

# Output the components of the final calculation and the result.
