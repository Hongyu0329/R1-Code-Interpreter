def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    Identifies the indices of insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be
    collected using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - 1 (Apis): Larvae are in hives. Unlikely.
    - 2 (Melipotini): Larvae (caterpillars) are on foliage. Likely.
    - 3 (Eupholini): Larvae (grubs) are internal borers. Unlikely.
    - 4 (Acritini): Larvae are predators in dung/carrion/litter. Unlikely.
    - 5 (Oxyptilini): Larvae (caterpillars) are on foliage. Likely.
    - 6 (Dictyophorini): Nymphs are on foliage. Likely.
    - 7 (Acanthocerini): Larvae are in decaying wood/litter. Unlikely.

    The function will print the indices of the unlikely tribes.
