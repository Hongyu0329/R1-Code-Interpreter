# This script analyzes the correctness of five statements about a Datalog formalism.

# Statement A critiques the definition of the 'segregation' operator as potentially
# ill-defined due to its reliance on "order of appearance" and ambiguous notation.
# A formal program is a set of rules (unordered), so an order-dependent definition
# is not well-defined.
is_A_correct = True

# Statement B misrepresents the central claim. The claim is about the semantic
# equivalence of program evaluation results, not the syntactic equality of programs.
is_B_correct = False

# Statement C correclty points out that aggregation is a lossy operation,
# meaning that in general, `gamma_inverse(gamma(P))` will not be identical to `P`.
# It will be a set of possible original programs.
is_C_correct = True

# Statement D correctly identifies that the application of the 'segregation' operator
# to a set of facts `S0` is not clearly defined in the provided text, which
# introduces ambiguity.
is_D_correct = True

# Statement E provides an accurate conceptual interpretation of the main equation.
# It correctly frames it as a statement about information preservation, where
# coarse-grained inference is equivalent to a 'refine-evaluate-coarsen' cycle.
is_E_correct = True

# We sum the boolean values (True=1, False=0) to get the total count.
