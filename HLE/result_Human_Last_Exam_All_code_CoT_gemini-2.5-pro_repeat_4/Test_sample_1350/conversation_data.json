    "My plan is to answer the user's literary question by first identifying the correct character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*. I will recall or look up information about the book's plot and characters to find who traveled among the Romans and described their founding myth. The description in question, a she-wolf suckling two infants, is a clear reference to Romulus and Remus. Once the character is identified, I will create a simple Python script to print the name and a brief explanation, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes the\n    Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in question is a former thrall who was captured by the Romans\n    # and lived in one of their cities before returning to the Goths.\n    # In Chapter V, \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" he describes what he saw.\n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n\n    # He describes the Roman token or symbol as follows:\n    # \"...a She-wolf giving suck to two men-children, and this they have\n    # in all their temples, and on their banners...\"\n    # This is a direct reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n    \n    print(f\"The character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings who describes the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus is: {character_name}\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
