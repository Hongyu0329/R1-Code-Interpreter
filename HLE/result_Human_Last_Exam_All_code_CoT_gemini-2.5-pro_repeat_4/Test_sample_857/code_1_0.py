# This script solves a problem in point-set topology by explaining the relevant theorems and presenting the final answer.
#
# Problem: What is the largest possible cardinality of the set of points where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal?
#
# Step 1: Characterize the set of non-coastal points.
# In a hereditarily decomposable continuum, a key theorem from continuum theory states that the set of points that are not coastal
# is exactly the set of "endpoints" of the continuum. Let's call this set E(X).
#
# Step 2: Reframe the problem.
# The problem is now to determine the maximum possible cardinality of the set of endpoints, |E(X)|, for a hereditarily decomposable continuum X.
#
# Step 3: Analyze the cardinality of E(X).
# For simple examples like an arc, |E(X)| = 2.
# However, there exist more complex hereditarily decomposable continua (specifically, a class of spaces called dendroids)
# for which the set of endpoints is much larger.
#
# Step 4: State the maximum cardinality.
# It is a known result in the field that there exist hereditarily decomposable continua where the set of endpoints E(X) has
# the cardinality of the continuum. This cardinality is denoted by 'c' or, by the continuum hypothesis, as 2^{\aleph_0}.
# A standard metric continuum cannot have more than 'c' points, so this is the maximum possible value.
#
# Step 5: Present the final answer and the numbers in the symbolic equation.
# The final answer is the cardinality of the continuum, written as 2^{\aleph_0}.
# The numbers in this expression are the base (2) and the index of the Aleph number in the exponent (0).

print("The largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is the cardinality of the continuum.")
print("This is represented by the symbolic equation: c = 2^{\\aleph_0}")
print("\nHere are the numbers from that expression:")

base_of_exponent = 2
aleph_index_in_exponent = 0

print(f"The base is: {base_of_exponent}")
print(f"The index of the Aleph number (\\aleph) in the exponent is: {aleph_index_in_exponent}")
