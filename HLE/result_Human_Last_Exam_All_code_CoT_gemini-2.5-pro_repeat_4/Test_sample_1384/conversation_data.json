    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to calculate this value in a way that avoids the limitations of standard floating-point arithmetic, which would underflow to zero. The strategy is to represent the number in scientific notation, $N = A \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le A < 10$. The first two non-zero digits of the number $N$ are then the first two digits of the mantissa $A$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Let $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We will use the base-10 logarithm to find the exponent $k$ and the mantissa $A$.\n2.  The equation is $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$.\n3.  We will calculate the value of $7^{13}$ first.\n4.  Then, we'll compute $\\log_{10}(N)$ using high-precision arithmetic, as the numbers involved are very large. Python's `decimal` module is perfect for this.\n5.  The value of $\\log_{10}(N)$ can be decomposed into an integer part, $k'$, and a fractional part, $f'$. We write $\\log_{10}(N) = k' + f'$. To ensure the mantissa is between 1 and 10, we adjust this to $k = \\text{floor}(\\log_{10}(N))$ and $f = \\log_{10}(N) - k$, so that $0 \\le f < 1$.\n6.  The number is then $N = 10^{\\log_{10}(N)} = 10^{k+f} = 10^f \\times 10^k$. The mantissa is $A = 10^f$, and the exponent is $k$.\n7.  Finally, we calculate the value of the mantissa $A$ and extract its first two digits.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations.\n    # 7^13 has 11 digits.
