    This function determines the parameter group changes for different violin playing scenarios.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  sul ponticello: Affects the string's harmonic content (ν), which is Group ii.
    2.  bridge mute: Adds mass to the bridge, lowering body resonance frequencies (f_m),
        especially affecting the higher frequency response represented by Group iv.
        The frequency f_2 will go down.
    3.  helium room: Changes the speed of sound, which alters the air resonance frequencies (f_1),
        corresponding to Group iii.
    4.  E string: Changes the fundamental frequency of the open string (F), which is Group i.
