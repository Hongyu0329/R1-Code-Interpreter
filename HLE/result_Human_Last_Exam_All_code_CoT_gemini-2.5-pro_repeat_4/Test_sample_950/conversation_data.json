    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we need to perform a detailed calculation in algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space is the real Grassmannian $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, which is the manifold of all 3-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. Its dimension is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the target**: We need to find the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The \"rank\" of a torsion group is formally 0. However, in this context, it is standard to interpret this as the number of cyclic summands in its decomposition, which for 2-torsion groups is its dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n3.  **Methodology**: The integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have only 2-torsion. This torsion can be calculated using the Bockstein homomorphism $\\beta: H^{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, which corresponds to the differential $d_1 = Sq^1$ in the Bockstein spectral sequence. The rank of the torsion subgroup in degree $i$, denoted $t_i$, is the dimension of the image of $Sq^1: H^{i-1}(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H^i(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\n\n4.  **Steps for Calculation**:\n    a. Determine the structure of the cohomology ring with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. This ring is generated by Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, w_2$ subject to certain relations.\n    b. For each degree $i$ from 1 to 6, calculate $t_i = \\dim(\\text{Im}(Sq^1: H^{i-1} \\to H^i))$.\n    c. The total rank is the sum of these dimensions: $\\sum_{i} t_i$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that explains and carries out these calculations step by step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cohomology_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \n    The rank of a torsion group is interpreted as its dimension as a Z_2-vector space.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the space and the problem.\")\n    print(\"The space is the real Grassmannian G(3, 5), the space of 3-planes in R^5.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of H*(G(3, 5); Z).\")\n    print(\"The torsion in H*(G_k(R^n); Z) is always 2-torsion.\")\n    print(\"The 'rank' of the torsion subgroup is interpreted as its Z_2-dimension.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the Bockstein spectral sequence.\")\n    print(\"The torsion in H^i(X; Z) is given by the image of the first Bockstein\")\n    print(\"homomorphism, which is equivalent to the Steenrod square Sq^1 acting on\")\n    print(\"the mod 2 cohomology ring H^*(X; Z_2).\")\n    print(\"t_i = rank(Tors(H^i(X; Z))) = dim(Im(Sq^1: H^{i-1}(X; Z_2) -> H^i(X; Z_2))).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the structure of H*(G(3, 5); Z_2).\")\n    print(\"This ring is generated by Stiefel-Whitney classes w_1, w_2.\")\n    print(\"The relations are derived from the fact that the Whitney classes of the universal bundle for R^5 are trivial.\")\n    print(\"This gives the relations:\")\n    print(\"1. w_3 = w_1^3\")\n    print(\"2. w_1^4 + w_1^2*w_2 + w_2^2 = 0\")\n    print(\"3. w_1^5 + w_1^3*w_2 = 0\")\n    print(\"The dimensions of the cohomology groups H^i(G(3,5); Z_2) are the Z_2-Betti numbers:\")\n    betti_Z2 = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1}\n    print(f\"dim(H^i) = {betti_Z2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Compute the action of Sq^1.\")\n    print(\"Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2\")\n    print(\"Sq^1(w_2) = w_1*w_2 + w_3 = w_1*w_2 + w_1^3\")\n    print(\"We now compute t_i for each degree i.\")\n    \n    # t_i = rank of torsion in H^i\n    t = {}\n\n    # For H^1 (i=1)\n    # Sq^1: H^0 -> H^1.
