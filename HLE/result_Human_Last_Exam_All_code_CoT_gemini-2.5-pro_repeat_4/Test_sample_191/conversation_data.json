    "The question asks to identify a protein that, when its function is disrupted or \"broken down,\" permits macrophages to engulf amyloid deposits. This describes an inhibitory protein that normally protects substances from being \"eaten\" by macrophages. This is often called a \"don't eat me\" signal. In the context of amyloid plaques, research has identified a specific protein that coats the plaques and prevents their clearance by microglia (the brain's resident macrophages). By blocking or breaking down the signaling pathway of this protein, engulfment is enabled.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define a variable in Python that stores the name of this protein.\n2.  Use the `print()` function to output the name of the protein.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the protein that acts as a \"don't eat me\" signal.\n# When the function of this protein is inhibited or \"broken down,\"\n# it allows macrophages to clear amyloid plaques.\n\n# The protein is CD47. It signals through the SIRPÎ± receptor on macrophages.\nprotein_name = \"CD47\"\n\nprint(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is: {protein_name}\")\n```\n<<<CD47>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
