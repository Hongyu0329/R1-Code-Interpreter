    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor:** First, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A primitive character of conductor $d$ can be uniquely factored into a product of primitive characters corresponding to the prime power factors of $d$. Since $d=53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, the conductor is square-free.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A character $\\chi$ is primitive with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime $p_i$. The \"non-trivial\" condition ensures that the conductor of each $\\chi_i$ is $p_i$, making the total conductor their product.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** For the lcm of the orders to be 6, each individual order, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    The number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n    For all our prime factors ($7, 13, 19, 31$), the value of $p-1$ is a multiple of 6, so characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist for each.\n\n5.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** We can count the number of valid combinations using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n    *   First, we count the total number of ways to choose one non-trivial character for each prime factor, such that its order divides 6. For each prime, the number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6)$.\n    *   Then, we subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. This occurs if the lcm divides 2 (i.e., all orders are 2) or if the lcm divides 3 (i.e., all orders are 3).\n    *   The final count will be: (Total combinations with order dividing 6) - (Combinations with order dividing 2) - (Combinations with order dividing 3).\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp_n % d == 0:\n                temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors.append(temp_n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of the conductor\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    num_factors = len(prime_factors)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {prime_factors}.\")\n    print(\"The conductor is square-free.
