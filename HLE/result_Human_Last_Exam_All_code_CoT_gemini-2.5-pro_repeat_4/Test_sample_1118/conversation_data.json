    "My plan is to first identify the specific 1933 self-portrait by Curt Querner painted after his interaction with the Gestapo. I will then research the details of this painting to determine the object he is holding. Finally, I will present this information in a Python script that prints the answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the question about Curt Querner's self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event_context = \"after having escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbolic_object = \"a red poppy\"\n\n    # The painting is titled \"Self-Portrait with Poppy\".\n    # The red poppy is considered a symbol of his unbroken political convictions (communism)\n    # and resistance against the nascent Nazi regime.\n    \n    print(f\"In the self-portrait he painted in {year} {event_context}, {artist} holds {symbolic_object} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a red poppy>>>"
