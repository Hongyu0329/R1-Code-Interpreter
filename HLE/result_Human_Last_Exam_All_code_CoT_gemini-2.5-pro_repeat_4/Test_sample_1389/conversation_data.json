    "This is an interesting question in epidemiology that highlights the difference between what a clinical trial measures and the underlying biological effect of a vaccine. Let's break down the problem and use a simulation to find the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Vaccine Model:** We'll model an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine. This means a certain percentage of vaccinated people (`c`) become completely immune, while the rest (`1-c`) remain as susceptible as unvaccinated people. The true \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" (`VE_p`) in this model is exactly `c`.\n2.  **Define the Efficacy Measures:**\n    *   **Per-exposure Efficacy (`VE_p`)**: The reduction in risk for a single exposure. In our model, `VE_p = c`.\n    *   **Trial-Observed Efficacy (`VE_IRR`)**: This is calculated as `1 - IRR` (Incidence Rate Ratio). The `IRR` is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group over the whole trial.\n3.  **Simulate a Clinical Trial:** We will write a Python script to calculate the expected outcomes of a hypothetical trial.\n    *   It will calculate the number of infections and total person-time at risk for both the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups.\n    *   Crucially, for the vaccinated group, we will account for the fact that only the non-immune subgroup contributes to infections, while the entire group contributes to person-time.\n4.  **Compare the Efficacies:** The script will calculate `VE_IRR` from the simulated trial results and compare it to the true `VE_p` (`c`) that we defined at the start.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, we will determine if `1 - IRR` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the true per-exposure efficacy. The underlying reason for the result is a statistical effect called \"depletion of susceptibles,\" which the simulation will demonstrate.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a clinical trial for an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine to determine\n    if 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) overestimates, underestimates, or\n    correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
