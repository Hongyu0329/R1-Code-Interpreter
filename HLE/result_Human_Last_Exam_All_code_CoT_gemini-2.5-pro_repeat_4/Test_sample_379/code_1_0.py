# Step 1: Define constants. The side length 'r' will cancel out, so we can use r=1.
r = 1.0
pi = math.pi

# Step 2: Determine the number of arc segments that form the locus C.
# Based on the geometric analysis, the locus is composed of 6 distinct arcs.
num_arcs = 6
print(f"The locus C is composed of {num_arcs} arc segments.")

# Step 3: Calculate the length of a single arc segment.
# Each arc is part of a circle of radius r and subtends an angle of pi/3 radians.
angle_per_arc = pi / 3
length_per_arc = r * angle_per_arc
print(f"Each arc has a radius r = {r:.1f} and subtends an angle of pi/3 radians.")
print(f"The equation for the length of one arc is: r * (pi / 3)")
print(f"The numeric length of one arc is: {r:.1f} * ({pi:.4f} / 3) = {length_per_arc:.4f}")

# Step 4: Calculate the total length of the locus C.
# Total Length = (number of arcs) * (length of one arc)
total_length_C = num_arcs * length_per_arc
print(f"\nThe equation for the total length of C is: {num_arcs} * (r * pi / 3)")
print(f"The numeric total length is: {num_arcs} * {length_per_arc:.4f} = {total_length_C:.4f}")
print("Simplifying the equation gives: 6 * r * pi / 3 = 2 * pi * r")

# Step 5: Divide the length of C by 2*pi*r as requested.
divisor = 2 * pi * r
ratio = total_length_C / divisor
print(f"\nThe problem asks for the ratio: (Total Length of C) / (2 * pi * r)")
print(f"The equation for the ratio is: (2 * pi * r) / (2 * pi * r)")
print(f"The numeric ratio is: {total_length_C:.4f} / {divisor:.4f} = {ratio:.1f}")

# Step 6: Convert the ratio to a whole number percentage.
percentage = int(round(ratio * 100))
print(f"\nThe ratio as a whole number percentage is: {ratio:.1f} * 100 = {percentage}%")
print(f"\nFinal Answer: {percentage}")
