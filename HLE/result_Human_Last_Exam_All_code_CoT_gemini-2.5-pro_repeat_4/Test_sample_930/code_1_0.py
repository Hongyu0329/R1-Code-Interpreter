def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    In the context of flowering plants, mutualists are typically pollinators.
    They receive a food reward (nectar) and in return, transfer pollen,
    helping the plant reproduce.

    Analysis of the list:
    - 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (Adults): Danaus plexipus (butterfly), Megachile species (bees),
      and Sphex/Pepsis species (wasps) are all known to feed on nectar and act as
      pollinators. This is a mutualistic relationship.
    - 3 (Adult): Formica rufa (ant) is a known nectar feeder but a poor pollinator,
      often considered a "nectar robber". Not a mutualist.
    - 7 (Larva): Danaus plexipus larva is a herbivore that eats the plant's leaves.
      This is an antagonistic relationship, not mutualism.
    - 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (Larvae): The larvae of these bees, ants, and wasps
      develop in nests or on prey and do not interact directly with the plant in
      a mutualistic way.

    Therefore, the mutualists are the organisms with indices 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
