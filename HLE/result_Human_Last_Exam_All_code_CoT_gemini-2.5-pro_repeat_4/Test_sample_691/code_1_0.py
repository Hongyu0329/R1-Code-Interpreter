    print("  - A pair of pants is topologically a sphere with 3 holes.")
    print("  - Sewing two pairs of pants along their corresponding leg openings results in a larger surface.")
    print("  - The Euler characteristic of a pair of pants is -1.")
    print("  - Gluing them along two circular seams (Euler characteristic 0) gives a new surface S with Euler characteristic: -1 + -1 - 0 = -2.")
    print("  - This surface S has 2 boundary components (the two waistbands).")
    print("  - Using the formula χ = 2 - 2g - b, we get -2 = 2 - 2g - 2, which implies g=1.")
    print("  - Therefore, the intermediate space S is a torus with two holes.")
    print("\nStep 2: Find the fundamental group of the intermediate space S.")
    print("  - The fundamental group of a surface of genus g with b>0 boundaries is the free group on 2g + b - 1 generators.")
    print("  - For S, g=1 and b=2, so the group is free on 2*1 + 2 - 1 = 3 generators.")
    print("  - So, π₁(S) = F₃ = ℤ * ℤ * ℤ.")

    print("  - The instruction is to 'identify the waistbands into a single point'.")
    print("  - This means we collapse the two boundary loops of S to a single point.")
    print("  - In terms of the fundamental group, this adds relations making the elements corresponding to the boundary loops equal to the identity.")
    print("\nStep 4: Calculate the final fundamental group.")
    print("  - Let π₁(S) be represented by generators <a, b, c₁>, where a, b are the torus loops and c₁ is a loop around the first boundary.")
    print("  - The loop around the second boundary, c₂, is then related by c₂ = [b,a]c₁ = b⁻¹a⁻¹bac₁.")
    print("  - Collapsing the boundaries adds the relations: c₁ = 1 and c₂ = 1.")
    print("  - Starting with the group <a, b, c₁> and adding these relations gives:")
    print("    1. c₁ = 1")
    print("    2. b⁻¹a⁻¹bac₁ = 1")
    print("  - Substituting (1) into (2) gives b⁻¹a⁻¹ba = 1, which means ab = ba.")
    print("  - The generator c₁ is eliminated, and we are left with generators a and b with the commuting relation.")
    print("  - The final group is <a, b | ab = ba>, which is the fundamental group of the torus.")
