def get_product_smiles():
    """
    This function returns the SMILES string for the likely hydrolysis product.

    The reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a spiroketal containing
    a methyl and a phenyl group. The provided SMILES for the reactant is invalid,
    so a plausible structure is assumed.

    The hydrolysis product is an open-chain keto-diol, which has a higher
    molar mass than the starting spiroketal due to the addition of a water molecule.

    The assumed product is 1,9-dihydroxy-3-methyl-7-phenyl-5-nonanone.
