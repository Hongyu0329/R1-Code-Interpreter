    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  First, I will identify the character in question, which is 謄.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the structure of the character to determine its radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of 月 on the left and 朕 on the right. The radical used for dictionary indexing is typically the left-hand component, which is 月 in this case.\n3.  When the radical 月 appears on the left side of a character (as a `hen`), it is often a variant of the radical 肉 (niku, meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\"). This specific variant is called `にくづき` (nikuzuki).\n4.  I will then find the standard Hepburn transcription for `にくづき`, which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that uses a dictionary as a small knowledge base to look up the character 謄 and print its radical's name in Hepburn transcription.\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical (bushu) of a specific Kanji character\n    and prints its name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character we are analyzing.\n    target_character = '謄'\n\n    # A simple knowledge base mapping a few kanji to their radicals' names.\n    # The radical for 謄 is 月, which in this context is a variant of the\n    # 'meat' radical (肉) called 'Nikuzuki' (にくづき).\n    radical_database = {\n        '謄': 'Nikuzuki',\n        '媛': 'Onnahen'  # The example from the user's prompt\n    }\n\n    # Retrieve the radical's name from our database.\n    radical_name = radical_database.get(target_character, \"Radical not found.\")\n\n    # Print the result in a clear format.\n    print(f\"The bushu / radical in the Japanese character '{target_character}' is '{radical_name}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_kanji_radical()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
