# Based on the retrosynthetic analysis of the Robinson annulation reaction,
# the locant numbers for the substituents on the starting material are determined.
# This script constructs the name of the starting material from these numbers and prints it.

# Locant number for the methyl group on the cyclohexanone ring.
methyl_position = 3

# Locant number for the ketone (oxo group) on the cyclohexanone ring.
oxo_position = 2

# Locant number for the ethyl carboxylate group on the cyclohexanone ring.
carboxylate_position = 1

# Construct the full chemical name using the determined positions.
# The "equation" for the name is Name = ethyl [methyl_pos]-methyl-[oxo_pos]-oxocyclohexane-[carboxylate_pos]-carboxylate.
final_name = f"ethyl {methyl_position}-methyl-{oxo_position}-oxocyclohexane-{carboxylate_position}-carboxylate"

# Print the name of the starting material.
print(final_name)

# As requested, here is each number from the final name's "equation".
