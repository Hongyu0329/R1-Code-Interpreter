    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find a pair of polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that they are left coprime and their product reconstructs $H(s)$. A factorization is left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. This is guaranteed if the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ is minimal among all possible left factorizations. This minimal degree is known as the McMillan degree of $H(s)$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a general polynomial matrix $D(s)$ and impose the condition that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ must also be a polynomial matrix.\n2.  From this condition, we will derive constraints on the elements of $D(s)$.\n3.  We will choose the simplest possible polynomials for the elements of $D(s)$ that satisfy these constraints. This approach helps in finding a $D(s)$ where the degree of its determinant is minimal.\n4.  Once $D(s)$ is determined, we will calculate the corresponding numerator matrix $N(s)$.\n5.  Finally, we will present the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ in a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics, which will define the matrices and print them in the final equation form.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  Let the given transfer function be:\n    \\[\n    H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  Let $D(s)$ be a general $2 \\times 2$ polynomial matrix:\n    \\[\n    D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n3.  We require $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix.\n    \\[\n    N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n4.  For $N(s)$ to be polynomial, its elements must be polynomials.\n    *   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n    *   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n    *   $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This means the numerator must be divisible by $s^2-1$, which has roots at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This means its numerator must also be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n\n5.  Let's find the simplest non-trivial polynomials that satisfy these conditions. We'll make strategic choices to keep the degree of $\\det(D(s))$ low.\n    *   Let's choose $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n    *   Now, for $n_{11}(s)$, the numerator is $(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$.\n        *   At $s=1$: $(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n        *   At $s=-1$: $(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n        The simplest polynomial for $d_{12}(s)$ satisfying these two conditions is a line, $d_{12}(s) = as+b$. Solving the system $a+b=0$ and $-a+b=-2$ gives $a=1, b=-1$. So, $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    *   For $n_{21}(s)$, with $d_{21}(s)=0$, the numerator is $2d_{22}(s)$. This must be divisible by $s^2-1$. The simplest polynomial choice for $d_{22}(s)$ is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n\n6.  With these choices, our denominator matrix is:\n    \\[\n    D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The degree of its determinant is $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = \\deg(s^2-1) = 2$. This matches the McMillan degree of $H(s)$, indicating our factorization is coprime.\n\n7.  Now, we calculate the numerator matrix $N(s)$:\n    *   $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$.\n    *   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    *   $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = 2$.\n    *   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n    So, the numerator matrix is:\n    \\[\n    N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\nThe following Python code uses `sympy` to represent these matrices and prints the final factorization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Set up the symbolic variable\ns = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n# Define the calculated left coprime matrices D(s) and N(s)\n# based on the derivation above.\nD = sympy.Matrix([\n    [1, s - 1],\n    [0, s**2 - 1]\n])\n\nN = sympy.Matrix([\n    [1, 1],\n    [2, 0]\n])\n\n# Define the original transfer function H(s) for verification\nH = sympy.Matrix([\n    [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n    [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n])\n\n# --- Output the results ---\n\nprint(\"A left coprime factorization for the transfer function H(s) is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\")\nprint(\"\\nThe matrices D(s) and N(s) are found to be:\")\n\nprint(\"\\nD(s) =\")\nsympy.pretty_print(D)\n\nprint(\"\\nN(s) =\")\nsympy.pretty_print(N)\n\n# The final equation with each matrix element shown:\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n\n# Pretty print the full equation H(s) = D(s)^-1 N(s)\n# We manually construct the print output for better alignment and clarity.\nh_str = sympy.printing.pretty(H, use_unicode=True).split('\\n')\nd_str = sympy.printing.pretty(D, use_unicode=True).split('\\n')\nn_str = sympy.printing.pretty(N, use_unicode=True).split('\\n')\n\n# Add the inverse symbol '⁻¹' to D(s)\nmid_row = len(d_str) // 2\nd_str[mid_row] += '⁻¹'\n\n# Align the matrices for printing\nmax_height = max(len(h_str), len(d_str), len(n_str))\nwhile len(h_str) < max_height:\n    h_str.insert(len(h_str)//2, ' ' * len(h_str[0]))\nwhile len(d_str) < max_height:\n    d_str.insert(len(d_str)//2, ' ' * len(d_str[0]))\nwhile len(n_str) < max_height:\n    n_str.insert(len(n_str)//2, ' ' * len(n_str[0]))\n\nfor i in range(max_height):\n    op1 = '  =  ' if i == max_height // 2 else '     '\n    op2 = ' * ' if i == max_height // 2 else '   '\n    print(h_str[i] + op1 + d_str[i] + op2 + n_str[i])\n\n# Verification (optional, for confidence)\n# D_inv_N = sympy.simplify(D.inv() * N)\n# print(f\"\\nVerification successful: {D_inv_N == H}\")\n\n```\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
