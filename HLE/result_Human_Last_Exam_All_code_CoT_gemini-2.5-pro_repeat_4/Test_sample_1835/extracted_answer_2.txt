Yes. The Generality Constraint is fundamentally about the systematic and combinatorial nature of thought. If you understand `Fa`, you must possess a general concept of the predicate `F` that is not intrinsically tied to `a`. If you also possess the conceptual tool of universal quantification (`∀x`), you have all the necessary components to construct the thought `∀x Fx`. The ability to make such a combination is precisely what the Generality Constraint suggests is a condition of being a rational thinker.
