    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to analyze the rhymes in Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" to find the word that isn't used in a rhyme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Fetch the Text:** The script will first download the full text of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  **Isolate the Poem:** It will then clean up the downloaded file by removing the header and footer information that Project Gutenberg adds, leaving only the poem's text.\n3.  **Extract Rhyming Words:** The poem is written in couplets, meaning the words at the end of consecutive lines rhyme. The script will process the poem line by line, extract the last word from each line, and add it to a collection of all rhyming words. These words will be converted to lowercase to ensure accurate matching.\n4.  **Check the Answer Choices:** Finally, the script will iterate through the provided list of words (Wente, Here, Fool, Hool, Countour). It will check which of these words appears in the collection of rhyming words extracted from the poem.\n5.  **Identify the Exception:** The word from the list that is *not* found in the collection of the poem's rhyming words is the one Chaucer did not use in a rhyme. The script will print this analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" to find which word from a given\n    list is not used at the end of a line to make a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
