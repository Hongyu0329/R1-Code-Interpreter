# (a) Does the existence of a non-zero sigma(a) imply that g acts by a reflection?

# The answer is No. The statement "The map g acts as a reflection on Q with g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}"
# is provided as part of the definition of the mathematical setup.
# It is a foundational premise, not a result that can be implied by other conditions
# within the system, such as sigma(a) being non-zero.
print("Part (a): No")


# (b) Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.

# A condition on 'd' is required such that sigma(a) must be non-zero for all arrows 'a'.
# This is possible if we avoid situations that force sigma(a) to be zero.
# A frequent cause for sigma(a) being forced to zero occurs when 'a' is a fixed-point of the map g.
# An arrow a: i -> j is a fixed-point (g.a = a) if it is a loop (i=j) at a vertex 'v' that
# is itself a fixed-point of the vertex map (g.v = v).
#
# A vertex 'v' is a fixed point if it satisfies the equation v = n - d - v.
# This can be rewritten as:
# 2 * v = n - d
#
# For an integer solution 'v' to exist, the right-hand side (n - d) must be an even number.
# To guarantee that no integer solution 'v' exists, and thus no fixed-point vertices or arrows exist,
# the value of (n - d) must be an odd number.
#
# This is the condition on d. It can be expressed with the following equation:
print("Part (b): The condition on d is that (n - d) must be an odd integer.")
