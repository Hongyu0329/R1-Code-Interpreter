    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single fixed number but rather falls within an optimal range. The performance depends heavily on the preparation method and reaction conditions. However, based on scientific literature, a general consensus can be established. An optimal ratio balances the number of active Ni sites with their dispersion on the ceria support, which prevents the nickel nanoparticles from sintering (clumping together) at high temperatures and maximizes the crucial interface between Ni and Ceria.\n\nFor both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, research indicates that a relatively low nickel loading is often most effective. A composition of around 15 atomic percent Ni is frequently cited as being near-optimal.\n\nI will write a Python script that calculates the specific Ni/Ce atomic ratio based on this representative value of 15 atomic percent Ni. The script will then print a clear statement explaining this calculation, showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio based on literature findings.\n    \n    The ideal ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is often expressed in terms of atomic percent (at%).\n    A value of 15 at% Ni is frequently found to be highly effective. This function\n    calculates the corresponding Ni/Ce atomic ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A representative optimal value for Ni concentration in atomic percent (at%).\n    ni_atomic_percent = 15\n    \n    # The remainder is the cerium (Ce) concentration.\n    ce_atomic_percent = 100 - ni_atomic_percent\n    \n    # Calculate the atomic ratio of Ni to Ce.\n    ni_ce_ratio = ni_atomic_percent / ce_atomic_percent\n    \n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but falls within a range.\")\n    print(f\"Based on research, a representative optimal composition is around {ni_atomic_percent} atomic percent Ni.\")\n    print(\"This means for every 100 total metal atoms (Ni + Ce), there are 15 Ni atoms and 85 Ce atoms.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe corresponding Ni/Ce atomic ratio is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: Ni atoms / Ce atoms = {ni_atomic_percent} / {ce_atomic_percent}\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Ratio: {ni_ce_ratio:.3f}\")\n\ncalculate_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.176>>>"
