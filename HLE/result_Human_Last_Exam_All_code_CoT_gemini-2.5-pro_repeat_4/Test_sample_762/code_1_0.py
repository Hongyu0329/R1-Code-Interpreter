# The problem can be modeled by processing iterations in chunks of size P.
# First, calculate the number of chunks required to process all N iterations.
# We must use the ceiling function because even a partial chunk requires processing.
num_chunks = math.ceil(N / P)

# Each chunk of P iterations takes D cycles to complete. This is because:
# Cycle 1: P LOADs (all 16 units busy)
# Cycle 2: P MULs (all 16 units busy)
# Cycle 3: P ADDs (all 16 units busy)
# Cycle 4: P STOREs (all 16 units busy)
# Since the units are fully utilized for these 4 cycles, the chunks must be executed sequentially.
cycles_per_chunk = D

# The total number of cycles is the number of chunks multiplied by the cycles per chunk.
total_cycles = num_chunks * cycles_per_chunk
