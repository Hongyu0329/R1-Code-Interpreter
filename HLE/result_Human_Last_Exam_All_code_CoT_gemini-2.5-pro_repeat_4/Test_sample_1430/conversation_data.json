    "This is an interesting problem from algebraic geometry. To solve it, we don't need to perform heavy computations but rather apply some key theoretical results about algebraic curves and their associated varieties. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The core of the problem is to find the rank of the Néron-Severi group for a variety $X = C^{(15)}$, which is the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$. The rank can vary depending on the specific choice of the curve $C$. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for this rank.\n\n2.  **Apply Macdonald's Formula**: There is a fundamental formula that connects the Néron-Severi rank of a symmetric power of a curve, denoted $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, to the Néron-Severi rank of its Jacobian variety, $\\rho(J(C))$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n    This formula simplifies our problem significantly. Instead of analyzing the complex geometry of $X = C^{(15)}$, we only need to find the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Rank**: The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is determined by the complexity of the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian $J(C)$. For a \"generic\" curve $C$, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has no special endomorphisms (a property called \"no complex multiplication\"). In this case, its Néron-Severi group is as simple as possible, and its rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1.\n\n4.  **Find the Largest Rank**: The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is maximized when the curve $C$ is \"special\", meaning its Jacobian has the largest possible ring of endomorphisms (\"maximal complex multiplication\"). For a Jacobian of a genus $g$ curve, the maximum possible rank for its Néron-Severi group is $g^2$. This maximum is known to be achievable. For our genus $g=3$ curve, the maximum rank is $3^2 = 9$. This occurs for special curves like the Fermat quartic curve.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Results**: Using the formula from step 2, we can now calculate the smallest and largest ranks for $X$:\n    *   Smallest rank of $NS(X) = (\\text{min } \\rho(J(C))) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest rank of $NS(X) = (\\text{max } \\rho(J(C))) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps and print the calculations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the smallest and largest possible rank\n    of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15), the 15th symmetric power of a \n    genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the parameters from the problem description\n    g = 3  # The genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^({d}),\")\n    print(f\"where C is a Riemann surface of genus {g}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the key formula connecting rho(X) and rho(J(C))\")\n    print(\"Let rho(V) be the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a variety V.\")\n    print(\"A result by Macdonald relates the rank for the symmetric power C^(d) to the rank for the Jacobian J(C):\")\n    print(\"rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1\")\n    print(\"Our task is now to find the minimum and maximum possible values of rho(J(C)) for a genus 3 curve.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the smallest possible rank for NS(X)\")\n    print(\"The smallest rank occurs for a 'generic' curve C, whose Jacobian J(C) has no complex multiplication.\")\n    \n    # For a generic curve, the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is generated by the principal polarization.\n    min_rho_JC = 1\n    print(f\"For a generic curve of genus {g}, the minimum rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is rho(J(C))_min = {min_rho_JC}.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the smallest rank for X using the formula\n    smallest_rank_X = min_rho_JC + 1\n    print(\"\\nUsing the formula, the smallest rank for NS(X) is:\")\n    print(f\"Smallest Rank = rho(J(C))_min + 1 = {min_rho_JC} + 1 = {smallest_rank_X}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the largest possible rank for NS(X)\")\n    print(\"The largest rank occurs for a 'special' curve C, whose Jacobian J(C) has maximal complex multiplication.\")\n    \n    # For a special curve, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian can reach the theoretical maximum.\n    # This maximum for a g-dimensional abelian variety is g^2.\n    max_rho_JC = g * g\n    print(f\"For a special curve of genus {g}, the maximum rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is rho(J(C))_max = g^2 = {g}^2 = {max_rho_JC}.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achieved by curves such as the Fermat quartic.\")\n\n    # Calculate the largest rank for X using the formula\n    largest_rank_X = max_rho_JC + 1\n    print(\"\\nUsing the formula, the largest rank for NS(X) is:\")\n    print(f\"Largest Rank = rho(J(C))_max + 1 = {max_rho_JC} + 1 = {largest_rank_X}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is {smallest_rank_X}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is {largest_rank_X}.\")\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n```\n<<<Smallest: 2, Largest: 10>>>"
