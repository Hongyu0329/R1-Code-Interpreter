    This script symbolically derives the expression for theta'(t) based on the problem description.
    It follows the logical steps outlined:
    1. Define the relationship between the components in the standard basis (a, b) and the problem's basis (u, v).
    2. Define the Jacobi equations for (a, b) with zero curvature.
    3. Derive the system of differential equations for (u, v).
    4. Use the polar coordinate representation z = u + i*v = r*exp(i*theta) to find theta'.

    # From the problem statement, we have the relations:

    # b(t) = u(t) * f(t)
    # And the Jacobi equations for a(t), b(t) with K=0 are:
    # a'(t) = b(t)
    # b'(t) = 0
    #
    # From these, we derive the ODEs for u and v:
    # v'(t) = a'(t) = b(t) = u(t)*f(t)
    # b'(t) = (u(t)*f(t))' = u'(t)*f(t) + u(t)*f'(t) = 0  => u'(t) = -u(t)*f'(t)/f(t)
