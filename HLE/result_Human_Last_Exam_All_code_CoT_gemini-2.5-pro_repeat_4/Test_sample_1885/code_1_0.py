    print("Problem Statement:")
    print("Let <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> be a sequence of functions, where each f_alpha maps omega_1 to omega_1.")
    print("This sequence is increasing modulo finite, i.e., for any alpha < beta < omega_2, the set")
    print("{gamma in omega_1 : f_beta(gamma) <= f_alpha(gamma)} is finite. We denote this by f_alpha <* f_beta.")
    print("\nQuestion:")
    print("Does there necessarily exist (i.e., is it provable from ZFC) an uncountable set X (a subset of omega_2)")
    print("and a function g: omega_1 -> omega_1 such that for every beta in X and every gamma in omega_1,")
    print("we have f_beta(gamma) < g(gamma)?")
    print("="*50)

    print("\nAnswer:")
    print("No, such a set X and function g do not necessarily exist.")
    print("="*50)

    print("\nExplanation and Proof:")
    print("To show that a statement is not a theorem of ZFC, we can show that its negation is consistent with ZFC.")
    print("In other words, if a counterexample can exist in some model of ZFC, then the statement is not necessarily true.")

    print("\nStep 1: Understanding Bounding and Dominance")
    print("Let's define two ways a function g can be 'larger' than a function f:")
    print("  - Pointwise Bound: f < g if for all gamma, f(gamma) < g(gamma).")
    print("  - Dominance mod finite: f <* g if {gamma : f(gamma) >= g(gamma)} is finite.")
    print("\nIf a set of functions {f_beta : beta in X} is pointwise bounded by g, then it is also bounded by g modulo finite.")
    print("That is, for all beta in X, f_beta < g implies f_beta <* g.")

    print("\nStep 2: Constructing a Counterexample using a Dominating Family")
    print("A family of functions F is called 'dominating' if for any function g, there is some f in F such that g <* f.")
    print("A special type of dominating family is a 'scale', which is a <*-increasing, cofinal sequence.")
    print("A cofinal sequence F has the property that for any g, there is an f in F such that g <* f.")
    
    print("\nLet's assume we have a <*-increasing sequence F = <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> that is cofinal (and thus dominating).")
    print("We will show that for this sequence F, no uncountable subset can be pointwise bounded.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Contradiction")
    print("Assume for contradiction that there IS an uncountable set X (subset of omega_2) and a function g that pointwise bounds {f_beta : beta in X}.")
    print("This means for every beta in X, f_beta <* g.")
    
    print("\nSince our sequence F is cofinal, for the function g, there must exist some delta < omega_2 such that g <* f_delta.")
    
    print("\nNow, X is an uncountable subset of omega_2, and delta is a specific element of omega_2.")
    print("Because omega_2 is a regular cardinal larger than aleph_0, X cannot be contained in the initial segment delta.")
    print("So, there must be some beta in X such that beta > delta.")
    
    print("\nFrom our assumptions, we now have three relations:")
    print(f"  1. g <* f_delta (because F is cofinal)")
    print(f"  2. f_delta <* f_beta (because beta > delta and the sequence is <*-increasing)")
    print(f"  3. f_beta <* g (because beta is in X and g bounds X)")
    
    print("\nCombining (1) and (2) gives g <* f_beta. But this contradicts (3), f_beta <* g.")
    print("(Note: g <* f and f <* g cannot both be true unless f and g are equal mod finite, which is not the case here).")
    print("Thus, our initial assumption that an uncountable bounded subset X exists must be false.")

    print("\nStep 4: Consistency Result from Set Theory")
    print("We have shown that if a <*-increasing cofinal omega_2-sequence exists, it serves as a counterexample.")
    print("The final piece of the puzzle is that the existence of such a sequence is consistent with ZFC.")
    print("This is a deep result proven by Saharon Shelah. It is consistent with ZFC that the 'dominating number' for functions from omega_1 to omega_1 is omega_2.")

    print("\n--- Final Equation ---")
    print("The dominating number, d(kappa), is defined as:")
    kappa = "omega_1"
    kappa_notation = "omega_1"
    print(f"d({kappa}) = min{{ |F| : F is a subset of {kappa_notation}^{kappa_notation} and F is a dominating family }}")
    print("--- End Equation ---")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The statement 'd(omega_1) = omega_2' is consistent with ZFC. In any model of ZFC where this holds,")
    print("a counterexample to the user's question exists. Therefore, the statement is not a theorem of ZFC,")
    print("and the answer is NO.")
