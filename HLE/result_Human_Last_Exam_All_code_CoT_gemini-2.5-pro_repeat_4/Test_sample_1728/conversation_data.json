    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Graph and Operation:** The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which can be written as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The term \"sum\" in this context refers to the disjunctive product of graphs. For two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), their disjunctive product \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) has vertices that are pairs \\( (v_1, v_2) \\) where \\( v_1 \\in V(G_1) \\) and \\( v_2 \\in V(G_2) \\). Two vertices \\( (u_1, u_2) \\) and \\( (v_1, v_2) \\) are adjacent if \\( u_1 \\) is adjacent to \\( v_1 \\) in \\( G_1 \\) **or** \\( u_2 \\) is adjacent to \\( v_2 \\) in \\( G_2 \\).\n\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number Formula for Graph Sums:** A key property of the disjunctive product is that its chromatic number is the product of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\n    \\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) \\times \\chi(G_2) \\]\n    This property extends to the sum of three graphs:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n + C_n + C_n) = \\chi(C_n) \\times \\chi(C_n) \\times \\chi(C_n) = (\\chi(C_n))^3 \\]\n\n3.  **Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd (for \\( n \\ge 3 \\)).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, \\( C_n \\) is bipartite, and its vertices can be colored with just two colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, \\( C_n \\) is not bipartite. At least three colors are required. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n4.  **Find the Maximal Value:** To find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\), we need to find the maximum possible value of \\( (\\chi(C_n))^3 \\). This is achieved by maximizing \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). Comparing the two possible values (2 and 3), the maximum is 3. This occurs when \\( n \\) is any odd integer \\( \\ge 3 \\).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Substitute the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into the formula.\n    \\[ \\text{Maximal } \\chi(G) = (3)^3 = 27 \\]\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph G,\n    where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\")\n    print(\"The '+' operation here denotes the disjunctive product of graphs.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the formula for the chromatic number of a graph sum.\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the property of the chromatic number for a disjunctive product.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the product of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"χ(G1 + G2) = χ(G1) * χ(G2)\")\n    print(\"Therefore, for G = C_n + C_n + C_n, we have:\")\n    print(\"χ(G) = χ(C_n) * χ(C_n) * χ(C_n) = (χ(C_n))^3\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the chromatic number of a cycle C_n.\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of a cycle C_n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle C_n (for n >= 3) depends on the parity of n:\")\n    print(\" - If n is even, C_n is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\")\n    print(\" - If n is odd, C_n requires three colors, and its chromatic number is 3.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the maximum value for χ(C_n).\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the maximal value for χ(C_n).\")\n    print(\"To maximize χ(G), we must maximize χ(C_n).
