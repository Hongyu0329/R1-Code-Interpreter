# The final answer is E because AKo is a premium hand that is at the top of any shoving range in this spot.
# It maintains high equity against the tight calling ranges expected on the bubble and has significant fold equity.
# Final Answer Calculation:
# Strength of AKo = Premium
# Strength of 99 = Strong
# Strength of AJo = Good but dominated
# Strength of QJs = Marginal
# Best Choice = AKo
# Final Answer Code = 'E'
