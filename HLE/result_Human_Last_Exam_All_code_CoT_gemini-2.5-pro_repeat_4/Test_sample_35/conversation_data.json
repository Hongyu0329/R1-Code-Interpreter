    "This is a classic poker tournament scenario that involves understanding stack sizes, position, and Independent Chip Model (ICM) pressure. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the best hand to shove.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1) is an early position. Any hand we play needs to be strong because there are many players left to act behind us.\n    *   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (bb) is a classic \"shove/fold\" stack. Calling raises is generally not a good option, so we are looking for hands that are strong enough to open-shove all-in with.\n    *   **Game State:** \"Near the money bubble\". This is the most critical factor. The ICM pressure is extremely high. This means the monetary value of surviving is very high, so opponents will be calling our all-in with a much tighter range of hands than usual. This increases our \"fold equity\" (the chance they fold). However, it also means we should be more selective about the hands we risk our tournament life with.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hand Options under ICM Pressure:**\n    *   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This is a decent hand, but it performs poorly when called. A tight calling range (like JJ+, AK) has QJs dominated or in a coin-flip at best. Given the early position and bubble pressure, this is a risky shove and likely a fold.\n    *   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** A strong pair. It is a coin-flip against hands like AK and AQ, which might call us. It's ahead of smaller pairs but behind any overpair (TT, JJ, QQ, etc.). It's a strong candidate for a shove, but not the absolute strongest.\n    *   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** A strong high-card hand with a good \"blocker\" effect (holding an Ace makes it less likely an opponent has AA or AK). However, it is dominated by AQ and AK, which are the exact hands that would be most likely to call our shove. This makes it a riskier shove than a pocket pair like 99.\n    *   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand. It dominates almost every other hand that isn't AA or KK. It has excellent blocker effects, reducing the chances of running into those monster hands. Even when called by a pocket pair like QQ or JJ, it has nearly 50% equity (a coin flip). Given its raw strength and ability to make opponents fold, this is the best hand to shove to accumulate chips and apply pressure on the bubble.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** While several hands in the list might be part of a standard 16bb shoving range, the bubble pressure makes us prioritize hands that have the best equity when called. AKo is at the top of this range. It combines raw strength, excellent blockers, and plays well against the tight calling ranges we expect on the bubble. Therefore, it's the most profitable and correct hand to jam all-in with.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the correct action.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Scenario Definition ---\n    position = \"UTG+1 (Early Position)\"\n    stack_size_bb = 16\n    game_state = \"Near the money bubble (High ICM pressure)\"\n    hand_options = {\n        \"A\": \"QJs\",\n        \"B\": \"None of these\",\n        \"C\": \"99\",\n        \"D\": \"AJo\",\n        \"E\": \"AKo\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the poker scenario:\")\n    print(f\"Stack Size: {stack_size_bb}bb.
