    "To answer this question, I will write a Python script that processes historical data.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a list of notable French ships that were sunk due to U-boat actions between the start of World War II (September 1939) and the French armistice (June 22, 1940).\n2.  Each entry in the list will contain the ship's name, type, and gross register tonnage (a measure of displacement).\n3.  The script will then iterate through this list to identify the ship with the highest tonnage.\n4.  Finally, it will print a detailed answer, including the ship's name and its displacement, which is the key number in this query.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat's action\n    before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data format: (Ship Name, Type, Gross Register Tonnage)\n    # This data represents a selection of the largest French ships sunk by U-boats\n    # or mines laid by U-boats in the specified period.\n    ships_data = [\n        (\"Ã‰mile Miguet\", \"Tanker\", 14115),\n        (\"Cheyenne\", \"Tanker\", 8825),\n        (\"Brazza\", \"Passenger Ship\", 10387),\n        (\"Champlain\", \"Passenger Liner\", 28124)\n    ]\n\n    # Initialize variables to store the details of the largest ship found.\n    largest_ship_name = \"\"\n    largest_ship_displacement = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the data to find the ship with the maximum displacement.\n    for name, ship_type, displacement in ships_data:\n        if displacement > largest_ship_displacement:\n            largest_ship_displacement = displacement\n            largest_ship_name = name\n\n    # Output the result.\n    if largest_ship_name:\n        # The final answer includes the name and the key number (displacement).\n        print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat's action before the 1940 armistice was the S.S. {largest_ship_name}.\")\n        # The number from the final 'equation' or finding is the displacement.\n        print(f\"Its displacement was {largest_ship_displacement} tons.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine the largest ship from the provided data.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<S.S.
