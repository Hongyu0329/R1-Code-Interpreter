For q = 5 and m = 1:
The group order is 2 * 5^1 = 10.
Based on the classification of filled groups, the unique nonabelian filled group of this order is the Dihedral Group.
Name: D_10 (also written as D_n where n is the number of rotational symmetries, n=5)
The standard presentation of this group is:
<r, s | r^5 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^-1>
