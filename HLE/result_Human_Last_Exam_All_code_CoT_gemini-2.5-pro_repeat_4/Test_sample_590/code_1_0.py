    This function determines the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    # The stability operator is given by:
    # L = (1/(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|)) * d/drho(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|^(-1) * d/drho)
    #     + (1/<rho>^2) * Delta_S + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n)
    # where <rho> = sqrt(rho^2 + 1).

    # Step 1: Separation of Variables
    # We look for eigenfunctions u(rho, theta) of the form R(rho) * Y_k(theta), where Y_k
    # are spherical harmonics, i.e., eigenfunctions of the spherical Laplacian Delta_S
    # with eigenvalues -k(k+n-2) for k = 0, 1, 2, ...
    # This reduces the problem to a family of 1D radial eigenvalue problems L_k R = lambda R.

    # Step 2: Asymptotic Analysis of the Radial Operators
    # Each radial operator L_k is a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line rho in (-inf, inf).
    # We analyze its behavior as rho -> +/- infinity.
    # As |rho| -> infinity:
    #   <rho> approaches |rho|.
    #   |F_rho| approaches 1.
    #   The potential term V_k(rho) = -k(k+n-2)/<rho>^2 + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n) goes to 0.
    # The kinetic part of the operator asymptotically behaves like the radial part of the
    # standard Laplacian in R^n.

    # Step 3: Determining the Essential Spectrum
    # For a Sturm-Liouville operator on an infinite domain, if the potential term vanishes
    # at infinity, the essential (continuous) spectrum starts at 0 and extends to infinity.
    # Thus, for each k, the essential spectrum of L_k is [0, infinity).
    # The essential spectrum of the full operator L is the union of the spectra of L_k,
    # which is also [0, infinity).

    # Step 4: Conclusion on Positive Eigenvalues
    # Eigenvalues, by definition, are part of the discrete spectrum. They must be isolated
    # points in the full spectrum of the operator.
    # Since the entire positive axis (0, infinity) is filled by the continuous spectrum,
    # there is no room for isolated points. Therefore, there can be no positive eigenvalues.
    # A more rigorous proof involves showing that for any lambda > 0, the solutions to
    # the equation L*u = lambda*u are oscillating at infinity and are not square-integrable
    # in the required L^2 space. Hence, they are not true eigenfunctions.
