def solve_limit_size_problem():
    """
    This function explains and calculates the smallest possible size of the limit
    for the given type of functor.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible size of the limit of a functor F: J^op -> Set,
    where J is a directed poset, F(j) is non-empty for all j in J, and all maps
    in the image of F are surjective.

    Step 1: Establish a lower bound for the size.
    A standard result in category theory (provable with the Axiom of Choice) states
    that the limit of such a diagram of non-empty sets with surjective maps is
    always non-empty. This means the size of the limit must be at least 1.

    Step 2: Construct an example to see if a size of 1 is achievable.
    To find the *smallest possible* size, we can choose the simplest J and F
    that satisfy the conditions.

    - Let J be the simplest directed poset: a single-element set {0}.
    - The functor F must map 0 to a non-empty set. To minimize the limit's size,
      we choose the smallest non-empty set: a singleton set.
    """

    # Let F(0) be a singleton set.
    F_0 = {"*"}
    size_F_0 = len(F_0)

    """
    - The conditions on F are satisfied: F(0) is non-empty, and the only
      morphism map F(id_0) = id_{F(0)} is surjective.

    Step 3: Calculate the limit for this specific example.
    An element in the limit is a coherent family (x_j) for j in J.
    Here, J = {0}, so a family is just an element x_0 from F(0).
    The coherence condition is x_i = f_ji(x_j) for i <= j.
    The only case is i=0, j=0, so x_0 = f_00(x_0). Since f_00 is the identity map,
    this is x_0 = x_0, which is always true.
    Thus, the limit set is identical to F(0).
    """

    # The size of the limit in our example is the size of F(0).
    limit_size_in_example = size_F_0

    # Since the limit size must be >= 1, and we found an example where it is 1,
    # the smallest possible size is 1.
    smallest_possible_size = 1

    print("1. A theorem in category theory guarantees the limit is non-empty, so its size is at least 1.")
