    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to transform the integral equation into a system of linear equations. Then, we can use numerical methods to find the eigenvalues that determine the values of λ.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  The integral equation is given by `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, where the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n2.  The kernel can be expanded as a sum: `K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`.\n3.  Substituting this into the equation, we see that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can write `u(x)` in the form `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k`.\n4.  The unknown coefficients `c_k` are defined by `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy`.\n5.  By substituting the form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `c_j`, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` coefficients `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n    `c_j = 1/(n-j) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (n-j+k)` for `j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n6.  This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, and the elements of matrix `A` and vector `b` are:\n    *   `A_{jk} = 1 / (n - j + k)` (with `j` as the row index and `k` as the column index, both from `0` to `n-1`).\n    *   `b_j = 1 / (n - j)`.\n7.  According to the Fredholm alternative, this system has no solution if `det(I - λA) = 0` and the vector `b` is not in the range of the matrix `(I - λA)`. The first condition, `det(I - λA) = 0`, is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n8.  Let `μ` be an eigenvalue of `A`. Then `λ = 1/μ` is a characteristic value. For these values of `λ`, the equation generally has no solution. A solution would only exist under the specific condition that `b` is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)ᵀ`. We will find the values of `λ` for which a solution does not exist by assuming this orthogonality condition is not met.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It constructs the matrix `A`, finds its eigenvalues `μ`, and then calculates the corresponding values of `λ = 1/μ`. You can set the value of `n` at the beginning of the script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the integral equation kernel.
