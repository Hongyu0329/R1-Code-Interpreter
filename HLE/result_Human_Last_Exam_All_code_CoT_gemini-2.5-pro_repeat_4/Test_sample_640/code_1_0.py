def solve_scattering_problem():
    """
    Analyzes statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The analysis relies on the following key relationships from inverse scattering theory:

    1. V(r) <==> F(E): The potential V(r) and the Jost matrix F(E) are in a one-to-one
       correspondence. A given F(E) (including its full analytic structure) uniquely
       determines V(r), and vice-versa. This implies that the family of matrices V(r)
       is trivially coupled if and only if the family F(E) is.

    2. F(E) ==> S(E): The S-matrix S(E) is determined by the Jost matrix F(E), but this
       mapping is many-to-one. Different Jost matrices can lead to the same S-matrix.
       This also means the mapping from the potential V(r) to the S-matrix S(E) is
       many-to-one (a phenomenon known as phase-equivalent potentials).

    "Trivially coupled" means the matrix family (e.g., V(r) for all r) can be
    diagonalized by a single, constant similarity transformation. "Nontrivially
    coupled" means it cannot.

    Let's analyze each statement based on these principles.

    # Statement 1: A nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a
    # nontrivially coupled potential V(r).
    # This is equivalent to its contrapositive: a trivially coupled potential V(r)
    # corresponds to a trivially coupled scattering matrix S(E).
    # If V(r) is trivially coupled, so is F(E) (due to V<=>F).
    # If F(E) is trivially coupled, its structure (F = C*F_d*C^-1) passes to S(E)
    # through the relation S ~ F(-k)*[F(k)]^-1, making S(E) also trivially coupled.
    # The reasoning holds.
    analysis.append("1) Correct. This statement is equivalent to its contrapositive: 'a trivially coupled potential leads to a trivially coupled S-matrix'. If V(r) can be diagonalized by a constant transformation C, the entire system can be solved in that diagonal basis, leading to an S-matrix that is also diagonalizable by the same transformation C.")
    correct_statements.append(1)

    # Statement 2: A diagonal scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a diagonal
    # potential V(r).
    # A diagonal S(E) is trivially coupled. The statement claims this implies V(r)
    # is diagonal. However, because the V=>S mapping is many-to-one, a nontrivially
    # coupled potential can be constructed to have the same (diagonal) S-matrix
    # as a simple diagonal potential.
    analysis.append("2) Incorrect. The existence of 'phase-equivalent potentials' means that a nontrivially coupled potential V(r) can produce the same S-matrix as a diagonal potential. Therefore, a diagonal S(E) does not uniquely imply a diagonal V(r).")
    
    # Statement 3: A nontrivially coupled potential V(r) corresponds to a
    # nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E).
    # This follows directly from the one-to-one correspondence between V(r) and F(E).
    # One is nontrivially coupled if and only if the other is.
    analysis.append("3) Correct. The Jost matrix F(E) and the potential V(r) are uniquely related (a one-to-one mapping in scattering theory). Therefore, one being nontrivially coupled directly implies the other must be as well.")
    correct_statements.append(3)

    # Statement 4: A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E) corresponds to a
    # nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E).
    # This is the contrapositive of 'a trivially coupled S(E) corresponds to a
    # trivially coupled F(E)'. This is false because the F=>S mapping is many-to-one.
    # One can have a nontrivially coupled F(E) that produces a trivially coupled S(E).
    analysis.append("4) Incorrect. The mapping from F(E) to S(E) is many-to-one. It is possible to construct a nontrivially coupled F(E) that results in a trivially coupled (or even diagonal) S(E), for instance by using a CDD ambiguity factor.")

    # Statement 5: There exist nontrivially coupled potentials V(r) with diagonal
    # Jost matrices F(E).
    # A diagonal F(E) is trivially coupled. Due to the one-to-one V<=>F relationship,
    # this would imply that the corresponding V(r) must also be trivially coupled.
    # This contradicts the premise that V(r) is nontrivially coupled.
    analysis.append("5) Incorrect. This statement contradicts the one-to-one correspondence between V(r) and F(E). A diagonal F(E) is trivially coupled, which requires that its corresponding potential V(r) must also be trivially coupled.")
