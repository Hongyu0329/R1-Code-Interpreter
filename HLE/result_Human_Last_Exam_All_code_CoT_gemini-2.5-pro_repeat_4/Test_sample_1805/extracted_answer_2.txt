For an integer $n$, the q-difference quotient of $T^n$ is given by the formula $\nabla_q(T^n) = [n]_q T^{n-1}$, where $[n]_q = \frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$. Using the convention that for a sum $\sum_{k=a}^b$, if $b < a$, then $\sum_{k=a}^b = -\sum_{k=b+1}^{a-1}$, the q-number can be expressed as $[n]_q = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q^k$ for all integers $n$. Therefore, the result is $\nabla_q(T^n) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q^k\right) T^{n-1}$.
