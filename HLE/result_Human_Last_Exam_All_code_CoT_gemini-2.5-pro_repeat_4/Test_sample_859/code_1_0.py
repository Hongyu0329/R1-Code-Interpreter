# Step 1: Define the problem parameters based on the reasoning.
# The number of edges to add depends on the number of disconnected components 'k'
# in the worst-case G'. The formula is k - 1 + ceil(k/2).
# We need to find the maximum possible value for k.

# Step 2: Determine the maximum value of k.
# The total number of edges from the removed vertices {v1, v2, v3} to G' is 3d + 2.
# For G to be 2-edge-connected, each of the k components of G' must have at least
# 2 edges connecting to {v1, v2, v3}.
# So, 2*k <= 3d + 2, which implies k <= (3d/2) + 1.
# To find the number of edges for the worst case, we maximize k.
# k_max = (3d/2) + 1.

# Step 3: Assume the minimal possible value for d to get a numerical answer.
# d is a positive even integer, so the smallest value is 2.
d = 2
print(f"The number of edges to add depends on d. We assume the minimal possible value, d = {d}.")

# Step 4: Calculate k_max for d=2.
k_max = int((3 * d / 2) + 1)
print(f"The maximum number of disconnected components in G' is k = (3 * {d} / 2) + 1 = {k_max}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the number of edges to add for this k_max.
# The formula is k - 1 + ceil(k/2).
# Since k_max=4 is even, ceil(k/2) is just k/2.
import math
edges_to_add = (k_max - 1) + math.ceil(k_max / 2)
term1 = k_max - 1
term2 = math.ceil(k_max / 2)

# Step 6: Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
print(f"The number of new edges is k - 1 + ceil(k/2).")
print(f"Final equation: ({k_max} - 1) + {term2} = {term1} + {term2} = {edges_to_add}")
