def solve_dimension():
    """
    This function calculates the largest possible dimension for the quotient ring R/I.

    The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I,
    where R is a polynomial ring in 10 variables and I is the ideal generated by
    positive-degree homogeneous invariants of a group G.

    Let the representation of G on C^10 be rho. The group that acts effectively
    on C^10 is H = G / ker(rho).

    A theorem in invariant theory states that the dimension of the coinvariant
    algebra is equal to the order of the effective group acting on the space.
    So, dim(R/I) = |H| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.

    The order of the group G is given as 10000.
    |G| = 10000

    To maximize the dimension, we must minimize the order of the kernel, |ker(rho)|.
    The smallest possible order for a subgroup is 1 (the trivial group). This occurs
    when the representation rho is faithful.

    A group of order 10000 with a faithful 10-dimensional representation exists.
    For instance, the cyclic group C_10000 can be faithfully represented in GL_10(C).

    Therefore, the maximum possible dimension is |G| / 1.
