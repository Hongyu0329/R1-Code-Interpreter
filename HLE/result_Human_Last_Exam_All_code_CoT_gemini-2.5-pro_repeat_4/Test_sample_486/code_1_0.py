    This function calculates the integral needed to show that a=2 is achievable.

    For the plane-like solution u(x1, x2, x3) = tanh(x3 / sqrt(2)), we have
    |∇u|^2 = (1/sqrt(2) * sech^2(x3 / sqrt(2)))^2 = (1/2) * sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)).

    The integral we want to evaluate is I(R) = ∫_{B_R} |∇u|^2 dx.
    I(R) = ∫_{B_R} (1/2) * sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)) dx1 dx2 dx3
         = ∫_{-R}^{R} (Area of 2D disk of radius sqrt(R^2 - x3^2)) * (1/2) * sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)) dx3
         = ∫_{-R}^{R} π(R^2 - x3^2) * (1/2) * sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)) dx3

    We are interested in the limit of R^{-2} * I(R) as R -> ∞.
    lim_{R->∞} R^{-2} * I(R) = lim_{R->∞} (π/2) ∫_{-R}^{R} (1 - (x3/R)^2) * sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)) dx3
    
    Due to the fast decay of sech^4, the term (x3/R)^2 -> 0 in the effective integration range.
    The limit becomes (π/2) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} sech^4(x3 / sqrt(2)) dx3.

    Let y = x3 / sqrt(2), so dx3 = sqrt(2) dy.
    The integral becomes (π/2) * sqrt(2) * ∫_{-∞}^{∞} sech(y)^4 dy.

    We will now calculate this definite integral.
