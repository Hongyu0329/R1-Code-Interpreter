    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid Al(OH)₃ and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant equilibria.**\n    *   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n    *   Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex:\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n2.  **Define solubility.** The molar solubility (s) is the total concentration of dissolved aluminum species.\n    *   s = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Establish the charge balance in the solution.** The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    *   3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   To find an expression for [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the two given reactions to get:\n        Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant for this, K_c, is K_sp * K_f.\n        K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] => [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻]\n    *   From the autoionization of water: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻], where K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH⁻].** Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation. This results in a polynomial equation that can be solved for [OH⁻].\n    *   3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_c * [OH⁻])\n\n6.  **Calculate the solubility.** Once [OH⁻] is known, we can calculate [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] and sum them to find the total solubility, s.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water,\n    considering the formation of the Al(OH)4- complex ion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants ---\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation of Al(OH)3 Solubility ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the equilibrium constants.\")\n    print(f\"K_sp for Al(OH)3 <=> Al^3+ + 3OH^- is {K_sp:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"K_f for Al^3+ + 4OH^- <=> Al(OH)4^- is {K_f:.2e}\")\n    print(f\"K_w for H2O <=> H+ + OH- is {K_w:.2e}\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the combined equilibrium constant K_c ---\n    K_c = K_sp * K_f\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Combine equilibria to relate Al(OH)4- to OH-.\")\n    print(\"The reaction is: Al(OH)3(s) + OH-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4-(aq)\")\n    print(f\"The constant K_c = K_sp * K_f = ({K_sp:.2e}) * ({K_f:.2e}) = {K_c:.2e}\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Use the charge balance equation.\")\n    print(\"3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4-]\")\n    print(\"Substituting expressions in terms of [OH-]:\")\n    print(f\"3*(K_sp / [OH-]^3) + (K_w / [OH-]) = [OH-] + (K_c * [OH-])\")\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Rearrange into a polynomial equation ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Rearrange into a solvable polynomial equation for [OH-].\")\n    print(\"Let x = [OH-].
