    # Based on the analysis of the properties of a head tail weak Delta-system
    # and Hajnal's Free Set Theorem, it can be deduced that a set 'x' with the
    # desired property (x intersect (union of a_alpha for alpha in x) = empty)

    # Step 3: List the elements of X and find its order type.
    # The infinite cardinals less than or equal to omega_7 are:
