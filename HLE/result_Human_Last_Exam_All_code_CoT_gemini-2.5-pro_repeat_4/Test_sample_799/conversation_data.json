    "This is a fascinating question at the intersection of number theory and fractal geometry.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Terms:** First, I'll briefly explain what a \"Sidon set\" and \"Hausdorff dimension\" are in this context.\n    *   A **Sidon set** (or B₂-set) is a set of numbers `A` where all pairwise sums are unique. That is, if `a, b, c, d` are in `A`, and `a + b = c + d`, then the pair `{a, b}` must be the same as `{c, d}`. This property imposes a strong arithmetic structure on the set.\n    *   **Hausdorff dimension** is a concept from mathematics that generalizes the notion of dimension to fractal sets. It measures how much \"space\" a set fills and can be a non-integer value.\n\n2.  **State the Result:** The maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set in the interval `[0, 1]` is exactly **1/2**. This is a known result established through two key findings:\n    *   A theorem by S. J. Taylor and J.-P. Kahane shows that the dimension of a Sidon set can **not exceed 1/2**.\n    *   Constructions by mathematicians like S. Astels show that for any dimension `α` up to and including 1/2, a Sidon set with that **exact dimension can be created**.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate with Code:** To make this concrete, I will demonstrate how to construct a Sidon set with a dimension that approaches 1/2. The method involves building a fractal set by restricting the digits of numbers in a large base `q`.\n    *   We choose our allowed digits from an integer Sidon set `D`.\n    *   For a prime number `p`, it's known that we can construct an integer Sidon set `D` of size `p` where its elements are all less than `p²`.\n    *   To ensure the resulting fractal is also a Sidon set, we must choose a base `q` large enough to avoid \"carries\" during addition. A safe choice is `q > 2 * max(D)`, so we can set `q = 2 * p²`.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by the formula `dim = log(|D|) / log(q)`.\n    *   The Python code below will calculate this value for a large prime `p` to show how close it gets to 0.5.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Choose a large prime number p.\n# This determines the size of our integer Sidon set.\np = 1009  # A reasonably large prime number\n\n# Step 2: Define the properties of our constructed Sidon set of digits, D.\n# Number theory allows us to construct an integer Sidon set D with p elements,\n# where the maximum element is approximately p^2.\nsize_of_D = p\nmax_element_in_D = p**2 # An approximation for the largest element in D\n\n# Step 3: Define the base 'q' for our number system.\n# To ensure the resulting fractal is a Sidon set, we must prevent carries\n# during the addition of two numbers. A base q > 2 * max(D) is sufficient.\n# We will use q = 2 * p^2 for this calculation.\nbase_q = 2 * p**2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Hausdorff dimension.\n# The dimension of a set whose members are formed by digits from D in base q\n# is given by the formula: log(|D|) / log(q).\nhausdorff_dimension = math.log(size_of_D) / math.log(base_q)\n\n# Step 5: Print the explanation and the result.\n# As p gets larger, this value gets arbitrarily close to 0.5.\nprint(\"Illustrative Calculation for the Hausdorff Dimension of a Sidon Set\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(f\"We construct the set using a prime p = {p}.\")\nprint(f\"Size of the digit set |D| = p = {size_of_D}\")\nprint(f\"Base for the number system q = 2 * p^2 = {base_q}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe dimension is calculated using the formula: log(|D|) / log(q)\")\nprint(f\"\\nlog({size_of_D}) / log({base_q}) = {hausdorff_dimension:.8f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis demonstrates that we can construct Sidon sets with a dimension very close to 0.5.\")\nprint(\"The theoretical maximum dimension is exactly 0.5.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
