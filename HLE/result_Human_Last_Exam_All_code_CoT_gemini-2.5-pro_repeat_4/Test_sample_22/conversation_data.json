    "This is a conceptual question in statistical genetics. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This term represents the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typically assayed in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). It is a theoretical, population-level parameter that represents the *upper limit* or ceiling for prediction using a linear model based on these SNPs. It assumes you know the true effect size of every SNP.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²_PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool. It's a single value calculated for an individual by summing their alleles, weighted by effect sizes that are *estimated* from a GWAS. Its predictive ability (R²) is how much of the variance in a phenotype it can actually explain in a new, independent set of individuals.\n\n3.  **Why R²_PGS < h²_SNP:** The predictive ability of a PGS is nearly always lower than the SNP heritability. This is because the PGS is built using imperfect information:\n    *   **Finite Sample Size of GWAS:** The effect sizes used to create the PGS are not the true effect sizes; they are *estimates* from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. These estimates contain sampling error (\"noise\"), which reduces the accuracy of the resulting PGS. Only a GWAS of infinite size could yield the true effect sizes.\n    *   **Modeling Imperfections:** Methods for building a PGS must account for the complex correlation structure between SNPs (linkage disequilibrium). These methods are not perfect and introduce further inaccuracies.\n    *   **Population Differences:** If the PGS is applied to a population with a different genetic ancestry or environment than the original GWAS population, its predictive ability will decrease.\n\nBecause the PGS is a real-world predictor built from noisy, estimated data, its performance (R²_PGS) will inevitably fall short of the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP).\n\nTo demonstrate this principle, the following Python code simulates a scenario. It first defines a true SNP heritability, simulates a \"GWAS\" to estimate SNP effects, builds a PGS from those estimates, and then compares the PGS's predictive R² to the true heritability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_heritability_gap():\n    \"\"\"\n    This simulation demonstrates that the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (R^2_PGS)\n    is necessarily lower than the true SNP heritability (h^2_SNP) due to estimation\n    error from finite sample sizes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Simulate a GWAS on the training set to get *estimated* effect sizes\n    # A simple way to estimate betas is via regression, which simplifies to this\n    # matrix operation for standardized genotypes.
