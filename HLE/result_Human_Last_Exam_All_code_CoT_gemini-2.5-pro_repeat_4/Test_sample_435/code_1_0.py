    print(" - CAR T cells are engineered to recognize and kill target cells (e.g., cancer cells).")
    print(" - Upon binding to their target antigen, CAR T cells become activated.")
    print(" - This activation triggers powerful effector functions, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α).")

    print(" - Manufacturing CAR T cells in the presence of IL-15 would likely generate a cell product enriched in persistent, memory-like cells.")
    print(" - These IL-15-conditioned cells would be more metabolically fit and have a higher proliferative potential.")

    print("------------------------")
    print("Compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit an **INCREASED RELEASE** of key effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation. This is a direct consequence of their enhanced persistence, proliferative capacity, and overall fitness.")
