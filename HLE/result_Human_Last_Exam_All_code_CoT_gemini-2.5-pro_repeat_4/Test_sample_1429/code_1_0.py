    print("1. The machine model described is a type of Register Machine, which is a form of Random Access Machine (RAM).")
    print("2. The instruction set includes arithmetic (ADD), universal logic (BITWISENAND), memory access (LOAD, STORE), and conditional control flow (BRANCHIFZERO). This set of operations is known to be sufficient for universal computation, making the machine model Turing-complete.")
    print("3. The definition of a 'boopable' function states that a single program L works for all sufficiently large machine parameters R, A, and W. This is equivalent to assuming the machine has unbounded memory and registers, a standard assumption in computability theory for RAM models.")
    print("4. Since the machine model is Turing-complete, the set of functions it can compute (the 'boopable' functions) is the same as the set of functions a Turing machine can compute (the Turing-computable functions).")
    print("5. Therefore, any boopable function is, by definition, Turing-computable.")
    print("\nConclusion for A: Yes.\n")

    # --- Analysis for Question B ---
    print("--- Analysis for Question B: Does a specific fast program exist? ---")
    print("1. The goal is a program L that, for input x, boops x times and halts in <= x + 50 steps. The machine is fixed to (R,A,W)=(64,64,512).")
    print("2. The time constraint `x + 50` is extremely tight. Executing x `BOOP` instructions already takes `x` steps. This leaves a maximum of 50 steps for all other operations (initialization, logic, and jumping).")
    print("3. A simple loop that decrements x and boops would have an overhead of several instructions per boop (e.g., check, decrement, jump), making the total time a multiple of x (like 4x), which is too slow.")
    print("4. The only feasible program structure is to have a massive, pre-written chain of `BOOP` instructions and have a 'dispatcher' at the start of the program jump to the correct entry point in this chain. For an input x, the program would jump to an address that starts a sequence of exactly x `BOOP`s followed by a `HALT`.")
    print(textwrap.fill("5. The program L would have a length of about 2^32 + 50. It would consist of a small dispatcher (<50 instructions) and a large block of ~2^32 instructions. This block would be a chain: `BOOP, BOOP, ..., BOOP, HALT`.", width=100))
    print(textwrap.fill("6. The challenge is the jump. The instruction set lacks an indirect jump (e.g., jumping to an address stored in a register). The only jump instruction is `BRANCHIFZERO adr, reg`, which jumps to a fixed address `adr` embedded in the instruction.", width=100))
    print(textwrap.fill("7. To perform a computed jump, the dispatcher must use self-modifying code. It must compute the target address `T` and then create a `BRANCHIFZERO T, zero_reg` instruction in memory and execute it.", width=100))
    print(textwrap.fill("8. According to the problem specification, the instruction word for `BRANCHIFZERO adr, reg` uses `A+R = 64+64 = 128` LSBs for its arguments. The 64-bit address `adr` must be placed into its specific field within the 512-bit instruction word. A plausible encoding is `word = (opcode << N) | (adr << 64) | reg_idx`. To construct this word, the program needs to compute `T` and then calculate `T * 2^64` (or `T << 64`).", width=100))
    print(textwrap.fill("9. The instruction set does not have a multiplication or a bit-shift instruction. The `ADD reg <- reg, reg` instruction can be used to perform a left shift by one bit. Therefore, computing `T << 64` requires 64 separate `ADD` instructions.", width=100))
    print("10. A sequence of 64 additions by itself exceeds the 50-step budget for the dispatcher. This doesn't even account for the steps needed to calculate T and store the final instruction.")
    print("11. Since the necessary computed jump cannot be implemented within the 50-step overhead, no such program L can exist.")
