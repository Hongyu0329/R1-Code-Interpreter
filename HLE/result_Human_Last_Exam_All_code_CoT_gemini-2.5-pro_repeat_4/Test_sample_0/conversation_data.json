    "My goal is to identify which of the five given principles of population ethics is violated by \"critical-level views\". I will write a Python script to demonstrate this violation.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Define the Critical-Level View:** In this view, the value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"contributory value\" of each person. The contributory value is their welfare level minus a fixed \"critical level\" (`c`). A person's life is only a net positive to the world if their welfare is above this critical level.\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Principle:** This principle states that for any positive welfare level (`w > 0`), no matter how low, there is some number of people (`n`) such that adding these `n` people to the world is a net good (i.e., better than adding no one).\n3.  **Create a Demonstration:** I will set up a scenario in the Python script.\n    *   I'll choose a positive critical level, for example, `c = 10`.\n    *   I'll choose a low, but still positive, welfare level that is *below* the critical level, for example, `w = 5`.\n    *   The script will then simulate adding an increasing number of people with this low welfare level (`w = 5`).\n4.  **Analyze the Result:** The script will calculate the total value of the added population. We will observe that because the welfare level (5) is below the critical level (10), each person added has a negative contributory value (5 - 10 = -5). Therefore, adding more people will only make the total value of the population more and more negative. It will never become a positive value.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This result directly contradicts the Non-Elitism principle, which requires that we should be able to find *some* number of people whose addition is a net good. Since the critical-level view fails this test for any welfare level below `c`, it violates Non-Elitism.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates which condition of Arrhenius's theorem\n    is violated by critical-level views in population ethics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
