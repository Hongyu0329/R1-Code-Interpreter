def solve_braid_homfly_parameters():
    """
    This function determines the parameters a and b that map the Ocneanu trace
    of a specific braid to its HOMFLY polynomial.

    The braid is beta = sigma_2^-1 * sigma_1 * sigma_2^-1 * sigma_1 in B_3.
    Its closure is the Whitehead link.

    1.  Define the HOMFLY polynomial P(x, y) for the Whitehead link.
        There are multiple conventions for the HOMFLY polynomial. A common one,
        in variables (v, z), is P(v, z) = v^-2 * z^2 - v^-2 + v^-4.
        We map this to the (x, y) variables used in the problem, typically by
        setting v = x^-1 and z = y.
        P(x, y) = (x^-1)^-2 * y^2 - (x^-1)^-2 + (x^-1)^-4 = x^2*y^2 - x^2 + x^4.

    2.  The problem states that P(x, y) is obtained from the Ocneanu trace W(q, z)
        by the substitution q = x^a, z = x^b * y.
        P(x, y) = W(x^a, x^b * y).

    3.  We can invert this relationship to find the expression for the trace W(q, z)
        for a given choice of (a, b).
        W(q, z) = P(x(q,z), y(q,z)).

    4.  We test the provided answer choice F: a = -2, b = -1.
        - Substitution: q = x^-2  => x = q^(-1/2)
        - Substitution: z = x^-1 * y = q^(1/2) * y => y = z * q^(-1/2)

    5.  We substitute these expressions for x and y into P(x, y) to find the
        formula for the trace W(q, z).
