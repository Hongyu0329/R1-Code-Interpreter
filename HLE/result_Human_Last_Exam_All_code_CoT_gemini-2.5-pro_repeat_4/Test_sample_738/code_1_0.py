# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instructions.
# There are 5 types of commands: stop, turn left, turn right, move forward, move backward.
# Each command can have multiple speed levels.
# Stop: 1 state
# Turn left: 2 speed levels
# Turn right: 2 speed levels
# Move forward: 4 speed levels
# Move backward: 2 speed levels
num_distinct_instructions = 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2

# Step 2: Determine the number of bits required to represent one instruction.
# To represent 'N' distinct states, we need ceil(log2(N)) bits.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(num_distinct_instructions))

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions needed for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds long.
# We convert this duration into Earth minutes.
sol_duration_in_minutes = (24 * 60) + 39 + (35.244 / 60)
# Since an instruction is sent each minute, we need to store enough instructions
# for the entire duration. We use ceiling to cover the partial minute at the end.
total_instructions_for_a_day = math.ceil(sol_duration_in_minutes)

# Step 4: Calculate the total memory size in bits and then convert to bytes.
total_bits = total_instructions_for_a_day * bits_per_instruction
bits_per_byte = 8
total_bytes = total_bits / bits_per_byte

print("To calculate the minimum memory size, we follow these steps:")
print(f"1. Total unique instructions: 1 (Stop) + 2 (Left) + 2 (Right) + 4 (Forward) + 2 (Backward) = {num_distinct_instructions}")
print(f"2. Bits needed per instruction: ceil(log2({num_distinct_instructions})) = {bits_per_instruction} bits")
print(f"3. Minutes in a Martian day: {total_instructions_for_a_day} (rounded up), which is the total number of instructions.")
print("\nFinal Calculation:")
print(f"({total_instructions_for_a_day} instructions * {bits_per_instruction} bits/instruction) / {bits_per_byte} bits/byte = {int(total_bytes)} bytes")

print(f"\nThe smallest size of memory required is {int(total_bytes)} bytes.")
