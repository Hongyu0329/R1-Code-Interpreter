    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, given that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3 with derivatives that are always positive.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the problem mathematically**: We are looking for the maximum number of roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n2.  **Determine the degree of the polynomial**: First, we find the degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Since $f$ and $g$ are both degree 3, $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. Therefore, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9. The maximum number of real roots is at most 9.\n3.  **Use Rolle's Theorem**: Rolle's Theorem states that if a differentiable function has $N$ real roots, its derivative must have at least $N-1$ real roots. We can apply this theorem repeatedly. If $P(x)$ has $N$ roots, then $P'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ roots, and $P''(x)$ must have at least $N-2$ roots.\n4.  **Analyze the derivatives**: We will analyze the second derivative $P''(x)$. Note that for $k \\ge 2$, $P^{(k)}(x) = h^{(k)}(x)$. We need to find the degree of $h''(x)$.\n5.  **Calculate the degree of h''(x)**: We will use the chain rule to find the general form of $h''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$ and determine its degree.\n6.  **Combine the results**: By finding the maximum number of real roots that $h''(x)$ can have (which is its degree), we can establish an upper bound on $N-2$, and thus on $N$.\n7.  **Provide a Python script**: The script will use the `sympy` library to symbolically perform the derivative calculations and determine the degrees to illustrate the argument and derive the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will define the polynomials and their derivatives symbolically, calculate the degree of the relevant derivatives, and use this to explain the argument based on Rolle's theorem to find the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_points_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the maximum number of fixed points\n    for the composition of two cubic polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    y = sympy.Symbol('y')\n    a3, a2, a1, a0 = sympy.symbols('a3 a2 a1 a0')\n    b3, b2, b1, b0 = sympy.symbols('b3 b2 b1 b0')\n\n    # Define generic polynomials f(y) and g(x) of degree 3\n    f_poly = a3*y**3 + a2*y**2 + a1*y + a0\n    g_poly = b3*x**3 + b2*x**2 + b1*x + b0\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the problem\")\n    print(\"Let f(x) and g(x) be two polynomials of degree 3.\")\n    print(\"The condition f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 means f and g are strictly increasing.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the maximum number of fixed points of h(x) = f(g(x)).\")\n    print(\"A fixed point is a solution to the equation: f(g(x)) = x.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the degree of the composite polynomial\")\n    # The composite function h(x) = f(g(x))\n    h_poly = f_poly.subs(y, g_poly)\n    degree_h = sympy.degree(h_poly, x)\n    print(f\"The function h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = {degree_h}.\")\n    print(\"The fixed-point equation f(g(x)) = x is equivalent to P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0.\")\n    print(f\"P(x) is a polynomial of degree {degree_h}.
