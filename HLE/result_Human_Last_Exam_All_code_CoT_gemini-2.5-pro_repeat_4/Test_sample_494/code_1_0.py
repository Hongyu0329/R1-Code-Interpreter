    1.  **The Nature of Tunneling in Ammonia:**
        Ammonia (NH3) has a pyramid shape. The Nitrogen atom can quantum mechanically tunnel through the plane of the Hydrogen atoms, inverting the pyramid. This is possible because the potential energy for this motion is a "double-well". In quantum mechanics, a particle in a double-well potential has its ground state split into two very close energy levels: one symmetric and one antisymmetric. The energy difference between these two levels corresponds to the tunneling frequency. The existence of this energy splitting is the signature of tunneling.

    2.  **The Role of Nuclear Spin and Particle Statistics:**
        - Ordinary hydrogen nuclei (protons) are fermions (spin 1/2). The Pauli Exclusion Principle requires the total wavefunction of the molecule to be *antisymmetric* when two identical fermions are exchanged.
        - The proposed exotic hydrogen nuclei are bosons (spin 0). For identical bosons, the total wavefunction must be *symmetric* upon exchange.

    3.  **Analyzing the Exotic Ammonia Molecule:**
        - The exotic hydrogens are bosons, so the total wavefunction must be symmetric.
        - The total wavefunction is a product of vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin parts.
        - Since the exotic hydrogens have spin 0, their combined nuclear spin wavefunction is necessarily *symmetric*.
        - This means the product of the vibrational and rotational wavefunctions must also be symmetric to satisfy the overall requirement.

    4.  **Are Both Tunneling States Allowed?**
        - The tunneling phenomenon creates a symmetric vibrational state and an antisymmetric vibrational state. The question is whether both can exist in the exotic molecule.
        - A state can exist if it can be paired with a rotational state that satisfies the overall symmetry rule.
        - For the symmetric vibrational state: It can be paired with a symmetric rotational state. (Symmetric x Symmetric = Symmetric). These rotational states exist.
        - For the antisymmetric vibrational state: It can be paired with an antisymmetric rotational state. (Antisymmetric x Antisymmetric = Symmetric). These rotational states also exist.

    5.  **Conclusion:**
        Since allowed rotational states exist for both the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational levels, both levels of the tunneling doublet will be populated. The energy splitting between them will still be present. Therefore, the fundamental condition for tunneling is met. The nuclear spin does not change the potential energy barrier or the masses involved, which are the primary determinants of the tunneling rate.
