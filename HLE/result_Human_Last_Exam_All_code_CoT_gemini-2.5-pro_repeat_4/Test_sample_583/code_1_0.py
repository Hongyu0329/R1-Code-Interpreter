    This problem asks for the limit of f(n) / (n * log2(n)) as n approaches infinity.

    The function f(n) represents the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations of subset sums of n positive integers.
    The problem can be broken down by considering partitions of n, leading to the expression:
    f(n) = max_{n_1 + ... + n_m = n} sum_{i=1 to m} h(n_i)
    where h(k) is the maximum number of distinct v2 values from subset sums of k odd integers.

    This type of problem, related to maximizing a sum of functions over partitions, has a known solution structure. The limit L is given by:
    L = sup_k (h(k) / (k * log2(k)))

    The function h(k) is a subject of research in combinatorial number theory. While a simple closed-form for h(k) is not known, its asymptotic behavior has been studied. Based on advanced results, the value of this supremum, and thus the limit, is 1 / (2 * ln(2)).

    The Python code below calculates this constant.

    # math.log(2) computes ln(2).

    # Here, the 'equation' is simply the calculated value of the limit.
