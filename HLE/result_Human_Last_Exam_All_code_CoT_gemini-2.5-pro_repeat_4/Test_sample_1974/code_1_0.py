Here is a step-by-step derivation for the maximum possible cardinality of the set S.

Step 1: Understanding the Set S and its Equivalence to a Set of Logical Sentences
The set S consists of Diophantine equations, D, which are polynomial equations for which we seek integer solutions. The equations in S must satisfy three conditions:
1.  D has no solutions in the natural numbers. In logical terms, the statement of its unsolvability is true.
2.  The unsolvability of D is unprovable in ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice).
3.  The unsolvability of D is provable in a stronger theory, ZFC + ψ, where ψ is a statement independent of ZFC.

The statement "the Diophantine equation D has no solution" is what is known as a Π_1^0 sentence in the language of arithmetic. The Matiyasevich theorem (also known as the MRDP theorem) establishes a fundamental connection: a set is Diophantine if and only if it is recursively enumerable. A direct consequence is that for any Π_1^0 sentence, there is a corresponding Diophantine equation whose unsolvability is equivalent to the truth of that sentence.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible cardinality of a set of true Π_1^0 sentences that are unprovable in ZFC but become provable in ZFC + ψ.

Step 2: Establishing the Upper Bound
The set of all possible polynomials with integer coefficients is countably infinite. Each such polynomial defines a Diophantine equation. The set S is a subset of this universal set of all Diophantine equations. The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted as aleph-null (ℵ₀).
Therefore, the cardinality of S must be less than or equal to aleph-null.
|S| ≤ ℵ₀

Step 3: Establishing the Lower Bound by Construction
To find the *maximum possible* cardinality, we must show that it is possible for S to be countably infinite for a suitable choice of the statement ψ. This would establish aleph-null as a lower bound. We can demonstrate this by construction.

a) The Construction of an Infinite Family of Π_1^0 Sentences:
We can create an infinite sequence of Π_1^0 sentences with increasing logical strength. Let T₀ = ZFC. For each n ≥ 0, define Tₙ₊₁ = Tₙ + Con(Tₙ), where Con(Tₙ) is the Π_1^0 sentence asserting the consistency of the theory Tₙ.

By Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, if a theory T is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency. Thus, Con(Tₙ) is not provable in Tₙ. Since ZFC is a sub-theory of every Tₙ, this means that for each n, Con(Tₙ) is not provable in ZFC.

This process gives us a countably infinite sequence of Π_1^0 sentences: {Con(ZFC), Con(ZFC + Con(ZFC)), ...}. Let's call them {φₙ}. Each φₙ is true (assuming ZFC is consistent), and none are provable in ZFC. By the MRDP theorem, each φₙ corresponds to a unique Diophantine equation Dₙ with no solutions, and these {Dₙ} satisfy the first two conditions.

b) The Choice of the Statement ψ:
We now need a single statement ψ, independent of ZFC, such that the theory ZFC + ψ can prove every sentence φₙ in our sequence. Certain powerful axioms, known as large cardinal axioms, serve this purpose.

Let's choose ψ to be a statement asserting the existence of a sufficiently large cardinal (for instance, "there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals"). Such axioms are known to be independent of ZFC. It is a major result in modern set theory that these large cardinal axioms have profound consequences, including implying the consistency of weaker theories. A sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom ψ can prove Con(Tₙ) for all natural numbers n. The statement ψ can be forced, so there exist models M and M[G] satisfying the conditions of the problem.

c) The Result of the Construction:
With this choice of ψ, we have found a countably infinite set of Π_1^0 sentences {φₙ}, corresponding to a countably infinite set of Diophantine equations {Dₙ}. Each Dₙ in this set satisfies all three conditions of the problem. This demonstrates that it's possible for the set S to be countably infinite. Therefore, the lower bound for the maximum possible cardinality is aleph-null.
|S| ≥ ℵ₀

Step 4: Final Conclusion
From Step 2, we have |S| ≤ ℵ₀.
From Step 3, we have |S| ≥ ℵ₀.
Combining these two results, the maximum possible cardinality of S is exactly aleph-null.
