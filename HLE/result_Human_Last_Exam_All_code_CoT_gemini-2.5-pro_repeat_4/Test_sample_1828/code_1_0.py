# Based on the set-theoretic analysis, we determine the maximal and minimal
# possible cardinalities for the set X.

# Let's denote the cardinality of a set S by |S|.
# Let X be the set of cardinalities of uncountable maximal almost disjoint families.
# Our step-by-step derivation shows that for any model of ZFC satisfying the
# problem's conditions, the set X contains exactly one element.

# The maximal possible cardinality of X is therefore 1.
max_card_X = 1

# The minimal possible cardinality of X is also 1.
min_card_X = 1

# The question asks for the difference between the maximal and minimal possible
# cardinalities of X.
difference = max_card_X - min_card_X

# The final equation is: 1 - 1 = 0
print(f"The maximal possible cardinality of X is {max_card_X}.")
print(f"The minimal possible cardinality of X is {min_card_X}.")
print(f"The difference is {max_card_X} - {min_card_X} = {difference}.")
