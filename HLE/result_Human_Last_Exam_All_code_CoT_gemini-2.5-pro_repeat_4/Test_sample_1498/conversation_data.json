    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the range of verses.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will first identify the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  I will then locate the specific section within the poem that enumerates the names of the Prophets.\n3.  The verse where the list of names begins will be identified as the starting point.\n4.  The verse where the list of names concludes will be identified as the ending point.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to declare these starting and ending verse numbers and print them out clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of bayts (verses) in\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Bayt 17 is an introduction to the list of 25 prophets.\n    # The actual enumeration of the names begins in the next bayt.\n    start_bayt = 18\n    \n    # The list of names continues for several bayts and concludes in bayt 21.\n    # Bayt 22 is a closing benediction upon them.\n    end_bayt = 21\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from:\")\n    print(f\"Starting Bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"To Ending Bayt: {end_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the range is from Bayt {start_bayt} to {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<18-21>>>"
