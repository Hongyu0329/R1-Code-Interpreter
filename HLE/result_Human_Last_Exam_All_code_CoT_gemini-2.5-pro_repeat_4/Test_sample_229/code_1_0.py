    This function solves the graph theory problem by deriving and analyzing
    an equation based on the properties of the graph's edge coloring.

    # The problem provides rules for edge coloring. We can use these rules to count
    # the number of red edges, E_R, in two different ways.
    
    # Let b4 be the number of black vertices of degree 4.
    # Let w4 be the number of white vertices of degree 4.
    # Let b3_R be the number of black vertices of degree 3 with all red edges.
    # Let w3_R be the number of white vertices of degree 3 with all red edges.
    
    # According to the rules:
    # - Each degree-4 vertex has 2 red edges.
    # - Each red-specialized degree-3 vertex has 3 red edges.
    
    # First, we count the red edges by summing their endpoints at black vertices.
    # E_R = 2 * b4 + 3 * b3_R
    
    # Second, we count the red edges by summing their endpoints at white vertices.
    # E_R = 2 * w4 + 3 * w3_R
    
    # Equating these two expressions gives us a key relationship:
    # 2 * b4 + 3 * b3_R = 2 * w4 + 3 * w3_R
    
    # We can rearrange this equation to isolate the term (b4 - w4):
    # 2 * b4 - 2 * w4 = 3 * w3_R - 3 * b3_R
    # 2 * (b4 - w4) = 3 * (w3_R - b3_R)
    
    # Let's analyze this final equation.
    # The term (w3_R - b3_R) must be an integer because they are counts of vertices.
    # Let's call the coefficients c1 and c2.
    c1 = 2
    c2 = 3
    
    print(f"From the properties of edge coloring, we derive the equation:")
    print(f"{c1} * (b4 - w4) = {c2} * (w3_R - b3_R)")
    
    print(f"\nIn this equation, the coefficient on the left is {c1}.")
    print(f"The coefficient on the right is {c2}.")
    
    # Since c1 and c2 are coprime, for the equality to hold, (b4 - w4) must be
    # a multiple of c2.
    
    # The problem states that b4 is strictly greater than w4, so (b4 - w4) is a
    # positive integer.
    
    # Therefore, (b4 - w4) must be a positive multiple of 3.
    smallest_positive_multiple = c2
    
    print(f"\nThis means (b4 - w4) must be a positive multiple of {c2}.")
    print(f"The smallest positive multiple of {c2} is {smallest_positive_multiple}.")
    print(f"Thus, the smallest possible value for b4 - w4 is {smallest_positive_multiple}.")
