def solve_power_series_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the properties of four sets of natural numbers to determine
    for which of them a specific type of power series can exist.

    The problem asks for which subsets S of natural numbers there exists a power series
    with non-zero coefficients only at indices in S, such that the series converges
    everywhere on the closed unit disc (|z| <= 1), but does not converge absolutely
    for |z| = 1.

    This property is directly linked to a concept in harmonic analysis called a "Sidon set".
    A power series with the desired properties exists if and only if the set of indices S
    is NOT a Sidon set.

    We will analyze each set based on known mathematical results.

    # --- Analysis of each set ---

    # Analysis: The range of a one-dimensional random walk with non-negative steps
    # (like the one described) is known to have significant additive structure.
    # This structure almost surely prevents it from being a Sidon set.
    is_sidon_1 = False  # Almost surely not a Sidon set.

    # Analysis: It is a known result in harmonic analysis that the set of k-th powers
    # of integers, {n^k}, is not a Sidon set for any integer k >= 2. Such sets
    # are "convex" sequences, and this property is related to them not being Sidon sets.
    is_sidon_2 = False # Not a Sidon set.

    # Set 3: The set of primes
    # Analysis: It was a famous open problem for a long time, but it has been proven
    # that the set of prime numbers IS a Sidon set. This is a deep result related
    # to the lack of additive structure in the primes.

    # The ratio of consecutive terms s_{n+1}/s_n approaches q, which is greater than 1.
