    "To design the observer, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the error between the actual state and the estimated state, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, converges to zero in the shortest possible time. This is known as a deadbeat observer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Formulate the Problem**: The observer error dynamics are governed by the equation `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. For a deadbeat observer, the error must become zero after a finite number of steps, `N`, regardless of the initial error `e(0)`. This requires the matrix `(A - LC)` to be nilpotent, which means all its eigenvalues must be zero. Consequently, the characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` must be `λⁿ = 0`, where `n=4` is the dimension of the state vector.\n\n2.  **Use Duality**: Designing an observer gain `L` for the system `(A, C)` is equivalent (dual) to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the system with matrices `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)`. The relationship between the gains is `L = Kᵀ`. We need to find `K` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop dual system, `Aᵀ - CᵀK`, are all zero.\n\n3.  **Pole Placement**: We will determine the characteristic polynomial of `Aᵀ - CᵀK` in terms of the unknown elements of the gain matrix `K`. By setting the coefficients of this polynomial (for powers `λ³`, `λ²`, `λ¹`, `λ⁰`) to zero, we obtain a system of equations.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Gain**: The gain matrix `K` is a 2x4 matrix with 8 unknowns. The pole placement gives us 4 equations. This means we have extra degrees of freedom. To find a specific solution, we can simplify the problem by setting some elements of `K` to zero. A convenient choice is to set the second row of `K` to all zeros. This will allow us to solve for the elements in the first row of `K`.\n\n5.  **Construct `L`**: Once `K` is found, the observer gain is `L = Kᵀ`.\n\n6.  **Verify the Solution**: The final Python code will not only display the resulting gain matrix `L` but also verify the design by computing the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` to confirm they are all at the origin.\n\n### Execution:\nFollowing the plan, we derive the characteristic polynomial of `Aᵀ - CᵀK` and set its coefficients to zero. By assuming the second row of `K` is zero (`k_21=k_22=k_23=k_24=0`), we solve the resulting system of four linear equations for the four non-zero elements of `K`.\n\nThe solution for the controller gain `K` is:\n`K = [[-2, -1, 3, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = Kᵀ = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThe following Python code defines the system, calculates the observer gain `L` based on our derivation, and verifies that the resulting observer is indeed a deadbeat observer by checking the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 1, 0, -1],\n    [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n])\nC = np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Based on the pole placement design for the dual system, we found the\n# state-feedback gain K for the dual system (A^T, C^T).\n# We chose a solution where the second row of K is zero for simplicity.\nK = np.array([\n    [-2.0, -1.0, 3.0, -1.0],\n    [ 0.0,  0.0, 0.0,  0.0]\n])\n\n# The observer gain L is the transpose of K.\nL = K.T\n\nprint(\"The designed observer gain matrix L is:\")\nprint(L)\n\n# --- Verification ---\n# For a deadbeat observer, all eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix (A - LC)\n# must be at the origin (0).\nA_cl = A - L @ C\n\n# Calculate the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix\neigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"\\nTo verify the design, we calculate the eigenvalues of (A - LC).\")\nprint(\"For a deadbeat observer, all eigenvalues should be zero.\")\nprint(\"Calculated eigenvalues (rounded to 5 decimal places):\")\n# We round the result to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.\nprint(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n\n```\n<<<[[-2.  0.]\n [-1.  0.]\n [ 3.  0.]\n [-1.  0.]]>>>"
