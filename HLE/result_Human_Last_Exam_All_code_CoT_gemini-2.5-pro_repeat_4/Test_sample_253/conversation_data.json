    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110:** I will start by defining the rules for the Rule 110 cellular automaton. This can be efficiently stored in a Python dictionary. The keys will be the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods (e.g., '111', '110'), and the values will be the corresponding next state for the central cell (0 or 1).\n\n2.  **Initialize the Grid:** I'll create a 1D grid, represented as a list of integers. To prevent the pattern from hitting the edge, the grid needs to be wide enough. A width of 81 cells is a safe size for 20 generations. I will initialize this grid with all zeros and place a single '1' in the center to match the starting condition.\n\n3.  **Simulate Generations:** I will write a loop that runs for 20 iterations, where each iteration calculates one generation of the automaton. Inside the loop, I'll create a new grid for the next state. I will then iterate through the cells of the current grid, determine the 3-cell neighborhood for each, look up the new state in the Rule 110 dictionary, and store it in the new grid.\n\n4.  **Update and Finalize:** After each iteration, the main grid will be updated with the newly calculated states. Once the 20 generations are complete, the final grid will hold the resulting pattern.\n\n5.  **Print the Result:** I will convert the final list of 0s and 1s into a single binary string. To provide a clean output of just the pattern itself, I will trim the leading and trailing zeros from this string before printing the result. The instruction to \"output each number\" will be interpreted as printing this final string of digits.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation:\n```python\ndef rule_110_simulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single cell and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
