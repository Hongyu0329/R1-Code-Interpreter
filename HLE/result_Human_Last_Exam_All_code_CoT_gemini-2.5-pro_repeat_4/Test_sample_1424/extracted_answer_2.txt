The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The precise functional form in the frequency domain is $G_0(k, \omega) = (\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \cdot \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu))^{-1}$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that enforces causality.
