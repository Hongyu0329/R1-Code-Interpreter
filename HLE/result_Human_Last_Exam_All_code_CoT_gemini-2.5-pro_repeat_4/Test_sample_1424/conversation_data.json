    "In many-body physics, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a particle in a non-interacting system. The Feynman path integral formalism is a powerful tool to derive this quantity.\n\nMy plan is to first state the well-known formula for the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain, which clearly shows its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. Then, I will provide a Python script that defines this function and uses it to calculate a specific value for a given set of parameters. The script will print the general formula and then the specific calculation, showing how each number fits into the equation.\n\nThe functional form is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere, $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The additional components in the denominator are:\n*   $\\omega$: The frequency variable.\n*   $\\mu$: The chemical potential, which sets the Fermi level.\n*   $\\eta$: A positive infinitesimal number that ensures causality by placing the poles of the Green's function correctly in the complex plane.\n*   $\\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$: The sign function, which adjusts the sign of $i\\eta$ depending on whether the state is above the Fermi level (a particle state) or below it (a hole state).\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for a given set of parameters.\n\n# --- Theoretical Formula ---\nprint(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω)\")\nprint(\"describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle.\")\nprint(\"Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ε_k is:\\n\")\nprint(\"  G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iη * sgn(ε_k - μ))\\n\")\nprint(\"This shows that G_0 is inversely proportional to (ω - ε_k), with a small imaginary part for causality.\\n\")\n\n# --- Example Calculation ---\nprint(\"Let's calculate G_0 for a specific case (an unoccupied 'particle' state):\\n\")\n\n# Parameters\nomega = 2.5      # Frequency (energy of the propagating particle) in eV\nepsilon_k = 2.0  # Single-particle energy eigenvalue in eV\nmu = 1.0         # Chemical potential (Fermi energy) in eV\neta = 1e-6       # A small positive infinitesimal\n\n# --- Calculation Steps ---\n# Determine the sign for the imaginary part\nsign = np.sign(epsilon_k - mu)\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta * sign\n\n# Calculate the Green's function\nG0 = 1 / denominator\n\n# --- Final Output ---\nprint(\"Using the following values:\")\nprint(f\"  ω = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"  ε_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"  μ = {mu}\")\nprint(f\"  η = {eta}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The final equation with the numbers substituted is:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + 1j * {eta} * sgn({epsilon_k} - {mu}))\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({(omega - epsilon_k):.1f} + {1j * eta * sign})\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The precise functional form in the frequency domain is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))^{-1}$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential and $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that enforces causality.>>>"
