    "To determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place outside of Quebec, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates:** First, I'll find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish, Quebec. Waskaganish is located on the southeastern shore of James Bay.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors:** Next, I'll identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec. The primary neighbors relevant to Waskaganish's location are Ontario (to the west) and Nunavut (which includes Akimiski Island in James Bay). Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick are significantly farther away.\n3.  **Find Closest Points:** I will find the coordinates for the nearest point in Ontario and the nearest point in Nunavut.\n    *   For **Ontario**, the closest point is on the provincial land border just west of Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Nunavut**, the closest point is on the coast of Akimiski Island, located within James Bay.\n4.  **Calculate Distances:** Using the Haversine formula, which calculates the distance between two points on a sphere, I will compute the distance from Waskaganish to the representative points in both Ontario and Nunavut.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare these distances to determine which province or territory is closest. The final output will be the name of that province or territory.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n\n    distance = R * c\n    return distance\n\n# Coordinates of Waskaganish, Quebec\nwaskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon = 51.483, -78.767\n\n# Coordinates of the closest point in Ontario (provincial border on James Bay coast)\nontario_point_lat, ontario_point_lon = 51.483, -79.517\n\n# Coordinates of the closest point in Nunavut (southeastern coast of Akimiski Island)\nnunavut_point_lat, nunavut_point_lon = 52.8, -80.8\n\n# Calculate distances\ndist_to_ontario = haversine_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, ontario_point_lat, ontario_point_lon)\ndist_to_nunavut = haversine_distance(waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, nunavut_point_lat, nunavut_point_lon)\n\nprint(f\"The Waskaganish gathering place is located at latitude {waskaganish_lat}, longitude {waskaganish_lon}.\")\nprint(f\"The closest point in Ontario is at latitude {ontario_point_lat}, longitude {ontario_point_lon}.\")\nprint(f\"The closest point in Nunavut (Akimiski Island) is at latitude {nunavut_point_lat}, longitude {nunavut_point_lon}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Distance to Ontario border: {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km\")\nprint(f\"Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Determine the closest province/territory\nif dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n    closest_location = \"Ontario\"\nelse:\n    closest_location = \"Nunavut\"\n\nprint(f\"The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is {closest_location}.\")\n\n<<<Ontario>>>\n```"
