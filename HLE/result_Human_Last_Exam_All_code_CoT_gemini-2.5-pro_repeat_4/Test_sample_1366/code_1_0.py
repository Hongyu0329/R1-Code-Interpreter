    # --- Part (a) ---
    # The question asks if V(p) can decompose in a specific infinite sum form.
    # 1. The decomposition of V(p) into irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules (or more accurately, composition factors)
    #    is a FINITE sum over n from 0 to p-1, not an infinite one.
    # 2. The notation `rho_n x L(p)_n` is also suggestive. V(p) is a module for L_k(sl_2),
    #    not for an "external" sl_2 algebra acting on a rho_n factor.
    # Because the proposed form is an infinite sum, the answer to the first part is "No".
    # However, a different decomposition in terms of a finite sum of L_k(sl_2) composition factors does exist.
    # Therefore, the answer to the second part is "Yes".
    answer_a = "No; Yes"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # The question asks for the top-level dimension of L(p)_n.
    # The problem statement defines L(p)_n as the module "with top-level rho_n".
    # It also defines rho_n as the "(n+1)-dimensional irreducible sl_2-module".
    # Therefore, by definition, the dimension of the top-level of L(p)_n is n+1.
    answer_b = "n+1"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # The question asks for the minimal conformal weight in the decomposition for p=2.
    # This is interpreted as the minimal non-zero conformal weight of the primary fields
    # corresponding to the highest-weight vectors of the modules L(p)_n in the decomposition.
    p = 2
    # The decomposition runs for n = 0, ..., p-1. For p=2, this is n=0, 1.
    # The formula for the conformal weight of the highest-weight vector of L(p)_n is h_n = n * (n + 1/p).
    
    # For n=0 (the vacuum module):
    n0 = 0
    h0 = n0 * (n0 + 1/p)

    # For n=1:
    n1 = 1
    h1 = n1 * (n1 + 1/p)

    # The conformal weights of the primary fields are {h0, h1} = {0, 1.5}.
    # The minimal conformal weight is 0. The minimal NON-ZERO conformal weight is 1.5.
    # This is the likely intended answer.
    answer_c = h1
