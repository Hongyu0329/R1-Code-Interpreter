    # The frequency correction at order epsilon^2 is sought. This correction,

    # Omega_corr = c1*w0^5 + c2*w0^3 + c3*w0
    # We need to calculate the coefficients c1, c2, c3.
    # These coefficients arise from various nonlinear interactions in the equation.

    # 1. Contribution from the cubic term in the expansion:
    # This comes from the term -gamma*(3*gamma+1)*(3*gamma+2)/2 * x^3 in the O(epsilon^2) equation.
    # In terms of W = omega_0^2 = 3*gamma, this term's coefficient is
    # -W/3 * (W+1) * (W+2) / 2.

    # to (3/4) of its coefficient.

    # These are "effective" cubic nonlinearities. They arise from the quadratic
    # terms in the O(epsilon) equation. Let W = w0**2.
    # The interaction term can be split into three parts based on the derivation:
    # a) from -x * ddot(x1)
    # b) from -3 * dot(x0) * dot(x1)
    # c) from the derivative of the quadratic potential terms
    
    # The sum of these interaction terms gives a coefficient:
    S_int_coeff = W/24 * (W+6) * (5*W+17)

    # The total coefficient of the secular term (S) is the sum of these contributions.

    S_total_coeff = W/6 * (-W**2 + 5*W + 21)
