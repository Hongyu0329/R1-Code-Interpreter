    "The task is to identify which of the provided peptides, all containing the RGD motif, is most likely to bind to an integrin receptor. The binding affinity of RGD-containing peptides is not solely dependent on the RGD sequence but is significantly modulated by the flanking amino acid residues. Certain sequences are known to have high affinity because they are derived from natural integrin ligands like fibronectin.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to solve this problem by:\n1.  Creating a data structure (a dictionary) that acts as a knowledge base. This will store each peptide along with a score and a justification for its binding likelihood based on established biochemical knowledge.\n2.  Assigning the highest score to the peptide sequence that is known to be derived from a natural, high-affinity ligand for integrins.\n3.  Writing code to programmatically identify the peptide with the highest score from this knowledge base.\n4.  Printing a detailed explanation of why the chosen peptide is the most likely candidate, referencing its origin and significance.\n\n```python\ndef find_best_integrin_binder():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to identify the one\n    most likely to bind an integrin receptor based on known motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary represents a knowledge base of integrin-binding peptides.\n    # The keys are the peptides, and the values are tuples containing:\n    # (Binding Likelihood Score, Justification).\n    # A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of strong binding based on scientific literature.\n    peptide_knowledge_base = {\n        'A.
