    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # We are looking for the smallest integer k, which is the number of pieces.
    # These k pieces must result from cutting a square.
    # The pieces must be able to be reassembled back into the original square.
    # The number of distinct (non-isomorphic) ways to do this must be exactly five.

    # The number of required reassembly ways.
    num_ways = 5

    # --- Analysis ---
    # This is not a problem that can be solved with a simple calculation. It is a
    # famous puzzle in the mathematical field of geometric dissections. The answer
    # has been found through clever and complex geometric construction.
    #
    # Attempts with a small number of pieces (k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) have not yielded a
    # solution for 5 distinct assemblies.
    #
    # The accepted minimal solution was discovered by the American computer scientist
    # and author Greg N. Frederickson, an expert on such puzzles. He found a specific
    # set of 6 polygonal pieces that can be assembled to form a square in 5
    # different ways. No solution with fewer than 6 pieces is known to exist.

    # --- Solution ---
    # The smallest value of k is therefore 6.
    min_k = 6
