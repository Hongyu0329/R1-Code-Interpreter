    "To solve this problem and determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze Input Requirements:** The problem states we receive two strings, each with a maximum length of 100 characters. In C, a string is an array of characters ending with a null terminator (`\\0`). To store a 100-character string, we need an array of size 101 (`char string[101];`). Therefore, we need two such arrays to store the input.\n\n2.  **Design the Comparison Logic:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. The most direct approach is to loop through the strings, comparing characters at each position. To handle the case-insensitivity, we can convert characters from both strings to a common case (e.g., lowercase using the `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>`) before comparing them.\n\n3.  **Optimize for Memory:** A memory-efficient program minimizes the number of variables.\n    *   The two character arrays, `char s1[101];` and `char s2[101];`, are essential for storing the input.\n    *   A loop is necessary to iterate through the strings. This requires a loop counter variable, typically an integer (`int i;`).\n    *   To be maximally efficient, the program should print the result (`-1`, `1`, or `0`) and terminate as soon as the lexicographical order is determined. This avoids the need for an extra `result` variable. If the loop completes without any differences found, the strings are equal, and we print `0`.\n\n4.  **Identify Variables and Calculate Memory:** Based on the most memory-efficient design, the program will declare the following variables:\n    *   `char s1[101]`: A character array to hold the first string.\n    *   `char s2[101]`: A character array to hold the second string.\n    *   `int i`: An integer to serve as the loop counter.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total memory (`m`) in bytes, assuming standard data type sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (32-bit or 64-bit system):\n*   The size of a `char` is 1 byte.\n*   The size of an `int` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   Memory for `s1`: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**\n*   Memory for `s2`: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**\n*   Memory for `i`: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**\n\nTotal memory `m` = (Memory for s1) + (Memory for s2) + (Memory for i)\n`m = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206`\n\n<<<206>>>"
