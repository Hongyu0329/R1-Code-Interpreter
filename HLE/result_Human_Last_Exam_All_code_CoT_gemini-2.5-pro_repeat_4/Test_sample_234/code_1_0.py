# The problem asks to determine how many of a list of seven topological properties
# must always be true for a set S defined by the properties of a function f.
#
# Let's analyze the properties of the function f and the set S.
#
# The function f: R^n -> R^m has the property that for any point x,
# it preserves distances from x in a small neighborhood around x.
# Let's call this Property (P).
# (P): for all x in R^n, there exists ε > 0 such that for all y in B(x, ε),
# we have ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||x - y||.
#
# This property implies that f is continuous everywhere.
#
# The set S is the set of points x such that f is a full isometry on a
# neighborhood of x.
# x in S <=> there exists ε > 0 such that for all y, z in B(x, ε),
# we have ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||y - z||.
#
# The crucial insight is to analyze the consequence of Property (P) holding
# for *all* points in R^n.
# Let's fix an arbitrary point x in R^n.
# We know that for x, there is a ball B(x, ε) where f preserves distances from x.
# Now, for any other point y inside this ball B(x, ε), Property (P) also holds.
# This means that f is not just preserving distances from x, but at every
# point y in B(x, ε), it is also preserving distances from y in a smaller ball around y.
# A theorem in geometry states that a map on a connected open set (like our ball B(x,ε))
# which locally preserves distances from every point must be a full isometry on that set.
#
# Therefore, for any x in R^n, f is an isometry on a neighborhood B(x, ε).
# This is exactly the definition for x to be in S.
# Since x was an arbitrary point in R^n, it follows that every point of R^n is in S.
# So, the set S must be the entire space R^n.
#
# Now we check the seven properties for the set S = R^n, assuming n >= 1.
# 1. Open: R^n is an open set. (True)
# 2. Closed: R^n is a closed set in itself. (True)
# 3. Connected: R^n is path-connected and therefore connected. (True)
# 4. Compact: R^n is not bounded for n >= 1, so it is not compact. (False)
# 5. Dense: The closure of R^n is R^n, so it is dense in itself. (True)
# 6. Connected complement: The complement of R^n is the empty set, which is connected. (True)
# 7. Trivial first singular homology group: H_1(R^n) = {0} for n >= 1. (True)
#
# The properties that must always be true are: Open, Closed, Connected, Dense,
# Connected complement, and Trivial first singular homology group.
#
# Counting these properties, we find there are 6 of them.
