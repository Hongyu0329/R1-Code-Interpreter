    print("\nStep 1: The First Postulate Alone")
    print("The first postulate (the principle of relativity) states that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.")
    print("If we only assume this, we can derive a general form for coordinate transformations, but it's not unique.")
    print("This general transformation depends on an unknown constant, let's call it 'k'.")

    print("The transformation for the time coordinate between two frames moving at velocity 'v' looks like this:")
    print("t' = gamma * (t - v*k*x)")
    print("where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - k*v^2).")
    print("The laws of physics depend critically on the value of 'k', which is not determined by the first postulate.")

    print("    If k is zero, the transformation becomes the Galilean transformation of classical physics.")
    print("    In this universe, velocities add linearly, and the speed of light is NOT constant for all observers.")
    print("\n  * Case 2: k > 0")
    print("    If k is positive, we get the Lorentz transformations of special relativity.")
    print("    This implies there is a maximum possible speed, c = 1/sqrt(k), which is the same for ALL observers.")

    print("\nStep 4: The Role of the Second Postulate")
    print("The second postulate (the speed of light 'c' is constant for all observers) is an experimental fact.")
    print("This postulate provides the missing information needed to determine 'k'.")
    print("It forces us to reject the k=0 case and tells us that k must be positive.")
    print("Specifically, it fixes the value of k in relation to c.")

    print("The second postulate sets the value of the constant k to be:")
    equation_str = "k = 1 / c^2"
    print(f"  {equation_str}")

    numerator = 1
    print(f"  Right-hand side numerator: '{numerator}'")
    print("  Right-hand side denominator: 'c^2' (The square of the constant speed of light)")

    print("Conclusion: The 2nd postulate is an essential, independent axiom. It is the experimental key that selects the correct")
    print("relativistic laws (Lorentz) from the possibilities (like Galilean) allowed by the 1st postulate alone.")
