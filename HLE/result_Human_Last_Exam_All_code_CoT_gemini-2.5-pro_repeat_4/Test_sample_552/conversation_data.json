    "To answer this historical question, I will provide a Python script. While Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion famously contained very few direct citations, his work was fundamentally based on the principles of statistical mechanics, a field largely developed by a specific Austrian physicist. Einstein had studied this physicist's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (\"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie\").\n\nMy script will programmatically state and print the name of this influential scientist.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and returns the name of the physicist whose lectures\n    on statistical mechanics and gas theory were a primary influence on Albert\n    Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n    While the paper itself lacks a formal bibliography, historical analysis confirms\n    that Einstein's work is built upon the foundations laid by this scientist.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The physicist is Ludwig Boltzmann. His work on the molecular-kinetic theory\n    # of heat was the theoretical basis for Einstein's paper.\n    influential_physicist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    return influential_physicist\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the logic and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    lecturer_name = find_cited_lecturer()\n    print(\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein built upon the theoretical framework developed by a specific physicist.\")\n    print(\"The lectures he studied, which were foundational to his paper, were by:\")\n    print(f\"\\n{lecturer_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
