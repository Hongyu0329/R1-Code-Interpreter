Yes, adding a birefringent medium can cause the theory to fail. This is because the birefringent element's effect on polarization is not correctly reversed by the described verification procedure. The procedure only inverts the transformation from the random medium (`T`), not the polarization change from the birefringent plate (`B`). This leads to an incorrect "necessary input" being calculated, and when this input is propagated through the full system, it does not reproduce the desired output, as it mathematically requires the birefringent plate's Jones matrix `B` to satisfy `BÂ² = B`, which is not true for such optical elements.
