    # Answer to question 1: The primary stressed syllables from the first seven words.
    # The words are: מַשְׂכִּ֗יל לְאָ֫סָ֥ף לָמָ֣ה אֱ֭לֹהִים זָנַ֣חְתָּ לָנֶ֑צַח יֶעְשַׁ֥ן
    # The stressed syllables are: כִּ֗יל סָ֥ף לָ֣ הִים נַ֣ח נֶ֑ שַׁ֥ן
    # Note: For אֱ֭לֹהִים, the phonological stress is on the final syllable (הִים) according to
    # the Tiberian tradition (per Khan), even though the pre-positive accent is written on a previous syllable.
    answer_1 = "כִּ֗יל סָ֥ף לָ֣ הִים נַ֣ח נֶ֑ שַׁ֥ן"

    # Answer to question 2: The last occurrence of a syllable with marked secondary stress.
    # The verse is וּבִימֵ֣י שָׁא֗וּל...לַגִּלְעָֽד׃
    # The last word with marked secondary stress is בְּאָ֣הֳלֵיהֶ֔ם.
    # The syllable is אָ֣, where the munach serves as a meteg to mark secondary stress.
