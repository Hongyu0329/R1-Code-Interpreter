    # 2. Define the electron-phonon coupling constant from the Hamiltonian.

    C_qj = g * sp.I * q_j / sp.sqrt(2 * m * w_q)

    # 3. Define the phonon propagator in the imaginary frequency domain.
    # The interaction involves the phonon displacement field, which is proportional to (a_q + a_{-q}^dagger).

    # This is obtained from second-order perturbation theory, which is equivalent to the
    # path integral result. The potential is V_eff = -C_{q,j} * C_{-q,j} * D(q, i*nu_n).
    # C_{-q,j} is found by replacing q_j with -q_j.
