    "My thinking process to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The task is to find a transformation rule that converts the input grid of numbers into the output grid. I need to apply this rule to `Input_C` to determine the value of `MISSING`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Examples:** I'll represent the comma-separated strings as 2D grids of numbers. The core of the puzzle seems to be the number `2`. Its presence triggers a change.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis Formulation (Case A vs. Case B):**\n    *   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'` -> `Output_A:** '201111,101111,111111'`\n        *   A `2` is at grid position `(r, c) = (1, 1)`.\n        *   The `2` at `(1, 1)` becomes `0`.\n        *   A `0` at grid position `(0, 0)` becomes `2`.\n    *   **Input_B:** `'...1111002111111...'` -> `Output_B:** '...1111000211110...'`\n        *   A `2` is at grid position `(r, c) = (3, 6)`.\n        *   The `2` at `(3, 6)` becomes `0`.\n        *   A `0` at grid position `(2, 7)` becomes `2`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Pattern:** The `2` at `(r, c)` seems to \"jump\" to a new location, turning the original spot into `0` and the destination spot into `2`. The destination must originally be a `0`. The direction of the jump seems to be determined by the immediate left (`L`) and right (`R`) neighbors of the `2` in its row.\n    *   In Case A, the `2` at `(1, 1)` is surrounded by `1` on the left and `1` on the right (`L=1, R=1`). The jump is to `(r-1, c-1)` (top-left).\n    *   In Case B, the `2` at `(3, 6)` is surrounded by `0` on the left and `1` on the right (`L=0, R=1`). The jump is to `(r-1, c+1)` (top-right).\n\n5.  **Generalizing the Rule:** This suggests a lookup table for the jump direction `(dr, dc)` based on the `(L, R)` pair:\n    *   `(L=1, R=1)` -> `(dr=-1, dc=-1)` (top-left)\n    *   `(L=0, R=1)` -> `(dr=-1, dc=+1)` (top-right)\n    *   By symmetry, I can hypothesize the other two cases:\n    *   `(L=1, R=0)` -> `(dr=+1, dc=-1)` (bottom-left)\n    *   `(L=0, R=0)` -> `(dr=+1, dc=+1)` (bottom-right)\n\n6.  **Defining Failure Condition:** The transformation is only valid if the `2` can jump to a cell that is within the grid boundaries and contains a `0`. If the target cell is out of bounds or does not contain a `0`, the transformation fails. The output in this case is `MISSING`.\n\n7.  **Applying the Rule to Input_C:**\n    *   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    *   Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The `2` is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n    *   The left neighbor `L` is `grid[1][3] = 1`.\n    *   The right neighbor `R` is `grid[1][5] = 0`.\n    *   The pair is `(L, R) = (1, 0)`. My rule dictates a jump to the bottom-left: `(dr=+1, dc=-1)`.\n    *   The target coordinates are `(r+dr, c+dc) = (1+1, 4-1) = (2, 3)`.\n    *   Let's check the value at the target cell: `grid[2][3] = 1`.\n    *   Since the target cell's value is `1` (not `0`), the transformation is invalid.\n    *   Therefore, the output for `Input_C` is `MISSING`.\n\n8.  **Constructing the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic. It will parse the input, find the `2`, determine the jump direction from its neighbors, check if the target cell is valid, and then either perform the transformation or output `MISSING`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by finding the transformation rule from the examples\n    and applying it to the target input.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_c = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # Step 1: Parse the input string into a 2D grid of integers.\n    rows_str = input_c.split(',')\n    try:\n        grid = [[int(char) for char in row] for row in rows_str]\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"MISSING\")\n        return\n\n    num_rows = len(grid)\n    if num_rows == 0:\n        print(input_c)\n        return\n    num_cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to store the result.\n    # All transformation logic will read from the original `grid`.\n    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n\n    # Step 2: Find all locations of the number 2.\n    twos_locations = []\n    for r in range(num_rows):\n        for c in range(num_cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                twos_locations.append((r, c))\n\n    # If there are no 2s, the grid doesn't change.\n    if not twos_locations:\n        print(input_c)\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: For each '2', determine the transformation.\n    for r, c in twos_locations:\n        # Check if the '2' is at the left/right edge of the grid.\n        if c == 0 or c == num_cols - 1:\n            print(\"MISSING\")\n            return\n\n        # Get Left and Right neighbors.\n        L = grid[r][c - 1]\n        R = grid[r][c + 1]\n\n        # Determine jump direction based on the (L, R) pattern.\n        dr, dc = None, None\n        if (L, R) == (1, 1):\n            dr, dc = -1, -1  # Top-left\n        elif (L, R) == (0, 1):\n            dr, dc = -1, 1   # Top-right\n        elif (L, R) == (1, 0):\n            dr, dc = 1, -1   # Bottom-left\n        elif (L, R) == (0, 0):\n            dr, dc = 1, 1    # Bottom-right\n        else:\n            # This handles cases where neighbors are not 0 or 1.\n            print(\"MISSING\")\n            return\n            \n        # Calculate target coordinates.\n        target_r, target_c = r + dr, c + dc\n\n        # Validate the target: must be within bounds and its value must be 0.\n        if not (0 <= target_r < num_rows and 0 <= target_c < num_cols):\n            print(\"MISSING\") # Target is out of bounds.\n            return\n        \n        if grid[target_r][target_c] != 0:\n            print(\"MISSING\") # Target cell is not a '0'.\n            return\n\n        # Apply the transformation to the new grid.\n        new_grid[r][c] = 0\n        new_grid[target_r][target_c] = 2\n\n    # If all transformations were valid, format and print the final grid.\n    output_rows = [\"\".join(map(str, row)) for row in new_grid]\n    final_output = \",\".join(output_rows)\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<MISSING>>>"
