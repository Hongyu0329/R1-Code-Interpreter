    print("H_1 = LL^+ - alpha")
    print("\nThe constant 'alpha' is a simple energy shift applied to both Hamiltonians. It does not change the structure of the spectra relative to each other, so we can analyze the spectra of H_0' = L^+L and H_1' = LL^+ without loss of generality.")

    print("\nIf we try to find the partner state in H_1', we compute (L * psi_ground), which is 0. The zero vector is not a valid eigenstate, so this ground state of H_0' is unpaired.")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Calculating the maximum number of differing levels.")
    print("For a one-dimensional system as described, the energy levels are non-degenerate. This means for any given energy value, there can be at most one eigenstate.")
    print("Therefore, H_0' can have at most one zero-energy state, and H_1' can also have at most one.")
    print("It is a standard result in supersymmetry that at most one of the partner Hamiltonians can possess a zero-energy state (unless W(x) is trivial, in which case H_0 = H_1 and their spectra are identical).")
    print("Thus, the spectra of H_0 and H_1 can differ by at most one level.")
