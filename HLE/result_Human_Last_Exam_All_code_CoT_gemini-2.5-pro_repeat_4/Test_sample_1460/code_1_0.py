# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the braid and find the components.
# The braid is beta = sigma_1^2 * sigma_2^2 * sigma_3 * sigma_4^{-1} in B_5.
# The permutation is pi(sigma_1)^2 * pi(sigma_2)^2 * pi(sigma_3) * pi(sigma_4)^{-1}.
# pi(sigma_i) is the transposition (i, i+1).
# The permutation is (1,2)^2 (2,3)^2 (3,4) (4,5) = id * id * (3,4) (4,5) = (3,5,4).
# The cycles are (1), (2), and (3,5,4).
# This confirms there are 3 components.
# Component 1: strand 1 (an unknot).
# Component 2: strand 2 (an unknot).
# Component 3: strands 3, 4, and 5.

# Step 3: Isolate the sub-braid for the third component.
# The knot type of the third component is determined by the part of the braid acting
# internally on strands {3, 4, 5}. This is sigma_3 * sigma_4^{-1}.
# The sigma_1^2 and sigma_2^2 terms are full twists that link the other components
# to this one, but they don't change its knot type.
# We analyze the closure of sigma_3 * sigma_4^{-1} on 3 strands.
# Relabeling strands {3,4,5} to {1,2,3}, this is equivalent to the braid
# sigma_1 * sigma_2^{-1} in B_3.

# Step 4: Use spherogram to identify the knot.
# In spherogram, braid generators sigma_i are represented by the integer i,
# and their inverses by -i. We want to identify the closure of the braid
# sigma_1 * sigma_2^{-1} in the 3-strand braid group B_3.
# The braid word is represented by the list [1, -2].
try:
    B = spherogram.Braid(3, [1, -2])

    # Close the braid to get a link object.
    L = B.closure()

    # Spherogram can identify many simple knots and links by name.
    # The 4_1 knot is the figure-8 knot.
    print(f"The simplified braid corresponds to the knot: {L.name}")
    print("This knot is also known as the Figure-8 knot.")
