    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the closed-form of the infinite product, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\nThe goal is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of a product starting from n=1**\n\nThe given product starts from $n=3$. We can relate it to the full product starting from $n=1$ by dividing by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n**Step 2: Factor the general term of the product**\n\nThe general term of the product is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. We can factor this using the difference of cubes formula, $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$. Let $a=n$ and $b=z$.\n$$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\frac{n^3 - z^3}{n^3} $$\nThe roots of $x^3 - z^3 = 0$ are $z$, $z\\omega$, and $z\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Therefore, $n^3-z^3$ can be factored as $(n-z)(n-z\\omega)(n-z\\omega^2)$.\nThis gives us:\n$$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\frac{(n-z)(n-z\\omega)(n-z\\omega^2)}{n \\cdot n \\cdot n} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the product starting from n=1 using the Gamma function**\n\nThe product from $n=1$ can now be written as:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\nWe use the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function, which leads to the identity:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{-\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\nwhere $\\Gamma(x)$ is the Gamma function and $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\nWe apply this identity for $x=z$, $x=z\\omega$, and $x=z\\omega^2$ and multiply the three resulting expressions. The product of the left-hand sides is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left[\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)e^{z\\omega/n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right)e^{z\\omega^2/n}\\right] $$\n$$ = \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)\\right] \\cdot \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{(z/n)(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}\\right] $$\nSince $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, the exponential term becomes $e^0 = 1$.\n\nThe product of the right-hand sides is:\n$$ \\frac{e^{-\\gamma z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-\\gamma z\\omega}}{\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-\\gamma z\\omega^2}}{\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} = \\frac{e^{-\\gamma z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\nAgain, since $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, the numerator becomes $e^0=1$.\n\nEquating the two sides gives the identity for the product starting from $n=1$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Combine results to find the final expression**\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression from Step 1, we get the final answer:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\nThe following Python code prints this formula.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_formula():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the closed-form expression for the infinite product as a string.\n  The string represents the formula derived above and includes all the\n  relevant numbers (1, 3, 8, 2, 4) as requested.
