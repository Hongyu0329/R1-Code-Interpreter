    "My plan is to scan the provided Latin line, \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\", by applying the rules of classical Latin prosody. I will proceed as follows:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision**: I will first break the line down into its constituent syllables. I will also account for elision, which occurs when a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel. In this line, `bene` ends with '-e' and `esse` starts with 'e-', so `ben(e) esse` will be scanned as a single unit.\n2.  **Vowel Quantity**: I will determine whether each syllable is long or short. A syllable is considered long ('L') if it contains a naturally long vowel or a diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (making it long by \"position\"). Otherwise, the syllable is short ('S'). The final syllable of a line is always treated as long (*syllaba anceps*).\n3.  **Foot Division**: I will group the resulting sequence of long and short syllables into six metrical feet. While this line does not perfectly conform to the standard dactylic hexameter pattern (the fifth foot is an anapest instead of the expected dactyl), this foot-based structure provides the most accurate scansion according to the rules.\n\nThe Python code below will print the final scansion, with each foot separated by a space.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the metrical scansion of the given Latin line.\n    L represents a long syllable.\n    S represents a short syllable.\n    Each group of letters represents a metrical foot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scansion is determined by applying the rules of Latin prosody.\n    # The line is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    # It scans into 6 feet as follows:\n    foot1 = \"L S S\"  # et ti-bi\n    foot2 = \"L L\"    # ben(e) es-\n    foot3 = \"L L\"    # -se sō-\n    foot4 = \"L L\"    # -lī quom\n    foot5 = \"S S L\"  # si-bi sit\n    foot6 = \"L S\"    # mā-le (final syllable anceps, treated as long for the foot's value)\n\n    # Print the full scansion with feet separated by a space.\n    print(f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6}\")\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S S L L L L L L S S L L S>>>"
