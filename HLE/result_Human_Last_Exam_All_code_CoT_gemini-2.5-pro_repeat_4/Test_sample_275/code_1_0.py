    # Step 1: Define Menotaxis
    print("Menotaxis is a form of navigation where an organism moves at a constant angle relative to a fixed, distant stimulus. It is essentially a 'compass orientation'.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the options
    print("Let's analyze the provided choices for inducing menotaxis in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster:")
    
    print("\nA. Presenting a 100 Hz sinusoidal sound: This is incorrect. While flies can detect sound, it's typically for short-range communication or predator detection, not long-range compass navigation.")
    
    print("\nB. Food depriving, heating and providing a visual reference: This describes methods to motivate a fly (hunger, discomfort) and a general condition (a visual reference). While necessary for an experiment, it's not as specific as other options about the stimulus that *induces* the orientation.")

    print("\nC. Presenting 12 constant vertical bright bars around the fly: This describes a classic experimental setup. A panorama of stationary vertical bars provides a perfect set of visual landmarks for the fly to use as a compass. The fly can learn to hold a specific angle relative to these bars. The number of bars is a detail of the setup.")
    # Extracting the number from the option as requested by the prompt's meta-instructions.
    number_in_option = 12 
    print(f"The number of bars mentioned is {number_in_option}. This visual pattern directly induces the menotactic behavior that researchers want to study.")

    print("\nD. Presenting odors from above: This is incorrect. Odors are used for chemotaxis (moving along a concentration gradient), not typically for maintaining a constant heading in the horizontal plane.")
    
    print("\nE. Spinning the fly on an air-cushioned foam ball: This describes an apparatus, not a stimulus. A 'fly-on-a-ball' setup is used to *measure* the fly's intended walking direction while presenting it with a stimulus, such as the vertical bars from option C.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Conclude the best answer
    print("Conclusion: The most direct and standard method for inducing menotaxis is to provide a stable, panoramic visual reference that the fly can use as a compass. Option C provides the most accurate and specific description of such a stimulus.")
