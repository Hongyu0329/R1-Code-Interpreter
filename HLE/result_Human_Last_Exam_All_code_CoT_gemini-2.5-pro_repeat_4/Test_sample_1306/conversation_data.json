    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the category $C$**: The category of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity $q$ is a complex object. Its structure is best understood by decomposing it into \"blocks\" based on the action of its center.\n2.  **Classify the blocks**: For $q$ a primitive third root of unity (so the order is $l=3$), the center of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is large. The action of central elements splits the category $C$ into a direct sum of subcategories, called blocks. These blocks are parameterized by a \"central character\" $\\chi=(a,b,c) \\in \\mathbb{C}^3$.\n3.  **Count objects within each block type**: I will determine the ratio of irreducible (simple) objects to all indecomposable objects within each type of block. There are three distinct types of blocks, depending on the central character.\n4.  **Interpret \"percentage\"**: The question asks for a single percentage for the entire category $C$. Since the category consists of infinitely many objects distributed among different types of blocks (some of which are continuous families), a simple counting approach is not possible. The standard way to interpret such a question in this context is to determine the property of a \"generic\" object. This corresponds to the behavior in the blocks that form a dense, open subset of the parameter space of all blocks.\n5.  **Synthesize the result**: I will argue that the \"generic\" block type is semi-simple, where all indecomposable objects are irreducible. This will lead to the final percentage.\n6.  **Provide Python code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that walks through this reasoning, presents the calculations for each case, and prints the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_representation_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of irreducible objects in the category C\n    of indecomposable finite-dimensional u_q(sl_2) representations for q\n    a primitive third root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The order 'l' for q = exp(2*pi*i/3) is 3, since (q^2)^3 = 1 and 3 is the smallest such integer.\n    l = 3\n\n    # The category of representations decomposes into blocks based on the central character chi=(a,b,c).\n    # We analyze the ratio of irreducible to indecomposable objects in each type of block.\n\n    # Case 1: The principal block (a=0, b=0).\n    # This block has a finite number of irreducible objects but infinitely many indecomposable ones.\n    # The irreducible objects are L_0, L_1, L_2.\n    num_irreducible_principal = 3\n    num_indecomposable_principal = float('inf')\n    # The percentage is effectively zero.\n    perc_principal = 0.0\n\n    # Case 2: Taft-like blocks (a=0, b!=0 or a!=0, b=0).\n    # These blocks are equivalent to the representation category of the Taft algebra T_l.\n    # T_l has l simple objects and l^2 indecomposable objects.\n    num_irreducible_taft = l\n    num_indecomposable_taft = l**2\n    perc_taft = (num_irreducible_taft / num_indecomposable_taft) * 100\n\n    # Case 3: Semi-simple blocks (a!=0, b!=0).\n    # In these blocks, every indecomposable object is also irreducible.\n    # Each such block contains a single indecomposable object, which is irreducible.\n    num_irreducible_semisimple = 1\n    num_indecomposable_semisimple = 1\n    perc_semisimple = (num_irreducible_semisimple / num_indecomposable_semisimple) * 100\n    \n    print(\"The category C of indecomposable representations is partitioned into blocks based on a central character (a, b, c).\")\n    print(\"We analyze the percentage of irreducible objects within each type of block:\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"1.
