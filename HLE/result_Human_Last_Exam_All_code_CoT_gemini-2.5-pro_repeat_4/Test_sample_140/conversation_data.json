    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume calculation gives an upper limit, but the actual number depends on how the blocks can be physically arranged without overlapping.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the volume of the cube and the volume of a single block to find the theoretical maximum number of blocks. This serves as an upper bound.\n2.  Simulate a practical packing strategy. I will use a \"greedy slicing\" approach, where I fill a section of the cube as densely as possible and then try to pack the remaining space.\n3.  **Step 1:** I will orient the 9x1x1 blocks along one edge of the 15x15x15 cube. This fills a 9x15x15 volume. I will calculate how many blocks fit in this section.\n4.  **Step 2:** This leaves a remaining space of 6x15x15. I will then calculate how many blocks can be packed into this remaining space. Note that the 9-unit length of the blocks can no longer be aligned with the 6-unit dimension.\n5.  **Step 3:** After the second step, there will be a final leftover space. I will check if any more blocks can fit in it.\n6.  **Step 4:** The total number of blocks will be the sum of the blocks from each packing step. The code will print out the calculation for each step and then the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_dims = (9, 1, 1)\n    \n    # --- Theoretical Maximum (based on volume) ---\n    cube_volume = cube_edge ** 3\n    block_volume = block_dims[0] * block_dims[1] * block_dims[2]\n    theoretical_max = cube_volume // block_volume\n    \n    print(f\"The volume of the cube is {cube_edge}x{cube_edge}x{cube_edge} = {cube_volume}.\")\n    print(f\"The volume of one block is {block_dims[0]}x{block_dims[1]}x{block_dims[2]} = {block_volume}.\")\n    print(f\"Based on volume alone, the maximum possible number of blocks is {cube_volume} / {block_volume} = {theoretical_max}.\\n\")\n    print(\"However, we must be able to physically fit the blocks.
