    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we need to analyze its structure and how the rank is affected by the values `a` (for red pixels) and `b` (for white pixels), and the dimensions of the flag's components.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Matrix Structure:** The Tongan flag consists of a large red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The canton itself contains a red couped cross. We can represent this as a large matrix `A`, where red pixels have value `a` and white pixels have value `b`. The matrix `A` has a block structure:\n    ```\n    A = | C | R |\n        |---|---|\n        | B | J |\n    ```\n    Here, `C` is the `m x n` matrix for the canton, and `R`, `B`, and `J` are matrices where all entries are `a`.\n\n2.  **Rank Decomposition via Row/Column Operations:** The rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations. We can use this to simplify the problem. Let's assume `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b` to avoid trivial cases (like a monochrome flag).\n    - We can subtract the last row of `A` (which is all `a`'s) from all other rows in the bottom red part (rows `m+1` to `M-1`), making them zero.\n    - Similarly, we can subtract the last column (all `a`'s) from other columns in the right red part (columns `n+1` to `N-1`), making them zero.\n    - After these operations, the rank of the matrix is determined by an `(m+1) x (n+1)` block in the top-left, which looks like this: `B = [C | a*col; a*row | a]`, where `col` is a column of ones and `row` is a row of ones.\n    - We can further simplify by subtracting `a` times the last row of `B` from its first `m` rows, and `a` times the last column from its first `n` columns. This leads to the following relationship for the rank of the original matrix `A`:\n      `rank(A) = rank(C - a*J) + 1`\n      where `J` is an `m x n` matrix of all ones.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Canton Matrix:** The matrix `C - a*J` has entries `(b-a)` for white pixels and `(a-a) = 0` for red pixels. Let `c = b-a`. The rank of this matrix is the same as the rank of a matrix `W` which has `1`s for white pixels and `0`s for red pixels (assuming `c ≠ 0`). We want to maximize `rank(W)`.\n\n4.  **Maximizing `rank(W)`:** The matrix `W` represents the white parts of the canton. This is a white rectangle with a red cross-shaped \"hole\". The rank of `W` is the number of linearly independent row (or column) patterns.\n    - A row's pattern is defined by the locations of its zeros.\n    - The red cross is formed by the union of two overlapping rectangular areas: a horizontal bar `H` and a vertical bar `V`.\n    - To maximize the number of different row patterns, we can define a cross geometry where the row sets and column sets of `H` and `V` partially overlap. This creates four distinct regions for rows to pass through:\n        1.  Outside the cross entirely.\n        2.  Intersecting only the vertical bar `V`.\n        3.  Intersecting only the horizontal bar `H`.\n        4.  Intersecting the union of `H` and `V`.\n    - These four regions can produce four linearly independent row vectors. By ensuring the column geometry is similarly complex, we can also obtain four linearly independent column vectors. This allows for `rank(W) = 4`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** With `rank(W)` maximized to 4, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `A` is:\n    `rank(A) = rank(W) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by constructing a matrix for the Tongan flag with a specific geometry that yields this maximal rank and printing the result of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef create_tonga_matrix(M, N, m, n, a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a matrix representing the Tongan flag with maximal rank geometry.\n\n    Args:\n        M (int): Total height of the flag matrix.\n        N (int): Total width of the flag matrix.\n        m (int): Height of the canton.\n        n (int): Width of the canton.\n        a (float): Value for red pixels.\n        b (float): Value for white pixels.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The matrix representing the flag.\n        np.ndarray: The W matrix (white parts of the canton).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Start with a full red flag\n    flag_matrix = np.full((M, N), a)\n\n    # Create the white canton\n    flag_matrix[:m, :n] = b\n\n    # Create the red cross in the canton.\n    # To maximize rank, we use a cross shape made of two partially\n    # overlapping rectangles H and V.\n    \n    # Define vertical bar V region\n    i_v1, i_v2 = m // 5, 3 * m // 5\n    j_v1, j_v2 = n // 5, 3 * n // 5\n    \n    # Define horizontal bar H region\n    i_h1, i_h2 = 2 * m // 5, 4 * m // 5\n    j_h1, j_h2 = 2 * n // 5, 4 * n // 5\n\n    # Create a boolean mask for the cross\n    cross_mask = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=bool)\n    # Mark horizontal bar region\n    cross_mask[i_h1:i_h2, j_h1:j_h2] = True\n    # Mark vertical bar region\n    cross_mask[i_v1:i_v2, j_v1:j_v2] = True\n\n    # Apply the cross to the canton\n    flag_matrix[:m, :n][cross_mask] = a\n\n    # Create the W matrix (1 for white, 0 for red in canton)\n    canton = flag_matrix[:m, :n]\n    W = (canton == b).astype(int)\n    \n    return flag_matrix, W\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the maximal rank of the Tongan flag matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define dimensions (must be large enough for the geometry)\n    M, N = 100, 150  # Flag dimensions\n    m, n = 50, 75    # Canton dimensions\n\n    # Choose a and b to maximize rank (a!=b, a!=0)\n    a, b = 1.0, 2.0\n\n    # Create the matrices\n    A, W = create_tonga_matrix(M, N, m, n, a, b)\n\n    # Calculate the ranks\n    rank_A = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)\n    rank_W = np.linalg.matrix_rank(W)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the result\n    print(\"The rank of the flag matrix 'A' can be decomposed as rank(A) = rank(W) + 1,\")\n    print(\"where W is the matrix representing the white areas of the canton (1 for white, 0 for red).\")\n    print(\"To maximize the rank of A, we need to maximize the rank of W.\")\n    print(\"By choosing a cross geometry that creates four distinct row/column patterns, we can achieve rank(W) = 4.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the ranks with this optimized geometry:\")\n    \n    # Output the numbers in the final equation\n    print(f\"Rank of the canton's white-pattern matrix, rank(W) = {rank_W}\")\n    print(f\"Maximal rank of the flag matrix, rank(A) = rank(W) + 1 = {rank_W} + 1 = {rank_A}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<5>>>\n```"
