Here is the step-by-step analysis of the four legal questions:

1.  Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Bryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
    Yes. When restrictive covenants are part of a sale of a business, courts are more likely to enforce them to protect the purchased goodwill. Bryan was a seller and the new CEO. The restrictions (1-year non-solicitation, 6-month non-competition in Ontario) are reasonably framed to protect the business Stan and Jerry bought. Therefore, they are likely enforceable.

2.  Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Ryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
    Yes. Although Ryan's new role as Shift Manager is not executive-level, he was also a co-owner selling his stake in the business. The covenants protect the value of the business sold. A court would likely focus on his status as a seller who received payment for the company's goodwill, making the clauses enforceable.

3.  Are the Employment Agreements for the 20 new employees valid and enforceable?
    The agreements are generally valid, but the non-competition clause is not. Under Ontario law, non-competition clauses are banned for non-executive employees hired after October 2021. These new manufacturing employees fall into that category. A court would sever the unenforceable non-compete clause but uphold the remainder of the employment agreement. The agreements are not entirely invalid.

4.  Is Bryan required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan?
    No. A legally binding contract requires consideration from both sides. Bryan's promise to give Stan the truck was a one-sided, gratuitous promise (a promise of a gift) made after the business deal was set. Stan did not provide anything in exchange for the truck. Therefore, the promise is not legally enforceable.

Conclusion:
- Bryan's covenants are enforceable.
- Ryan's covenants are enforceable.
- The new employees' agreements are valid, but the non-competition clause is unenforceable.
- Bryan is not required to transfer the truck.

This reasoning leads to a single correct option among the choices.
