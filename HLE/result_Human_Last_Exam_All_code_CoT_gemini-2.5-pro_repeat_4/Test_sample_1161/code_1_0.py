def solve_fortress_problem_for_sphere():
    """
    Solves the fortress problem for a unit ball in 3D space.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of guards on the surface of a sphere
    required to see the entire exterior of the sphere.

    1. A single guard on the sphere's surface can see the open half-space
       defined by the tangent plane at its location.
    2. The problem is equivalent to covering the exterior of the sphere with
       these tangent half-spaces.
    3. The region unseen by the guards is the intersection of the complementary
       half-spaces (the ones containing the sphere). To cover the entire exterior,
       this unseen region must be bounded.
    4. In 3D space, the intersection of 'n' half-spaces can only form a bounded
       polyhedron (a simplex, specifically a tetrahedron) if n >= 4.
    5. With n=3 guards, the unseen region is an unbounded prism, so there are
       points at infinity that are not observed. Thus, 3 guards are not sufficient.
    6. With n=4 guards placed at the vertices of an inscribed tetrahedron, the
       tangent planes form an enclosing tetrahedron. This is a bounded region,
       and its exterior is fully covered. Thus, 4 guards are sufficient.
    7. The general formula for a d-dimensional convex body is d+1. For a sphere in
       3D, d=3.
