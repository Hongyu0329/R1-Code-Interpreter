    "This is a geographical riddle that can be solved by deduction using the provided clues. Here is my plan to identify the island town:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the key characteristics of the location:\n    *   It's an island town.\n    *   It's highly isolated (\"> 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\"). This points to one of the world's most remote places.\n    *   It's located on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town and the bay have the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:** I'll consider well-known remote islands.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** Extremely remote, but its main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, does not share its name with its bay, nor is the bay a caldera.\n    *   **Santorini, Greece:** Famous for its caldera bay, but it is not isolated; it's close to many other Greek islands.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is a very strong candidate. It is extremely isolated (over 2,000 km from Pitcairn Island). Its main town is Hanga Roa, which sits on Hanga Roa Bayâ€”the names match. The island is entirely volcanic and features prominent calderas like Rano Kau. While the bay itself is not a perfect, enclosed caldera, it is a key feature of this famous volcanic island, making it the best fit for all the clues combined.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Code:** Since the task requires a script, I will write a simple Python script that stores the deduced answer in a variable and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the geographical riddle by storing and printing the answer.\n    \n    The riddle describes an island town with the following properties:\n    1. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    2. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    3. The bay shares the town's name.\n\n    The answer is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - Easter Island is one of the most isolated inhabited islands in the world.\n    - The main town is Hanga Roa, which is situated on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    - The island is of volcanic origin and features large calderas, fitting the description.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The name of the town that fits the description.\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    \n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
