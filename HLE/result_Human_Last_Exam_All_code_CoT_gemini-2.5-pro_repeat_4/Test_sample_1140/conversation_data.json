    "For a peptide of 100 amino acids, a direct, single synthesis using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is highly inefficient. The overall yield decreases exponentially with each amino acid added. A superior and more practical approach for a peptide of this length, especially one containing an unnatural amino acid, is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nNCL involves synthesizing two smaller, more manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two 50-amino-acid fragments) via SPPS, where the unnatural amino acid can be easily incorporated. One fragment is made with a C-terminal thioester and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. These two fragments are then joined together (ligated) in solution to form the full-length 100-amino-acid peptide. This method dramatically improves the overall yield compared to a single, continuous 100-step synthesis.\n\nTo demonstrate why direct SPPS is so challenging for a 100aa peptide, the following Python script calculates the theoretical yield. It compares the yield of a direct 100aa synthesis to that of a 50aa fragment, which would be the first step in an NCL approach. We'll assume an optimistic 99% efficiency for each coupling step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, coupling_efficiency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\n\n    Args:\n        peptide_length (int): The number of amino acids in the peptide.\n        coupling_efficiency (float): The efficiency of a single coupling step (e.g., 0.99 for 99%).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (0 < coupling_efficiency <= 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"Coupling efficiency must be between 0 and 1.\")\n    if peptide_length < 2:\n        # No coupling steps needed for a single amino acid\n        return 1.0\n\n    # The number of coupling reactions is one less than the peptide length\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n\n    # Overall yield is the coupling efficiency raised to the power of the number of couplings\n    total_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings\n\n    return total_yield, num_couplings\n\n# --- Parameters ---\npeptide_length_full = 100\npeptide_length_fragment = 50\nefficiency = 0.99\n\n# --- Calculations ---\nyield_full, couplings_full = calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length_full, efficiency)\nyield_fragment, couplings_fragment = calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length_fragment, efficiency)\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(\"--- Comparing Theoretical SPPS Yields ---\")\nprint(f\"Assuming a per-step coupling efficiency of: {efficiency * 100}%\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"1.
