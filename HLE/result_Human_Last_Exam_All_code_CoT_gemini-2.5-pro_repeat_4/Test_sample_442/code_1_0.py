    # Step 3: Identify the original compound word
    print("   - In Latin, the verb for 'to come before' or 'to precede' is 'praevenio'.")
    print("   - This is a compound verb made from the prefix 'prae-' (meaning 'before') and the verb 'venio' (meaning 'to come').")
    print("   - The present participle of this verb is 'praeveniens' ('coming before').")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: Show the separation
    print("   - Vergil takes this single word, 'praeveniens', and 'cuts' it.")
    print("   - He separates the prefix 'prae-' from the base participle 'veniens'.")
    print("   - He then inserts the words '-que diem' ('and the day') into the gap.")

    print("This intentional separation of a compound word for metrical and dramatic effect is a clear example of Tmesis.")
