# The clue points to the 2010 Nobel Prize for the Heck reaction.
Y1 = 2010

# Step 2: Decipher X5 through X11 from Clue 2
# The digits are derived from the CAS number of the catalyst Palladium(II) acetate (3375-31-3).
X5 = 3
X6 = 3
X7 = 7

# Step 3: Determine Y4 and the topological index from Clue 3
# Y4 is constructed from X9, X10, X11.
Y4 = int(str(X9) + str(X10) + str(X11))

# The "Y1-Hall topological state index" refers to the number of carbon atoms
# in the halide-containing reactant, Iodobenzene (C6H5I).

# Step 4: Perform the final calculation
result = Y4 ** topological_index

# Output the final equation with each number printed explicitly.
