    print("The question's premise is: 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)...'")
    print("This premise is contradictory. A scheme is 'existentially forgeable' if an attacker can create a new valid message-signature pair. ECDSA is a standard secure algorithm, meaning it is designed to be existentially UNFORGEABLE.")

    print("Statement A: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("This statement describes a property known as strong existential unforgeability. It means it is computationally infeasible to create a second, different signature for a message that has already been signed. This is a standard security goal for modern signature schemes like ECDSA.")

    print("Statement B: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("This describes resistance to a 'total break' or key recovery attack. The security of ECDSA relies on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Recovering the secret key is considered computationally infeasible.")
    print("Result: Statement B is TRUE.")

    # 4. Evaluate Option C

    print("Statement C: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("This statement claims that there exist some signature schemes that are insecure in a specific way (selectively forgeable). This is true. For example, the 'textbook' RSA signature scheme (without a proper padding or hashing scheme) is known to be forgeable. Thus, such schemes exist.")

    print("Statement D: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("This statement is about message recovery. Digital signatures are primarily for authentication and integrity, not confidentiality. In most standard implementations (like ECDSA with SHA-256), the message is sent in plaintext alongside the signature. Therefore, 'figuring out m' is trivial because it's not hidden. This statement is false.")
