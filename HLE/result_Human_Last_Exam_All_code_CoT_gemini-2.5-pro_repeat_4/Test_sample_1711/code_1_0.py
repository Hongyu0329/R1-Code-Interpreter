# The group is G = (Z/49Z)^2024.
# We are looking for the smallest size of a set A that intersects every cyclic subgroup of G.

# The problem reduces to finding the size of a minimal hitting set for the 1-dimensional
# subspaces of the vector space V = (F_7)^2024, plus one element for the trivial subgroup.

# n is the dimension of the vector space
n = 2024
# q is the size of the finite field
q = 7

# The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over a field of size q
# is given by the formula (q^n - 1) / (q - 1).
# This is the minimum number of elements required to hit all non-trivial cyclic subgroups.
num_subspaces = (q**n - 1) // (q - 1)

# We also need to hit the trivial subgroup {0}, so we add 1 to the result.
total_size = num_subspaces + 1

# The final formula is (q^n - 1)/(q-1) + 1 = (q^n + q - 2)/(q-1).
# For q=7, this is (7^n - 1)/6 + 1 = (7^n + 5)/6.

# Let's print the components of the final equation and the result.
numerator = q**n + 5
denominator = 6

print(f"The final equation for the size of the set A is: ({q}^{n} + 5) / {denominator}")
print(f"The value is: {total_size}")
