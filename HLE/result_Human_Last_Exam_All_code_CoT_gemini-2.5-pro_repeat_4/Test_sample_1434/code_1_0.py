# Based on the mathematical analysis, for each integer n >= 1, the set S contains exactly
# two pairs: (n, 0) and (n, N_n), where N_n is the size of the neighborhood S_p.
# This means for each n, we add two terms of 1/4^n to the total sum.
# The sum to be calculated is therefore:
# Sum = Sum_{n=1 to infinity} 2 * (1/4)^n

# This can be rewritten as 2 * Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n.
# The sum part is an infinite geometric series.

# The factor that multiplies the geometric series.
factor = 2

# The parameters for the geometric series Sum_{n=1 to inf} a * r^(n-1).
# Our series is Sum (1/4)^n, which is (1/4) + (1/4)^2 + ...
# The first term 'a' is 1/4.
# The common ratio 'r' is 1/4.
a = fractions.Fraction(1, 4)
r = fractions.Fraction(1, 4)

# The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula: a / (1 - r).
series_sum = a / (1 - r)

# The total sum is the factor multiplied by the sum of the series.
total_sum = factor * series_sum

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is: factor * series_sum = total_sum
