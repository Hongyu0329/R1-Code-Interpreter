    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a solution to the problem, along with the analysis requested.\n\nFirst, I will outline the plan to solve the problem using Python. The goal is to take an input string like \"3+2+1+4+1\", extract the numbers, sort them, and then reassemble them into a new string like \"1+1+2+3+4\".\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Read the entire line of input, which is the sum, as a single string.\n2.  The numbers in the sum are separated by the '+' character. I will split the input string by '+' to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n3.  Since the numbers are all single digits ('1', '2', '3', '4'), sorting this list of strings alphabetically will achieve the same result as sorting them numerically.\n4.  After sorting the list, I will join the elements back together into a single string, with '+' as the separator.\n5.  Finally, I will print the resulting sorted sum string.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\n# Read the input sum as a string\ns = input()\n\n# Split the string by '+' to get a list of numbers (as strings).\n# For example, \"3+2+1+4+1\" becomes ['3', '2', '1', '4', '1'].\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of strings. Since all numbers are single digits,\n# lexicographical (alphabetical) sorting is equivalent to numerical sorting.\n# ['3', '2', '1', '4', '1'] becomes ['1', '1', '2', '3', '4'].\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted list of strings back into a single string,\n# separated by '+'.\n# ['1', '1', '2', '3', '4'] becomes \"1+1+2+3+4\".\nresult = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final, rearranged sum.\nprint(result)\n```\n\nRegarding the task to find the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program:\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program would not store the entire input string. Instead, it would read the input one character at a time and use an array of counters to keep track of how many times each number (1, 2, 3, or 4) appears. After counting, it would loop through the counters to print the sorted sum. This approach minimizes memory usage by avoiding the need for a large buffer to hold the input string or the extracted numbers.\n\nTo calculate the total memory `m` used for variables in such a program, we must select the smallest possible data types for each variable on a typical system (e.g., 64-bit Linux with GCC, where `sizeof(short)` is 2, `sizeof(int)` is 4, and `sizeof(char)` is 1).\n\nThe variables required are:\n1.  `counts[4]`: An array to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The maximum number of terms is about 500, which fits in a `short int`. Memory: `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n2.  `c`: A variable to store the character read by `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n3.  `i`, `j`: Loop counters. The outer loop runs 4 times, so `char i` is sufficient (`1` byte). The inner loop can run up to 500 times, so `short j` is needed (`2` bytes). Memory: `1 + 2 = 3` bytes.\n4.  `first`: A flag to correctly print the `+` symbols. A `char` is sufficient. Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\nTotal memory usage `m` is the sum of these:\nm = 8 (counts) + 4 (c) + 3 (i, j) + 1 (first) = 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
