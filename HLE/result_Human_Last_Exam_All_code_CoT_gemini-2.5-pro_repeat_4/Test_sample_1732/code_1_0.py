# Based on the derivation, the problem reduces to solving a quadratic equation for d.
# The condition that {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence leads to two cases: a_1 = d or a_1 = 2d.
# The case a_1 = 2d leads to solutions for d that do not satisfy the condition d > 1.
# The case a_1 = d leads to the following quadratic equation, which we solve here.

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation 50*d^2 - d - 51 = 0
a = 50
b = -1
c = -51
