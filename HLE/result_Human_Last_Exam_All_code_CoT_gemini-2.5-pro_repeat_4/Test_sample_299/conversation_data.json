    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of the function `f`**:\n    Let the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   **Injectivity**: The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, which means it is injective (one-to-one). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n    *   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n2.  **Determine the monotonicity of `f`**:\n    *   Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing. If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is a strictly increasing function. However, any continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. For this fixed point, we would have $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This leads to the equation $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. The function $h(x) = \\exp(x) - x$ has a minimum value of 1 (at $x=0$), so it is never zero. Thus, the equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions. This is a contradiction, so $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing.\n    *   Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing. This implies that $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent. Therefore, any solution `f` must be a strictly increasing function.\n\n3.  **Constructing the solutions**:\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing and has no fixed points, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. If $f(x) < x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$, which would mean $\\exp(x) < x$. This is false. Thus, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n    Let's define $c = f(0)$. From the main equation at $x=0$, we get $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0)$, which means $f(c) = 1$.\n    From $f(x)>x$, we have $c = f(0) > 0$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $c > 0$, we have $f(c) > f(0)$, which implies $1 > c$.\n    So, for any solution $f$, the value $c = f(0)$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\n    The construction of a solution $f$ can be based on the choice of $c \\in (0,1)$ and the behavior of $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$.\n    Let $h$ be the restriction of $f$ to the interval $[0,c]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, $h: [0,c] \\to [f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]$ must be a strictly increasing, continuous function (a homeomorphism).\n\n    Any pair $(c, h)$, where $c \\in (0,1)$ and $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ is a homeomorphism, can be shown to uniquely define a function $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the original equation. The function is extended to other intervals using the relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and the commutation property $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Cardinality**:\n    The number of distinct solutions is the number of possible pairs $(c, h)$.\n    *   The number of choices for the real number $c$ from the interval $(0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   For any fixed $c$, we need to count the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms $h$ from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$. The set of such functions also has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. This can be seen by considering that for any point $x \\in (0,c)$, the value $h(x)$ can be chosen as any point $y \\in (c,1)$, and there is an uncountably infinite number of ways to complete the function while maintaining its properties.\n\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of the sets of choices for $c$ and $h$. This is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to represent these cardinalities and calculates the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R\n    satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The cardinality of the continuum, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers R.\n    # In sympy, this is represented by S.Continuum.\n    continuum = sympy.S.Continuum\n\n    # The first step in constructing a solution is to choose a value c = f(0).\n    # This value must lie in the interval (0, 1).\n    # The number of choices for c is the cardinality of the interval (0, 1), which is the continuum.\n    num_choices_for_c = continuum\n\n    # The second step is to choose a strictly increasing continuous function h\n    # that maps the interval [0, c] to [c, 1].\n    # The number of such functions is also the cardinality of the continuum.\n    num_choices_for_h = continuum\n\n    # The total cardinality of the set of solutions S is the product of the number of choices\n    # for c and the number of choices for h.\n    total_cardinality = num_choices_for_c * num_choices_for_h\n\n    # The final equation for the cardinality of the set S.\n    # We output each component of the calculation.\n    print(\"The cardinality of the set of solutions, |S|, is determined by the number of ways to construct a valid function.\")\n    print(\"This is based on two independent choices:\")\n    print(\"1. The choice for a value c = f(0) from (0, 1).\")\n    print(\"2. The choice for a function h mapping [0, c] to [c, 1].\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the cardinality is:\")\n    print(f\"|S| = (Number of choices for c) * (Number of choices for h)\")\n    print(f\"|S| = {num_choices_for_c} * {num_choices_for_h}\")\n    print(f\"|S| = {total_cardinality}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nIn set theory, the cardinality of the continuum is often written as 2^aleph_0.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n\ncalculate_cardinality()\n```\n<<<Continuum>>>"
