    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, we need to classify the possible topological structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\nA stable curve of genus `g ≥ 2` is a connected curve that has only nodal singularities (ordinary double points) and has a finite automorphism group. This latter condition is equivalent to requiring that every irreducible component that is a rational curve (isomorphic to `P¹`, a sphere) must intersect the other components in at least three points.\n\nWe can classify these curves based on their number of irreducible components and their geometric genera. The arithmetic genus `g` of a nodal curve is given by the formula:\n`g = Σ gᵢ + n - c + 1`\nwhere:\n*   `gᵢ` is the geometric genus of the i-th component.\n*   `n` is the total number of nodes (intersections).\n*   `c` is the number of irreducible components.\n\nLet's analyze the possible cases for `g = 2`:\n\n1.  **Case 1: Irreducible Curve (c = 1)**\n    The formula becomes `2 = g₁ + n`.\n    *   If `n = 0`, then `g₁ = 2`. This is a smooth, irreducible curve of genus 2. This is the case of \"good reduction\". (1 type)\n    *   If `n = 1`, then `g₁ = 1`. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) with one node. (1 type)\n    *   If `n = 2`, then `g₁ = 0`. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. (1 type)\n\n2.  **Case 2: Reducible Curve with two components (c = 2)**\n    The formula becomes `2 = g₁ + g₂ + n - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n = 3 - g₁ - g₂`. `n` is the number of intersection points.\n    *   If `g₁ = 1, g₂ = 1`: `n = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1`. This is a curve made of two elliptic curves intersecting at one point. Since no component is rational, the stability condition is automatically satisfied. (1 type)\n    *   If `g₁ = 1, g₂ = 0`: `n = 3 - 1 - 0 = 2`. This consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at two points. The rational component (genus 0) intersects the rest of the curve in only two points, which violates the stability condition. Thus, this is not a stable reduction type.\n    *   If `g₁ = 0, g₂ = 0`: `n = 3 - 0 - 0 = 3`. This is a curve made of two rational curves intersecting at three points. Each rational component intersects the other at 3 points, so the stability condition is satisfied. (1 type)\n\n3.  **Cases with more components (c ≥ 3)**\n    Any configuration with `c ≥ 3` components that has arithmetic genus 2 will contain at least one rational component that intersects the rest of the curve in fewer than three points, making it unstable. For example, for `c=3` all components must be rational (`gᵢ=0`). The formula `2 = n - 3 + 1` implies `n=4`. A configuration of 3 rational curves connected by 4 nodes in a way that is stable is not possible.\n\nSumming up the stable types, we have 3 irreducible types and 2 reducible types.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reduction_genus_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and explains the number of different types of stable reduction\n    for curves of genus 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The types of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve correspond to the topological\n    # types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.
