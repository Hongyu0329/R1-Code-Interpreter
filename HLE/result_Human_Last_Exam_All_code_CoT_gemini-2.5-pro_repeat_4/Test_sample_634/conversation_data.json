    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. The method involves forming an augmented matrix by stacking the two matrices and then reducing this matrix to a simpler form using elementary row operations. The non-zero part of the resulting matrix will be a GCRD.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Form the Augmented Matrix**: We'll stack matrix `P1` on top of matrix `P2` to create a single 4x2 matrix, let's call it `M`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Perform Row Reduction**: We will apply elementary row operations to `M`. These operations are:\n    a) Swapping two rows.\n    b) Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    c) Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n    The goal is to transform `M` into an upper triangular form (or more specifically, row echelon form), where the rows below a certain point are all zeros.\n3.  **Extract the GCRD**: The remaining non-zero rows of the transformed matrix form the GCRD. We can then normalize this matrix to a simpler form (e.g., making the diagonal elements 1).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the input polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                    [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                    [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # 1. Form the augmented matrix M by stacking P1 and P2\n    M = P1.vstack(P2)\n\n    # 2. Perform elementary row operations to reduce M\n    # The process is similar to Gaussian elimination but for polynomials.\n\n    # Step A: Use R2 ([s, 0]) to simplify R0 and R1\n    # R0 -> R0 - (s+1)*R2\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] - (s + 1) * M[2, :]\n    # R1 -> R1 + s*R2\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] + s * M[2, :]\n\n    # Step B: Simplify the matrix further.\n    # R2 -> R2 + R3\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + M[3, :]\n    \n    # At this point, M has a simple row M[2,:] = [-1, 1]. We use it as a pivot.\n    \n    # Step C: Use the new R2 ([-1, 1]) to simplify R1 and R3\n    # R1 -> R1 - R2\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - M[2, :]\n    # R3 -> R3 - (s+1)*R2. The factor is chosen to make M[3,0] zero.\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] - (s + 1) * M[2, :]\n\n    # Now the matrix has two zero columns in the first element,\n    # and is ready for further reduction. Let's reorder for clarity.\n    M.row_swap(0, 2)\n    M.row_swap(1, 3)\n    \n    # Step D: Reduce the second column\n    # R2 -> R2 + s*R1\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[1, :]\n    \n    # Step E: Final reduction to get to echelon form\n    # R1 -> R1 - s*R2\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - s * M[2, :]\n\n    # 3. Extract the non-zero rows which form the GCRD\n    # The matrix is now in row echelon form, with the bottom two rows being zero.\n    G = M[:2, :]\n    \n    # Normalize the GCRD to its simplest form (an identity matrix in this case)\n    # Multiply the first row by -1\n    if G[0, 0] == -1:\n        G[0, :] = -G[0, :]\n    # Multiply the second row by -1\n    if G[1, 1] == -1:\n        G[1, :] = -G[1, :]\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor is the matrix G(s):\")\n    # Using a loop to print each element as requested\n    for i in range(G.rows):\n        row_str = []\n        for j in range(G.cols):\n            row_str.append(str(G[i, j]))\n        print(f\"[{', '.join(row_str)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
