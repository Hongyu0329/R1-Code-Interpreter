    print("Step 1: Grammatical Ambiguity")
    print("The word 'miserrima' is a feminine adjective. Its '-a' ending creates ambiguity:")
    print("  - Nominative 'miserrima' (short 'a'): It would describe the subject, 'she'.")
    print("  - Ablative 'miserrimā' (long 'a'): It would describe 'tabe' (wasting).")
    print("Both readings are grammatically plausible, so we need more information.\n")

    print("For 'sērrĭmă' to be a dactyl, its syllable pattern must be long-short-short.")
    print("  - 'sēr-' is long.")
    print("  - '-rĭ-' is short.")
    print("  - Therefore, the final syllable '-mă' must be short to fit the meter.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("A short final '-a' means the word must be the nominative form, 'miserrima'.")
    print("If it were the ablative 'miserrimā', the final syllable would be long, which would break the meter.")
