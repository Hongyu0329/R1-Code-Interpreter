    "In this task, I will identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first compile a list of real-world rivers that are mentioned in the Aeneid. This requires knowledge of the text. The most prominent ones are the Nile, Danube, Euphrates, Ganges, Rhine, Po, and Tiber.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate lengths of these rivers in kilometers using geographical data.\n3.  I will then create a Python script to store this data in a dictionary, with river names as keys and their lengths as values.\n4.  The script will sort the rivers based on their lengths in descending order.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the names and lengths of the top three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n\n    This function contains a predefined dictionary of rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n    and their approximate real-world lengths in kilometers.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
