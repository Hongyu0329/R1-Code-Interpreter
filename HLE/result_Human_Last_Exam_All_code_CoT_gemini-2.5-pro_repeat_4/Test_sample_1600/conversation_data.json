    "The problem asks for `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This number depends on the specific physical process being considered. The two most fundamental processes are the correction to the electron propagator (electron self-energy) and the correction to the photon propagator (vacuum polarization).\n\nThe number of diagrams for each sequence is known from theoretical calculations:\n*   **Electron propagator diagrams**: `a_e(1)=1`, `a_e(2)=7`, `a_e(3)=72`, `a_e(4)=891`, ...\n*   **Photon propagator diagrams**: `a_p(1)=1`, `a_p(2)=2`, `a_p(3)=10`, `a_p(4)=54`, ...\n\nThe question's phrasing \"for the electron or the photon propagators\" is slightly ambiguous. However, the sequence for the electron propagator is the one most commonly cited in physics literature as \"the\" number of QED diagrams at a given order. Therefore, I will proceed with the assumption that the question refers to the diagrams for the electron propagator.\n\nFor `n=3`, we are interested in diagrams of order `2*3 = 6`. The number of such diagrams for the electron propagator is 72.\n\nSince there isn't a simple formula to calculate this number, the following Python code will retrieve this known value from a pre-defined list.\n\n```python\ndef get_qed_diagram_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator\n    in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) at order 2n.\n\n    These values are known from complex theoretical calculations and are not generated\n    by a simple formula. The sequence is stored here for lookup.\n    This corresponds to the OEIS sequence A000598.\n    \"\"\"\n    # a(n) corresponds to the number of diagrams at order 2n.\n    # The dictionary maps n to a(n).\n    known_values = {\n        1: 1,    # Order 2\n        2: 7,    # Order 4\n        3: 72,   # Order 6\n        4: 891,  # Order 8\n        5: 12672 # Order 10\n    }\n    \n    if n in known_values:\n        return known_values[n]\n    else:\n        return f\"The value for a({n}) is not in our pre-computed list.\"\n\n# The user asks for a(3).\nn_value = 3\nresult = get_qed_diagram_count(n_value)\n\n# Print the final result as an equation.\nprint(f\"a({n_value}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<72>>>"
