    """
    This function explains the step-by-step determination of the point group
    for the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper.
    """
    print("Step 1: Analyze the molecular structure.")
    print("  - Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print("  - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (Me-S-CH2-CH2-S-Me), a bidentate ligand.")
    print("  - Complex: [Cu(ligand)2], a 4-coordinate complex.")
    print("\nStep 2: Determine the most likely coordination geometry.")
    print("  - The complex is typically square planar, especially for the common Cu(II) oxidation state.")
    print("  - In this geometry, the four sulfur atoms form a square around the central Cu atom.")
    print("\nStep 3: Consider the ligand conformation.")
    print("  - Each ligand forms a 5-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S).")
    print("  - These rings are puckered (non-planar).")
    print("  - The most stable conformation has the two rings puckering in opposite directions from the CuS4 plane (one 'up', one 'down').")
    print("\nStep 4: Identify the symmetry elements for this stable conformation.")
    print("  - E (Identity): Present in all molecules.")
    print("  - i (Center of Inversion): Yes. An inversion center exists at the Cu atom. The 'up' ring inverts to the 'down' ring, and each atom maps to an identical one through the center.")
    print("  - Cn (Proper Rotation Axis): No. The puckered rings prevent any C2 or C4 rotation axes.")
    print("  - Ïƒ (Mirror Plane): No. The puckering of the rings breaks all possible mirror planes.")
    print("  - Sn (Improper Rotation Axis): Only S2, which is equivalent to the center of inversion 'i'.")
    print("\nStep 5: Conclude the point group.")
    print("  - A molecule with only the identity (E) and a center of inversion (i) belongs to the Ci point group.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: The symmetry point group is Ci.")
