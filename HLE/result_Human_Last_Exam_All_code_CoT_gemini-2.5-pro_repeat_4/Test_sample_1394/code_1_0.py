    # The original equation is x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*y' + y^2*(y')^2 + x*y*y' + 9*x^2.
    # As explained in the plan, this is likely a typo for:
    # x^2*y^2 = y^2*(y')^2 + 6*x*y*y' + 9*x^2

    # This gives two separable ODEs to solve.

    # --- Solution for ODE 1: y*y' = x*(y-3) ---

    # 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| - x^2 = C1
    
    # --- Solution for ODE 2: y*y' = -x*(y+3) ---
    # Separating variables: y/(y+3) dy = -x dx
