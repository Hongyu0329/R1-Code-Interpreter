    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. At steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. This means their derivatives with respect to time, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nLet $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ be the steady-state probability of being in state $i$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set Derivatives to Zero:** I will set $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$ in the given system of differential equations. This transforms the differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  **Formulate the Linear System:** The resulting system of equations, along with the normalization condition $\\sum p_i = 1$, is:\n    *   $-\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3} = 0$\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n    The first four equations are linearly dependent. I will select three of them (e.g., the first, third, and fourth) and use them with the normalization condition to create a solvable system of four linear equations for the four unknown probabilities ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$).\n3.  **Solve using Python:** I will write a Python script that uses the `numpy` library to solve this system of linear equations. This involves setting up a matrix `A` and a vector `b` for the equation $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ and then using `numpy.linalg.solve` to find the probability vector $\\mathbf{p}$.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Once the values for $p_0$ and $p_1$ are determined, I will calculate their sum, $p_0 + p_1$, and print the result in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# These are the transition rates given in the problem\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are zero.\n# Let p_i = P_i(+inf). This gives a system of linear equations.\n# We will use the following four independent equations to solve for p_i:\n# 1.  lambda_01*p0 - lambda_10*p1 = 0\n# 2.  lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 = 0\n# 3.  lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 = 0\n# 4.  p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# This can be written in the matrix form A * p = b, where p = [p0, p1, p2, p3]^T.\n\n# We define the matrix A based on the coefficients of p_i in the equations.\nA = np.array([\n    [lambda_01, -lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# We define the vector b based on the constant terms in the equations.\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# We solve the system A*p = b for the vector of probabilities p.\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0 = p[0]\n    p1 = p[1]\n\n    # The final result is the sum of P0(+inf) and P1(+inf).\n    result = p0 + p1\n\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
