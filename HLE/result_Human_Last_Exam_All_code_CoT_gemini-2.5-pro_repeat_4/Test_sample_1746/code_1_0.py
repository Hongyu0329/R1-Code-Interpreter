    # --- Statement A ---
    # Claim: For any two positive integers x, y: x / y == x // y was true in Python 2 but false in Python 3
    # Py2 Analysis: True. For positive integers, `5 / 2` was integer division (2), same as floor division `5 // 2` (2).
    # Py3 Test:
    a_test_pass = (4 / 2 == 4 // 2)  # 2.0 == 2 is True
    # Because the statement is not false for *any* two positive integers in Python 3, the overall claim is false.
    print("A: False. The claim says the equality is 'false in Python 3', but it's true when x is divisible by y (e.g., 4/2 == 4//2).")

    # --- Statement B ---
    # Claim: The expression 1/2 * 2 equals 1/2 + 1/2 in all Python versions
    # Py2 Analysis: `1/2` is 0. So `0 * 2` (0) equals `0 + 0` (0). This is true.
    # Py3 Test:
    if (1 / 2 * 2) == (1 / 2 + 1 / 2):
        print("B: True. In Python 2, this evaluates to 0 == 0. In Python 3, it's 1.0 == 1.0.")

    # --- Statement C ---
    # Claim: For integers a, b: a / float(b) has always returned same result as float(a) / b
    # Py2/Py3 Analysis: True. In both versions, forcing one operand to be a float promotes the operation to float division.
    print("C: True. Casting either integer operand to a float ensures float division is performed in all versions, yielding the same result.")

    # --- Statement D ---

    d_floor_div = -7 // 3    # Floor division: floor(-2.33...) is -3
    d_int_cast = int(-7 / 3) # True division then truncate: int(-2.33...) is -2
    print(f"D: False. -7 // 3 evaluates to {d_floor_div}, while int(-7 / 3) evaluates to {d_int_cast}.")

    # --- Statement E ---
    # Claim: For any non-zero integers x, y: x / y == float(x) / float(y) in Python 3
    # Py3 Analysis: True. The `/` operator on integers performs "true division" and already returns a float.

    # --- Statement F ---

    # --- Statement G ---

    # --- Statement K ---

    # Py3 Analysis: True. Both expressions `(a/b)/c` and `a/(b*c)` will always produce a float.
    # Py2 Analysis: True. The chain of operations will either stay as integers on both sides or get promoted to floats on both sides.
