    "My plan is to determine which animal from the choices can hear the low-frequency sound of a human muscle twitch.\n\n1.  First, I'll establish the approximate frequency of the sound produced by a human muscle contracting. This is a very low-frequency sound, typically around 25 Hertz (Hz).\n2.  Next, I'll research and define the approximate lower limit of the hearing range for each animal listed in the choices (Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, Human).\n3.  I will then write a Python script that compares the muscle twitch frequency to the lower hearing threshold of each animal.\n4.  The script will print out its analysis for each animal, stating whether its hearing range includes the frequency of a muscle twitch.\n5.  Based on this comparison, the script will identify the most likely animal. While multiple animals might be close, the answer often lies with the animal whose survival is specifically adapted to hearing such sounds. In this case, prey fish like herring have evolved to detect the subtle sounds of predator movements, which includes muscle sounds.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal can hear the low frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
