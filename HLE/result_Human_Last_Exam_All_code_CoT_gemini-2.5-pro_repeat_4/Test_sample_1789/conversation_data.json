    "Answering this question requires concepts from poset theory and number theory.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Poset Theory Interpretation**: The problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset on the set of integers S = {1, 2, ..., N}, where N = 823564528378596.\n    *   A **poset** is a set with a partial order. Here, the set is S, and the order is divisibility (`a | b`).\n    *   An **antichain** is a subset of S where no two distinct elements divide each other.\n    *   By the dual of Dilworth's Theorem, a set is a union of `k` antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length `k+1`. A **chain** is a sequence `c_1, c_2, ..., c_m` where `c_1 | c_2 | ... | c_m`.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the largest subset of S that does not contain a chain of length 21.\n\n2.  **Number Theory Connection**: The length of the longest possible chain ending with an integer `x` is `Ω(x) + 1`, where `Ω(x)` (Omega `x`) is the number of prime factors of `x` counted with multiplicity. For example, for `x=12=2^2*3^1`, `Ω(12)=2+1=3`, and the longest chain ending at 12 is `1 | 2 | 6 | 12` or `1 | 3 | 6 | 12`, both of length 4, which is `Ω(12)+1`.\n    *   A subset of S has no chain of length 21 if and only if for every element `x` in the subset, the longest chain ending at `x` has a length of at most 20.\n    *   This means we must have `Ω(x) + 1 <= 20`, which simplifies to `Ω(x) <= 19`.\n\n3.  **The Computational Problem**: The task is now to count the number of integers `x` in the range `[1, N]` such that `Ω(x) <= 19`.\n\n4.  **Algorithm**: This counting problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.\n    *   Let `dp(x, k, i)` be the number of integers `n <= x` such that `Ω(n) <= k` and their smallest prime factor is greater than or equal to the `i`-th prime, `p_i`.\n    *   We can establish a recurrence relation for `dp(x, k, i)`:\n        `dp(x, k, i) = dp(x, k, i+1) + dp(x / p_i, k-1, i)`\n        The first term counts numbers not divisible by `p_i`. The second term counts numbers that have `p_i` as a factor.\n    *   The final answer is `dp(N, 19, 0)`, where `p_0 = 2`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this recursive solution. Please note that for the given magnitude of N, the computation is very intensive and may take a significant amount of time and memory to complete. Running the script with `PyPy` is recommended for better performance.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's recommended to run this script with PyPy for better performance.\n# The recursion limit is increased to handle deep recursive calls.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(30000)\n\nN = 823564528378596\nK = 19\n\n# The core of the solution is a recursive function (with memoization) to count\n# the numbers with a certain number of prime factors.\n# Let dp(x, k, i) be the number of integers n <= x such that Omega(n) <= k\n# and the smallest prime factor of n is greater than or equal to the i-th prime, p_i.\n# The recurrence relation is:\n# dp(x, k, i) = dp(x, k, i+1)      (counts numbers whose smallest prime factor is > p_i)\n#             + dp(x/p_i, k-1, i) (counts numbers for which p_i is a factor)\n# The base cases for the recursion are:\n# - If k < 0, the count is 0.\n# - If x < 1, there are no numbers to count, so the result is 0.\n# - If the current prime p_i > x, the only integer n <= x that can satisfy the\n#   lpf(n) >= p_i condition is n=1. For n=1, Omega(1)=0, which is <= k. So the count is 1.\n\n# A large number of primes may be needed for the recursion. We pre-compute them\n# up to a reasonable limit.
