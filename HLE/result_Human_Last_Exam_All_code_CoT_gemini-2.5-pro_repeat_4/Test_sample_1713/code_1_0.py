# Define example values that satisfy the condition P = MC < AVC < ATC
# Let's assume the firm is producing 10 units.
q1 = 10

# Let's set the prices and costs according to the problem's condition.
P = 5   # Market Price
AVC = 7 # Average Variable Cost
ATC = 9 # Average Total Cost

# The condition P < AVC < ATC is satisfied (5 < 7 < 9).

# Calculate the area S (Total Revenue)
# S is the area of the rectangle with height P and width q1.
S = P * q1

# Calculate the area T (Total Variable Cost)
# T is the area of the rectangle with height AVC and width q1.
T = AVC * q1

# Calculate the area H (Total Cost)
# H is the area of the rectangle with height ATC and width q1.
H = ATC * q1

# The firm's profit is TR - TC = S - H.
# Since P < ATC, S < H, so the firm is making a loss.
# The area representing the loss is the magnitude of the loss, which is TC - TR = H - S.
loss_area = H - S

# Print the explanation and the final result.
