# This problem is theoretical and requires deriving the answer from the model's logic.
# The code below prints the result of this derivation.

# The problem asks for the set of values for the truthfulness parameter, theta,
# for which firms with more truthful accounts choose more lenient auditors.
# Let's denote the choice of a firm of type theta as x*(theta).
# The condition "more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors" implies
# that x*(theta) is a decreasing function of theta. In our binary case (theta in {0, 1}),
# this means we need x*(1) < x*(0). Since x can only be 0 (lenient) or 1 (strict),
# this requires x*(1) = 0 and x*(0) = 1.

# As derived in the explanation, this sorting occurs if the following condition on the
# model's parameters holds:
# p(1) * (t(0) + F(0)) < t(0)

# The question asks for the set of theta that corresponds to the description
# "companies keeping more truthful accounts [that] choose more lenient auditors".

# When the condition above holds:
# - The more truthful firms (theta=1) are indifferent but can choose the lenient auditor (x=0).
# - The less truthful firms (theta=0) choose the strict auditor (x=1).

# The firm type that is both "more truthful" and "chooses the lenient auditor" is theta=1.
# Therefore, the set of values is {1}.

theta_set = {1}

print("The set of values for theta for which companies keeping more truthful accounts choose more lenient auditors is:")
# The final result is a set containing a single number. We print that number.
for theta in theta_set:
    print(theta)

print("\nThis result holds under the condition that p(1) * (t(0) + F(0)) < t(0), which allows this sorting of firms to occur.")
# The problem asks to output numbers in the "final equation". The derived condition for the phenomenon to occur is an inequality.
# Let's present this condition as the "final equation" context.
print("\nThe final inequality that determines this behavior is:")
print("p(1) * (t(0) + F(0)) - t(0) < 0")
