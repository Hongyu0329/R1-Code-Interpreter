    "To determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality, we need to analyze the text of \"The Chameleon\" and count each instance where an action involving the coat reflects a change in his attitude.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will count the number of times Otchumyelov takes his coat off. This happens when he becomes flustered and fearful that the dog's owner is an important person.\n2.  I will count the number of times he puts his coat back on. This happens when he feels his authority returning as he believes the dog's owner is insignificant.\n3.  I will include the final description where he wraps himself in his coat, which represents his final retreat into his shell of authority.\n4.  The Python script below will add these counts to find the total number of symbolic descriptions.\n\n```python\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described\n    to symbolize his shifting mentality in Chekov's \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # In the story, Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat signals his changing mood.\n\n    # He takes his coat off when he gets nervous and hot, fearing the dog's owner is important.\n    times_coat_off = 2\n\n    # He puts his coat on when he feels a \"draught\" and regains his composure,\n    # believing the owner is a commoner.\n    times_coat_on = 2\n    \n    # In the final scene, he wraps himself in his coat, representing his final disposition.\n    final_wrap_action = 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of symbolic descriptions.\n    total_descriptions = times_coat_off + times_coat_on + final_wrap_action\n\n    print(f\"Based on the analysis of the text, Chekov describes a change related to the coat {total_descriptions} times.\")\n    print(f\"This is calculated from him taking it off {times_coat_off} times, putting it on {times_coat_on} times, and wrapping it around himself {final_wrap_action} time.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {times_coat_off} + {times_coat_on} + {final_wrap_action} = {total_descriptions}\")\n\ncount_coat_descriptions()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
