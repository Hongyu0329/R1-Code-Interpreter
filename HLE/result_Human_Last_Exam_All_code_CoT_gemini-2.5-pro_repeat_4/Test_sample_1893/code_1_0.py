# This script calculates the specific eigenvalue based on the problem's constraints.
# The derivation shows that the problem simplifies to finding the eigenvalues
# of a 2x2 submatrix under a special condition.

# Define the symbolic parameters involved in the submatrix.
M1, mu, MZ = sympy.symbols('M1 mu M_Z')

# Define the 2x2 submatrix derived in the analysis.
submatrix = sympy.Matrix([
    [M1, MZ],
    [MZ, mu]
])

# The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, det(submatrix - lambda*I) = 0.
lmbda = sympy.symbols('lambda')
char_poly = submatrix.charpoly(lmbda)
# The polynomial is: P(lambda) = lambda**2 - (M1 + mu)*lambda + (M1*mu - MZ**2)

# The question asks for an eigenvalue not proportional to M1 or mu.
# This is possible if one eigenvalue is a constant. For that to happen, we can
# adjust the parameters such that the constant term of the polynomial is zero.
# This makes lambda = 0 a root.
# Condition: M1*mu - MZ**2 = 0.
# With this condition, the equation becomes lambda * (lambda - (M1 + mu)) = 0.
# The eigenvalues of the submatrix are 0 and M1 + mu.

# The eigenvalue that is not proportional to M1 or mu is 0.
# The final equation for this eigenvalue is lambda = 0.
final_eigenvalue = 0

# We print the single number that constitutes the solution.
