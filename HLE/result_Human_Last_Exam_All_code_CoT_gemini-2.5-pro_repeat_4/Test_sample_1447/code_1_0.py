    # and Christie's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter" (a delirious man asking for a "fillet of sole"
    # being misheard as talking about his "soul") is a homophone or a pun.
    # The plot hinges on two different words/phrases sounding identical in English.
    # This is a significant translation challenge because homophones are language-specific.
    # A literal translation would lose the pun, making the plot incomprehensible.

    print("The core challenge is translating a plot-critical homophone (a word that sounds the same as another word but has a different meaning).")

        'III': "Changing the setting: Not capable. Simply changing the story's location from England to Japan, for example, does not solve the linguistic problem of the English 'sole'/'soul' pun.",
        'IV': "Making a character a foreigner: Not capable. This explains mispronunciation, but the issue here is a homophone, where the words are pronounced identically by a native speaker.",
        'V': "Adding a pictorial illustration: Not capable. An illustration would likely give away the solution immediately (e.g., by drawing a fish and a soul), spoiling the mystery rather than preserving the clue within the narrative.",
        'VI': "Adding footnotes: Capable. A footnote can explicitly explain the pun to the reader (e.g., 'In English, these two words are pronounced identically...'). This is a common and effective solution."
