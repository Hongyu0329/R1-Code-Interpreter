    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible size (order) for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical theory:** The structure of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a well-studied area of number theory. For quadratic fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, there is a complete classification of all possible torsion subgroups.\n2.  **List possible groups for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** I will consult the known classification results to list all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. According to the work by Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and Najman, the possible torsion structures for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are precisely those that can occur over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as described by Mazur's Theorem), plus two additional non-cyclic groups: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **List the non-cyclic candidates:** The non-cyclic groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n4.  **Calculate and compare orders:** I will write a Python script to compute the order of each of these possible non-cyclic groups. The order of a group $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is simply $m \\times n$.\n5.  **Find the maximum:** The script will then identify and print the largest order from the calculated values.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over Q(sqrt(-3))\n    # states that the possible non-cyclic structures are those that occur over Q, plus two more.\n    # We list these groups as tuples (m, n) representing Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n\n    # 1.
