    print("A. Incorrect. The definition of an 'interactive' proof system is fundamentally based on the idea of communication (interaction) between a verifier and a prover. This statement describes a non-interactive proof system (like NP) and incorrectly claims interaction 'won't work'.")

    print("\nB. Incorrect. The interactive proof for Graph Non-Isomorphism (GNI) is a classic and foundational example used to demonstrate the power of combining randomization and interaction. It is very helpful for understanding the class IP.")

    print("\nC. Incorrect. Quantum entanglement is a powerful tool. The complexity class MIP* (multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers) is famously equal to RE (the class of recursively enumerable languages), meaning such systems can verify answers to problems that are undecidable by normal computers.")

    print("\nD. Correct. This statement accurately describes the fundamental asymmetry in computational power in an interactive proof system. The verifier is required to be efficient (a probabilistic polynomial-time machine), while the prover is assumed to be computationally powerful enough to solve the problem in question. For problems in classes like PSPACE or NEXP, this implies the prover must be capable of computations that take at least exponential time.")

    print("\nE. Incorrect. The first part correctly describes randomized verification. However, the conclusion that 'the exact values significantly affect the class of languages' is false. A key property is that amplification (repeating the protocol) allows us to make the probabilities of error arbitrarily small, meaning the specific initial values (as long as there's a gap between them) do not change the power of the complexity class.")

    print("\nF. Incorrect. Allowing the verifier to interrogate two provers that cannot communicate with each other (Multi-prover Interactive Proofs, or MIP) strictly increases the class of problems that can be verified. We know that MIP = NEXP, which is a larger class than IP = PSPACE.")

    print("\nG. Incorrect. A polynomial-time verifier with a prover and randomization defines the class IP, which was proven to be equal to PSPACE. The class PSPACE contains problems believed to be vastly more difficult than NP problems. Therefore, these systems *can* solve problems much harder than NP.")

    print("\nH. Incorrect. While the general idea is correct, languages in complexity theory are conventionally defined as subsets of binary strings, {0, 1}*, not trinary strings, {0, 1, 2}*.")
    
    print("\nI. Incorrect. This statement attempts to define the class NP using 3-COLORING as an example, but the soundness condition (ii) is wrong. The correct soundness condition is that for any instance z not in the language, the verifier V must reject *for all* possible proofs Ï€.")

    print("\nJ. Incorrect/Misleading. This is a set of highly specific technical definitions for a 'normal form verifier'. While such forms are used in proofs (e.g., for the PCP theorem), the terminology is not standard, and it's easy for such a detailed statement to contain a subtle error (e.g., the field size or the definition of length). Compared to D, which states a core, fundamental concept, this option is less likely to be the intended correct answer in a general context.")
