def solve_mis_complexity():
    """
    This function provides the solution based on the analysis of the randomized greedy MIS algorithm.
    The analysis for the three classes of graphs is as follows:

    1.  Cycles (length n): The graph is 2-regular. The number of vertices is reduced by a constant
        factor in each step in expectation. Detailed analysis shows that the probability of a vertex
        surviving a round is a constant (2/15). This leads to a runtime of Theta(log n).
        This falls into category 9.

    2.  Trees (n vertices, max degree <= 100): The general O(log n) upper bound for bounded-degree
        graphs applies. A lower bound can be shown by considering a deep balanced binary tree,
        where the algorithm takes Omega(log n) steps to clear the levels. The runtime is Theta(log n).
        This falls into category 9.

    3.  General Graphs (n vertices, max degree <= 100): It is a standard result that this algorithm
        runs in O(log n) steps with high probability on any bounded-degree graph. It is also known
        that this is tight, with an Omega(log n) lower bound on certain graphs. The runtime is Theta(log n).
        This falls into category 9.

    Therefore, the three digits d1, d2, d3 are 9, 9, and 9.
