    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the System and Goal:**\n    We are given the state matrix `A`, the input matrix `B`, and the desired eigenvalues (poles).\n    A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n    Poles = [-1 + j, -1 - j]\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    The characteristic polynomial is formed from the desired poles. For poles `p1` and `p2`, the polynomial is `(λ - p1)(λ - p2) = 0`.\n    For `p = -1 ± j`, this is `(λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j)) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Closed-Loop Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    The closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Let `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`. The characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`.\n    This will result in a polynomial whose coefficients are functions of the elements of `F`.\n\n4.  **Solve for F:**\n    By equating the coefficients of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial with the desired one, we get a system of equations.\n    This is a multi-input system (B has 2 columns), which means the solution for `F` is not unique. We have 4 unknowns in `F` but only 2 equations from the polynomial coefficients.\n    To find a solution, we can simplify the problem by setting some elements of `F` to zero. A common approach is to set one row of `F` to zero. Let's set the second row of `F` to zero: `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n    This reduces the problem to solving a system of 2 linear equations for the 2 unknowns `f11` and `f12`.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:**\n    The Python code will perform these steps numerically:\n    *   Define `A` and `B`.\n    *   Set up and solve the system of linear equations for `f11` and `f12`.\n    *   Construct the final `F` matrix.\n    *   Print the resulting `F` and verify the solution by calculating the eigenvalues of `A + BF`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system (A, B)\n    to place the closed-loop poles at desired locations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given system matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1],\n                  [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2],\n                  [1, 0]])\n\n    # Desired eigenvalues (poles)\n    p = np.array([-1 + 1j, -1 - 1j])\n\n    # The desired characteristic polynomial is (s-p1)(s-p2) = s^2 - (p1+p2)s + p1*p2\n    # For p = -1 +- j, the polynomial is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0\n    # The coefficients are [1, 2, 2]\n    desired_coeffs = np.poly(p)\n    # alpha1 is the coefficient of s, alpha0 is the constant term\n    alpha1 = desired_coeffs[1]\n    alpha0 = desired_coeffs[2]\n\n    # The characteristic polynomial of A_cl = A + B*F is s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl) = 0\n    # This gives: s^2 + (1 - f11 - 2*f21 - f12)s + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 + 2*f21*f12 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22) = 0\n    #\n    # Equating coefficients with s^2 + alpha1*s + alpha0 = 0 gives two equations for the four unknowns in F.\n    # The system is underdetermined.
