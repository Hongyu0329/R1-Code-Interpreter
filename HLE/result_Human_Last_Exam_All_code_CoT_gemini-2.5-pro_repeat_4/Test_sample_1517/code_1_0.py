    This function determines the largest value of I_G based on the reasoning outlined.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The value I_G must be a countable cardinal, so its value is at most aleph_0.
    2. We can construct a countably infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological group G
       for which I_G = aleph_0. An example is a direct sum of countably many
       finite groups with a suitable topology, for which it can be shown that
       any discrete subset A is finite.
    3. If A is finite and G is an infinite torsion group, the subgroup <A> is also finite.
    4. The index of a finite subgroup in a countably infinite group is aleph_0.
    5. Since the index is aleph_0 for any discrete set A, the minimum index I_G is aleph_0.
    6. As aleph_0 is an upper bound and is attainable, it is the largest possible value.
