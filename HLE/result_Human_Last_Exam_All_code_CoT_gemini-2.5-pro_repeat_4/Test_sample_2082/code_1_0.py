    Explains the primary mechanism by which magnesium helps lower blood pressure.

    explanation = """
Magnesium helps lower blood pressure primarily through its role as a natural calcium channel blocker. Here's a breakdown of the mechanism:

1.  **Muscle Contraction:** The contraction of smooth muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels requires an influx of calcium ions. When these muscles contract, the blood vessels narrow (vasoconstriction), which increases blood pressure.
2.  **Magnesium's Role:** Magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist. It competes with calcium for entry into the smooth muscle cells.
3.  **Vasodilation:** By blocking the influx of calcium, magnesium promotes the relaxation of these smooth muscles. This causes the blood vessels to widen, a process known as vasodilation.
4.  **Result:** Wider blood vessels offer less resistance to blood flow, which leads to a decrease in overall blood pressure.

Therefore, the most direct mechanism is through vasodilation.
