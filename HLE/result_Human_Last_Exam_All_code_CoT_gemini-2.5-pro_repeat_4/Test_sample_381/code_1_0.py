    # The problem is to find the upper-bound for the matrix norm ||B * Q_{0,M}||_infinity,
    # expressed as a factor of sqrt(N), where N is the number of nodes.

    # Step 1: Relate the infinity-norm to the 2-norm.
    # For any N x N matrix A, the inequality ||A||_infinity <= sqrt(N) * ||A||_2 holds.
    # Applying this to our matrix A = B * Q_{0,M}, we get:
    # ||B * Q_{0,M}||_infinity <= sqrt(N) * ||B * Q_{0,M}||_2
    explanation = "Step 1: Use the norm inequality ||A||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||A||_2.\n"
    explanation += "This gives ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||B * Q_{0,M}||_2.\n\n"

    # Step 2: Argue that ||B * Q_{0,M}||_2 is bounded by a constant.
    # The provided text sets up the framework to prove this. The condition that beta > 0
    # implies that the total perturbation is finite (sum of delta_t < infinity).
    # This, combined with standard results on the ergodicity of products of stochastic
    # matrices (which implies a contraction in the 2-norm when projected by B),
    # allows one to prove that ||B * Q_{0,M}||_2 is bounded by a positive constant
    # that does not depend on M or N. Let's call this constant 'C'.
    explanation += "Step 2: Show that ||B * Q_{0,M}||_2 is bounded by a constant, let's call it C.\n"
    explanation += "This follows from the fact that Q_{0,M} is a small perturbation of a product of contracting matrices.\n\n"

    # Step 3: Combine results and conclude.
    # Substituting the result from Step 2 into the inequality from Step 1 gives:
    # ||B * Q_{0,M}||_infinity <= C * sqrt(N)
    explanation += "Step 3: Combining these steps, we get the upper bound: ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= C * sqrt(N).\n\n"

    # Step 4: Final Answer
    # The question asks for the upper bound "expressed as a factor of sqrt(N)".
    # Based on our derived inequality, this factor is the constant C.
    # Since C's value cannot be computed from the given text, we represent it symbolically.
    explanation += "The question asks for the factor that multiplies sqrt(N). This factor is C."

    print(explanation)

    # The final answer is the symbolic constant C.
    final_factor = "C"
