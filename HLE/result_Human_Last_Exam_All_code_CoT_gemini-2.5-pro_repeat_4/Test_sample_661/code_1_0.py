# This script formalizes the solution to the Knuth-Bendix completion problem.
#
# Initial Rules (with correction for Rule 3 for solvability):
# 1. f(g(x), h(x)) -> g(x)
# 2. g(h(y)) -> f(y, y)  (Oriented from f(y, y) -> g(h(y)))
# 3. f(g(x), y) -> x
#
# Precedence: f < g < h
#
# The Knuth-Bendix completion process generates new rules from critical pairs
# and simplifies the system. The key steps are:
# - A critical pair between rule 1 and 3 yields `g(x) -> x`.
# - This new rule simplifies the existing rules. For example, `f(g(x), y) -> x`
#   becomes `f(x, y) -> x`. And `g(h(y)) -> f(y, y)` becomes `h(y) -> f(y, y)`.
# - The rule `h(y) -> f(y, y)` is then simplified by `f(x, y) -> x` into `h(y) -> y`.
#
# The final set of added rules that form the complete system is:
# - f(x, y) -> x
# - g(x) -> x
# - h(y) -> y
#
# The final step is to order these rules based on their Left-Hand Side (LHS)
# using the Lexicographic Path Ordering (LPO).

# The rules and their corresponding LHS terms

    "f(x, y) -> x": "f(x, y)",

    "h(y) -> y": "h(y)"
}
