    Calculates the limit by summing the number of solutions for the simplified equation.
    
    The limit is given by L = lim_{N->inf} p(N)/N.
    As explained in the plan, the contributions to this limit are non-zero only when the
    coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f are all zero. In this case, the equation
    becomes F_n = -g.

    The limit L is the sum of the number of solutions (k_g) to F_n = -g for each g in [-25, 25].
    Let V = -g. Since F_n >= 0, we only need to consider V in [0, 25].
    The code calculates the sum of k_g for g from -25 to 0, which is equivalent to
    summing the number of solutions to F_n = V for V from 0 to 25.
