    "To find the next number in the sequence, let's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\nLet the sequence be denoted by `a_n`.\nThe sequence is: `a_1=2`, `a_2=11`, `a_3=23`, `a_4=51`, `a_5=119`.\n\nLet's see if we can find a pattern of the form `a_{n+1} = 3 * a_n - s_n`.\n*   For n=2: `a_3 = 23`. `3 * a_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we subtract 10. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`.\n*   For n=3: `a_4 = 51`. `3 * a_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we subtract 18. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`.\n*   For n=4: `a_5 = 119`. `3 * a_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we subtract 34. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`.\n\nThe sequence of numbers being subtracted is 10, 18, 34. Let's find the pattern in this new sequence.\n*   The difference between 18 and 10 is `18 - 10 = 8`.\n*   The difference between 34 and 18 is `34 - 18 = 16`.\n\nThe differences are 8 (which is 2^3) and 16 (which is 2^4). This suggests the next difference should be 32 (which is 2^5).\nSo, the next number to be subtracted is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\nUsing this, we can calculate the next term in the original sequence (`a_6`):\n`a_6 = 3 * a_5 - 66 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate these steps.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the sequence to find the pattern and calculates the next number.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(f\"The given sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, seq))}, ...\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's analyze the pattern.
