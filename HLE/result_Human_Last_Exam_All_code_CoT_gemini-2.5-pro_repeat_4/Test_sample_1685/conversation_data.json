    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large $x$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large $x$**: The given ODE is:\n    $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n    As $x \\to \\infty$, we analyze each term:\n    *   The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2 + 2}$ approaches zero, provided $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. We will verify this assumption later.\n    *   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is oscillatory and bounded (except where $\\tan(x) = -1$). When seeking a smooth, leading-order asymptotic behavior, such oscillating terms are typically subdominant compared to power-law terms.\n    *   Therefore, for large $x$, the ODE can be approximated by its dominant terms: $y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$.\n\n2.  **Propose a solution form**: We assume a power-law solution, which is a common approach for finding asymptotic behavior. Let's assume the solution is of the form:\n    $y(x) = A x^n$\n    Then its derivatives are:\n    $y'(x) = A n x^{n-1}$\n    $y''(x) = A n (n-1) x^{n-2}$\n    $y'''(x) = A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}$\n\n3.  **Substitute and find the dominant balance**: Substituting these into the simplified ODE gives:\n    $A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (A n x^{n-1})^4$\n    $A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n    To find a valid solution for large $x$, we need to balance the terms with the highest power of $x$. We compare the exponents: $n-3$, $4n$, and $4n-4$.\n    *   If we balance the two terms on the right, $4n = 4n-4$, this is impossible.\n    *   The only consistent non-trivial balance is achieved when the power on the left-hand side matches the leading power on the right-hand side. For large $x$, $x^{4n}$ dominates $x^{4n-4}$. Thus, we balance $n-3$ with $4n$:\n        $n - 3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n    *   With $n=-1$, the powers are $x^{-4}$ (from $y'''$ and $y^4$) and $x^{-8}$ (from $y'^4$). For large $x$, the $x^{-4}$ terms are dominant, so our balance is consistent.\n\n4.  **Solve for the coefficient A**: Now that we have $n=-1$, we can solve for the coefficient $A$ by equating the coefficients of the dominant $x^{-4}$ terms:\n    $A n (n-1) (n-2) = A^4$\n    Substituting $n=-1$:\n    $A(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = A^4$\n    $A(-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n    $-6A = A^4$\n    Assuming a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we can divide by $A$:\n    $A^3 = -6$\n    $A = -\\sqrt[3]{6}$\n\n5.  **Verify the assumptions**: Our assumed solution is $y(x) \\approx -\\sqrt[3]{6} x^{-1}$. Let's check the term we neglected, $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$. With our solution, $y'' = 2A x^{-3}$. The term becomes $\\frac{2A x^{-3}}{3x^2+2} \\approx \\frac{2A}{3}x^{-5}$. Since this term decays faster than the dominant $x^{-4}$ terms, our assumption to neglect it was valid.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expression**: We need to calculate the numerical value of $A$ and round it to two decimal places.\n    $A = -\\sqrt[3]{6} \\approx -1.81712...$\n    Rounding to two decimal places gives $A \\approx -1.82$.\n    The approximate solution is $y(x) = -1.82 x^{-1}$. The initial conditions at $x=0$ do not affect the leading-order asymptotic behavior at $x \\to \\infty$, as the solution is typically drawn towards an \"attractor\" behavior.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the coefficient and prints the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the asymptotic analysis of the ODE for large x, the solution\n# takes the form y(x) = A * x^n.\n# The analysis yields n = -1 and an equation for A, which is A^3 = -6.\n\n# 1. Define the equation for the coefficient A.\nA_cubed = -6.0\n\n# 2. Solve for A by calculating the real cube root of -6.\n# The sign of A will be negative.\nA = math.copysign(pow(abs(A_cubed), 1.0/3.0), A_cubed)\n\n# 3. Round the value of A to two decimal places as requested.\nA_rounded = round(A, 2)\n\n# 4. The power n was determined to be -1 from the dominant balance.\nn = -1\n\n# 5. Construct and print the final analytical expression.\n# The format y(x) = C * x^(n) explicitly shows both numbers in the equation.\nprint(f\"y(x) = {A_rounded} * x^({n})\")\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 * x^(-1)>>>"
