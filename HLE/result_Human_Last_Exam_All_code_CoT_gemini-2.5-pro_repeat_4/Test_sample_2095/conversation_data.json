    "My plan is to find the exact evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems from Liu Ban's writings. This information is famously recorded in Liu Ban's work, *Zhongshan Shihua* (中山诗话). I will retrieve the original Chinese text of this evaluation. The evaluation is nuanced, starting with a critique of the poems' style as being more \"artless\" than \"skillful,\" but concluding with high praise for their emotional power and realism, to the point of being able to \"make ghosts and spirits weep.\" To fulfill the user's request for a code block, I will present this complete answer, including the original quote and a modern Chinese explanation, within a Python `print` statement.\n\n```python\ndef liu_ban_evaluation_of_zhang_ji():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems.\n    The evaluation is sourced from Liu Ban's \"Zhongshan Shihua\" (中山诗话).\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_text = \"\"\"\n根据北宋学者刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的记载，他对唐代诗人张籍的七言诗的准确评价原文是：\n\n“张籍七言诗，拙多于巧，然吾常爱其‘海人无家海里住，采珠役象为岁赋。恶波横天山塞路，未央宫中常满库’之句，状其事，切其情，可以泣鬼神矣。”\n\n这段评价的含义可以理解为：\n刘攽首先指出，张籍的七言诗在艺术技巧上显得朴实甚至有些笨拙，而非华丽取巧（“拙多于巧”）。\n然而，他紧接着表达了极高的赞赏，认为这些诗歌的真正价值在于其能够深刻、真切地描绘事件、抒发情感（“状其事，切其情”），其艺术感染力强大到足以感动天地鬼神（“可以泣鬼神矣”）。他还引用了具体的诗句作为例证，来支持自己的观点。\n\"\"\"\n    print(evaluation_text)\n\nliu_ban_evaluation_of_zhang_ji()\n```\n<<<张籍七言诗，拙多于巧，然吾常爱其‘海人无家海里住，采珠役象为岁赋。恶波横天山塞路，未央宫中常满库’之句，状其事，切其情，可以泣鬼神矣。>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was Liu Ban's (刘攽) exact evaluation of Zhang Ji’s (张籍) seven-character poems (七言诗)?
