# This script is designed to provide the solution to the user's question about the value of n.
# Based on the reasoning from representation theory of algebras, the problem's conditions
# constrain the homological properties of the functor F.
#
# The key steps in the reasoning are:
# 1. The existence of the exact functor f^k from a category of finite global dimension implies
#    that the functor F must have finite projective dimension.
# 2. The property of F being a "tame functor" suggests it's a regular module, which for most
#    tame algebras has infinite projective dimension.
# 3. This conflict restricts the context to tame algebras of finite global dimension (e.g., canonical algebras).
# 4. For such algebras, the indecomposable modules that characterize tameness (those in homogeneous tubes)
#    have a projective dimension of exactly 2.
# 5. Therefore, interpreting "n-resolvable" as having a projective dimension of n, we conclude n=2.

n = 2

# The problem asks for the value of n.
# The final equation is n = 2.
# We will print the number in the final equation as requested.
