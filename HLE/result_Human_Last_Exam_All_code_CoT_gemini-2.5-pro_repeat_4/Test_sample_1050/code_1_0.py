    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze constraints and find the number of safe columns.
    # There are `num_monsters` monsters in total. Each column has at most one monster.
    # This means `num_monsters` columns are "unsafe" because they each contain one monster.

    num_safe_columns = num_cols - num_unsafe_columns

    # Step 5 & 6: Formulate the guaranteed strategy and calculate attempts.
    # A guaranteed strategy must work against the worst-case placement of monsters.
    # To guarantee a safe path, Turbo must find the single safe column.

    # A failed attempt occurs when Turbo hits a monster. The attempt ends, but he learns
    # the location of that one monster. So, each failed attempt reveals one monster's location.
    #
    # In the worst-case scenario, Turbo must find all the monsters to identify the safe
    # column by a process of elimination. For example, the adversary could always place a
    # monster in the column Turbo chooses to test, until all unsafe columns have been tested.
    #
    # Number of failed attempts needed to find all monsters = num_monsters
