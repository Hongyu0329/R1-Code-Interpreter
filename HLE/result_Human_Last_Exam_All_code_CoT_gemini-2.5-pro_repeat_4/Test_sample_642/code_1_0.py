# The problem asks for the limit of the difference in state complexity
# for a Turing machine recognizing the language L_k = {w in {0,1}* : |w|_1 = 0 (mod k)}.
# Let f(k) be the minimum number of states for such a Turing machine.

# Step 1: Establish the complexity f(k).
# A standard construction for a Turing machine to solve this problem involves
# counting the number of 1s and checking for divisibility by k.
# The most direct method for checking divisibility by k using a finite state machine
# requires keeping track of the remainder modulo k. This requires k distinct states,
# one for each possible remainder (0, 1, ..., k-1).
# Therefore, the number of states required is at least k. So, f(k) >= k.

# An upper bound can also be established. A TM can simulate a k-state DFA,
# or it can count the 1s in binary on its tape and then perform long division by k.
# This division also requires k states to store the running remainder.
# This gives f(k) <= k + C, where C is a small constant for other control states.

# Combining these, the state complexity f(k) is tightly bound by k.
# For the purpose of the limit, we can approximate f(k) as being equal to k,
# or more formally as f(k) = k + d(k) where d(k) is a slow-growing or constant term.
# f(k) = k

# Step 2: Define the expression to be calculated.
# We need to compute the limit of f(k+1) - f(k) as k -> infinity.

# Step 3: Substitute f(k) into the expression.
# If f(k) = k, then f(k+1) = k + 1.
# The difference is f(k+1) - f(k) = (k + 1) - k = 1.

k_plus_1_f = "k+1"
k_f = "k"
difference = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the limit.
# The limit of a constant is the constant itself.
# lim_{k->inf} (1) = 1
limit_result = 1

# Print the components of the final equation
print(f"Based on the analysis, the state complexity function f(k) can be tightly approximated by k.")
print(f"So, we have f(k+1) = {k_plus_1_f} and f(k) = {k_f}.")
print(f"The difference is f(k+1) - f(k) = ({k_plus_1_f}) - ({k_f}) = {difference}.")
print(f"The limit of this difference as k approaches infinity is:")
print(f"lim_{{k->inf}} ({difference}) = {limit_result}")
