    "My approach is to identify the underlying pattern in the sequence.\n\n### Pattern Analysis\n\n1.  **Decomposition**: I'll break down the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` into logical parts.\n2.  **Part 1: The Sweep**: The sequence begins with `3, 2, 1, 2, 3`. This is a clear \"sweep\" pattern, moving from 3 down to 1 and then back up to 3. Let's call this `Sweep(3)`.\n3.  **Part 2: The Repeats**: The sweep is followed by `3, 3, 3` and then `2, 2`.\n    *   `3, 3, 3`: This is the number 3, repeated 3 times.\n    *   `2, 2`: This is the number 2, repeated 2 times.\n    This suggests a pattern of `k` repetitions of the number `k`, in descending order (from `k=3` down to `k=2`). This concludes the first phase or \"Stage 3\" of the sequence.\n4.  **Part 3: The Next Stage**: After the `Repeats(2)` block (`2, 2`), Stage 3 is complete. The pattern suggests that a new stage, \"Stage 2\", begins.\n    *   The last stage was Stage 3. The new stage is Stage 2.\n    *   A new stage should start with a sweep. The sweep starts at the new stage number, `2`.\n    *   It sweeps down to 1, and then back up. Where does it sweep up to? A logical continuation is for it to sweep up to the previous stage number, which was `3`.\n    *   This creates a new sweep: `2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.\n5.  **Prediction**: The next four elements are therefore the numbers generated by this new sweep: `2, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\nThe python code will first define the known sequence and the predicted next four elements based on the logic above. Then, it will print the original sequence followed by the next four elements to show the complete pattern.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle by identifying and extending the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n    \n    # The pattern is determined to be:\n    # 1. A sweep from 3 down to 1 and back to 3: 3, 2, 1, 2, 3\n    # 2. A block of three 3s: 3, 3, 3\n    # 3. A block of two 2s: 2, 2\n    # This concludes \"Stage 3\". The next stage, \"Stage 2\", begins.\n    # 4. The next part is a sweep starting from 2, going down to 1, and then up to the previous stage number (3): 2, 1, 2, 3\n    \n    next_elements = [2, 1, 2, 3]\n    \n    full_sequence = initial_sequence + next_elements\n    \n    print(\"The initial sequence is: \", end=\"\")\n    print(*initial_sequence, sep=' ')\n    \n    print(\"The pattern continues with a new sweep (2 -> 1 -> 3).\")\n    \n    print(\"The next 4 elements are: \", end=\"\")\n    print(*next_elements, sep=' ')\n    \n    print(\"The completed sequence is: \", end=\"\")\n    print(*full_sequence, sep=' ')\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
