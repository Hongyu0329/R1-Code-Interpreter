    "To determine the number of moves in which White can win from the given position, assuming optimal play, we need to find the shortest forced checkmate sequence. This is a complex tactical problem that is best solved using a chess engine.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the environment**: Use the `python-chess` library to represent the chessboard and interact with a chess engine.\n2.  **Load the position**: The provided FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` will be loaded onto the board.\n3.  **Use a chess engine**: I will use the powerful Stockfish engine to analyze the position. The engine will calculate the best sequence of moves for both sides.\n4.  **Find the forced mate**: The engine will report if there is a forced checkmate and, if so, in how many moves. This is often denoted as \"mate in N\".\n5.  **Display the solution**: The script will print the number of moves for White to win and also display the principal variation (the sequence of moves that leads to the checkmate). The sequence of moves fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" by showing the numbered moves in the winning line.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan. You will need to have `python-chess` installed (`pip install python-chess`) and have the Stockfish engine executable available on your system. Please update the `STOCKFISH_PATH` variable in the script to point to your Stockfish executable file.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.engine\nimport sys\nimport os\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a chess position to find a forced mate.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Configuration ---\n    # IMPORTANT: Update this path to your Stockfish executable.\n    # On Windows, it might be r\"C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Downloads\\stockfish\\stockfish.exe\"\n    # On Linux/macOS, it might be \"/usr/games/stockfish\" or a local path like \"./stockfish\"\n    # We will try to find a common path, but you may need to change it.\n    \n    # List of potential paths for the Stockfish engine\n    potential_paths = [\n        # For Linux/macOS in common locations\n        \"/usr/games/stockfish\",\n        \"/usr/local/bin/stockfish\",\n        # For local directory (e.g., if you downloaded it to the same folder)\n        \"stockfish\",\n        \"stockfish.exe\" \n    ]\n    \n    STOCKFISH_PATH = None\n    for path in potential_paths:\n        if os.path.exists(path) and os.access(path, os.X_OK):\n            STOCKFISH_PATH = path\n            break\n\n    if STOCKFISH_PATH is None:\n        print(\"---\")\n        print(\"Error: Stockfish engine not found or is not executable.\")\n        print(\"Please download the Stockfish chess engine, place it in this script's directory,\")\n        print(\"or update the `potential_paths` list with the correct path to your stockfish executable.\")\n        print(\"---\")\n        return\n\n    # FEN for the specified chess position\n    fen = \"4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\"\n\n    try:\n        engine = chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(STOCKFISH_PATH)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to start the engine.
