    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** I will first identify the key constraints from the problem statement. The graph $G$ has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\n2.  **Recall Graph Theory Principles:** I will use a fundamental theorem about graph colouring. A well-known result states that the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of any graph $G$ is at most $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree. Brooks's Theorem refines this, stating that for a connected graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** I will prove that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$. The proof relies on the fact that a non-complete graph must have at least one vertex with a degree less than or equal to $n-2$. A greedy coloring algorithm with a specific vertex ordering can then color the graph with at most $n-1$ colors.\n\n4.  **Construct an Example:** To show that this upper bound of $n-1$ is achievable, I will describe a specific graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete and requires exactly $n-1$ colors. A simple example is a graph consisting of a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and one additional isolated vertex.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Code:** Combining the upper bound and the constructive example, I will conclude that the maximum number of colors is exactly $n-1$. I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and calculate the final answer for $n=12345$, printing the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colours needed to properly colour a graph\n    with 12345 vertices, given that it is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # The problem asks for the maximum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring\n    # of a graph G with 'num_vertices', given that G is not a complete graph.\n    # This value is the maximum possible chromatic number, chi(G), for any such graph.\n\n    # A key theorem in graph theory provides an upper bound for the chromatic number of a non-complete graph.\n    # Theorem: If a graph G on n vertices is not a complete graph, then chi(G) <= n - 1.\n    \n    # Proof sketch:\n    # Since G is not a complete graph, there must be at least one vertex, v, that is not\n    # connected to all other n-1 vertices. Thus, the degree of v is at most n-2.\n    # We can use a greedy colouring algorithm and order the vertices such that v is coloured last.\n    # When colouring v, its neighbours (at most n-2 of them) have already been coloured.\n    # These neighbours use at most n-2 distinct colours. So, from a palette of n-1 colours,\n    # there is guaranteed to be at least one colour available for v.\n    # This proves that any non-complete graph on n vertices can be coloured with at most n-1 colours.\n\n    # So, for n = 12345, the maximum number of colours is at most n - 1.\n    max_colors_upper_bound = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # To show that this maximum is achievable, we need to find an example of a graph that\n    # satisfies the conditions and requires exactly n - 1 colours.\n    # Consider a graph G constructed as the union of two disjoint components:\n    # 1. A complete graph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1}).\n    # 2.
