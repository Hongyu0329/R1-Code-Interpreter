    "To find the small molecules that interact with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install necessary library**: The code will require the `chembl_webresource_client` library to interact with the ChEMBL database. I will include a comment in the code on how to install it.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will use the client to establish a connection to the ChEMBL database API.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: I will query the 'activity' endpoint of the ChEMBL database. This endpoint contains information about bioactivity assays, linking molecules (ligands) to targets. I will filter the results specifically for the target ChEMBL ID `CHEMBL4803817`.\n4.  **Extract Molecule IDs**: From the query results, I will parse each activity entry to extract the ChEMBL ID of the interacting molecule, which is stored under the `molecule_chembl_id` key.\n5.  **List Unique Molecules**: To avoid duplicates, as a single molecule might be tested in multiple assays, I will collect all unique molecule IDs.\n6.  **Print the Results**: Finally, the script will print the list of unique ChEMBL IDs for the small molecules found to interact with the specified target.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the ChEMBL webresource client.\n# You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that have recorded interactions\n    with a given target ChEMBL ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Get the activity client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n        # Search for activities related to the target\n        print(f\"Querying ChEMBL for molecules interacting with {target_chembl_id}...\")\n        res = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id)\n\n        if not res:\n            print(f\"No interacting molecules found for {target_chembl_id}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Use a set to store unique molecule IDs\n        molecule_ids = set()\n        for r in res:\n            # We only care about entries that have a molecule ID\n            if r['molecule_chembl_id']:\n                molecule_ids.add(r['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        if molecule_ids:\n            print(f\"\\nFound {len(molecule_ids)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_chembl_id}:\")\n            # Print each molecule ID\n            for mol_id in sorted(list(molecule_ids)):\n                print(mol_id)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Found activity entries, but no associated molecule ChEMBL IDs for {target_chembl_id}.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have an internet connection and the chembl_webresource_client is installed correctly.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_id)\n```"
