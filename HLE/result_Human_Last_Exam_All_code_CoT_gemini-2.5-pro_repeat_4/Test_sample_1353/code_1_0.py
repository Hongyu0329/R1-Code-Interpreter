    # Part a: Determine the bi-degree of the terminal polynomial.
    # A string starter P with bi-degree (a, b) = (4, 3) is a lowest weight vector.
    # The sl(2) weight is w = b - a = 3 - 4 = -1.
    # For a finite-dimensional representation, the lowest weight is -k and the highest is k.
    # Thus, k = 1.
    # The string is generated by applying the E operator k=1 time.
    # The terminal polynomial is E*P.
    # E changes bi-degree (a, b) to (a-1, b+1).
    # So the terminal bi-degree is (4-1, 3+1) = (3, 4).
    answer_a = "(3, 4)"

    # Part b: Provide the condition for a valid string starter.
    # This assumes a specific construction of string starters by applying
    # b operators (indexed by r_1, ..., r_b) to a base polynomial,
    # typically the Vandermonde determinant Delta_n(X) which has bi-degree (C(n,2), 0).
    # If each operator changes the bi-degree by (-r_i, +1), the final x-degree 'a' is
    # a = C(n,2) - sum(r_i).
    # Rearranging gives the condition.
    answer_b = "a + \\sum_{i=1}^{b} r_i = C(n, 2)"

    # Part c: Check if a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) can be constructed.
    # To get a y-degree of 2, we apply two operators. Using the given indices r=1 and r=2,
    # the change in x-degree is -1-2 = -3.
    # If we start with a polynomial of bi-degree (a_0, 0), the result has bi-degree (a_0 - 3, 2).
    # We want this to be (5, 2), so a_0 - 3 = 5 => a_0 = 8.
    # A polynomial in DH_n of bi-degree (8, 0) exists if n is large enough
    # (e.g., for n=5, max x-degree is C(5,2)=10). Thus, it is possible.
