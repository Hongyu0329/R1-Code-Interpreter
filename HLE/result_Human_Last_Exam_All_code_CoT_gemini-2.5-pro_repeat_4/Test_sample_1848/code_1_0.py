    # The problem asks for the largest cardinality of a collection A of sets with specific properties.
    # The universe is the set corresponding to the cardinal omega_4.
    # Each set in A has cardinality omega_4.
    # The intersection of any two distinct sets in A has cardinality less than omega_4.
    # We are given that 2^(omega_3) = omega_4.

    # Lower Bound:
    # A theorem by Tarski states that for an infinite cardinal lambda, there exists a family
    # of 2^lambda subsets of lambda^+ (the successor of lambda), each of size lambda^+,
    # such that the intersection of any two has size at most lambda.
    # Let lambda = omega_3. Then lambda^+ = omega_4.
    # The theorem guarantees a family of size 2^(omega_3) exists.
    # Given 2^(omega_3) = omega_4, a family of size omega_4 exists.
    
    # Upper Bound:
    # Assume a family A of size omega_4^+ exists.
    # By the Delta-system lemma, since omega_4 is regular, there must be a
    # Delta-system A' subset of A of size omega_4^+ with some root R.
    # The size of the root |R| must be less than omega_4.
    # The family {a \ R for a in A'} consists of omega_4^+ disjoint sets,
    # each of size omega_4.
    # Their union is a subset of omega_4 but has size omega_4^+ * omega_4 = omega_4^+,
    # which is a contradiction.
    # Therefore, the size of A cannot exceed omega_4.

    # Conclusion:
    # The lower bound and upper bound both point to omega_4.
