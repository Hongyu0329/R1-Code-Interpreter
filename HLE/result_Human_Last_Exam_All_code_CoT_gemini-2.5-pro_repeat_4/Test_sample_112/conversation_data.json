    "This is a knowledge-based question rather than a computational one. My plan is to find the correct answer through my knowledge base and then present it using a simple Python script as requested by the prompt. The script will store the answer in a variable and then print it in a full sentence to provide context.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_of_manners():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the literary question about Sir Launfal.\n  The poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell was a common text\n  in American schools. In a popular edition from the Riverside Literature Series,\n  it was frequently bound with several of Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays,\n  including his essay \"Behavior,\" which served as a text on manners and conduct.\n  \"\"\"\n  book_of_manners = \"Emerson's 'Behavior'\"\n  preserved_alongside = \"Sir Launfal\"\n  \n  print(f\"The poem '{preserved_alongside}' was preserved alongside the book of manners known as {book_of_manners}.\")\n\nfind_book_of_manners()\n```\n<<<Emerson's 'Behavior'>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What book of manners was Sir Launfal preserved alongside?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
