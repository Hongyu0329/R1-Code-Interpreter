# The squared L2 norm of the horizontal derivative of the density, ||∂_x ρ(t)||^2,
# is found to decay algebraically with time t.
# The decay is estimated by analyzing the behavior of Fourier modes.
# For small wavenumbers k, the decay rate λ_k of a mode is proportional to k^2.
# The squared norm is given by the sum (or integral) of k^2 * exp(-2*λ_k*t).
# I(t) ≈ ∫ k^2 * exp(-c*k^2*t) dk from 0 to ∞.

# Let's perform a change of variables: s = k * sqrt(t)
# Then k = s / sqrt(t), and dk = ds / sqrt(t).
# The integral becomes:
# I(t) ≈ ∫ (s^2/t) * exp(-c*s^2) * (ds/√t)
# I(t) ≈ t^(-3/2) * ∫ s^2 * exp(-c*s^2) ds
# The integral with respect to s is a constant.
# So, ||∂_x ρ(t)||^2 decays as t^(-3/2).

# The decay rate for the norm ||∂_x ρ(t)|| is the square root of the decay rate for the squared norm.

# We are asked for the decay rate, which is the exponent of t.
# The final result is the exponent.
