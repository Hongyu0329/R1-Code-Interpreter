    "This problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3. A category with a single object is defined entirely by its set of morphisms and their composition rules. This structure is precisely what defines a monoid.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this programmatically:\n1.  A category with one object requires an identity morphism. So, our three morphisms are `id`, `f`, and `g`. For simplicity, we can represent these as integers `0`, `1`, and `2`, where `0` is the identity element.\n2.  The structure of the category is determined by the composition of these morphisms. This can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (a Cayley table).\n3.  Since `0` is the identity, the first row and first column of the table are fixed: `0*x = x` and `x*0 = x`. This leaves the 2x2 sub-table for the composition of `f` and `g` to be determined. The compositions `f*f`, `f*g`, `g*f`, and `g*g` must each result in one of `{id, f, g}` (or `{0, 1, 2}`).\n4.  There are `3^4 = 81` possible ways to define this 2x2 sub-table.\n5.  We will iterate through all 81 possibilities and check each one for the associative property: `(a*b)*c = a*(b*c)` for all `a, b, c`.\n6.  The valid, associative tables represent all possible categories of this type. However, we need to count them \"up to isomorphism\". An isomorphism here means we can relabel `f` and `g` and get the same structure.\n7.  To handle isomorphisms, for each valid category (table), we will also generate its \"swapped\" version (where `f` and `g` are interchanged). We then define a \"canonical representation\" for the isomorphism class, for example, by choosing the lexicographically smaller of the two tables.\n8.  By storing these unique canonical representations in a set, we can count the number of distinct isomorphism classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]  # 0 is the identity element\n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # The compositions 1*1, 1*2, 2*1, 2*2 can each be 0, 1, or 2.\n    # This gives 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables.\n    possible_compositions = itertools.product(elements, repeat=4)\n\n    for comps in possible_compositions:\n        ff, fg, gf, gg = comps\n        \n        # Build the 3x3 Cayley table for the monoid\n        # 0 is the identity, so the first row and column are fixed.\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, ff, fg],\n            [2, gf, gg]\n        ]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (a*b)*c == a*(b*c)\n        is_associative = True\n        for a in elements:\n            for b in elements:\n                for c in elements:\n                    # Look up compositions in the table\n                    ab_comp = table[a][b]\n                    bc_comp = table[b][c]\n                    \n                    lhs = table[ab_comp][c]\n                    rhs = table[a][bc_comp]\n\n                    if lhs != rhs:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            # Found a valid monoid.
