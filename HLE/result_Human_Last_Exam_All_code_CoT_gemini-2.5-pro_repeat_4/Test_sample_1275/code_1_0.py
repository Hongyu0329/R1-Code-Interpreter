    # Part A: Must every geodesic word representing an element in α(K) be fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    #
    # No. Consider the free group G = F_2 = <a, b> and the rational set K = {a^n}.
    # The word w = b^m a^n b^{-m} is a geodesic representing an element in α(K).
    # A cyclic permutation of w, such as w' = (a^n b^{-m}) b^m = a^n, corresponds to a geodesic path.
    # However, another cyclic permutation, corresponding to the element g' = b a^n b^{-1}, may not have a geodesic path.
    # For instance, the word s*p where w=p*s, p=b, s=b^{m-1}a^nb^{-m} is s*p = b^{m-1}a^nb^{-m}b.
    # The path for this word has length (m-1)+n+m+1 = 2m+n. The element is g' = b^{m-1}a^nb^{-(m-1)},
    # which has length 2(m-1)+n. The ratio of path length to geodesic distance (2m+n)/(2m-2+n) approaches 1,
    # but for other cyclic permutations (e.g. p=b^{m-1}), the path is not a quasigeodesic.
    # Let w = b^m a^n b^{-m}. p = b^{m-1}. s = b a^n b^{-m}.
    # The path for sp has length |s|+|p| = (1+n+m) + (m-1) = 2m+n.
    # The element is p^{-1}wp = b^{-(m-1)} (b^m a^n b^{-m}) b^{m-1} = b a^n b^{-1}.
    # The length of this element is 1+n+1 = n+2.
    # The path length 2m+n is not bounded by λ(n+2)+ε for fixed λ, ε as m grows.
    # So, w is not fully quasireduced.
    answer_A = "No"

    # Part B: Is there a finite bound for ε such that a fully (1, ε)-quasireduced word
    # in α(K) exists for a rational K? If so, state the bound in terms of δ and R; otherwise, state 'No'.
    #
    # Yes. For any hyperbolic element g, its conjugacy class contains a cyclically minimal element g_0.
    # Any geodesic word for g_0 is fully quasireduced. A standard result states that such a geodesic
    # is a (1, ε)-quasigeodesic for ε related to the hyperbolicity constant δ.
    # The bound is 8*δ. The constant R is not needed for this particular bound.
    bound_constant_B = 8
    answer_B = f"{bound_constant_B}*delta"

    # Part C: Is it true that α(K) contains only quasigeodesic words if K is context-free?
    #
    # No. This can be interpreted as asking if all elements in α(K) are hyperbolic (of infinite order).
    # Consider a hyperbolic group with torsion, e.g., G = Z * Z_2.
    # Let K = G. The set of all words in the generators for G is regular, hence context-free.
    # Then α(K) = α(G) = G.
    # The group G contains an element of order 2 (the generator of Z_2).
    # Elements of finite order are not hyperbolic. Thus, α(K) contains non-quasigeodesic elements.
