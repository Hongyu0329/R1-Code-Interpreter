    """
    Solves the topology problem by constructing a counterexample.

    The problem asks for the largest number of components X \ C can have, where:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (continuum).
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a component of X \ A.

    A naive application of a theorem from topology would suggest the answer is 1,
    as the theorem states that X \ C should be connected. However, this theorem
    has known counterexamples, as its proof contains a subtle flaw.

    We can construct a counterexample in the plane R^2 to find the maximum number.

    # 1. Define the parameters of the problem.
    # The cardinality of the continuum is denoted by 'c'.
    c = "c (the cardinality of the continuum)"

    # 2. Describe the construction of the space X.
    # Let P be the Cantor set on [1, 2], with |P| = c.
    # Let X be the union of the following sets in R^2:
    # - K_0 = [-1, 0] x {0}
    # - K_t = {1/t} x [0, 1] for each t in P
    # X = K_0 U (union_{t in P} K_t)
    # This space X is connected, T1, and has cardinality c.

    # 3. Define the connected subset A.
    # Let A = {(0, 0)}. This is a single point and is connected.

    # 4. Identify the components of X \ A.
    # The components of X \ A are:
    # - C' = K_0 \ {(0,0)} = [-1, 0) x {0}
    # - K_t for each t in P
    # The number of these components is 1 + |P| = 1 + c = c.

    # 5. Choose one component C.
    # Let C = C' = [-1, 0) x {0}.

    # 6. Analyze the set X \ C and its components.
    # X \ C = X \ ([-1, 0) x {0}) = {(0, 0)} U (union_{t in P} K_t)
    # The components of this set are:
    # - The point {(0, 0)} (which is the set A)
    # - Each segment K_t for t in P
    # These components are all disjoint and separated from each other.

    # 7. Count the number of components of X \ C.
    # Number of components = (component for A) + (components for each K_t)
    #                   = 1 + |P|
    # Since |P| = c, the number of components is 1 + c.

    # In cardinal arithmetic, 1 + c = c.
    num_components = c

    # 8. Argue that this is the maximum possible number.
    # The number of components of a space cannot exceed its cardinality.
    # The cardinality of X \ C is at most the cardinality of X, which is c.
    # Thus, the number of components is at most c.
    # Since we found an example with c components, this is the maximum.

    final_result_cardinal = "c"
