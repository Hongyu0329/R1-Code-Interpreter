    "Of course. In Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can win: one for batting and one for pitching.\n\n*   A **Batting Triple Crown** is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) in the same season.\n*   A **Pitching Triple Crown** is awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA) in the same season.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the total number of times a Triple Crown has been won in MLB history by adding the number of batting winners to the number of pitching winners.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crowns():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n    This includes both batting and pitching Triple Crowns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical number of times the batting Triple Crown has been won.\n    batting_triple_crown_seasons = 18\n\n    # Historical number of times the pitching Triple Crown has been won.\n    pitching_triple_crown_seasons = 36\n\n    # Calculate the total.\n    total_seasons = batting_triple_crown_seasons + pitching_triple_crown_seasons\n\n    print(\"MLB Triple Crown Winners Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Batting Triple Crown seasons: {batting_triple_crown_seasons}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Pitching Triple Crown seasons: {pitching_triple_crown_seasons}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Total Triple Crown seasons in MLB history:\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed\n    print(f\"{batting_triple_crown_seasons} (batting) + {pitching_triple_crown_seasons} (pitching) = {total_seasons}\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crowns()\n```\n<<<54>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
