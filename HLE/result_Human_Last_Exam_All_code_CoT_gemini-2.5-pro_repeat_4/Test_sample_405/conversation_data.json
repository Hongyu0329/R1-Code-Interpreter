    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n1.  I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors.\n2.  The primary allotropes are white, red, violet, and black. It's also important to note that white phosphorus often appears yellow due to impurities or exposure to light, making yellow another distinct observable color.\n3.  I will create a Python script to store these allotropes and their colors.\n4.  The script will then identify the unique colors, print them, and calculate the total count.\n5.  Finally, as requested, the script will display the calculation as a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the number of distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes/forms to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus can appear as white or yellow.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"White\",\n        \"Yellow Phosphorus\": \"Yellow\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    # Extract the unique color names from the dictionary values\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(allotrope_colors.values())))\n    \n    # Get the total count of unique colors\n    color_count = len(unique_colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final count is derived from the sum of each unique color found.\")\n    \n    # Create and print the equation as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * color_count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"Equation: {equation_str} = {color_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
