    "This is a music theory question about The Beatles' compositions. I will identify the song that fits the described chord progression.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user is asking for a Beatles song that begins with a chord progression moving from the tonic (the \"home\" chord, or I) to a \"minor fifth chord\". The most common interpretation of a \"minor fifth chord\" is a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (the 'v' chord). So, the progression is I → v.\n2.  **Identify the Song:** The most well-known Beatles song that prominently features this I → v progression is \"Michelle\".\n3.  **Explain the Nuance:** The song's intro and verses are in a minor key (F minor). However, the chorus (\"I love you, I love you, I love you...\") switches to the parallel major key (F major). This section starts with an F major chord (the tonic, I), which is immediately followed by a C minor chord (the v chord). This powerful and poignant change is a defining feature of the song and is almost certainly what the question is referencing, even though it's not the absolute first chord of the track.\n4.  **Create the Python Code:** I will write a simple script to declare the song's title and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression.\n\n    The question asks for a song starting with a jump from the tonic (I) chord\n    to the minor fifth (v) chord.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - Song: \"Michelle\"\n    - Key (Chorus): F Major\n    - Tonic Chord (I): F Major\n    - Fifth Degree of F: C\n    - Minor Fifth Chord (v): C minor\n\n    The chorus of \"Michelle\" prominently features the progression F Major -> C minor,\n    which is a classic example of a I -> v chord change.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    \n    # The progression in the key of F Major is F (I) to Cm (v).\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that features a prominent chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: {song_title}\")\n    print(f\"In the chorus, the progression goes from {tonic_chord} to {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
