    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the integral and the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Integral**: The problem asks for the definite integral of a piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range $[0, 4]$. Since the function's definition changes at $x=3$, I will split the integral into two parts:\n    $$ \\int_0^4 p(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^3 p(x) \\,dx + \\int_3^4 p(x) \\,dx $$\n\n2.  **Solve the First Part**: For the range $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$. I will find the antiderivative and evaluate it from 0 to 3.\n    $$ \\int_0^3 \\frac{x^3}{4} \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{16} \\right]_0^3 = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16} $$\n\n3.  **Solve the Second Part**: For the range $3 \\le x \\le 4$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$. This integral can be simplified by recognizing that it fits the form $\\int e^x(f(x) + f'(x))dx = e^x f(x)$. By using trigonometric half-angle identities, we can show that for $f(x) = \\tan(x/2)$, its derivative $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(x/2)$, and the integrand $\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{1 + \\cos x}$ simplifies to $f(x) + f'(x)$. Therefore, the antiderivative of the second part is $e^x \\tan(x/2)$. I will evaluate this from 3 to 4.\n    $$ \\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} \\,dx = \\left[ e^x \\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\right]_3^4 = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Combine and Calculate**: The final result is the sum of the two parts. I will use a Python script to compute the numerical values for each part and sum them up. The script will print the values for each term in the final equation before printing the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem is to compute the integral of a piecewise function p(x) from x=0 to x=4.\n# The integral is split into two parts:\n# Integral = Integral from 0 to 3 of (2*x^3 / 8) dx + Integral from 3 to 4 of (e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))) dx\n\n# Part 1: Analytical integral of x^3 / 4 from 0 to 3.\n# The antiderivative is x^4 / 16.\n# Evaluating at the limits: (3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16)\nintegral_part1 = (3**4) / 16\n\n# Part 2: Analytical integral of e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) from 3 to 4.\n# The antiderivative is e^x * tan(x/2).\n# Evaluating at the limits: [e^x * tan(x/2)] from 3 to 4.\n# Note: The arguments to trigonometric functions are in radians.\nterm_at_4 = np.exp(4) * np.tan(4 / 2)\nterm_at_3 = np.exp(3) * np.tan(3 / 2)\nintegral_part2 = term_at_4 - term_at_3\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated numbers\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of two parts.\")\nprint(f\"The first part of the integral (from 0 to 3) is: {integral_part1}\")\nprint(f\"The second part of the integral (from 3 to 4) is: {integral_part2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{integral_part1} + ({term_at_4} - {term_at_3}) = {total_integral}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final numerical result for the integral is:\")\nprint(total_integral)\n```\n<<<-397.4606113864499>>>"
