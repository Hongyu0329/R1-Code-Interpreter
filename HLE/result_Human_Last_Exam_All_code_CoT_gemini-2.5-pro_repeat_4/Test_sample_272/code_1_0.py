    # Let H be the group <a,b | a^2 = b^2 = 1> = C2 * C2 (the infinite dihedral group).
    # Let G be the group H * H.
    # Let p be an odd prime.

    # (1) What is the cohomological dimension of H?
    # A group has infinite cohomological dimension over the integers if and only if it has torsion.
    # H has elements of order 2 (a and b), so it has torsion.
    # Thus, cd(H) is infinite.
    answers.append('infty')

    # (2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H * H. Since H has torsion elements, their images in G are also torsion elements.
    # Therefore, G has torsion, and its cohomological dimension is also infinite.
    answers.append('infty')

    # (3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # The virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) is the cd of a finite-index torsion-free subgroup.
    # H contains the subgroup generated by 'ab', which is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z.
    # This subgroup is torsion-free and has index 2 in H.
    # The cohomological dimension of Z is 1. Thus, vcd(H) = 1.
    answers.append(1)

    # (4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H * H acts on a Bass-Serre tree with vertex stabilizers H and trivial edge stabilizers.
    # A finite-index torsion-free subgroup of G acts freely on this tree, which implies it must be a free group.
    # Any non-trivial free group has cohomological dimension 1.
    # Such subgroups exist and are non-trivial. Thus, vcd(G) = 1.
    answers.append(1)

    # (5) How many ends does H have?
    # A finitely generated group has 2 ends if and only if it has an infinite cyclic subgroup (Z) of finite index.
    # As noted for question (3), H has such a subgroup of index 2.
    # Thus, H has 2 ends.
    answers.append(2)

    # (6) How many ends does G have?
    # For a free product G1 * G2, if G1 and G2 are not both C2, the number of ends is infinite.
    # H is an infinite group, not C2.
    # Thus, G = H * H has infinite ends.
    answers.append('infty')

    # (7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the pro-p completion of G for an odd prime p.
    # Any homomorphism from G to a finite p-group must map the generators of G (of order 2) to elements
    # whose order divides both 2 and p^k for some k. Since p is odd, this means the order is 1.
    # So all generators are mapped to the identity, and the only p-group quotient is trivial.
    # Thus, P is the trivial group {1}. The cd of the trivial group is 0.
    answers.append(0)

    # (8) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # Since P is the trivial group, its only open subgroup is itself.
    # The vcd of P is the cd of {1}, which is 0.
    answers.append(0)

    # (9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p) as an F_p-vector space?
    # H^1(G, F_p) is isomorphic to Hom(G_ab, F_p).
    # G_ab = (H * H)_ab = H_ab x H_ab.
    # H_ab = (C2 * C2)_ab = C2 x C2.
    # So, G_ab = (C2 x C2) x (C2 x C2) = (C2)^4.
    # A homomorphism from C2 to F_p (p is odd) must be trivial, because for any x in the image, 2x=0,
    # which implies x=0 as 2 is invertible in F_p.
    # Thus, Hom((C2)^4, F_p) is the trivial group {0}. The dimension of this vector space is 0.
