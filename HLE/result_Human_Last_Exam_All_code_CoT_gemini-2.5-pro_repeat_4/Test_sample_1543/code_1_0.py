    # --- Introduction to the Puzzle ---
    print("The chess puzzle is a 'mate in N' problem for White.")
    print("FEN: 9k/5c1pb1/10/10/10/3Q6/PP5A2/K9 w - - 0 1")
    print("The goal is to find the smallest number 'N' of moves for White to force a checkmate.\n")

    # --- Step-by-Step Analysis ---
    print("Step 1: White's first move")
    print("White's winning move is 1. Qa6.")
    print("This move prepares an attack along the 8th rank and creates an immediate threat of 2. Qa8#.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyzing Black's possible defenses")
    print("Black must respond to the threat of checkmate. We consider two main defensive strategies for Black:\n")

    print("Defense A: The Black King moves out of the corner.")
    print("If Black plays 1... Ki8, the King moves to i8.")
    print("White responds with the second move: 2. Qc8#.")
    print("Explanation: The Queen on c8 checks the King on i8. The King's escape squares (h8 and j8) are both attacked by the Queen. No Black piece can capture the Queen or block the check. This is checkmate.\n")

    print("Defense B: The Black Chancellor defends against the threat.")
    print("Black can use the Chancellor (on f7) to defend the a8 square. For example, by playing 1... Cd8 (a knight move).")
    print("Now, 2. Qa8+ would be met by 2... Cxa8. However, White has a different winning move.")
    print("White responds with the second move: 2. Ac7#.")
    print("Explanation: The Archbishop (on h2) moves to c7 like a bishop. This checks the King on j8. The King's escape squares (i8 and j7) are both attacked by the Archbishop. No Black piece can capture the Archbishop or block the check. This is checkmate. (This same mate works if Black plays 1... Ch8 or 1... Cf8).\n")

    print("Any other move by Black fails to stop the initial threat of 2. Qa8#.\n")

    # --- Conclusion and Final Answer ---
    print("Conclusion: White can force a checkmate in 2 moves.")
    
    # The "equation" consists of counting White's moves to deliver mate.
    # Move 1: Qa6
    # Move 2: The mating move (e.g., Qc8# or Ac7#)
    move_count_white = 2
    
    print(f"The minimal amount of moves by White to win is the number of turns White takes: {move_count_white}.")
