# This script is designed to output the final answer based on the analysis of the C code.
# The analysis determined the following:
# a. The program is correct for the two given examples ("localization", "internationalization"). Answer: Y
# b. The program is not correct for every input due to improper handling of the EOF character from getchar().
#    The shortest input that causes failure is a single character not followed by a newline.
#    The length of this shortest incorrect input is 1.

# The combined answer is "Y1".

answer_a = 'Y'
answer_b = 1

# Printing the final combined answer.
print(f"{answer_a}{answer_b}")
