    "This is a specialized biological question, not a computational one. My plan is to consult scientific knowledge about cephalopod neuroanatomy to determine which brain structures are situated posterior to (behind) the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish. The palliovisceral lobe is a major part of the subesophageal mass of the brain, controlling functions like breathing, locomotion via the mantle and fins, and the internal organs. I will provide the answer in a simple python script that prints the information, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef get_cuttlefish_anatomy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.\n\n    The palliovisceral lobe is one of the most posterior lobes in the main\n    brain mass of a cuttlefish. Therefore, the structures lying immediately\n    posterior to it are not other lobes, but the major nerve trunks that\n    emerge from it to innervate the rest of the body.\n    \"\"\"\n    region1 = \"pallial nerves\"\n    region2 = \"visceral nerves\"\n\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The primary structures lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe \"\n        f\"in the dwarf cuttlefish are the large nerve trunks that originate from it. \"\n        f\"These are the {region1} (which contain the giant axons controlling the mantle for jet propulsion) \"\n        f\"and the {region2} (which control the internal organs).\"\n    )\n\n    print(explanation)\n\nget_cuttlefish_anatomy()\n```\n<<<The pallial nerves and the visceral nerves.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
