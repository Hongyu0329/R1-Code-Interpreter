# The second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B22_steric)
# can be calculated using the hard-sphere model approximation.

# Step 1: Define the partial specific volume (v_bar) for a typical monoclonal antibody.
# This value is approximately 0.73 mL/g.
partial_specific_volume = 0.73  # in mL/g

# Step 2: The formula for the steric-only contribution is B22_steric = 4 * v_bar.
# We define the steric factor from the hard-sphere model.
steric_factor = 4

# Step 3: Calculate the B22_steric value.
b22_steric = steric_factor * partial_specific_volume

# Step 4: Print the explanation, the equation with the numbers, and the final result.
print("The second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B22_steric) is calculated as:")
