    Calculates the dimension of a log blowup based on algebraic geometry principles.

    The problem asks for the dimension of the log blowup of a point P
    with log structure N^3 in the log ideal I generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).
    """

    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the space P.
    # The log structure is given by the monoid M = N^3. The space P is the
    # spectrum of the monoid algebra C[M], which is Spec(C[x, y, z]).
    # The dimension of this space is the number of independent generators of the monoid.

    print(f"The space P is an affine space of dimension k.")
    print(f"So, the dimension of P is {dim_P}.")

    # Step 2: Explain the effect of a log blowup on dimension.
    # The log blowup is a birational morphism. A fundamental property of birational
    # morphisms is that they preserve the dimension of the variety.
    # Therefore, the dimension of the log blowup of P is the same as the dimension of P.

    print("Birational modifications preserve the dimension of the space.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # Step 3: Print the final equation and the answer.
    # The final equation is dim(LogBlowup(P)) = dim(P).
    # We need to output each number in the final equation.
    print("The final equation is:")
    print("Dimension of the log blowup = Dimension of P")

    final_equation_lhs = "Dimension of the log blowup"
