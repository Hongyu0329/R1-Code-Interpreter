    # Step 1: Analyze the claim.
    # The claim is: For any matrix M, the number of its distinct eigenvalues is less than or equal to its rank.
    # Let's test this with a counter-example.
    # Consider the 2x2 zero matrix: M = [[0, 0], [0, 0]].
    # The rank of M is 0.
    # The eigenvalues are the roots of det(M - lambda*I) = 0, which is lambda^2 = 0.
    # The only distinct eigenvalue is 0.
    # So, the number of distinct eigenvalues is 1.
    # The claim states: 1 <= 0. This is false.
    # Therefore, the claim is "Wrong".

    # Line 3: "there exists G ... such that J ... is in Jordan normal form."
    # This is not true for any arbitrary field K. The existence of a Jordan Normal Form
    # is only guaranteed if the matrix's characteristic polynomial splits into linear
    # factors over K. This is true for algebraically closed fields (like Complex numbers),
    # but not for all fields (like Real numbers).
    # So, line 3 is incorrect.
    incorrect_lines.append(3)

    # Line 6: "the rank of J is bounded from below by the number of non-zero entries on the diagonal..."
    # Let a_0 be the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0, and g_0 be its geometric multiplicity.
    # The rank of J is n - g_0.
    # The number of non-zero diagonal entries is n - a_0.
    # The statement is rank(J) >= n - a_0, which means n - g_0 >= n - a_0, or a_0 >= g_0.
    # The algebraic multiplicity is always >= the geometric multiplicity. So, line 6 is correct.

    # Line 7: "we have |E(J)| <= rank(J)."
    # Let's use our counter-example, the zero matrix. Its Jordan form J is also the zero matrix.
    # The set of distinct eigenvalues E(J) is {0}, so |E(J)| = 1.
    # The rank of J is 0.
    # The statement becomes 1 <= 0, which is false.
    # Thus, line 7 is incorrect.

    # Step 3: Format the final answer.
