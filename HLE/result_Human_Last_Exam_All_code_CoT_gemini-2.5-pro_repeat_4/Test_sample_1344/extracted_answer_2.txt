A Hafnium (Hf) metal center complexed with a Constrained-Geometry Ligand (CGC) and supported on Zirconia (ZrO2). This combination is optimal because: 1) The Hf-CGC system is a state-of-the-art, highly active catalyst for olefin polymerization. 2) The robust Zirconia support enhances thermal stability and introduces active sites that aid in the C-C bond cleavage required for hydrogenolysis, complementing the molecular catalyst's function. 3) This system represents the best compromise between the distinct requirements of polymerization and depolymerization, providing high performance in both regimes.
