    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the plan to determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Terminology**:\n    *   A curve `z^2 = f(x)` has **good reduction** at a prime number `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a smooth (non-singular) curve. A straightforward way to check this is by examining the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. If `p` does not divide the discriminant, the curve has good reduction at `p`.\n    *   The condition \"good reduction above 2\" means the curve must have good reduction for all prime numbers `p > 2`. This implies that the discriminant of `f(x)` should not have any prime factors other than 2.\n    *   **Ordinary reduction** is a more advanced property. However, in a multiple-choice question, we can often find the answer by elimination. A curve must have good reduction to have good ordinary reduction.\n\n2.  **Execution Strategy**:\n    *   For each of the five given curves, I will calculate the discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side.\n    *   I will then find the prime factors of each discriminant.\n    *   The correct curve will be the one whose discriminant has no prime factors greater than 2. If only one curve satisfies this, it must be the answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that performs this analysis using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of hyperelliptic curves to find which one has good reduction\n    for all prime numbers greater than 2.\n\n    This script requires the 'sympy' library.
