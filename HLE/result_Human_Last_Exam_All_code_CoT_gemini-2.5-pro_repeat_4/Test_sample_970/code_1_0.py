# The problem asks for the necessary assumptions to prove that the expected information gain for a Bayesian agent approaches zero over time.
#
# Step 1: Analyze the expected information gain. The formula given is E[KL(posterior_t+1 || posterior_t)]. This measures how much the agent expects its beliefs to change with the next observation.
#
# Step 2: Recall a fundamental result in Bayesian inference. The sum of all expected information gains over time is bounded by the entropy of the initial prior distribution.
# Let P_0 be the prior. The total expected information gain is Sum(E[KL(P_{t+1} || P_t)]) for t from 0 to infinity.
# This sum is less than or equal to H(P_0), the entropy of the prior.
#
# Step 3: For a series of non-negative terms (KL-divergence is always non-negative) to have a finite sum, the terms themselves must converge to zero.
#
# Step 4: For this argument to hold, the upper bound, H(P_0), must be finite. Therefore, the assumption that the prior has finite entropy is crucial. This corresponds to option 'a'.
#
# Step 5: Consider the other options.
# - (b), (c), (d) are assumptions about the environment or data structure that are often used in specific proofs but are not universally necessary for the general principle of Bayesian convergence.
# - (e) is a result of the learning process converging, but it's a stronger condition than necessary. The information gain can go to zero even if the posterior converges to a distribution with non-zero entropy (if some models are indistinguishable).
#
# Step 6: Conclude that 'a' is the necessary assumption.
#
# Step 7: Format the answer 'a' in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as requested. A single literal 'a' is represented as a clause (a), and the full conjunction is [(a)].

# The final answer is the CNF representation of the conclusion.
