    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: This approach is complex and unreliable. A sophisticated adversary with a kernel-level implant on the client device could intercept and manipulate ALL outgoing requests, regardless of the network or protocol used, rendering cross-validation useless. It fails to address the core problem of the untrusted endpoint.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option B] Extra Strong Encryption (OTP)")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: While OTP offers perfect secrecy in theory, it is practically impossible to implement for DNS on a global scale due to the insurmountable challenge of secure key distribution. More importantly, if the system's kernel is compromised, an implant can steal the one-time pad key directly from memory before it is used. This solution is defeated by the untrusted endpoint.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option C] Strong Multi-Factor Authentication")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: This misapplies the concept of MFA. DNS lookups are automated background processes; requiring user interaction with a PIN/token for every request is not feasible. Furthermore, MFA authenticates a user or system, but a kernel-level implant can bypass this authentication check or operate after authentication is complete, still allowing for an AitM attack. It does not solve the core problem.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option D] FIPS 140-3 Level 5 Module")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: This solution is flawed for two reasons. First, FIPS 140-3 does not have a Level 5; the standard only goes up to Level 4, making the premise invalid. Second, even a maximum-security module on the DNS resolver (server-side) does nothing to protect against an AitM attack originating from a compromised client or a malicious network node between the client and the server. It only hardens one end of the communication.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option E] NextGen Intrusion Detection System")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: An IDS is a detection tool, not a prevention mechanism. It can be evaded by sophisticated attackers. Critically, a kernel-level implant can blind the host-based components of the IDS, making the malicious activity invisible. It is a reactive measure that is fundamentally undermined by a compromised system.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option F] Physical Security Guard Solution")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: This solution addresses physical tampering with servers, which is a different threat from a network-based AitM attack. An adversary can intercept DNS traffic on the internet far from the physically secure data center. This is irrelevant to the specified threat of AitM and compromised endpoints.", width=80))

    print("\n[Option G] Secure Blockchain Software Update Mechanism")
    print(textwrap.fill("ANALYSIS: This is the most fundamental solution. The problem states that implants DEFEAT existing defenses. This option addresses HOW the implants get onto the system in the first placeâ€”often via a compromised software update (a supply-chain attack). By creating a tamper-proof, verifiable ledger for all software updates, this mechanism ensures the integrity of the DNS software, the OS, and the kernel. It establishes a 'root of trust' in the software itself. If you can trust the code running on the machine, you can then trust its cryptographic functions to effectively mitigate AitM. This solution tackles the root cause, not the symptom.", width=80))

    Option G is the only solution that addresses the foundational premise of the problem.
    Instead of adding another layer of defense that relies on a trusted system, it provides a
    mechanism to ensure the system remains trustworthy in the first place. By preventing
    the installation of the malicious implants that undermine other defenses, it is the most
    robust and well-reasoned solution to the specified challenge.
