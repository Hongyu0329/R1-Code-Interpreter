    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Group:** First, I'll identify the group in question. The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, has the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n2.  **Categorize Elements:** The 128 elements of $Q_{128}$ can be split into two types:\n    *   The 64 elements of the form $x^k$, which make up a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    *   The 64 elements of the form $x^k y$.\n\n3.  **Count Elements by Order:** To find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups, I will first count the number of elements of each possible order in the group.\n    *   For the elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$, the number of elements of order $d$ (where $d$ divides 64) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   For the elements of the form $x^k y$, I will determine their order. It turns out they all have order 4.\n\n4.  **Calculate Subgroups:** The number of cyclic subgroups of a specific order $d$ is given by the formula: `(Number of elements of order d) / Ï†(d)`. I will apply this formula for each possible order.\n\n5.  **Sum the Results:** Finally, I will sum the number of subgroups for each order to get the total number of power subgroups. The code will print this final calculation clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function for n.\n    For this problem, we only need it for powers of 2.\n    phi(1) = 1\n    phi(2^k) = 2^(k-1) for k > 0\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # A simple check for powers of 2\n    if n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0:\n        return n // 2\n    # Fallback for general integers (not needed for this specific problem)\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in Q_128.\")\n    print(\"The strategy is to count the number of elements of each possible order and then determine the number of subgroups for each order.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Count the number of elements of each order.\")\n    \n    # Orders of elements in the cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64\n    elements_from_x = {\n        1: phi(1),   # Order 1:  1 element (x^0)\n        2: phi(2),   # Order 2:  1 element (x^32)\n        4: phi(4),   # Order 4:  2 elements\n        8: phi(8),   # Order 8:  4 elements\n        16: phi(16), # Order 16: 8 elements\n        32: phi(32), # Order 32: 16 elements\n        64: phi(64)  # Order 64: 32 elements\n    }\n    \n    # The other 64 elements are of the form x^k*y.
