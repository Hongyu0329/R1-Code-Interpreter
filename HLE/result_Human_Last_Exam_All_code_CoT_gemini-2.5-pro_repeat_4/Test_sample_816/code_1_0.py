    # --- Analysis of Forces ---

    # A. Marangoni Force
    print("A. Marangoni Force:")
    print("   - Description: A force driven by a gradient in surface tension on a fluid surface.")
    print("   - Mechanism: Surface tension changes with temperature. In most pure metals, surface tension decreases as temperature increases, causing outward flow from the hot center.")
    print(f"   - In '{material}', elements like sulfur are surface-active. They cause surface tension to INCREASE with temperature.")
    print("   - Result: The surface tension is highest at the hot center and lower at the cooler edges. Fluid is pulled from low to high tension, causing INWARD flow.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This matches the observation.\n")

    # B. Arc drag Force
    print("B. Arc drag Force:")
    print("   - Description: A shear force from the plasma jet flowing over the weld pool surface.")
    print("   - Result: The plasma gas flows radially from the center, so this force would push the liquid OUTWARDS.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This contradicts the observation.\n")

    # C. Arc Pressure Force
    print("C. Arc Pressure Force:")
    print("   - Description: A downward pressure from the plasma jet, highest at the center.")
    print("   - Result: This force primarily causes a depression in the weld pool surface, not the primary driver for inward surface flow.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This does not explain the observed surface flow pattern.\n")

    # D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force
    print("D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force:")
    print("   - Description: A body force caused by the interaction of the electric current and its magnetic field.")
    print("   - Result: This force generally pinches the fluid and drives it DOWNWARDS in the center and inwards below the surface. While it drives convection, the specific INWARD SURFACE flow is the classic signature of the Marangoni effect in steels.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Not the dominant cause for the *surface* flow described.\n")

    # E. Buoyancy Force
    print("E. Buoyancy Force:")
    print("   - Description: A force due to density differences from temperature gradients.")
    print("   - Result: Hotter, less dense fluid at the center would rise. This force is generally much weaker than Marangoni or Lorentz forces in welding.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Not the dominant force.\n")
