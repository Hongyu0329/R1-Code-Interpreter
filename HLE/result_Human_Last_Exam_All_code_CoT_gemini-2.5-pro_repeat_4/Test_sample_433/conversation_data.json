    "I will provide a Python script to answer the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule. The script will explain the rule based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> guidelines for sterile compounding and then print the specific time limit.\n\nAccording to USP <797>, a single-dose container, such as an ampule, is a container of a sterile medication for parenteral administration (injection or infusion) that is not required to have an antimicrobial preservative. Once opened in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner), its contents must be used within a specific timeframe to minimize the risk of microbial contamination.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on USP <797> guidelines for sterile compounding.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The BUD for a single-dose container opened in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment.\n    bud_hours = 12\n\n    # Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(\"The question is: What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment?\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> guidelines:\")\n    print(\"A single-dose container (like an ampule), once opened or punctured within a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or better), must be used within the following timeframe:\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {bud_hours} hours\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: The opened ampule cannot be stored. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately after the initial use or at the end of the 12-hour period, whichever comes first.\")\n\nget_bud_for_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
