    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will find the answer by searching for the plot summary of the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\". Then, I will present this information using a Python script as requested.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify the movie, character, and the specific plot point in question.\n2.  Search for a reliable plot summary of the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n3.  Find the name of the US city the character Tommaso moves to.\n4.  Create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear, descriptive answer.\n\n```python\n# Information about the movie \"Ovosodo\"\nmovie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\ndestination_city = \"New York City\"\n\n# Print the answer to the user's question\nprint(f\"In the 1997 movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {destination_city}.\")\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"
