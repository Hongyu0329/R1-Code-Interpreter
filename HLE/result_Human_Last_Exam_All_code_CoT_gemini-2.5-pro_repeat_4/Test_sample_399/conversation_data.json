    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Equation Type:** The given differential equation, $x'(t)=(t-1)x^2(t)$, is a separable differential equation. This means we can rearrange it to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n\n2.  **Separate and Integrate:** We rewrite the equation as $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$. Integrating both sides yields:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    This results in the general solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n    where C is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the Initial Condition:** We use the given initial condition, $x(0)=-8$, to find the value of C.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n4.  **Find the Particular Solution:** Substituting C back into the general solution gives us the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate x(1):** To find $x(1)$, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    The Python code below will compute the final value from this equation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# We are solving for x(1) from the particular solution:\n# -1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + 1/8\n\n# Set the value of t for which we want to find x\nt = 1\n\n# The constant C was found to be 1/8 from the initial condition x(0) = -8\nC = 1/8\n\n# The final equation involves substituting t=1.
