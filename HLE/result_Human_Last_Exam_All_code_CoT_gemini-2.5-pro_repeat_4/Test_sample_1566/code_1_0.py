    This script solves a topology problem by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for the number of topologically distinct continua `X` that satisfy two properties:
    1. `X` has `k` end points, where `1 < k < infinity`.
    2. `X` has exactly two orbits under the action of its auto-homeomorphism group.

    # Step 1: Analyze the definition of an "end point".
    # The definition given, involving an open cover U_1, ..., U_N where U_i intersects U_j iff |i-j|<=1
    # (assuming a typo correction from <1 to <=1), characterizes X as an "arc-like" continuum.
    # An arc-like continuum is one that shares certain properties with a simple arc.
    
    # Step 2: Apply Property (1) and a known theorem.
    # A key theorem in continuum theory states that any arc-like continuum has at most two end points.
    # Property (1) states X has more than one end point (k > 1).
    # Combining the theorem (k <= 2) and the property (k > 1), we must conclude that k=2.
    num_end_points = 2

    # Step 3: Analyze Property (2).
    # Property (2) states X has exactly two orbits. Let's call them O1 and O2.
    # The property of being an end point is preserved by homeomorphisms. This means that an orbit
    # must consist either entirely of end points or entirely of non-end points.
    # Let E be the set of end points and X\E be the set of non-end-points.
    # Since E is not empty, the only possible partition of X into two orbits is O1 = E and O2 = X\E.

    # Step 4: Synthesize the properties to identify the space.
    # For the set of end points E to be a single orbit, the two end points must be topologically
    # interchangeable. This is true for a simple arc, e.g., for X=[0,1], the map h(x)=1-x swaps the end points 0 and 1.
    #
    # For the set of non-end-points X\E to be a single orbit, it must be homogeneous. This means
    # every point in X\E is topologically indistinguishable from every other point in X\E.
    # If an arc-like continuum is not a simple arc, it contains points where it is not locally connected,
    # making its set of interior points non-homogeneous.
    # Therefore, for X\E to be homogeneous, X must be a simple arc (homeomorphic to [0,1]).

    # Step 5: Count the number of distinct continua.
    # All simple arcs are homeomorphic to each other. For example, any arc is homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1].
    # Therefore, there is only one such topologically distinct continuum.

    print("3. Property (2) requires 2 orbits. Due to the nature of homeomorphisms, these orbits must be the set of end points (E) and the set of non-end-points (X\\E).")
