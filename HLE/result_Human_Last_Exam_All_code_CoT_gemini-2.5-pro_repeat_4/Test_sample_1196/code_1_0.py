# The user wants to understand which scenario is most likely to create a misleading association in a GWAS due to Linkage Disequilibrium (LD).
# A misleading association occurs when a non-causal SNP shows a signal because it's inherited together with a true causal SNP.
# The strength of this misleading effect depends on the strength of the LD (correlation) between the non-causal and causal SNPs.

# Let's analyze the options:
# A. Three SNPs tightly linked within a single LD block on one chromosome.
#    - "Tightly linked" implies a very high LD (r^2 is close to 1).
#    - If one causal SNP is in this block, all three genotyped SNPs will show a strong association.
#    - This creates a very strong, concentrated signal, which can be misleading by overstating the importance of this single locus for a polygenic trait and making it hard to find the true causal SNP. This is a prime example of the problem.

# B. Two SNPs located at the extreme ends of an LD block.
#    - LD decays with distance. SNPs at the ends of a block are less correlated than SNPs close together.
#    - The misleading signal would be weaker than in scenario A.

# C. Two SNPs located on different chromosomes.
#    - SNPs on different chromosomes are not in LD. They segregate independently.
#    - This scenario cannot cause a misleading association due to LD between the two SNPs.

# D. A single SNP ... next to a recombination hotspot.
#    - A recombination hotspot breaks down LD.
#    - This would limit the size of the LD block and the extent of any misleading association.

# E. Three Tag SNPs predicting all alleles in an inherited haplotype.
#    - This is the definition of how Tag SNPs work and is functionally very similar to option A.
#    - However, "tightly linked" in option A describes the physical state that leads to the strongest possible LD and thus the most powerful misleading signal.

# Conclusion: Option A describes the strongest possible scenario for LD to create a powerful and misleading association signal.
