  This function provides the solution to the two Markov chain questions.

  Question 1:
  Given an irreducible Markov chain `p` and a specific harmonic function `h`,
  we determine if the chain must be recurrent or transient.
  The existence of a non-trivial potential function `h` (positive outside a finite set `A`
  and zero on `A`) implies that there is a non-zero probability of escaping `A`.
  In an irreducible recurrent chain, any finite set is hit with probability 1.
  This leads to a contradiction, so the chain must be transient.
  Answer: 't'

  Question 2:
  A new Markov chain `q` is constructed using an h-transform. This transform
  effectively makes the set `A` unreachable from outside `A`. If we define states
  in `A` to be absorbing, they become recurrent states. The states outside `A`
  can be shown to be transient. A Markov chain that contains both recurrent and
  transient states is neither a recurrent chain nor a transient chain.
  Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn.
