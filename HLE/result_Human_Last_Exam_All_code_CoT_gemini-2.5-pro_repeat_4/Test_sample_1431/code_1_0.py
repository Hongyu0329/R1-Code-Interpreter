def solve_rope_force():

    This function prints the symbolic formula for the force F required to lift the rope.
    
    The problem is symbolic, so we will print the final equation using the given variables.
    The variables are:
    m: mass of the rope
    l: length of the rope
    v: speed of the top end of the rope at the final moment
    g: acceleration due to gravity

    # The force must support the full weight of the rope (m*g) and provide
    # a dynamic force related to the motion of the rope being lifted.
    
    # We will print the final equation, showing the coefficients as requested.
