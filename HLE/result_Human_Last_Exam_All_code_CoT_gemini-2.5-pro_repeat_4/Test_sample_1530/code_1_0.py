    print("A. The intricate, lace-like patterns of frost during Autumn:")
    print("   - Matches 'cold', 'lace', 'glass', forming on plants, and being destroyed by weather. This is a perfect fit.")
    print("B. A floodplain:")
    print("   - Does not match the 'lace', 'glass', or 'knits' imagery.")
    print("C. A spider spinning her web amongst plants:")
    print("   - Matches 'knits' and 'lace' but does not fit 'cold' or 'glass' as well as frost does.")
    print("D. Autumn as a hunter:")
    print("   - Incorrect. Autumn is personified as the destroyer ('his...roar'), not the creator ('she').")
    print("E. A seamstress:")
