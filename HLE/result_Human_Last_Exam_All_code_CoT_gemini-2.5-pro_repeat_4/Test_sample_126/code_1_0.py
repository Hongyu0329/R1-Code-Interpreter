    This function identifies the correct matrix structure for a SWAP gate variant.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A SWAP operation exchanges the states of two qubits. It maps states with a certain
       number of excitations (e.g., number of |1>s) to states with the same number of excitations.
    2. The basis states are |00> (0 excitations), {|01>, |10>} (1 excitation), |11> (2 excitations).
    3. A SWAP variant must not mix these subspaces. This requires the matrix to be block-diagonal,
       with blocks corresponding to these subspaces.
    4. The required matrix structure is:
       [[A, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, F, G, 0],
        [0, J, K, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, P]]
       This structure acts on |00> with A, on |11> with P, and on the {|01>, |10>}
       subspace with the middle 2x2 matrix.
    5. Comparing this required structure with the given options, only option D matches.
