def solve_wave_amplitude():
    """
    This function calculates the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave after passing through
    a slab with time-varying properties.

    The key steps of the derivation are:
    1.  The impedance of the slab Z(t) = sqrt(mu(t)/epsilon(t)) is calculated. Since
        epsilon(t)/epsilon_0 = mu(t)/mu_0, the impedance Z(t) is equal to the vacuum
        impedance Z_0. This means there is no reflection at the boundaries.

    2.  For a slowly time-varying medium, the quantity (Energy Density / frequency), or W/omega,
        is an adiabatic invariant.
        - Energy Density W(t) is proportional to epsilon(t) * E(t)^2.
        - Frequency omega(t) is proportional to 1/n(t), where n(t) is the refractive index.
        - The refractive index n(t) = sqrt(epsilon(t)*mu(t) / (epsilon_0*mu_0)) = alpha*t + beta.
        - Combining these, we find that (alpha*t + beta) * E(t) is a constant.
        - Therefore, E_out / E_in = (alpha*t_in + beta) / (alpha*t_out + beta).

    3.  The time it takes for the wave to travel a distance L is calculated by integrating
        the inverse velocity: L = integral(c/n(t) dt) from t_in to t_out.
        - This integration yields: (alpha*t_out + beta) / (alpha*t_in + beta) = exp(alpha * L / c).

    4.  Combining the results from steps 2 and 3 gives the final amplitude E_out.
