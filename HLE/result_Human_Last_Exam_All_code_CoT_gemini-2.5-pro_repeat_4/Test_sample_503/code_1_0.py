# Step 1: Define n and m based on the problem statement.
# We are looking for adjunctions from [n] to [m].
n = 23
m = 37

# Step 2: The number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m] in the simplex category
# is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).
# This is derived from counting the number of order-preserving maps L: [n] -> [m]
# that satisfy L(0) = 0.

# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).
k = n + m
result = math.comb(k, n)

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
