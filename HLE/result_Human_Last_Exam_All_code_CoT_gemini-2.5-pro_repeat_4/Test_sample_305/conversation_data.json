    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can perform a systematic search. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  A binary operation on a set of 3 elements, which we can label as `{0, 1, 2}`, can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n2.  For the operation to be **commutative**, the table must be symmetric. This means the value of `op(x, y)` is the same as `op(y, x)`. Because of this symmetry, we only need to define the values for the entries on and above the main diagonal. For a set of 3 elements, this amounts to `3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6` entries.\n3.  Each of these 6 entries can be any of the 3 elements. Therefore, the total number of distinct commutative operations is $3^6 = 729$.\n4.  For the operation to also be **associative**, it must satisfy the condition `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all possible choices of `x`, `y`, and `z` from the set.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that iterates through all 729 commutative operations. For each one, it will check if it satisfies the associativity law.\n6.  The script will count the number of operations that meet both criteria and print the result, showing the numbers involved in the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    \n    # For a commutative operation, the multiplication table is symmetric.\n    # We only need to define the values on the main diagonal and the upper triangle.\n    # The number of such entries is n * (n + 1) / 2.\n    num_commutative_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # The total number of commutative operations is n raised to the power of\n    # the number of entries we need to define.\n    total_commutative_ops = n ** num_commutative_entries\n    \n    # We generate all possible ways to fill the upper triangle of the operation table.\n    # Each entry can be any of the n elements.\n    upper_triangle_indices = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            upper_triangle_indices.append((i, j))\n\n    # itertools.product generates all combinations of values for the upper triangle.\n    possible_op_values = itertools.product(elements, repeat=num_commutative_entries)\n\n    associative_count = 0\n    for values in possible_op_values:\n        # For each combination, construct the full operation table.\n        table = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        \n        # Fill the upper triangle from the current combination of values.\n        for idx, (r, c) in enumerate(upper_triangle_indices):\n            table[r][c] = values[idx]\n        \n        # Fill the lower triangle using commutativity (table is symmetric).\n        for r in range(n):\n            for c in range(r):\n                table[r][c] = table[c][r]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z) for all x, y, z.\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    # lhs = (x * y) * z\n                    res_xy = table[x][y]\n                    lhs = table[res_xy][z]\n                    \n                    # rhs = x * (y * z)\n                    res_yz = table[y][z]\n                    rhs = table[x][res_yz]\n                    \n                    if lhs != rhs:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_count += 1\n    \n    non_associative_count = total_commutative_ops - associative_count\n\n    print(\"Let S be a set with 3 elements.\")\n    print(f\"A commutative binary operation on S is determined by the {num_commutative_entries} entries on and above the main diagonal of its operation table.\")\n    print(f\"With {n} choices for each entry, there are {n}^{num_commutative_entries} = {total_commutative_ops} total commutative operations.\")\n    print(f\"By checking each of these, we find that {non_associative_count} are not associative.\")\n    print(\"The number of associative and commutative operations is therefore found by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_commutative_ops} - {non_associative_count} = {associative_count}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<78>>>"
