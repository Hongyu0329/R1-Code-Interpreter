    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step phonological breakdown of how \"shock absorber\" would be adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan and Phonological Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Source Phrase**: The English phrase is \"shock absorber,\" pronounced roughly as /ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/. We will adapt this sound by sound into Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n2.  **Adapt \"shock\"**:\n    *   **\"sh\" sound (/ʃ/)**: Standard Spanish lacks this sound. The most common adaptation is to use the \"ch\" sound, which is phonetically represented as /tʃ/.\n    *   **Vowel (/ɑ/)**: The English \"ah\" sound (as in \"cot\") is typically adapted to the closest Spanish vowel, which is /o/.\n    *   **Result for \"shock\"**: Combining these changes, \"shock\" becomes **[tʃok]**.\n\n3.  **Adapt \"absorber\"**:\n    *   First, we map the English sounds to a basic Spanish phonetic structure. \"Absorber\" (/əbˈsɔrbər/) would be structured as /ab.sor.ˈbeɾ/.\n    *   Next, we apply the distinct phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish to this base form:\n        *   **Lenition of /b/**: In Spanish, the /b/ sound is \"softened\" to a fricative sound (represented as **[β]**) when it appears between vowels or at the end of a syllable. This would apply to both instances of 'b' in \"absorber\".\n        *   **Lateralization of /ɾ/**: This is a hallmark of the Puerto Rican dialect. The 'r' sound (/ɾ/) at the end of a syllable or word is very often pronounced as an 'l' sound ([l]). Therefore, the final `/eɾ/` becomes **[el]**.\n        *   **S-Aspiration**: Note that the /s/ in `ab.sor.ber` is at the beginning of a syllable, not the end, so it is not aspirated to [h] in this context.\n    *   **Result for \"absorber\"**: Applying these rules transforms /ab.sor.ˈbeɾ/ into **[aβ.soɾ.ˈβel]**.\n\n4.  **Final Transcription**: By combining the two adapted parts, we arrive at the final phonetic transcription. The Python code below will construct and print this result, showing each symbol as requested.\n\n```python\ndef generate_phonetic_transcription():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the phonetic transcription of\n    \"shock absorber\" in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the phonetic symbols for the final transcription.\n    # This addresses the instruction to output each symbol.\n    phonetic_symbols = {\n        \"shock_ch\": \"tʃ\",   # English 'sh' -> Spanish 'ch'\n        \"shock_o\": \"o\",     # English 'o' vowel\n        \"shock_k\": \"k\",     # English 'k' sound\n        \"abs_a\": \"a\",       # English schwa -> Spanish 'a'\n        \"abs_b1\": \"β\",      # Softened 'b' sound (lenition)\n        \"abs_s\": \"s\",       # 's' sound\n        \"abs_o\": \"o\",       # Stressed 'o' vowel\n        \"abs_r\": \"ɾ\",       # Tapped 'r' sound\n        \"stress_mark\": \"ˈ\", # Indicates primary stress on the next syllable\n        \"abs_b2\": \"β\",      # Softened 'b' sound (intervocalic)\n        \"abs_e\": \"e\",       # Final vowel sound\n        \"abs_l\": \"l\"        # Final 'r' -> 'l' (lateralization)\n    }\n\n    # Assemble the full phonetic transcription string\n    shock = f\"{phonetic_symbols['shock_ch']}{phonetic_symbols['shock_o']}{phonetic_symbols['shock_k']}\"\n    absorber = (f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_a']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_b1']}.\"\n                f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_s']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_o']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_r']}.\"\n                f\"{phonetic_symbols['stress_mark']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_b2']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_e']}{phonetic_symbols['abs_l']}\")\n\n    full_transcription = f\"[{shock} {absorber}]\"\n\n    print(\"The phonetic transcription of 'shock absorber' in Puerto Rican Spanish is:\")\n    print(full_transcription)\n\n    print(\"\\nHere are the individual phonetic symbols that make up the transcription:\")\n    # Print each component symbol with a brief explanation\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['shock_ch']} (ch sound)\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['shock_o']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['shock_k']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_a']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_b1']} (soft b)\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_s']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_o']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_r']} (tapped r)\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['stress_mark']} (stress mark)\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_b2']} (soft b)\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_e']}\")\n    print(f\"{phonetic_symbols['abs_l']} (l sound from r)\")\n\ngenerate_phonetic_transcription()\n<<<[tʃok aβ.soɾ.ˈβel]>>>"
