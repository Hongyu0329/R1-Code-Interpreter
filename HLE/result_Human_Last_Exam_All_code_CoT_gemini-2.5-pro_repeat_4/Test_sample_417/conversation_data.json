    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule's name indicates a central benzene ring substituted at all six positions. At positions 2, 4, and 6 are methyl groups. At positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical, larger substituent groups (`-CH2-R`). This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry, meaning a 120Â° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the benzene ring leaves the molecule unchanged. This symmetry makes the three `-CH3` groups equivalent and the three `-CH2-R` \"arms\" equivalent.\n2.  **Count Signals from Equivalent Groups:** Due to this C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of the three identical repeating units. A repeating unit consists of one benzene-methyl group, one linker `-CH2-` group, and one camphor-derived substituent (`R`).\n3.  **Count Signals within the Repeating Unit:**\n    *   **Benzene-Methyl Groups (`-CH3`):** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce **1** signal.\n    *   **Linker Methylene Groups (`-CH2-`):** The three linker groups are also equivalent. However, each `-CH2-` group is bonded to the chiral camphor-derived substituent. Protons on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This means the two protons on each `-CH2-` group will produce **2** separate signals.\n    *   **Camphor-Derived Substituent (`R`):** This group is `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. It is a rigid, chiral structure with no internal symmetry. Therefore, all protons that are not constitutionally identical will be chemically non-equivalent.\n        *   **Methyls:** There are three methyl groups. One is on a bridgehead (C7), and two are geminal on the methano bridge (C8). These three methyls are in different chemical environments and will produce **3** signals.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring, giving **1** signal.\n        *   **Bicyclic Framework:** There is one proton on the other bridgehead (C4), giving **1** signal. There are two `-CH2-` groups in the six-membered ring (at C5 and C6). The two protons in each `-CH2-` group are diastereotopic. This results in **4** signals (2 for each `-CH2-`).\n        *   In total, the camphor-derived group produces 3 (methyls) + 1 (pyrazole) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (ring CH2s) = **9** signals.\n4.  **Sum the Peaks:** We add the number of signals from each unique part to find the total number of expected peaks.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints the final count based on this analysis.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of signals from the methyl groups on the central benzene ring.\n# Due to C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups are equivalent.\nsignals_from_benzene_methyls = 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the number of signals from the linker -CH2- groups.\n# The three -CH2- groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n# However, each -CH2- is attached to a chiral substituent, making its two protons diastereotopic.\nsignals_from_linker_ch2 = 2\n\n# Step 3: Define the number of signals from one camphor-derived substituent (R).\n# This substituent is chiral and has no internal symmetry.\n# a) Signals from the three non-equivalent methyl groups.\nsignals_from_R_methyls = 3\n# b) Signal from the single proton on the pyrazole ring.\nsignals_from_R_pyrazole_H = 1\n# c) Signal from the single proton on the bridgehead carbon.\nsignals_from_R_bridgehead_H = 1\n# d) Signals from the two CH2 groups in the bicyclic system. Each has 2 diastereotopic protons.\nsignals_from_R_ring_CH2s = 4\n# Total signals from one R group.\nsignals_from_R_group = signals_from_R_methyls + signals_from_R_pyrazole_H + signals_from_R_bridgehead_H + signals_from_R_ring_CH2s\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of signals by summing the contributions.\ntotal_signals = signals_from_benzene_methyls + signals_from_linker_ch2 + signals_from_R_group\n\n# Final output\n# The final print statement shows how the total is derived from its components.\nprint(\"Calculation of expected 1H NMR peaks:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from central ring methyl groups: {signals_from_benzene_methyls}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from linker -CH2- groups: {signals_from_linker_ch2}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one chiral substituent (R): {signals_from_R_group}\")\nprint(f\"Total expected peaks = {signals_from_benzene_methyls} + {signals_from_linker_ch2} + {signals_from_R_group} = {total_signals}\")\n\n```\n<<<H>>>"
