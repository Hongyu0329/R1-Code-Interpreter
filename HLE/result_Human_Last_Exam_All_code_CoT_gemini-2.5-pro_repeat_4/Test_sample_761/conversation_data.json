    "To determine whether polynucleotides are structurally polysaccharides, we can programmatically compare their fundamental building blocks (monomers) and their elemental composition.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the characteristic components of a polysaccharide monomer (a monosaccharide).\n2.  Define the characteristic components of a polynucleotide monomer (a nucleotide).\n3.  Compare the elemental composition of these two monomers, specifically looking for the presence of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P), which are hallmarks of nucleotides but not monosaccharides.\n4.  Create a simple \"structural difference score\" to satisfy the request for an equation. We will assign a value of `1` if a key element (N or P) is present and `0` if absent. The final \"equation\" will compare the total scores.\n5.  Print a clear, step-by-step explanation of the differences to conclude that they are not structurally the same.\n\n```python\ndef compare_polymer_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the structural and elemental composition of polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the building blocks (monomers) of each polymer\n    polysaccharide_monomer = {\n        \"name\": \"Monosaccharide (e.g., Glucose)\",\n        \"key_elements\": [\"Carbon\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Oxygen\"],\n        \"linking_bond\": \"Glycosidic Bond\"\n    }\n\n    polynucleotide_monomer = {\n        \"name\": \"Nucleotide\",\n        \"key_elements\": [\"Carbon\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Oxygen\", \"Nitrogen\", \"Phosphorus\"],\n        \"subcomponents\": [\"Phosphate Group\", \"Pentose Sugar\", \"Nitrogenous Base\"],\n        \"linking_bond\": \"Phosphodiester Bond\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Structural Comparison: Polynucleotide vs. Polysaccharide ---\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Compare the monomer names\n    print(f\"1.
