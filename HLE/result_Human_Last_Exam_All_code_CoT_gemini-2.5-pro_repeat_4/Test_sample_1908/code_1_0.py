def solve():

    This function solves the mathematical problem about the minimum number of complements for a topology.

    The problem is to find the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial, non-discrete topology
    T on a set X of cardinality c can have.

    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T intersect S is the trivial topology ({emptyset, X}).
    2. The join of T and S (the topology generated by T U S) is the discrete topology.

    This is a known problem in general topology. The key results are:
    - For a set X with |X| >= 3, no topology has exactly one complement.
    - For a set X with |X| >= 4, there exists a topology with exactly two complements.

    Since the set X in the problem has cardinality c (continuum), which is >= 4, the minimum
    number of complements is 2.
