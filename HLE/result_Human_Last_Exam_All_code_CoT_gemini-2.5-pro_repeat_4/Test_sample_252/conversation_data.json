    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required, we need to understand the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube, which has two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, Î»), from a single 2D image captured by a camera sensor.\n2.  **Analyze the Method (CTIS):** This technique uses a diffraction grating to project the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. The grating splits the light from each point in the scene into multiple, spectrally dispersed copies (diffraction orders). The resulting 2D image is a complex overlap of these orders. A computational algorithm then reconstructs the original 3D data cube from this single 2D \"projection,\" similar to how a 3D medical CT scan is reconstructed from multiple 2D X-ray images.\n3.  **Determine the Requirements for Reconstruction:** For a tomographic reconstruction to be successful and unambiguous, the projections must be taken from multiple \"angles.\" In CTIS, the different diffraction orders serve as these projections.\n4.  **Evaluate Grating Configurations:**\n    *   **One 1D Grating:** A single standard (1D) grating disperses light along only one axis. This means all the diffraction orders (the \"projections\") lie along a single line on the sensor. This is analogous to trying to build a 3D model of an object by only taking pictures from a single line of viewpoints; you can't see the top or bottom. This leads to a \"missing cone\" of information in the data, making a full reconstruction impossible.\n    *   **Two 1D Gratings:** By using two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (often fabricated as a single 2D grating component), light is dispersed along two independent axes. This creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor. This 2D pattern provides the necessary variety of \"projections\" from different effective angles to allow for a complete and unambiguous tomographic reconstruction of the 3D spectral data cube.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since one grating is insufficient and two are sufficient, the minimum number required is 2.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code below will formalize this logic by defining the number of dispersion axes required for a full reconstruction and calculating the minimum number of gratings needed to provide them.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n\n    This function formalizes the logic for solving the problem based on the\n    requirements of computed tomography.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a full tomographic reconstruction of a 3D volume (x, y, lambda)\n    # from a 2D projection, we need projections that are not co-planar.\n    # This requires dispersion in 2 independent directions or axes.\n    required_dispersion_axes = 2\n\n    # A standard diffraction grating provides dispersion along one primary axis.\n    dispersion_axes_per_grating = 1\n\n    # We need to find the minimum number of gratings (N) such that the total\n    # number of dispersion axes provided is at least the number required.\n    # The governing equation is: N * dispersion_axes_per_grating >= required_dispersion_axes\n    # We can solve for N by dividing the required axes by the axes per grating\n    # and taking the ceiling, as we need an integer number of gratings.\n    min_gratings = math.ceil(required_dispersion_axes / dispersion_axes_per_grating)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the requirement for full spectral volume reconstruction.\")\n    print(\"A full 3D reconstruction using computed tomography requires projections from multiple, non-collinear angles.\")\n    print(\"In optical terms for CTIS, this translates to a need for 2 independent axes of spectral dispersion.\")\n    print(f\"--> Required Dispersion Axes = {required_dispersion_axes}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the capability of a single diffraction grating.\")\n    print(\"A standard grating provides spectral dispersion along 1 axis.\")\n    print(f\"--> Dispersion Axes per Grating = {dispersion_axes_per_grating}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Formulate the equation to find the minimum number of gratings (N).\")\n    print(\"The condition to satisfy is: N * (Axes per Grating) >= (Required Axes)\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Solve for the minimum N.\")\n    print(f\"Plugging in the numbers: N * {dispersion_axes_per_grating} >= {required_dispersion_axes}\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to N >= {required_dispersion_axes}.\")\n    print(f\"The minimum integer N that satisfies this is {min_gratings}.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is {min_gratings}.\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_grating_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
