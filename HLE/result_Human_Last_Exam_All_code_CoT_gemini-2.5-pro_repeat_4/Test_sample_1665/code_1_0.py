    print("The dipole's magnetic field spreads out and weakens rapidly with distance. This is our reference for comparison.")

    print("Scenario 1: Ferromagnetic cylinder")
    print("The cylinder is made of a material that guides magnetic flux. It will capture the field lines from the nearby dipole and channel them to the other end.")
    print("Result: The field will be much STRONGER than in air.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Scenario 2: Hollow superconducting tube")
    print("The superconducting walls will expel the magnetic field, shielding the region outside the tube from the field trying to pass through its walls. The field is weakened as it's forced around or through the small air core, and the superconductor itself generates an opposing field.")
    print("Result: The field will be WEAKER than in air.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Scenario 3: Ferromagnetic core, superconducting shell")
    print("The outer superconducting shell will expel the dipole's field, preventing it from ever reaching and magnetizing the inner ferromagnetic core. The structure acts as a powerful magnetic shield.")
    print("Result: The field will be the WEAKEST of all scenarios.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Scenario 4: Superconducting core, ferromagnetic shell")
    print("The outer ferromagnetic shell captures and guides the magnetic flux. The inner superconducting core expels the field from the center, forcing the flux to become even more concentrated within the ferromagnetic shell material. This creates a highly efficient magnetic circuit.")
    print("Result: The field will be very STRONG, likely the strongest of all scenarios.")

    print("Conclusion:")
