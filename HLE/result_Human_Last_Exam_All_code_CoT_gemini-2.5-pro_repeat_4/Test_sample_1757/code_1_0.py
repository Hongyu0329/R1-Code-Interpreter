    Calculates the sum over all natural dimensions of the specified ratio.

    The problem asks for the sum S = sum_{d=1 to inf} R(d), where R(d) is a ratio
    of two expected values for a given dimension d.

    R(d) = A(d) / B(d)

    A(d): Expected Lebesgue measure (volume) of the random convex hull.
          A(d) = (1 / (2*d))^d

    B(d): Expected pairwise Euclidean distance between points in the set.
          The constant K represents the expected distance sqrt(x^2 + y^2) for
          uniform x, y in [-1, 1].

    running total until the terms become small enough to not affect the
    result at the required precision.
