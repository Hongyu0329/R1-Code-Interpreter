    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem is set in the context of the renormalization group (RG) and asks for a critical exponent using the epsilon expansion.\n2.  **Define the epsilon expansion:** This technique calculates critical exponents as a power series in `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d` is the spatial dimension and `d_c` is the upper critical dimension. For the universality class of the Ising, XY, or n-vector models, the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4.\n3.  **State the formula:** The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` for the n-vector model is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n    Here, `n` is the number of components of the order parameter (e.g., `n=1` for the Ising model, `n=2` for the XY model).\n4.  **Specify the model:** Since the problem does not specify the model, I will use the most common and fundamental case, the Ising model, for which `n=1`.\n5.  **Calculate the parameters:**\n    *   Spatial dimension `d = 3`.\n    *   Upper critical dimension `d_c = 4`.\n    *   Epsilon `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n    *   Order parameter components `n = 1`.\n6.  **Write the code:** I will create a Python script that substitutes these values into the formula, prints the full equation with the numbers, and calculates the final value for `α`. The script will use the `fractions` module to show the exact fractional result before converting to a decimal.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\n# Plan: Calculate the specific heat exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for the calculation.\n# d: spatial dimension\n# d_c: upper critical dimension for the n-vector model universality class\n# n: number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for the Ising model)\nd = 3\nd_c = 4\nn = 1\n\n# 2. Calculate epsilon (ϵ), the expansion parameter.\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# 3. Define the numerator and denominator for the alpha formula to the first order in epsilon.\n# Formula: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n# 4. Calculate the value of alpha.\nalpha_val = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# 5. Use the fractions module to get the exact fractional representation.\nfractional_alpha = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\n\n# 6. Print the results, showing each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α for d=3 using the epsilon expansion (to first order).\")\nprint(f\"Assuming the Ising model universality class (n={n}).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\nprint(f\"Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\nprint(f\"Epsilon, ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of order parameter components, n = {n}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The first-order epsilon expansion formula for α is: (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({2} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {fractional_alpha}\")\nprint(f\"As a decimal, α ≈ {alpha_val:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
