            "term": "High Dxy between populations",
            "can_occur": True,
            "reason": "Dxy measures absolute divergence, reflecting the time since two populations split. Gene flow (secondary contact) does not erase this accumulated historical divergence. If the populations were isolated for a long time, Dxy will be high."

            "can_occur": True,
            "reason": "Fis measures heterozygote deficit. A hybrid zone contains a mix of individuals from two distinct parental populations. This mixture (the Wahlund effect) leads to a statistical deficit of heterozygotes when the zone is sampled as a single population, resulting in a high Fis."

            "reason": "The mutation rate (u) is the fundamental rate at which new alleles are generated by errors in DNA replication. Gene flow is the movement of existing alleles between populations. Gene flow does not affect the underlying biochemical mutation rate."
