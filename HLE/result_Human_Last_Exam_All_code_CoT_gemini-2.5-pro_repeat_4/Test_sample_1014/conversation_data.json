    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will implement a prime factorization algorithm. A standard and efficient method is trial division.\n3.  First, I will check for divisibility by 2 and divide `n` by 2 until it's odd.\n4.  Then, I will iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n5.  For each `i`, I'll check if it divides `n`. If it does, I'll add `i` to my list of factors and divide `n` by `i` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n6.  After the loop, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is also a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n7.  Finally, I will identify the largest number from the list of prime factors found. If no factors were found (other than the number itself), the number is prime, and it is its own largest prime divisor.\n8.  The code will print the full prime factorization equation and then state the largest prime divisor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the largest prime divisor of a given number,\n    prints the prime factorization, and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2. For an odd number, this loop is skipped.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors. Iterate from 3 up to the square root of n.\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n        i += 2\n\n    # This condition handles the case where n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2 after all other divisions.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Determine the largest prime divisor\n    if not factors:\n        # This case handles input n=1\n        print(\"1 has no prime factors.\")\n        return None\n    else:\n        largest_prime = factors[-1]\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result\n    factor_string = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is: {original_n} = {factor_string}\")\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    \n    return largest_prime\n\n# Run the function and store the result for the final answer\nlargest_divisor = find_largest_prime_divisor()\n# The final answer is formatted as requested.\n# To avoid printing it here, we will place it after the code block.\n\n# <<<8139881>>>\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
