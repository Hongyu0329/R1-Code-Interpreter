    "Answering this question requires checking which of the given transformation sets is inconsistent with the rules of quantum mechanics. A quantum operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, `U`. The core principle is that a single, unique unitary matrix `U` must be able to perform all the transformations listed in a given set.\n\nMy plan is to use this principle to find the impossible transformation:\n1.  Any unitary transformation `U` is fully determined by how it transforms the computational basis states, `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, up to some complex phase factors. Let's say a transformation requires `|0⟩ → |ψ₀⟩` and `|1⟩ → |ψ₁⟩`. For `U` to be unitary, the output states `|ψ₀⟩` and `|ψ₁⟩` must form an orthonormal basis. The operation can be written as `U|0⟩ = c₀|ψ₀⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|ψ₁⟩`, where `c₀` and `c₁` are phase factors with a magnitude of 1 (i.e., `|c₀| = |c₁| = 1`).\n2.  The other transformations in the set (for `|+⟩`, `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, `|-i⟩`) must also be satisfied by this same `U`.\n3.  Each of these additional transformations imposes a constraint on the relationship between `c₀` and `c₁`.\n4.  If these constraints contradict each other, it's impossible to find a single `U` that satisfies all the conditions, and the transformation set is therefore not possible.\n\nI will write a Python script that applies this logic to the provided options. It will find the option where the constraints are contradictory. The script will focus on the specific calculations for the impossible option to demonstrate the contradiction clearly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef ket_to_str(vector):\n    \"\"\"Converts a state vector to a readable complex string.\"\"\"\n    return f\"[{vector[0]:.3f}, {vector[1]:.3f}]\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes quantum transformations to find the one that is not possible.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the six standard basis states as numpy arrays\n    s_sqrt2 = np.sqrt(2)\n    states = {\n        '0': np.array([1, 0], dtype=complex),\n        '1': np.array([0, 1], dtype=complex),\n        '+': np.array([1/s_sqrt2, 1/s_sqrt2], dtype=complex),\n        '-': np.array([1/s_sqrt2, -1/s_sqrt2], dtype=complex),\n        'i': np.array([1/s_sqrt2, 1j/s_sqrt2], dtype=complex),\n        '-i': np.array([1/s_sqrt2, -1j/s_sqrt2], dtype=complex),\n    }\n\n    # The transformation from option Q\n    rules_Q = {'0':'-', '1':'+', '+':'-i', '-': 'i', 'i':'1', '-i':'0'}\n\n    print(\"Analyzing transformation Q: |0⟩→|-⟩, |1⟩→|+⟩, |+⟩→|-i⟩, |i⟩→|1⟩, ...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Let U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩ and U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩, where |c₀|=|c₁|=1.\n    # The output basis {|-⟩, |+⟩} is orthonormal, so this is a valid start.\n    \n    # --- Constraint 1: From the transformation |+⟩ → |-i⟩ ---\n    print(\"1.
