    "Of course. Let's break down the inner product for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Basics:** We'll begin with the partition function `Z` and the Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` for a free, neutral scalar field.\n2.  **Identify the Operator D:** By rewriting the action using integration by parts, we can express it in the form `S[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, Dϕ)`. This process will reveal the differential operator `D`.\n3.  **Define the Inner Product:** The form from step 2 naturally defines the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)`.\n4.  **Symbolic Representation:** I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically construct and display the expression for the inner product, clearly identifying each term and its numerical coefficients as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to illustrate the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses the sympy library to symbolically represent and explain\n    the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature\n    field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Symbolic Definitions ---\n    # Define symbols for coordinates, mass, and inverse temperature\n    tau, m, beta = sympy.symbols('τ m β', real=True, positive=True)\n    d = sympy.Symbol('d', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n    # Define x as a placeholder for the d spatial coordinates\n    # We cannot represent a vector directly in this simple setup\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x') \n    \n    # Define ϕ as a function of the spatial coordinates and imaginary time\n    phi = sympy.Function('ϕ')(x, tau)\n\n    # --- The Operator D ---\n    # The operator D is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator: D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n    # We represent the Laplacian ∇²ϕ symbolically as a single term for clarity.\n    laplacian_phi = sympy.Symbol('(∇²ϕ)')\n    \n    # The term Dϕ is the operator D acting on the field ϕ\n    D_phi = -sympy.Derivative(phi, (tau, 2)) - laplacian_phi + m**2 * phi\n\n    # --- The Inner Product (ϕ, D_ϕ) ---\n    # The inner product is the integral of ϕ * (Dϕ) over spacetime.\n    # The integrand is ϕ multiplied by Dϕ.\n    integrand = phi * D_phi\n    \n    # --- Outputting the Explanation ---\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the Euclidean action S[ϕ] for a free neutral scalar field is:\")\n    print(\"S[ϕ] = ∫ d^d x ∫_0^β dτ [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]\")\n    print(\"\\nAfter integration by parts, this can be written as S[ϕ] = (1/2) (ϕ, D_ϕ),\")\n    print(\"where D is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator and ( , ) denotes the spacetime integral inner product.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is therefore given by the integral of the following expression:\")\n    print(\"(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d^d x ∫_0^β dτ [ ϕ(x,τ) * (Dϕ)(x,τ) ]\")\n\n    print(\"\\nLet's break down the integrand: ϕ * (Dϕ)\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Print each term and its coefficient as requested\n    \n    print(\"1.
