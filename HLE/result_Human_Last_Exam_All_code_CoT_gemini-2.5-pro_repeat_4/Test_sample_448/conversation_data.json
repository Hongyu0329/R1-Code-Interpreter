    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the rarest noble gas and its percentage abundance on Earth.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  First, I will identify the noble gases: Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon.\n2.  Next, I will find their abundance on Earth. The question specifies \"terrestrial matter,\" so I will use the mass fraction in the Earth's crust as a good proxy for this. Data from around 2002 is appropriate.\n3.  I'll store these abundance values in a Python dictionary.\n4.  Then, I will write a Python script to programmatically find the element with the lowest abundance from this data.\n5.  Finally, the script will convert this abundance (which is a mass fraction) into a percentage by multiplying it by 100 and print the final result, including the calculation steps. The rarest noble gas is Radon, due to its radioactivity and short half-life.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a new string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas and calculates its percentage abundance in Earth's crust.\n    The abundance data is based on mass fraction in the Earth's crust, sourced from\n    \"Nature's Building Blocks\" by John Emsley (2001), which is suitable for the year 2002.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of noble gases and their mass fraction in the Earth's crust\n    noble_gas_abundance_mass_fraction = {\n        'Helium': 8e-9,\n        'Neon': 7e-11,\n        'Argon': 4e-6,\n        'Krypton': 1e-10,\n        'Xenon': 3e-11,\n        'Radon': 4e-19\n    }\n\n    # Find the name of the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance_mass_fraction, key=noble_gas_abundance_mass_fraction.get)\n\n    # Get the abundance value (mass fraction) of the rarest gas\n    rarest_gas_fraction = noble_gas_abundance_mass_fraction[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert the mass fraction to a percentage\n    rarest_gas_percentage = rarest_gas_fraction * 100\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its approximate abundance as a percentage of terrestrial matter (crustal mass) is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Mass Fraction: {rarest_gas_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {rarest_gas_fraction} * 100\")\n    # Using scientific notation with one decimal place for a clean output\n    print(f\"Result: {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e} %\")\n\n    # The final answer is the numeric percentage value\n    global final_answer\n    final_answer = f\"{rarest_gas_percentage:.1e}\"\n\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output to the user\nprint(output)\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
