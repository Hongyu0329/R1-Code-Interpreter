    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will leverage a fundamental theorem from the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields. This theorem provides a direct formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. The formula depends on a key invariant of the group: the number of roots in its root system.\n\nMy plan consists of the following steps:\n1.  State the relevant theorem which connects the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori to the number of roots of the group $G$.\n2.  The group specified is of type $E_8$. I will determine the number of roots for the $E_8$ root system.\n3.  The calculation of the number of roots for $E_8$ is based on its standard construction in 8-dimensional Euclidean space. The roots fall into two distinct categories, and I will calculate the count for each.\n4.  The python code will implement this calculation, showing the breakdown of the two types of roots and summing them to get the total.\n5.  Finally, the code will present the resulting formula for the number of tori, explicitly stating the final equation and the numerical value of the exponent as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k), which is the number of ways\n    to choose k items from a set of n items without regard to the order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\ndef solve_e8_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A fundamental theorem by R. Steinberg states that for a connected reductive\n    # group G defined over a finite field F_q, the number of maximal tori\n    # rational over F_q is given by q^N, where N is the number of roots\n    # in the root system of G.\n\n    # For a group G of type E8, we need to find the number of roots.\n    # The rank of E8, which is the dimension of the maximal torus, is 8.\n    rank = 8\n\n    print(f\"The reductive group G is of type E8 over the finite field F_q.\")\n    print(\"According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori is q^N,\")\n    print(\"where N is the number of roots of the associated Lie algebra, E8.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe proceed to calculate N for E8.\")\n    print(f\"The rank of E8 is {rank}.\")\n\n    # The roots of E8 can be described in an 8-dimensional space.
