    "To determine the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to analyze the symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure on top of the standard Riemannian symmetries.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Dimensions**: Let's consider a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m`. Its real dimension is `n = 2m`.\n\n2.  **General Riemann Tensor**: For a general `n`-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor `R_ijkl` has `n^2(n^2-1)/12` independent components.\n\n3.  **Kähler Symmetries**: A Kähler manifold possesses a complex structure `J` that is compatible with the metric. This introduces powerful new symmetries. In complex coordinates `(z^1, ..., z^m)`, these symmetries imply that the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor are of the form `R_(α, β_bar, γ, δ_bar)`, where `α, γ` are holomorphic indices and `β, δ` are anti-holomorphic indices, each running from 1 to `m`.\n\n4.  **Component Symmetries**: These non-zero components have their own symmetries:\n    *   `R_(α, β_bar, γ, δ_bar) = R_(γ, β_bar, α, δ_bar)`: It's symmetric in its holomorphic indices.\n    *   `R_(α, β_bar, γ, δ_bar) = R_(α, δ_bar, γ, β_bar)`: It's symmetric in its anti-holomorphic indices.\n    *   `R_(α, β_bar, γ, δ_bar) = R_(γ, δ_bar, α, β_bar)`: It possesses a pair-swapping symmetry.\n    *   `R_(α, β_bar, γ, δ_bar) = conjugate(R_(β, α_bar, δ, γ_bar))`: A reality condition relates components to their conjugates.\n\n5.  **Counting the Components**:\n    *   Because the tensor is symmetric in its two holomorphic indices `(α, γ)` and its two anti-holomorphic indices `(β, δ)`, we can think of it as a matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by symmetric pairs of indices.\n    *   The number of ways to choose a symmetric pair of indices from `{1, ..., m}` is given by `N = m(m+1)/2`.\n    *   The symmetries allow us to represent the entire Riemann tensor as an `N x N` Hermitian matrix.\n    *   An `N x N` Hermitian matrix has `N^2` independent real components.\n\n6.  **The Final Formula**: Substituting the value of `N`, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is:\n    **Number = ( (m * (m+1)) / 2 )²**\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for a given complex dimension `m` and shows the steps.\n\n```python\ndef count_riemann_tensor_kahler(m: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n\n    Args:\n        m: The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: Please provide a positive integer for the complex dimension 'm'.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Step 1: Find the number of symmetric pairs of indices, N.\")\n    print(f\"The formula is N = (m * (m + 1)) / 2\")\n    n_pairs_val = (m * (m + 1)) // 2\n    print(f\"N = ({m} * ({m} + 1)) / 2 = ({m} * {m+1}) / 2 = {m * (m+1)} / 2 = {n_pairs_val}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The number of independent components is N^2.\")\n    print(f\"Number of components = N^2\")\n    result = n_pairs_val ** 2\n    print(f\"Number of components = {n_pairs_val}^2 = {result}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Final Equation: ( ({m} * ({m} + 1)) / 2 )^2 = {result}\")\n\n# Example: Calculate for a manifold of complex dimension m=2 (like a K3 surface)\n# You can change this value to any positive integer.\ncomplex_dimension = 2\ncount_riemann_tensor_kahler(complex_dimension)\n```\n<<<( (m * (m+1)) / 2 )**2>>>"
