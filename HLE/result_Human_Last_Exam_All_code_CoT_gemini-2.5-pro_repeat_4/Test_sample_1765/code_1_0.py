# The derivation shows that the two-terminal conductance G_12
# is a rational multiple of the quantum of conductance, G_0 = e^2/h.

# The numerical coefficient is 4/3.
numerator = 4
denominator = 3

# The fundamental unit of conductance is the conductance quantum, G_0 = e^2/h.

# Print the final derived equation for the conductance.
# The instruction is to output each number in the final equation.
