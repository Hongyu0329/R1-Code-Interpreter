# Based on the analysis, the problem simplifies to calculating the definite integral
# of u(x,y,-y,0) from x=0 to x=1. The integral is:
# Integral = -3 * [ln(e^(2x) + e^x + 1)] from 0 to 1.

# Define the constant multiplier from the integral
C = -3.0

# Calculate the value of the antiderivative at the upper limit (x=1)
e = math.exp(1)
e_squared = math.exp(2)
f_of_1 = e_squared + e + 1
val_at_1 = math.log(f_of_1)

# Calculate the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit (x=0)
f_of_0 = math.exp(0) + math.exp(0) + 1  # This is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
val_at_0 = math.log(f_of_0)

# Compute the final result of the definite integral
result = C * (val_at_1 - val_at_0)

# Print the components of the final equation as requested
print("The definite integral is evaluated using the formula: C * (value_at_x=1 - value_at_x=0)")
print("\nThe final equation is composed of the following numbers:")
print(f"The constant C is: {C}")
print(f"The value at x=1 is ln(e^2 + e + 1) which is approximately: {val_at_1}")
print(f"The value at x=0 is ln(e^0 + e^0 + 1) which is ln(3) or approximately: {val_at_0}")
print(f"\nThe final calculation is:")
print(f"{C} * ({val_at_1} - {val_at_0})")
print(f"\nThe result of the spatial average is: {result}")
