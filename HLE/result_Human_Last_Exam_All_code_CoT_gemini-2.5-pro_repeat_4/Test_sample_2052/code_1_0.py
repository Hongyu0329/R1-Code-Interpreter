    This function provides the answers to the user's questions based on the analysis
    of superintegrability in two-matrix models.

    (a) Superintegrability for n=3: The model is a known integrable system described
        by a character expansion, which is a hallmark of superintegrability.
    (b) Necessity of W_{-4} for n=4: The W_{-4} operator corresponds to the Tr(Phi_2^4) potential term.
        This operator is an independent generator of the W_4 algebra and is essential
        for defining the Z_{-4} model.
