# The problem is to find the sum of all entries in the Cartan matrix of the
# principal block of k[A5 x C2] for char(k)=2.
# The strategy is based on the following facts from modular representation theory:
# 1. The principal block of k[A5 x C2] is the tensor product of the principal
#    blocks of kA5 and kC2.
# 2. The Cartan matrix of this tensor product block is the Kronecker product
#    of the individual Cartan matrices.
# 3. The sum of entries of a Kronecker product of matrices is the product of
#    the sums of entries of the individual matrices.

# The Cartan matrix for the principal 2-block of A5 is a known result.
# It can be computed as C = D^T * D, where D is the decomposition matrix.

# kC2 has one block with one simple module. The Cartan matrix is (2).
