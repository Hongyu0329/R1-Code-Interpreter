def solve_wuxing_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the feasibility of the described C program on the Wuxing computer.

    The problem is determined to be unsolvable for the following reasons:
    1. Missing Data: The initial distance to Pandora cannot be determined from the provided information.
       The spectroscopic data (501 nm vs 500 nm) only gives the recession velocity, not the distance.
    2. Data Type Overflow: The specified `frac` data type uses a 2-digit signed char for its
       numerator (-99 to 99). The very first step of the velocity calculation (v_day_1 = 40 * 1.04 = 41.6)
       results in a fraction (208/5) whose numerator (208) exceeds the storage capacity.
    3. Missing Functions: The calculation of the onboard time requires a square root to handle
       relativistic time dilation (sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)). The Wuxing computer's C compiler does
       not support the sqrt function.

    Due to these fundamental constraints, the program cannot be written. As per the instructions,
    the correct response in this case is "0:0".
