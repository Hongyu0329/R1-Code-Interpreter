        'C': "Correct. The monotonicity assumption (privileges are only gained, not lost) is the key reason why LAGs are much more compact than SEGs, as it avoids enumerating the combinatorial explosion of network states.",
        'D': "Incorrect. While calculating probabilities in graphs with cycles is complex, it is not impossible. Techniques from probabilistic model checking can be applied to SEGs, and methods like loopy belief propagation can be used for LAGs.",
        'E': "Correct. Standard LAGs rely on monotonicity, so handling a general negation (e.g., NOT B) is problematic if B's truth value can change. SEGs, being explicit state models, can handle such conditions without issue."
