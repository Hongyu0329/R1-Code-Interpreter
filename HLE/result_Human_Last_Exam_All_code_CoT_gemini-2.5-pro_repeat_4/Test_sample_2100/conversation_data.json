    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the clues provided in the prompt: the description \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky, a poem by him questioning the location of the man's grave, and the fact that the grave's location was discovered in the late 1980s.\n2.  The poem and the description strongly point towards the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which is based on Voznesensky's poem \"Saga.\"\n3.  The protagonist of this work is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n4.  I will then verify the final clue: Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and his grave was indeed lost and then rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n5.  Based on this, the man's last name is Rezanov. I will create a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The man described by Andrei Voznesensky is Nikolai Rezanov.\n# He was a Russian nobleman and explorer whose story inspired the poem \"Saga\"\n# and the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# His grave was lost after the Russian Revolution and its location was rediscovered\n# in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1980s.\n# This script prints his last name.\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
