def calculate_rule_activation():
    """
    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule using a t-norm.

    The rule activation level is found by combining the antecedent's firing strength
    with the consequent's membership value. This is typically done using a t-norm
    operation, which models a fuzzy 'AND'. The most common t-norm is the minimum
    operator, which we will use here.
