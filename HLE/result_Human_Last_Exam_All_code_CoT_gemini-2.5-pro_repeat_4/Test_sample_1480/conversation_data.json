    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent with the membership value of the consequent using a t-norm operation. A t-norm acts as a fuzzy logic 'AND'.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two given values: The antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` and the consequent membership grade `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n2.  Select a specific t-norm to use. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, so we will use that for this calculation.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm to the two values to find the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule using a t-norm.\n\n    The rule activation level is found by combining the antecedent's firing strength\n    with the consequent's membership value. This is typically done using a t-norm\n    operation, which models a fuzzy 'AND'. The most common t-norm is the minimum\n    operator, which we will use here.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7      # Firing level of the antecedent: Phi_k(x')\n    mu_G_k_j = 0.9   # Membership value in the consequent set: μG_k_j(y_j)\n\n    # Using the minimum t-norm for the calculation\n    # Activation Level = t-norm(phi_k, mu_G_k_j) = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n    # Output the result in a clear format, showing the equation\n    print(\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm.\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_rule_activation()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
