    "My plan is to analyze the phrase \"my love for humanity\" using the framework of conceptual metaphor theory as established by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson.\n\n1.  **Define the Major Types of Conceptual Metaphors:** I will first outline the definitions of the primary metaphor types relevant to the question: Structural, Orientational, and Ontological metaphors.\n2.  **Analyze the Specific Phrase:** I will deconstruct the phrase \"my love for humanity.\" I'll focus on how the abstract concept of \"love\" is being treated or framed. It is treated as a quantifiable substance or a possession that one can have (\"my love\") and direct (\"for humanity\").\n3.  **Identify the Precise Metaphor Type:** This treatment of an abstract concept as a physical substance is the defining characteristic of an Ontological Metaphor.\n4.  **Select the Best Answer Choice:** Since \"Ontological Metaphor\" is not an option, I will evaluate the given choices. I will eliminate the incorrect or less precise options. I'll argue that because the phrase structures the concept of LOVE in terms of another concept (a SUBSTANCE or POSSESSION), it can be categorized under the broader umbrella of a Structural Metaphor, making it the best fit among the provided answers.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will print this entire line of reasoning and then output the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to print the explanation step-by-step\ndef explain_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conceptual metaphor in 'my love for humanity' and determines the best fit from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Core Types of Conceptual Metaphors (from Lakoff & Johnson)\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\" - Structural Metaphor: One concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another. Example: ARGUMENT IS WAR.\")\n    print(\" - Orientational Metaphor: A system of concepts is organized spatially (up/down, in/out). Example: HAPPY IS UP.\")\n    print(\" - Ontological Metaphor: An abstract experience or idea is treated as a concrete entity, substance, or container. Example: 'I have a lot of fear.'\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Phrase 'my love for humanity'\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The phrase treats the abstract concept 'love' as a concrete thing:\")\n    print(\" - As a possession: 'my love'\")\n    print(\" - As a substance that can be contained or directed: 'love for humanity'\")\n    print(\"This process of treating an abstraction as a physical entity is the core function of an Ontological Metaphor. The underlying metaphor is LOVE IS A SUBSTANCE.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Selecting the Best Answer from the Choices\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The given choices are: A.
