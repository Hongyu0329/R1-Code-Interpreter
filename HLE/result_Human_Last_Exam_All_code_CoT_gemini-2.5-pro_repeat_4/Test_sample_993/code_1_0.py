    This function determines and prints the answer to the paleoclimate question.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The 18O content in sulfate deposits reflects the 18O content of the lake water.
    2. To have low 18O levels, evaporation must be low compared to precipitation. This indicates a 'wet' climate.
    3. Precipitation in 'cold' climates is naturally depleted in 18O. This provides a low-18O source water for the lake.
    4. A wet and cold climate (inflow > outflow/evaporation) results in 'high' lake levels.
    5. Therefore, a "Wet, cold climate with high lake levels" is the correct condition.
    """
    
    # The answer choice corresponding to "Wet, cold climate with high lake levels"
    answer = "G"

    # The final equation is simply the identification of the correct choice.
    # Outputting the chosen option as per the logic.
    print(f"Factors for low 18O levels in sulfate:")
    print(f"Climate Type: Wet and Cold")
    print(f"Lake Status: High lake levels")
    print(f"Final Answer Choice: {answer}")
