def solve_probability_limit():
    """
    This function calculates the limit of the given probability by analyzing the
    asymptotic behavior of the process.

    The problem asks for lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3].

    1. V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by a Wiener sausage S.
       By a law of large numbers for transient processes, V_n converges in
       probability to a constant p_inf, the asymptotic density of the sausage.
       So, the problem reduces to finding p_inf and comparing it to 2/3.

    2. p_inf is the probability that a point z, with |z|->inf, is covered by the
       sausage. This can be calculated by transforming the process X_t to the
       log-plane via w = ln(z). The process X_t becomes a complex Brownian motion
       with a constant drift, W_s.

    3. The condition of being in the sausage, |X_t - z| <= 1, becomes a condition
       for W_s to hit a disk of exponentially small radius R = exp(-Re(w)) around w.

    4. The probability of this hitting event can be calculated. For a 2D Brownian
       motion with drift v, starting at x_start, the probability of hitting a disk
       D(a, R) is given by a formula involving modified Bessel functions of the
       second kind, K0.
       P(hit) = exp(v.(x_start - a)) * K0(|v|*|x_start-a|) / K0(|v|*R)

    5. In our case, the drift v=(1,0), R=exp(-u) where u=Re(w), the starting point
       x_start is near the origin and the target center a=w is far away.
       So, |x_start - a| is approximately u.
       The probability p(w) is approximately exp(-u) * K0(u) / K0(exp(-u)).

    6. We find the limit of this probability as u -> inf.
