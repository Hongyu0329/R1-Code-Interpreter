    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the Ecological Function of Mimicry")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Bumblebee (Bombus) mimicry is a form of MÃ¼llerian mimicry, where multiple well-defended (stinging) species converge on a similar visual appearance.")
    print("The ecological function of this shared warning signal (aposematism) is to more effectively teach predators to avoid them.")
    print("The success of the mimicry is therefore entirely dependent on how it is perceived by the predators.")

    print("\nStep 2: Identifying the Relevant Signal Receiver (The Predator)")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The primary predators of bumblebees are birds, other insects (e.g., robber flies, hornets), and some small mammals.")
    print("Avian predators are considered a major selective force driving the evolution of these color patterns.")
    print("Therefore, to be considered valid, any study of visual mimicry must assess similarity from the perspective of a relevant predator, such as a bird.")

    print("\nStep 3: Comparing Human Perception vs. Predator Perception")
    print("----------------------------------------------------------")
    print("This is the most critical issue with the proposed methodology.")
    print("1. Color Vision: Humans have trichromatic vision. Birds, a key predator, have tetrachromatic vision, which includes sensitivity to light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum.")
    print("2. UV Patterns: Many insect color patterns, including those on bees, have significant UV reflectance components. These patterns are invisible to humans.")
    print("3. Consequence: Two bee species that appear visually similar to a human might look completely different to a bird, and vice-versa. A clustering based on human perception may have no relationship to the functional mimicry rings that predators perceive.")

    print("\nStep 4: Evaluating the Use of Untrained Undergraduates")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("-> Strength: Using 'untrained' or 'naive' human observers is a good way to get unbiased ratings of perceived similarity, free from the theoretical knowledge that might influence an expert's judgment.")
    print("-> Fatal Flaw: The fundamental problem is not that the observers are 'untrained', but that they are 'human'. The data collected describes human aesthetic similarity, not the functional similarity that underpins the mimicry syndrome in its natural, ecological context.")

    print("\nConclusion: Is the Approach Valid?")
    print("------------------------------------")
    print("No. The approach is not valid for clustering species by their functional mimicry syndromes.")
    print("While it validly measures which bees humans think look alike, it fails to consider the perception of the ecologically relevant predators.")
    print("Because human vision is a poor proxy for avian vision, the resulting clusters are unlikely to represent the actual mimicry rings that function in nature to deter predators.")
    print("To be valid, the study would need to use methods that account for predator vision, such as spectrophotometry to measure color reflectance (including UV) and applying avian visual models.")
