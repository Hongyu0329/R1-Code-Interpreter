    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the constants and given values:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so n = 1.\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n    *   Bohr radius, a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\n2.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):**\n    *   According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty is given by the relation Δx * Δp = ħ / 2.\n    *   Therefore, Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n\n3.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p₁):**\n    *   For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the radius (r₁) is equal to the Bohr radius (a₀).\n    *   The angular momentum is quantized: L = mvr = nħ. For n=1, L = ħ.\n    *   Since momentum p = mv, we can write L = pr. So, p₁ * r₁ = ħ.\n    *   Therefore, the momentum in the first Bohr orbit is p₁ = ħ / r₁ = ħ / a₀.\n\n4.  **Find the ratio (Δp / p₁):**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for Δp and p₁ into the ratio.\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    *   By simplifying the expression, we get: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n\n5.  **Write a Python script:**\n    *   Define the values for a₀ and Δx.\n    *   Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n    *   Print the final calculation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants and given values.\n# Bohr radius in meters (m)\na0 = 5.29177e-11\n# Given uncertainty in position in meters (m). 10 pm = 10e-12 m\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula: ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n# The derivation is as follows:\n# Uncertainty in momentum (from Heisenberg's principle): delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n# Momentum in the first Bohr orbit: p1 = h_bar / a0\n# Ratio = delta_p / p1 = (h_bar / (2 * delta_x)) / (h_bar / a0) = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\ndenominator = 2 * delta_x\nratio = a0 / denominator\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The ratio is calculated as: a0 / (2 * delta_x)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to its momentum is: {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
