    # St. Bonaventure's core beliefs:
    # 1. The world (and time) must have a beginning.
    # 2. This is known through both faith (Creation) and reason.
    # 3. He developed philosophical arguments against an eternal past, primarily
    #    based on the impossibility of an actual, completed infinite.

    analysis = {
        'A': "Incorrect. Bonaventure argued it was philosophically *impossible* for time to go back forever, not just a factual matter.",
        'B': "Correct. Bonaventure's arguments were a direct refutation of Aristotle's position on the eternity of the world.",
        'C': "Correct. For Bonaventure, the Christian doctrine of creation out of nothing necessarily implies a beginning of time.",
        'D': "Incorrect. The Big Bang Theory is a 20th-century scientific theory; Bonaventure lived in the 13th century.",
        'E': "Correct. He famously used philosophical arguments, not just scripture, to argue that time must have a beginning.",
        'F': "Correct. In his view, time and space were created together. The entire created order had a beginning; one could not begin without the other.",
        'G': "Correct. This is a cornerstone of his argument: an eternal past would mean an actual infinite number of past events (e.g., souls, days) had occurred, which he held to be impossible.",
        'H': "Correct. This is his argument about the impossibility of traversing an infinite. To reach today from a beginningless past would require completing an infinite series of days.",
        'I': "Incorrect. Georg Cantor's set theory is from the 19th century; Bonaventure lived in the 13th century.",
        'J': "Correct. He held to the standard Christian, linear view of time, where events happen in a sequence from a beginning to an end.",
        'K': "Correct. He used this argument (e.g., comparing infinite solar vs. infinite lunar revolutions) to show the absurdities that arise from the concept of an eternal past.",
        'L': "Incorrect. This idea of a prior universe is foreign to his doctrine of a single creation ex nihilo.",
        'M': "Incorrect. He argued for a linear concept of time (Creation to Final Judgment), opposing cyclical views."
