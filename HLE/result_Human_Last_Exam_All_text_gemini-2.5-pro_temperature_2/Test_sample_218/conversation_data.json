    "Answering this question requires us to identify all irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations of $S_n$**: The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ such that their sum is $n$. In our case, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of Irreps**: The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h(i,j)}$,\n    where the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h(i,j)$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of boxes to its right (in the same row) plus the number of boxes below it (in the same column) plus 1 (for the box itself).\n\n3.  **Strategy**: The partitions that yield small dimensions are those whose Young diagrams are \"far from the center,\" meaning they are either long and thin (like `(n-k, k)` or hooks) or tall and narrow. We will systematically explore these families of partitions. We also use the fact that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram across its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. Since $n=25$ is odd, a partition of 25 cannot be self-conjugate, so each valid partition $\\lambda$ we find gives rise to a distinct conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ with the same dimension (unless $\\lambda$ itself is a conjugate we've already found). We will list the partitions we find and their conjugates.\n\n**Careful Points & Calculation:**\n\n*   For partitions with a small number of parts or specific shapes, simpler formulas for the dimension exist, which we will use to avoid errors with the full Hook Length Formula. For a partition $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$, the dimension is given by $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n! \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le k}(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j - i + j)}{\\prod_{i=1}^k (\\lambda_i + k - i)!}$.\n*   All calculations must be performed carefully. We will only list partitions whose dimension is less than 500,000.\n\n**Let's categorize the partitions based on their first part, $\\lambda_1$:**\n\n*   **Partitions with $\\lambda_1 = 25$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: $d_{(25)}=1$.
