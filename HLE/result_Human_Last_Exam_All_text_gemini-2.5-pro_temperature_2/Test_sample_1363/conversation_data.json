    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** This is a fundamental figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left. Its specific foot pattern and amount of turn are defined for each dance style.\n    *   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the prescribed amount for a given figure. For example, if a three-step figure is designed to turn 3/8 of a circle, overturning would mean turning 1/2 a circle or more in those same three steps.\n    *   **\"Without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It means we are looking for a situation where the act of overturning inherently violates a core technical rule of the figure itself, not just that it's difficult or looks awkward.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Reverse Turn in Each Dance:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The Reverse Turn in Viennese Waltz is part of a continuous, rapid rotation. The entire technique is built around maintaining this momentum. Overturning a step would be extremely difficult and would likely throw off the balance and timing for the subsequent steps, disrupting the characteristic flow. While highly impractical and destructive to the overall look, an argument could be made that a slight overturn isn't a direct violation of a single step's footwork rule, but rather a violation of the principle of continuous rotation.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These are \"swing\" dances. Their technique is based on principles of CBM (Contrary Body Movement), sway, and continuous, flowing movement through the feet. The Reverse Turn in both dances is a multi-step figure designed to travel and turn. Skilled dancers frequently and deliberately overturn (or underturn) these figures to change their alignment on the dance floor. This is considered an advanced application of technique, not a disregard for it. Therefore, overturning is possible within the technique.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** Much like the Waltz and Foxtrot, Quickstep is a swing dance, albeit a much faster one. The need to navigate a crowded floor at high speed makes the ability to modify the turn on figures like the Reverse Turn a practical necessity. Overturning a Reverse Turn, while requiring great skill, is possible and sometimes essential. It is not technically impossible.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The technique of the Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. It is characterized by staccato movements, no rise and fall, and very specific foot placements. Let's analyze a standard Tango Reverse Turn, often called the \"Reverse Turn, Lady Outside\" or simply the \"Tango Close.\" The Leader's steps are:\n        1.  Left Foot forward, beginning to turn left. (Count: Quick)\n        2.  Right Foot to the side, continuing to turn. (Count: Quick)\n        3.  **Left Foot closes to Right Foot**, without weight. (Count: Slow)\n        The technical instruction for the third step is \"LF closes to RF\". This action, bringing the feet together, definitively stops the turn. In order to overturn the figure, the dancer would have to continue turning *past* the point where the feet could close. They would have to take a different step entirely, for instance, stepping forward or across with the left foot. By doing this, the dancer is directly disregarding the explicit technical instruction of the figure, which is to close the feet. Therefore, it is impossible to perform the specified actions of a closed Tango Reverse Turn and overturn it at the same time. The technique itself prevents the overturn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning is a modification of the amount of rotation but doesn't necessarily violate the core footwork. In the Tango, the standard Reverse Turn includes a \"close\" as a fundamental part of its definition and technique. Overturning this figure would require the dancer to *not* close their feet, which is a direct disregard for the specified technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
