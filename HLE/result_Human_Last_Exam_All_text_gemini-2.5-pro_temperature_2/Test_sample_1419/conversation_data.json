    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Theory and the Renormalization Group Setup\nThe theory in question is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory. Its Euclidean Lagrangian density is given by:\n$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4 $\nWe are interested in the behavior of the theory near four spacetime dimensions. We use dimensional regularization, setting the dimension to $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\n\nIn $d$ dimensions, the scalar field $\\phi$ has a mass dimension of $(d-2)/2$. For the action $S = \\int d^d x \\mathcal{L}$ to be dimensionless, the coupling constant $\\lambda$ must have a mass dimension of $4-d = \\epsilon$.\n\nTo perform a renormalization group (RG) analysis, we introduce a dimensionless coupling constant, which we will call $u$. This is done by introducing an arbitrary mass scale $\\mu$ (the renormalization scale) and defining:\n$ u = \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\lambda $\nThe running of this dimensionless coupling $u$ with the energy scale $\\mu$ is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Beta Function $\\beta(u)$\nThe beta function for the dimensionless coupling $u$ is found by considering both its classical and quantum running.\n1.  **Classical Running:** This part comes from the re-scaling built into the definition of $u$.\n    $ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} (\\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\lambda) = -\\epsilon \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\lambda + \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\left(\\mu \\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\mu}\\right) = -\\epsilon u + \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\beta_\\lambda(\\lambda) $\n    where $\\beta_\\lambda(\\lambda) = \\mu \\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\mu}$ is the beta function for the dimensionful coupling $\\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Quantum Running:** This part, $\\beta_\\lambda(\\lambda)$, is determined by the quantum corrections (loop diagrams) in the theory. For $\\phi^4$ theory, we need to calculate the one-loop correction to the four-point vertex function.\n\n    The one-loop correction to the 1PI four-point vertex function $\\Gamma^{(4)}$ has a divergence that must be cancelled by renormalizing the coupling constant. The calculation of the one-loop diagrams (s, t, and u channels) gives a contribution to the beta function. In the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme or related schemes (like $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$), the result for the running of the dimensionful coupling $\\lambda$ is well-known:\n    $ \\beta_\\lambda(\\lambda) = \\mu \\frac{d\\lambda}{d\\mu} = \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(\\lambda^3) $\n    This positive sign indicates that the coupling strength increases at higher energies (shorter distances), which means the theory is not asymptotically free.\n\n3.  **Combining both parts:** We substitute the quantum running part back into the expression for $\\beta(u)$:\n    $ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{3\\lambda^2}{16\\pi^2} \\right) $\n    Now, substitute $\\lambda = u\\mu^\\epsilon$:\n    $ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\mu^{-\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{3(u\\mu^\\epsilon)^2}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2 \\mu^\\epsilon}{16\\pi^2} $\n    The result for $\\beta(u)$ must be independent of $\\mu$. At leading order in the coupling $u$, the term $\\mu^{\\epsilon}$ can be treated as $1$, as any expansion of it would introduce higher powers of $\\epsilon$, which are higher order corrections in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. So, to leading order, we have:\n    $ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3, \\epsilon u^2) $\n\n### Step 3: Find the Fixed Point\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling, $u^*$, where the beta function is zero. At a fixed point, the coupling constant does not change with the energy scale.\n$ \\beta(u^*) = 0 $\nSubstituting our expression for $\\beta(u)$:\n$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $\nThis equation has two solutions for $u^*$:\n1.  $u^* = 0$. This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  The non-trivial solution is found by factoring out one $u^*$:\n    $ u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = 0 $\n    $ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $\n    Solving for $u^*$ gives:\n    $ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $\n    $ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $\nThis non-trivial fixed point is known as the **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Leading Order Expression\nThe question asks for the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$. The entire calculation is based on the $\\epsilon$-expansion, and the result for $u^*$ is directly proportional to $\\epsilon$. Thus, this is the leading order result. Higher-order terms in the beta function (from two-loop diagrams and beyond) would contribute corrections to $u^*$ of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The coupling constant $u$ in this calculation corresponds to the interaction term $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$ in the Lagrangian. Different conventions for the coupling in the Lagrangian would change the numerical coefficient in the beta function and thus in the final answer. The one used here is the most standard convention.\n*   The sign of the terms in the beta function is crucial. The $-\\epsilon u$ term arises from the classical scaling dimension of the coupling, and the $+\\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ term is the result of the one-loop quantum correction. The positive sign of the quantum correction is a key feature of $\\phi^4$ theory.\n*   The analysis assumes $\\epsilon$ is small, which validates the perturbative calculation of the beta function and the search for a fixed point near the Gaussian fixed point.\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ is the value of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}$\n\n<<<$\\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}$>>>"
