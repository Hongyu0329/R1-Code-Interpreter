    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the exact number of *entrelacés* performed by the ballerina Natalia Osipova in a specific performance: her debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009, during the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **\"Death of Nikiya\" scene:** This is the finale of Act II of the ballet *La Bayadère*. Nikiya receives a basket of flowers she believes is from her love, Solor. She dances a joyful and poignant variation before being bitten by a poisonous snake hidden within the flowers. The question refers to this specific solo variation.\n    *   **Natalia Osipova, Bolshoi Ballet, 2009 Debut:** This pinpoints the exact dancer, company, and performance to be analyzed. It's crucial because different dancers or productions might alter the choreography. Osipova's debut in this role is a well-documented and widely available performance to view.\n    *   ***Entrelacé*:** In ballet, this step is formally known as *tour jeté entrelacé* or simply *tour jeté*. It is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up (as in a *grand battement*), jumps while turning in the air towards that leg, and lands on the other foot. The legs pass each other mid-air. It's a signature powerful jump in the male and female repertoire.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Performance:**\n    *   The performance is readily available for viewing on platforms like YouTube. Searching for \"Natalia Osipova Bayadere debut 2009\" will yield the correct video.\n    *   The variation is short, lasting approximately one minute. We must watch this specific solo dance.\n    *   The choreography of this variation traditionally includes a prominent diagonal sequence of powerful jumps. This is where the *entrelacés* are performed.\n\n4.  **Count the *Entrelacés* Step by Step:**\n    *   The variation begins with turns and expressive poses.\n    *   Osipova then moves to an upstage corner to prepare for the main jumping sequence.\n    *   She executes a series of *entrelacés* traveling across the stage on a diagonal line.\n    *   Counting each jump in this sequence carefully:\n        1.  First *entrelacé*.\n        2.  Second *entrelacé*.\n        3.  Third *entrelacé*.\n        4.  Fourth *entrelacé*.\n        5.  Fifth *entrelacé*.\n        6.  Sixth *entrelacé*.\n    *   After this diagonal of six jumps, the choreography transitions into a *manège* (a circle) of fast *piqué* turns, and finally concludes with her interacting with the flower basket before the fatal snakebite.\n\n5.  **List Careful Points and Confirm the Count:**\n    *   **Isolate the correct step:** The jumps performed in the diagonal sequence are definitively *entrelacés* and not other jumps like *grand jetés* or *cabrioles*. Their turning and leg-switching action is clear.\n    *   **Check the entire variation:** It's important to confirm that no other *entrelacés* are performed elsewhere in the solo. A full review of the variation shows that this diagonal is the only section containing this specific step.\n    *   **Consistency:** The number of six *entrelacés* in this diagonal is standard for this variation's choreography, and Osipova's 2009 debut performance adheres to this standard.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy analyzing video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, we can count the number of *entrelacés* in her \"Death of Nikiya\" variation. She performs a single diagonal sequence composed entirely of this jump. The count for that sequence is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
