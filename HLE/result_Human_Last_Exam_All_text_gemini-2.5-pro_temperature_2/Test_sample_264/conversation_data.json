    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Set up a Coordinate System and Define the First Cube\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, it's best to use a coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, C1, in a convenient position. We will define it as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the \"Main Diagonal\" and Interpret the Shift\nThe \"main diagonal\" of this cube is the line segment connecting opposite vertices, such as (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe problem states the cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This phrase can be ambiguous, but the most common and geometrically elegant interpretation in such problems is that the shift vector's components along the axes are each 1/2.\n*   **Shift vector interpretation:** The shift vector is **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n*   **Careful Point & Justification:** A more literal interpretation might suggest a shift *distance* of 1/2. This would mean the length of the shift vector is 1/2, i.e., ||**v**|| = 1/2. This would lead to a more complex shift vector **v** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)) and a complicated, irrational answer. However, the interpretation **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) creates a special configuration: the corner of the second cube is placed exactly at the center of the first cube. This kind of elegant setup is almost always the intention behind such problems, and it leads to a clean, simple answer. The shift distance for this vector is sqrt((1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)²) = √3/2. The length of the cube's main diagonal is √3. So, a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) corresponds to a shift distance of exactly half the length of the main diagonal, which is another way to justify this interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Second Cube\nThe second cube, C2, is identical to the first but translated by the shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). So, the coordinates (x', y', z') of any point in C2 can be found by adding the shift vector to the coordinates of C1. C2 is defined by:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n### Step 4: Find the Intersection of the Two Cubes\nThe intersection of C1 and C2 is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously. We can find this region by taking the most restrictive bounds for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is similarly [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is also [1/2, 1].\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe side length of this intersection cube is (1 - 1/2) = 1/2.\nThe volume of a cube is side length cubed. Therefore, the volume of the intersection is:\nVolume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
