    "This question is based on a false premise. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the issue:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question is about Goodluck Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria.\n2.  **Verify the name:** The full and official name of the former president is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n3.  **Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's birth name or his officially recognized name. It is a very famous name in Nigeria, belonging to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. There is no evidence that Goodluck Jonathan is related to Nnamdi Azikiwe or that he adopted the name.\n4.  **Search for a public declaration:** A thorough search of public records, news archives, official statements, and historical documents reveals no instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself by adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The event described in the question never occurred. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\" Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Verifying the premise:** It is crucial to first verify the core assumption of a question. In this case, the assumption that Jonathan ever identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" is incorrect.\n*   **Distinguishing between names:** One must be careful not to confuse the names of different public figures. The user has likely combined the name of Goodluck Jonathan with the name of Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n*   **Defining \"publicly identify\":** This term implies a formal or significant act. There is no record of any such act, formal or informal, related to this name change.\n\nSince the event never took place, there is no year to provide.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name.>>>"
