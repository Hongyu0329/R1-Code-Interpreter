    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Name \"Perfluoronanocar\"\nThe name of the molecule provides critical clues to its structure.\n*   **Nanocar**: This refers to a class of molecules synthesized to resemble a macroscopic automobile. The most well-known nanocar was developed by the research group of Prof. James Tour at Rice University. It consists of a chassis, axles, and four wheels.\n*   **Perfluoro-**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means that all the hydrogen atoms on the parent hydrocarbon molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Parent Molecule (the Nanocar)\nWe must first determine the chemical structure and formula of the original nanocar before it is fluorinated.\n*   **Chassis and Axles**: The \"body\" of the nanocar is a planar, H-shaped organic molecule. It is a type of oligo(phenylene ethynylene). Let's count the atoms in this hydrocarbon framework:\n    *   It has a central benzene ring (C₆H₆) where four hydrogens have been replaced by other groups. The hydrogens at positions 3 and 6 remain. This gives a **C₆H₂** core.\n    *   Attached to this core are four ethynyl groups (–C≡C–), which add **C₈**.\n    *   These linkers connect to four outer phenyl groups (C₆H₅), where one hydrogen on each is replaced by the bond to the axle. This gives four para-substituted phenylene groups (**4 x C₆H₄**). The total for these rings is **C₂₄H₁₆**.\n*   **Wheels**: The wheels of the original nanocar are four spherical fullerene molecules, specifically buckminsterfullerene (**C₆₀**). It's important to note that C₆₀ is an allotrope of carbon and contains no hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms in the Parent Nanocar\nTo know how many fluorine atoms will be in the perfluorinated version, we need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar. Based on the analysis in Step 2:\n*   Hydrogen atoms on the central ring: 2\n*   Hydrogen atoms on the four outer phenyl rings: 4 rings × 4 hydrogens/ring = 16\n*   Hydrogen atoms in the wheels (C₆₀): 0\n*   **Total Hydrogen Atoms = 2 + 16 + 0 = 18**\n\nThe chemical formula of the hydrocarbon chassis is C₃₈H₁₈, and the full molecule is C₃₈H₁₈(C₆₀)₄.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Modification\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" dictates that we must replace every hydrogen atom (H) with a fluorine atom (F).\n*   The hydrocarbon chassis has 18 hydrogen atoms.\n*   We replace all 18 hydrogen atoms with 18 fluorine atoms.\n*   The C₆₀ wheels have no hydrogens, so they are not affected by this process.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nBy replacing each of the 18 hydrogen atoms in the nanocar's chassis with a fluorine atom, the resulting perfluoronanocar molecule will contain exactly **18 fluorine atoms**. The new chassis formula would be C₃₈F₁₈.\n\n***\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly identify the parent structure as the \"Tour nanocar\".\n2.  Accurately count the hydrogen atoms only on the hydrocarbon chassis, as the fullerene wheels (C₆₀) do not have any hydrogen.\n3.  Understand that the chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\" means *all* hydrogens are replaced by fluorine.\n4.  Assume that the fluorination process does not alter the fundamental carbon skeleton or the C₆₀ wheels.\n\n***\nFinal Answer: Based on the step-by-step analysis, a perfluoronanocar would contain 18 fluorine atoms.\n<<<18>>>"
