    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 7657 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 589 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, which simplifies the conditions for a character to be primitive.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Dirichlet Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n*   **Order of the character**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n*   **Primitivity of the character**: For a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-principal. The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Therefore, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions on the Component Characters\nWe are looking for primitive characters of order 6. Let $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$ for each prime factor $p$ of $d$.\n1.  **Order condition**: $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$. This implies that each $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6, i.e., $k_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  **Primitivity condition**: Each component character must be non-principal, so $k_p > 1$.\n3.  **Group theory constraint**: The order of a character modulo $p$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nCombining these, $k_p$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(6, p-1)$ and be greater than 1.\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$. $\\gcd(6, 6) = 6$. Possible orders are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. After applying $k_7 > 1$, we get $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$. $\\gcd(6, 12) = 6$. Possible orders are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. After applying $k_{13} > 1$, we get $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$. $\\gcd(6, 18) = 6$. Possible orders are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. After applying $k_{19} > 1$, we get $k_{19} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$. $\\gcd(6, 30) = 6$. Possible orders are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. After applying $k_{31} > 1$, we get $k_{31} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nSo for each prime component, the order must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Component Characters\nThe number of Dirichlet characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided $k$ divides $p-1$. In our case, for all four primes, the orders $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ divide $p-1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four prime moduli (7, 13, 19, 31), the number of available characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 is the same.\n\n### Step 5: Combinatorial Calculation\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$ are chosen from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and satisfy $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\nWe use complementary counting.\n1.  **Count all possible character tuples where each component has order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$**.\n    For each prime, the number of choices is the sum of the number of characters of order 2, 3, or 6: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four prime components, the total number of such character tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract the tuples where the lcm of orders is NOT 6**.\n    Since all orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. The lcm is not 6 if it is 1, 2, or 3. As all orders are greater than 1, the lcm cannot be 1.\n    *   **Case A: The lcm is 2.** This occurs if and only if all component orders are 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. The total number of such tuples is $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case B: The lcm is 3.** This occurs if and only if all component orders are 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. The total number of such tuples is $2^4 = 16$.\n    These two cases are mutually exclusive.\n\n3.  **Final calculation**:\n    The number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of tuples from step 1 minus the unwanted tuples from step 2.\n    Number of characters = (Total tuples with orders in {2,3,6}) - (Tuples with lcm=2) - (Tuples with lcm=3)\n    Number of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
