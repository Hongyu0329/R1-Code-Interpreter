    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to determine the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basic SKI combinators and Church numerals.**\n\n*   **S combinator:** `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   **K combinator:** `K x y = x`\n*   **I combinator:** `I x = x`\n*   **Church Numerals:** A Church numeral `n` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. The general form is `n f x = f(f(...f(x)...))`, which can be written as `f^n(x)`.\n*   In SKI, the Church numeral for `1` is the identity combinator `I`, because `1 f x = f(x)` and `I f x = f x`.\n\n**Step 2: Parse the given expression.**\n\nThe expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's break this down:\n*   The overall structure is `A(B)`, where `A` is a function and `B` is its argument.\n*   The expression can be seen as `S(I)` applied to a large sub-expression. Let's name the combinators:\n    *   `Ψ = S(I)`\n    *   `M = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   `N = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n*   The innermost part of the main structure is `(K M) N`. According to the definition of `K`, `(K M) N` reduces to `M`. The entire `N` term is a \"red herring\" that gets discarded.\n*   So, the expression simplifies to `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(M)))`.\n*   Using our alias `Ψ`, this is `E = Ψ(Ψ(Ψ(M)))`. This means the combinator `Ψ` is applied three times, starting with `M` as the argument.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combinator `Ψ = S(I)`.**\n\nLet's see how `Ψ` acts on a Church numeral `m`. A Church numeral `m` is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`. We evaluate `(Ψ m) f x`.\n*   `Ψ m f x = (S I m) f x`\n*   By the definition of `S`, `(S I m) f = (I f) (m f)`.\n*   `(I f) (m f) = f (m f)` because `I f = f`.\n*   So, `(Ψ m) f x = (f (m f)) x`.\n*   Assuming standard left-associative application in lambda calculus, this is `f( (m f) x )`.\n*   `m f x` is `f^m(x)`. So `(m f)` is the function `λy.f^m(y)`. Applying this to `x` gives `f^m(x)`.\n*   Substituting this back: `f( (m f) x ) = f(f^m(x)) = f^(m+1)(x)`.\n*   This is the definition of the Church numeral `m+1`.\n*   Therefore, `Ψ = S(I)` is the **successor function** (`SUCC`). It takes a Church numeral `m` and returns `m+1`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combinator `M`**.\n\n`M = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\nThis expression has a sub-part `P = S(K(S))(K)` which is not a standard, well-known simple combinator and its direct evaluation leads to a complex expression that does not seem to represent a church numeral operation.\nLet's analyze the very similar and common combinator `B = S(KS)K`. The only difference is the placement of parentheses: `(KS)` vs `K(S)`.\n*   `B f g x = S(KS)K f g x = (KS f (K f)) g x = S(K g) x = (K x)(g x) = x(g x)`. Wait, this reduction is incorrect.\n*   Let's do it carefully: `(B f) g x = ( (S(KS)K) f) g x`. The first application is `(S(KS)K) f`. This yields `λy.(KS f (K f) y) = λy.(S(K y))`. No this is also wrong.\n*   The correct reduction is `B f g x = (S(KS)K f) g x = (KSf (Kf)) g x = (S(Kf)) g x = (Kfx (gx)) = f(gx)`. So `B` is the function composition combinator.\n\nThe expression in the problem `S(K(S))(K)` almost certainly contains a typographical error and was intended to be `S(KS)K = B`. Assuming this correction, we proceed.\n\n*   `M = S(B)(I)`.\n*   We can see what `S(B)` does to a numeral `m`. `(S B m) f x = (B m f) x = m(f)x`. No, this is incorrect.\n*   The correct `SUCC` function is `λm. λf. B f (m f) = λm. S (B) m`. No, that conversion is wrong. `λf. X f (Y f) = S X Y`. This doesn't apply here.\n*   The correct successor combinator using `B` is `SUCC = S(B)`. Let's verify `S(B)` acting on a numeral `m`:\n    *   `(S B m) f x = B f (m f) x = f ( (m f) x ) = f(f^m(x)) = f^(m+1)(x)`.\n    *   This is indeed `m+1`. So `S(B)` is also a successor function, functionally identical to `S(I)`.\n\nNow we can evaluate `M`:\n*   `M = S(B)(I) = SUCC(I)`.\n*   `I` is the Church numeral for `1`.\n*   So, `M = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value of n.**\n\nWe substitute the value of `M` back into the simplified expression from Step 2:\n*   `E = Ψ(Ψ(Ψ(M))) = SUCC(SUCC(SUCC(2)))`\n*   `SUCC(2) = 3`\n*   `SUCC(3) = 4`\n*   `SUCC(4) = 5`\n*   So, the expression represents the Church numeral `n=5`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate `log_2(n)`.**\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 5`\n*   `log_2(5) = ln(5) / ln(2) ≈ 1.6094379 / 0.6931472 ≈ 2.321928`\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, the answer is `2.3219`."
