    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group and the Goal**\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group, and its order is $49^{2024}$.\nWe need to find the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty. This is a classic hitting set problem where the sets to be \"hit\" are the cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing the Cyclic Subgroups**\nThe order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, the order of any element $g \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, which can also only be 1, 7, or 49.\nThis means that any cyclic subgroup of $G$ must have an order of 1, 7, or 49.\n*   **Order 1:** The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. To hit this subgroup, $A$ must contain 0. So, $0 \\in A$.\n*   **Order 49:** Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49, where $\\text{ord}(g) = 49$. This subgroup contains elements of all three possible orders. Specifically, it contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, which is generated by the element $7g$. Let's call this subgroup $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n*   **Order 7:** Let $H_7 = \\langle k \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 7, where $\\text{ord}(k)=7$.\n\n**Step 3: Devising a Strategy**\nThe condition for order 49 subgroups gives us a crucial insight. If our set $A$ intersects the subgroup $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$, it automatically intersects the larger subgroup $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ because $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$.\nThis suggests a strategy: construct a set $A$ that contains 0 and hits all cyclic subgroups of order 7. Such a set will then automatically hit all subgroups of order 49 as well.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A'$ that hits every cyclic subgroup of order 7. The final answer for the size of $A$ would then be $|A| = |A'| + |\\{0\\}| = |A'| + 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Minimum Size of the Hitting Set for Order 7 Subgroups**\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_7$ be the set of all distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$. We want to find the minimum size of a set $A'$ such that $A' \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$.\n\nLet $H_1$ and $H_2$ be two distinct subgroups in $\\mathcal{C}_7$. Since they are distinct subgroups of prime order 7, their intersection is just the trivial element: $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0\\}$.\nLet $a \\in A'$. If $a \\neq 0$, then $a$ belongs to exactly one cyclic subgroup, namely $\\langle a \\rangle$. If the order of $a$ is 7, then $\\langle a \\rangle$ is one of the subgroups in $\\mathcal{C}_7$. Therefore, a single non-zero element $a \\in A'$ can hit at most one subgroup from $\\mathcal{C}_7$.\n\nTo hit all $|\\mathcal{C}_7|$ subgroups, we will need at least $|\\mathcal{C}_7|$ distinct non-zero elements. A minimal set $A'$ can be constructed by picking exactly one non-zero element from each subgroup in $\\mathcal{C}_7$. The size of such a minimal set is $|A'| = |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Number of Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7**\nThe number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is given by:\n$$ |\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7 in } G}{\\text{Number of generators in a cyclic group of order 7}} $$\nThe number of generators in a cyclic group of order 7 is $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n\nTo find the number of elements of order 7, we first count the number of elements $g \\in G$ whose order divides 7. An element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ has an order dividing 7 if and only if $7g=0$, which is equivalent to $7g_i=0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the equation $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ implies that $x$ must be a multiple of 7. The multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. There are 7 such elements.\nFor each component $g_i$ of an element $g \\in G$, there are 7 choices for its value. Since there are 2024 components, the total number of elements in $G$ with order dividing 7 is $7^{2024}$.\nThis set of $7^{2024}$ elements forms a subgroup of $G$ (isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$). This subgroup contains exactly one element of order 1 (the zero element) and all other elements have order 7.\nSo, the number of elements of order 7 is $7^{2024} - 1$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7:\n$$ |\\mathcal{C}_7| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\nNote that $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, which means $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6, so $|\\mathcal{C}_7|$ is an integer.\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Final Answer**\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is $1 + |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n$$ |A| = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\nThis can be simplified:\n$$ |A| = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{6 + 7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6} $$"
