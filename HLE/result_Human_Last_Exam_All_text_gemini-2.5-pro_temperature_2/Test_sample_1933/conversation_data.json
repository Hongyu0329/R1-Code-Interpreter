    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where $S$ is a schema with 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Schema and the Logic\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them by $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A structure (or model) for this schema is a pair $M = (U, P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M)$, where $U$ is a non-empty set (the universe or domain) and each $P_i^M$ is a subset of $U$, representing the interpretation of the predicate $P_i$.\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic. The formulas in this logic are built using the predicates from $S$, the logical connectives for conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), false ($\\bot$), and the existential quantifier ($\\exists$). Equality is not part of this fragment.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Concept Class\n\nWe are interested in the sets defined by formulas with one free variable, say $x$. These sets are called \"concepts\". A concept defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ in a structure $M$ is the set $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$. The collection of all such concepts for a given structure $M$ forms the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$. The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_M$ over all possible structures $M$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of formulas $\\phi(x)$ in this logic:\n1.  **Atomic formulas**: Since the predicates are unary and there are no function symbols or constants, an atomic formula with a variable $v$ is of the form $P_i(v)$.\n2.  **Conjunction ($\\land$)**: We can form conjunctions of atomic formulas, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. This is a **positive monomial** in the free variable $x$. A general positive monomial is of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  **Existential quantifier ($\\exists$)**: We can apply existential quantification. For example, $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$. Since variables in different atomic formulas are distinct within the scope of this simple logic (no relations with arity > 1), we can distribute the quantifier:\n    $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y)) \\equiv P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$.\n    The part $P_1(x)$ has a free variable $x$, while $\\exists y P_2(y)$ is a **sentence** (no free variables). For any given structure $M$, a sentence is either true or false.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment can be shown to be equivalent to a formula of the form $M(x) \\land \\Psi$, where $M(x)$ is a positive monomial in $x$ and $\\Psi$ is a sentence constructed with $\\exists$ and $\\land$.\nFor a fixed structure $M$:\n*   If the sentence $\\Psi$ is false in $M$, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set $\\emptyset$. The formula $\\bot$ also defines the empty set.\n*   If the sentence $\\Psi$ is true in $M$, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $M(x)$. This defines the set of elements satisfying the monomial, i.e., $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$ for some $I$. The formula $\\top$ defines the entire universe $U$, which corresponds to a monomial with an empty index set ($I=\\emptyset$).\n\nTherefore, for any structure $M$, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is a subset of the class of sets definable by positive monomials:\n$\\mathcal{C}_M \\subseteq \\mathcal{H}_M = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered by the concept class. A set $A$ is shattered by a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ if for every subset $A' \\subseteq A$, there exists a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $C \\cap A = A'$.\n\nWe will show that the VC dimension is 4 by proving a lower bound and an upper bound.\n\n#### Lower Bound: VC-dim $\\ge 4$\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a structure $M$ and a set $A \\subseteq U$ of size 4 that is shattered by the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nLet the universe be $U = A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$.\nWe define the interpretations of the 4 predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on the set $A$ as follows:\nFor $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let $a_j \\in P_i^M$ if and only if $j \\neq i$.\nThis means:\n*   $P_1^M = \\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$\n*   $P_2^M = \\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\}$\n*   $P_3^M = \\{a_1, a_2, a_4\\}$\n*   $P_4^M = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$\n\nNow we check if $A$ is shattered. We must show that for any subset $A' \\subseteq A$, there exists a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}_M$ such that $C \\cap A = A'$. The concepts we use are the monomials $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$, which are definable by formulas $\\phi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\nLet's analyze which subset is \"picked out\" by a concept $C_I$:\nAn element $a_j \\in A$ is in $C_I$ if and only if $a_j \\in P_i^M$ for all $i \\in I$.\nBy our definition, this is equivalent to: $j \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I$.\nThis simply means that the index $j$ must not be in the set $I$. So, $C_I = \\{ a_j \\in A \\mid j \\notin I \\}$.\n\nNow, let $A'$ be an arbitrary subset of $A$. Let $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be the set of indices such that $A' = \\{a_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$.\nWe need to find an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $C_I = A'$.\nBased on our finding, we need $\\{a_j \\mid j \\notin I\\} = \\{a_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$. This requires the condition $j \\notin I \\iff j \\in J$, which means $I$ must be the complement of $J$, i.e., $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$.\nSince for any set of indices $J$, its complement $I$ is also a valid subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we can generate any subset of $A$ by choosing the appropriate monomial.\n\nFor example, to get the subset $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, we have $J=\\{1,3\\}$. We must choose $I=\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\setminus\\{1,3\\}=\\{2,4\\}$. The concept is $C_{\\{2,4\\}} = P_2^M \\cap P_4^M$.\nAn element $a_j$ is in this intersection iff $j \\neq 2$ and $j \\neq 4$. The values of $j$ that satisfy this are $1$ and $3$. So $C_{\\{2,4\\}} = \\{a_1, a_3\\}$.\n\nSince we can form all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $A$, the set $A$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Upper Bound: VC-dim $\\le 4$\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we show that no set of size 5 can be shattered.\nLet $A$ be any set of points with $|A|=5$. To shatter $A$, the concept class must be able to generate all $2^5 = 32$ subsets of $A$.\nThis means that for the chosen structure $M$, the set of intersections $\\{C \\cap A \\mid C \\in \\mathcal{C}_M\\}$ must have size 32.\nThe number of distinct concepts in $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is at most the number of subsets $I$ of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, because every concept in $\\mathcal{C}_M$ corresponds to one such intersection (or the empty set, which is often achievable by an intersection anyway).\nThe number of subsets $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is $2^4 = 16$.\nSo, $|\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 16$.\nThe number of distinct subsets of $A$ that can be generated is at most the number of concepts, so $|\\{C \\cap A \\mid C \\in \\mathcal{C}_M\\}| \\le |\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 16$.\nSince $16 < 32$, it's impossible to generate all 32 subsets of $A$. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower bound and the upper bound, we have shown that the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\nThe VC dimension is at least 4, and the VC dimension is at most 4. Thus, the VC dimension is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
