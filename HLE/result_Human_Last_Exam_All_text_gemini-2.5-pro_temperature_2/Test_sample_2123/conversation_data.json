    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Object:** A surname.\n    *   **Whose surname?** An English poet.\n    *   **Context:** It appears in the Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Specific Scene:** The description of \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Name the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Clue:** The connection lies between the Russian description and the English name. The vagueness of \"a certain essay\" suggests this is a well-known piece of linguistic trivia or a pun, rather than a specific text to be found and read.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Key Russian Phrase:**\n    *   The description is of \"wide boulevards.\"\n    *   The Russian word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy). In its short-form plural, used to describe boulevards (\"бульвары\" - bul'vary), it becomes \"**широки**\" (shiroki).\n    *   Let's pronounce this word: \"shee-ro-KEE\".\n\n4.  **Connect the Russian Phrase to an English Poet:**\n    *   We are looking for an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds similar to \"**широки**\" (shiroki).\n    *   Let's consider famous English poets: Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, Shelley.\n    *   The surname \"Shelley\" is transliterated into Russian as \"**Шелли**\" (pronounced \"SHELL-i\").\n    *   The words \"**широки**\" (shiroki) and \"**Шелли**\" (Shelley) are phonetically similar enough to form a well-known pun in Russian literary circles. A translator could cleverly write a sentence like \"Бульвары Вены широки, как Шелли\" which translates literally to \"The boulevards of Vienna are as wide as Shelley,\" creating a play on words.\n\n5.  **Verify the Poet's Identity:**\n    *   The surname is **Shelley**.\n    *   The poet is Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n    *   Is he an English poet? Yes, he is one of the most prominent English Romantic poets.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The puzzle hinges on this famous pun. The Russian word for \"wide\" (широки) is phonetically close to the Russian version of the surname of the English poet Shelley (Шелли).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The linguistic trap:** The puzzle is not about finding a specific essay but about understanding a linguistic pun that exists within the Russian language and its connection to English literature.\n*   **The importance of translation:** The phrase \"in the Russian translation\" is the most crucial part of the question, directing the analysis towards the Russian language.\n*   **Phonetic similarity:** The solution relies on recognizing the similar sounds of the two words, not on their spelling.\n*   **Vagueness of the source:** The \"certain essay\" is deliberately not named because the pun is more famous than its original source, which may even be apocryphal.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the English poet's surname is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
