    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the origin of the modern word \"sister\".\n\nThe current Modern English word \"sister\" is not a direct, phonetically regular descendant of the Old English word. Etymologists confirm that its modern form, particularly the 'i' vowel and the hard 's' sound at the beginning (instead of 'sw'), is the result of influence from the Old Norse word *systir*. The two words were cognates (descended from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestēr*), so they were similar enough for the Norse form to blend with and eventually replace the native English one in the language that emerged from the Danelaw and became standard.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.\n\nThe word for \"sister\" in Old English, the language spoken before the Norman Conquest and before heavy Norse influence, was ***sweostor***. There was also a common dialectal variant, ***swuster***.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the likely phonological development of the Old English word without external influence.\n\nTo figure out what *sweostor* would have become, we must trace its path through the regular sound changes that transformed Old English into Middle English and then into Modern English.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English word was ***sweostor*** or ***swuster***. As English evolved into Middle English (c. 1100-1500), these native forms developed in areas with less Scandinavian influence.\n    *   The form *sweostor* tended to become *sester*. The diphthong \"eo\" simplified, and the initial \"sw\" was sometimes reduced to \"s\".\n    *   The variant *swuster* became the most common native form in Middle English: ***suster***. This form is seen frequently in the writings of Chaucer and others from the south of England, away from the heaviest Norse settlement.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English:** Now we must project the most common native form, ***suster***, forward into Modern English. This involves a major sound change known as the \"Foot-Strut Split\" that occurred around the 17th century.\n    *   In Middle English, the 'u' in *suster* was pronounced like the 'u' in the modern word \"put\" or \"foot\" (a short /ʊ/ sound).\n    *   During the 16th-17th centuries, this short /ʊ/ vowel sound \"split\" in most words. It remained /ʊ/ in some contexts (e.g., *put*, *full*, *butcher*) but in most cases, it unrounded and lowered to become the /ʌ/ vowel, which we hear today in words like **\"cut\"**, **\"run\"**, and **\"sun\"**.\n    *   The word *sunu* (son) in Old English became *sone* in Middle English (pronounced with an /ʊ/ sound), which then evolved into our modern word **\"son\"** (pronounced with an /ʌ/ sound).\n    *   Applying this same, regular sound change to the Middle English word *suster* (/sʊstər/), the vowel would have changed from /ʊ/ to /ʌ/.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Cognate Influence:** The Norse and Anglo-Saxon words were very similar, making replacement easier than if they had been completely different.\n*   **Regional Variation:** The native form *suster* survived for centuries, particularly in southern and western dialects of English, while the Norse-influenced *sister* became dominant in the north and Midlands before eventually becoming the standard.\n*   **Predictability of Sound Change:** While historical linguistics can't predict the future with 100% certainty, it can reliably reconstruct past pathways based on consistent, observable sound changes. The development from Middle English *suster* to a modern form rhyming with \"cluster\" follows the most common and regular of these changes.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nIf the Norse had never invaded, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have continued its natural development. Its most common Middle English form, *suster*, would have undergone the regular English sound changes to become the Modern English word. Therefore, the word would be spelled identically to its Middle English form but pronounced differently.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
