    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source and Episode:** The question specifically points to the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\" and the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n2.  **Identify the Scene:** The scene in question is the Junior prom, which the Teen Girl Squad characters are attending.\n3.  **Identify the \"Performance\":** The girls are excited to see who is performing musically at the prom. The \"stage\" is revealed to be a simple table with a sign that says \"LIVE MUSIC!\".\n4.  **Identify the \"Performer\":** Instead of a live band, the musical guest is a cardboard cutout of a male singer with an acoustic guitar, accompanied by a boombox playing music.\n5.  **Identify the Name:** The narrator of the cartoon, Strong Bad, introduces the performer by saying, \"It's a cardboard cutout of... **Thompkins**!\"\n6.  **Confirmation:** So What's Her Face asks, \"Who's Thompkins?\" and Cheerleader explains he's \"that guy from that band that my older sister likes,\" confirming he is a fictional musician within the cartoon's universe.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The question correctly specifies that the performer is a **cardboard cutout**, not a live person. This is a key part of the joke in the cartoon.\n*   The name is clearly stated by the narrator, Strong Bad.\n*   The character \"Thompkins\" is fictional, created specifically for this episode to parody the archetype of a sensitive, acoustic singer-songwriter popular with an older sibling's generation.\n*   The episode is indeed #15 in the Teen Girl Squad series.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the fictional singer is Thompkins.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
