    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Flag of Tonga\nThe flag of Tonga consists of two main parts:\n1.  A red field, which makes up the main body of the flag.\n2.  A white canton (a rectangular area) in the upper-left corner (the hoist).\nInside the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton, meaning there is a white border surrounding the cross within the canton. The cross itself is a standard Greek cross, composed of a vertical bar and a horizontal bar.\n\n### Step 2: Define the matrix representation\nWe represent an image of the flag as an `m x n` matrix, `M`.\n-   Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`.\n-   Every white pixel is assigned a value `b`.\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximal possible rank*. This means we can choose the dimensions of the matrix (`m` and `n`), the dimensions of the canton and the cross, and the values of `a` and `b`, in any way that is consistent with the flag's description, to maximize the rank.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of the rows of the matrix\nLet's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in the matrix `M`. The rows of the matrix correspond to horizontal slices of the flag.\n\nA row vector can be of two kinds depending on its vertical position `i` (from `1` to `m`):\n\n**Case 1: The row is below the canton.**\nIf a row `i` is below the canton (i.e., its index `i` is greater than the height of the canton `k`), it passes only through the red field of the flag. Therefore, every element in this row will be `a`.\nLet's call this row type `R_A`. `R_A = [a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n\n**Case 2: The row is within the canton area (vertically).**\nIf a row `i` is within the top `k` rows of the flag, its first `l` elements (where `l` is the width of the canton) correspond to a horizontal slice of the canton, and the remaining `n-l` elements correspond to the red field.\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of a row within the canton. A horizontal slice of the canton can either:\n    a) pass through the horizontal bar of the red cross.\n    b) pass through the white area above or below the horizontal bar of the cross.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: Row passes through the horizontal bar of the red cross.**\n    The entire horizontal bar of the cross is red. So, the first `l` elements of this row will all be `a`. The rest of the row (`n-l` elements) is also from the red field, so those elements are also `a`. Thus, this entire row is `[a, a, ..., a]`, which is the same as `R_A`.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: Row passes through the white area of the canton.**\n    This row does not intersect the horizontal bar of the red cross. The first `l` elements correspond to a slice of the white field with the vertical bar of the red cross. This row will have `b`'s (for the white parts) and `a`'s (for the vertical bar of the cross). The remaining `n-l` elements of the row are from the red field and will be `a`'s.\n    So this row will look like: `[b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, ..., a]`.\n    Let's call this row type `R_B`. All rows of this type are identical because the vertical red cross bar is in the same column position for all of them.\n\n**Conclusion of Row Analysis:**\nAny row in the entire matrix `M` must be either of type `R_A` or type `R_B`. This means the entire row space of the matrix `M` is spanned by these two vectors, `R_A` and `R_B`.\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space. Since the row space is spanned by at most two vectors, the rank of `M` can be at most 2.\n`rank(M) = dim(span(R_A, R_B)) <= 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if rank 2 is achievable\nTo achieve the maximal rank of 2, we need to show that we can make the two row vectors `R_A` and `R_B` linearly independent. Two vectors are linearly independent if neither is a scalar multiple of the other.\n\n`R_A = [a, a, ..., a]`\n`R_B = [b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a]`\n\nLet's choose specific non-trivial values for `a` and `b`. For instance, let `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n`R_A = [1, 1, ..., 1]`\n`R_B = [0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1]`\n\nClearly, `R_A` is not a multiple of `R_B`, and `R_B` is not a multiple of `R_A` (since it contains both zeros and ones). Thus, they are linearly independent.\n\nWe must also ensure that the flag's features exist. This requires:\n-   A red field (`a`) and a white part (`b`), so `a != b`.\n-   The flag to have a part outside the canton (e.g., `n > l`).\n-   The canton to have a red cross and a white border.\n\nAll these conditions can be satisfied by choosing appropriate dimensions for the flag and its features. For example, a 10x20 matrix with a 5x10 canton containing a cross would have both types of rows.\n\nSince we have found two linearly independent row types, and we've shown there cannot be more than two, the maximal possible rank is 2. The same conclusion can be reached by analyzing the columns of the matrix.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly model the flag's geometry:** The specific structure with a canton and a couped cross is key.\n2.  **Analyze the structure by row types:** Instead of complex block matrix algebra, analyzing the possible types of rows simplifies the problem significantly.\n3.  **Recognize the repetition:** The key insight is that despite the complex description, the flag's structure results in only two unique types of rows (or columns).\n4.  **Maximize the rank:** To find the *maximal* rank, we need to show not just that the rank is at most 2, but that rank 2 can be achieved by a valid choice of parameters (`a`, `b`, and dimensions). This is achieved by ensuring the two row types are linearly independent.\n5.  **Don't overcomplicate:** The problem might seem to hint at a more complex answer, but a careful, fundamental analysis shows it is quite constrained. For instance, considering anti-aliased pixels or non-standard cross shapes is not supported by the problem statement.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe matrix of the Tonga flag is composed of rows of just two types:\n1. A row that is all `a`.\n2. A row that contains `b`'s and `a`'s.\nThe space spanned by these two vectors has a dimension of at most 2. We can choose `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1`, `b=0`) to make them linearly independent. Thus, the maximum possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
