    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific modern geographical location (a Vietnamese province) linked to a specific historical event (the first major defeat of Ming General Mu Sheng).\n\n**2. Identify the Key Historical Figures and Events**\n*   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A prominent general of the Ming Dynasty in China. He was involved in multiple campaigns in Vietnam during the period of Ming rule (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination, 1407-1427).\n*   **First Major Defeat:** This implies we are not looking for a minor skirmish but a significant battle with strategic consequences for Mu Sheng's army. It also specifies his *first* such defeat. Mu Sheng was involved in the initial successful invasion against the Hồ Dynasty in 1406-1407, so his major defeat must have occurred later, during the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**3. Analyze Mu Sheng's Role in the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427)**\n*   The Lam Sơn Uprising grew into a major threat to Ming control. By 1426, Ming forces under General Wang Tong were besieged in Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi).\n*   In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two massive relief armies to crush the Vietnamese rebellion.\n    *   One army, led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), came from the northeast (Guangxi).\n    *   The other army, led by **Mu Sheng**, came from the north/northwest (Yunnan).\n*   The plan was for these two armies to trap and destroy Lê Lợi's forces. This 1427 campaign would be the setting for Mu Sheng's major military test as a commander against the Lam Sơn forces.\n\n**4. Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Defeat in the 1427 Campaign**\n*   Liu Sheng's army advanced first and was famously ambushed and utterly destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang. Liu Sheng himself was killed.\n*   Meanwhile, Mu Sheng's army was advancing from Yunnan down the Thao River (the upper part of the Red River). As he advanced, he was harassed by Vietnamese forces led by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả.\n*   Upon hearing the catastrophic news of Liu Sheng's total defeat, panic began to set in among Mu Sheng's troops.\n*   The decisive engagement for Mu Sheng's army occurred at **Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lãnh Câu)** and **Đan Xá**. Vietnamese forces under Phạm Văn Xảo first attacked and defeated the Ming vanguard at Đan Xá. Following this, the main force under Mu Sheng was blocked and attacked at Lãnh Câu Pass.\n*   This defeat was not just a tactical loss but a strategic one. It shattered the morale of the Ming army. Faced with the destruction of the other main army and his own defeat, Mu Sheng chose to abandon the campaign entirely and ordered a panicked retreat back to Yunnan, losing many men and supplies in the process. This constitutes his first and most significant defeat as a commanding general during the war.\n\n**5. Locate the Historical Battle Site in Modern Vietnam**\n*   The key locations of the battle were Lãnh Câu Pass and Đan Xá, situated along the Thao River.\n*   Historical and geographical mapping places **Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lãnh Câu)** in the territory of what is today **Tuyên Quang Province**.\n*   The related skirmish at Đan Xá is located in modern Phú Thọ Province, which borders Tuyên Quang. However, the battle at Lãnh Câu Pass is often cited as the decisive moment that broke Mu Sheng's army and is located firmly within Tuyên Quang.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Distinguishing between Generals:** It's crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng (Lạng Sơn Province) or the predicament of Wang Tong in Hanoi. The question is specifically about Mu Sheng.\n*   **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** The battles at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá qualify as a major defeat because they resulted in the complete failure of a major army's strategic objective and forced its full retreat from the theater of war.\n*   **Mapping to a *Current* Province:** The historical names of locations must be correctly mapped to the present-day administrative divisions of Vietnam. Lãnh Câu Pass is definitively located in modern Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in 1427 during his campaign to relieve the siege of Dongguan. His army was decisively beaten by Vietnamese forces at Lãnh Câu Pass, forcing his complete retreat. This historical location falls within the borders of the modern Vietnamese province of Tuyên Quang.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
