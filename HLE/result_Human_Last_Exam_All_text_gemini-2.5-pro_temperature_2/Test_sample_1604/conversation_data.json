    "This question requires identifying the most recent historical battle depicted in any of the works of the British military painter, Lady Butler (Elizabeth Thompson).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the artist and her significant works:**\n    Lady Butler (1846–1933) was famous for her detailed and evocative military paintings. To answer the question, we must compile a list of her major paintings that depict specific battles or military campaigns and identify the historical date of each event.\n\n2.  **List key paintings and the dates of the events they depict:**\n    Here is a chronological list of the historical events depicted in some of her famous paintings:\n    *   ***Steady the Drums and Fifes*** (painted 1897): Depicts an event during the **Battle of Albuera (16 May 1811)** during the Peninsular War.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Shows the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815)**.\n    *   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Portrays the aftermath of the disastrous **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War, with the specific scene dated to 13 January 1842.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Represents a roll call after the **Battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854)** during the Crimean War.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift (22–23 January 1879)** during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Depicts the **Battle of Tel El Kebir (13 September 1882)** in the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n    *   ***The charge of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman*** (c. 1898): Depicts a charge during the **Battle of Omdurman (2 September 1898)** in the Mahdist War.\n    *   ***The Dorsetshire Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt, February 26th 1916*** (painted 1917): Depicts a cavalry charge during the **Affair of Agagia (26 February 1916)**, part of the Senussi Campaign in World War I.\n    *   ***A Lament in the Desert*** (painted 1925): A post-war painting representing \"The Missing of the Australian Light Horse in Palestine.\" This references the casualties from the **Sinai and Palestine Campaign (1915–1918)** of World War I.\n\n3.  **Compare the historical dates to find the latest event:**\n    Looking at the dates of the conflicts, they range from the Napoleonic Wars (1811, 1815) to World War I. The latest conflicts depicted are from World War I. We need to compare the specific events from this period that Lady Butler painted.\n\n4.  **Identify the latest specific battle:**\n    *   The painting *The Dorsetshire Yeomanry at Agagia* depicts a specific, named action that took place on **February 26, 1916**.\n    *   The painting *A Lament in the Desert* refers to the entire Sinai and Palestine Campaign, which lasted from **1915 until the Armistice of Mudros in October 1918**. The Australian Light Horse, the subject of the painting, fought in numerous battles throughout this campaign, including some of its final major engagements.\n    *   A significant and late engagement in this campaign involving the Australian Light Horse was the **Battle of Megiddo (19–25 September 1918)**. This battle occurred over two and a half years after the Affair of Agagia.\n    *   Although *A Lament in the Desert* is a memorial piece and doesn't depict the battle itself, its subject is the aftermath of battles from this campaign. Consistent with her other famous works like *The Roll Call* and *The Remnants of an Army*, which depict consequences rather than action, this painting is thematically tied to the battles of the campaign. Therefore, the historical events it represents are the latest.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Sinai and Palestine Campaign (1915-1918) is the latest conflict depicted by Lady Butler. The final major battle of this campaign was the Battle of Megiddo. Thus, this represents the latest historical battle referenced in her work.\n\n<<<Battle of Megiddo"
