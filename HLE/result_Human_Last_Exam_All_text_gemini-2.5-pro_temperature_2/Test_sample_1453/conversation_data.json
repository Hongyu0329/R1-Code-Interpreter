    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat `(abcdefg)`**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil, driving its formation through the \"knobs-into-holes\" hydrophobic packing interaction.\n\nLet's examine the sequence to find this pattern:\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nWe are looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues spaced by 2 and 3 other residues (i.e., at positions `i`, `i+3`, `i+4`, `i+7`, etc.). The key hydrophobic residues in the sequence are I, A, L, and W.\n\nLet's test the most likely alignment where `A` is at the `a` position and `L`/`W` is at the `d` position. This corresponds to a repeating `AxxL` (or `AxxW`) motif.\n\nSequence:   ... `I`  `A`  `Q`  `S`  `L`  `K`  `E` ...\nProposed   ... `g`  `a`  `b`  `c`  `d`  `e`  `f` ...\nRegister:\n\nLet's apply this register to the full sequence:\nSequence:     `GE` `I A Q S L K E` `I A K S L K E` `I A W S L K E` `I A Q S L K` `G`\nHeptad #:         (flank)   (Heptad 1)    (Heptad 2)    (Heptad 3)    (Heptad 4)   (flank)\nRegister:          `fg` `a b c d e f g` `a b c d e f g` `a b c d e f g` `a b c d e f`   `g`\n\nLet's list the amino acids at each position of the heptad repeat:\n*   **Position `a` (core):** A, A, A, A\n*   **Position `b`:** Q, K, W, Q\n*   **Position `c`:** S, S, S, S\n*   **Position `d` (core):** L, L, W, L\n*   **Position `e`:** K, K, K, K\n*   **Position `f`:** E, E, E, L\n*   **Position `g`:** I, I, I, I\n\nThis alignment is chemically sensible. The core `a` and `d` positions are filled exclusively with hydrophobic residues (A, L, W). The `g` position is also hydrophobic (I), and the `e` position is consistently charged (K), which is common for forming stabilizing salt bridges with oppositely charged residues on adjacent helices.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d`) and Their Packing Implications**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) due to packing constraints.\n\n*   **Residues at position `a`:** Alanine (A) for all four heptads. Alanine is the second smallest amino acid, with just a methyl group as its side chain.\n*   **Residues at position `d`:** Mostly Leucine (L), with one Tryptophan (W). Both Leucine and Tryptophan are large, bulky hydrophobic residues.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Packing Efficiency for Different Oligomeric States**\n\n*   **Trimer (3-helix bundle) & Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** In parallel trimers and tetramers, the hydrophobic core is packed in layers. Residues at the `a` positions of each helix pack against each other (`a-a-a` in a trimer), and residues at the `d` positions pack against each other (`d-d-d` in a trimer). This is called *axial* or *parallel* packing.\n    *   **The `a`-layer:** Packing three or four small Alanine residues together would leave a significant empty space, or cavity, in the center of the core. This is energetically very unfavorable, as it breaks the hydrophobic effect and is structurally unstable. Therefore, a trimeric or tetrameric state is highly unlikely for this sequence.\n*   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** In a canonical parallel dimer, the packing is different. The \"knobs\" from one helix fit into \"holes\" on the adjacent helix in a way that is often described as *perpendicular* packing. Specifically, a residue at position `a` on one helix packs into a hole formed by residues on the partner helix, and a residue at position `d` packs into a different hole. The packing is not `a-a` or `d-d`.\n    *   **Packing Compatibility:** This packing arrangement can easily accommodate knobs of different sizes. The small knob (Alanine at `a`) fits comfortably into its corresponding hole on the partner helix. The large knobs (Leucine/Tryptophan at `d`) also fit into their respective holes. The asymmetry between the small `a` residue and the large `d` residue is sterically well-tolerated in a dimer and, in fact, is characteristic of many known dimeric coiled-coils (like the GCN4 leucine zipper, which has `V` at `a` and `L` at `d`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe consistent presence of a small amino acid (Alanine) at the `a` position and large amino acids (Leucine/Tryptophan) at the `d` position strongly disfavors trimeric or higher-order oligomers due to inefficient core packing that would create a central cavity. This pattern is, however, highly compatible with the knobs-into-holes packing of a **dimeric** coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the most probable oligomeric state for this protein sequence is 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
