    "This problem asks for the number of distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Group $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$ is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nFor our problem, the order is 128, so $2^n = 128$, which implies $n=7$. The group is $Q_{128} = Q_{2^7}$.\nThe presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nKey structural features of $Q_{128}$:\n*   It has a maximal cyclic subgroup of index 2, $C = \\langle x \\rangle$, which has order 64.\n*   Every element of $G$ can be written either as $x^i$ for some $0 \\le i < 64$ (if it's in $C$), or as $yx^i$ for some $0 \\le i < 64$ (if it's in the coset $yC$).\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $H$ is equal to $G^n$, where $G^n = \\langle g^n \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. This is the subgroup generated by all $n$-th powers of elements of $G$. Our goal is to compute $G^n$ for all $n \\ge 1$ and count how many distinct subgroups we get.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the $n$-th Powers of Elements in $Q_{128}$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^n$ for every $g \\in Q_{128}$. We consider the two types of elements.\n1.  **Elements in $C = \\langle x \\rangle$**: Let $g = x^i$. Then $g^n = (x^i)^n = x^{in}$.\n2.  **Elements not in $C$**: Let $g = yx^i$. We first compute the square of $g$:\n    $g^2 = (yx^i)^2 = yx^i yx^i = y(x^i y x^{-i})x^{2i}$.\n    From the relation $yxy^{-1}=x^{-1}$, we get $yx^i y^{-1} = (yxy^{-1})^i = (x^{-1})^i = x^{-i}$.\n    So, $yx^i = x^{-i}y$.\n    $g^2 = (x^{-i}y)(yx^i) = x^{-i}y^2 x^i = x^{-i}x^{32}x^i = x^{32}$.\n    This is a crucial result: for any element $g \\in G \\setminus C$, its square is $g^2 = x^{32}$, which is the unique element of order 2 in $G$.\n\nNow we can compute $g^n$ for $g = yx^i$:\n*   If **$n$ is even** (let $n = 2k$):\n    $g^n = (g^2)^k = (x^{32})^k = x^{32k}$.\n*   If **$n$ is odd** (let $n = 2k+1$):\n    $g^n = g \\cdot (g^2)^k = (yx^i)(x^{32})^k = yx^i x^{32k} = yx^{i+32k}$. (Using $y(x^j)=(x^{-j})y$, which is not quite right here). Let's use the other form: $g^n = (g^2)^k g = x^{32k}(yx^i)$. Using $x^j y = yx^{-j}$: $x^{32k} yx^i = y x^{-32k} x^i = yx^{i-32k}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Power Subgroups $G^n$**\n\nThe subgroup $G^n$ is generated by all these powers.\n$G^n = \\langle \\{ (x^i)^n \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (yx^i)^n \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\rangle$.\nThe first set of generators $\\{ x^{in} \\}$ generates the subgroup $\\langle x^n \\rangle$, which is equal to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$.\nWe analyze based on the parity of $n$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $n$ is odd.**\n    Let $n = 2k+1$. Since $n$ is odd, $\\gcd(n, 64)=1$.\n    The first set of generators produces $\\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle = \\langle x^1 \\rangle = C$.\n    The second set of generators is $\\{ (yx^i)^n \\} = \\{ yx^{i-32k} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$. Since the map $i \\mapsto i-32k \\pmod{64}$ is a permutation of indices, this set is exactly the coset $yC$.\n    So, for odd $n$, $G^n = \\langle C \\cup yC \\rangle = \\langle G \\rangle = G$.\n    This means for any odd integer $n$, the power subgroup is $Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n$ is even.**\n    Let $n = 2k$.\n    The first set of generators produces $\\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$.\n    The second set of generators $\\{ (yx^i)^n \\}$ consists of just one element, $x^{32k}$.\n    So, $G^n = \\langle \\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle, x^{32k} \\rangle$.\n    Let's check if $x^{32k}$ is already in $\\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$. Let $d = \\gcd(n, 64) = \\gcd(2k, 64)$. We need to know if $x^{32k}$ is a power of $x^d$. This is true if $d$ divides $32k$.\n    Since $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$, we know $d$ divides $2k$. Let $2k = m \\cdot d$ for some integer $m$. Then $32k = 16 \\cdot (2k) = 16md$. This shows that $d$ divides $32k$.\n    Therefore, $x^{32k} \\in \\langle x^d \\rangle$, and the second generator is redundant.\n    So, for even $n$, $G^n = \\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nWe need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\nFrom Case 1 (n odd), we get one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\nFrom Case 2 (n even), we get subgroups of the form $H_d = \\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(n, 64)$ for some even integer $n$.\nLet's find all possible values for $d$:\n1.  $d$ must be a divisor of 64. The divisors of 64 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n2.  Since $n$ is even, $n=2k$. So $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$. As 2 divides both $2k$ and 64, their gcd must be divisible by 2. Thus, $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\nThe even divisors of 64 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\nFor each such even divisor $d_i$, we can choose $n = d_i$ (which is an even number) to get $\\gcd(d_i, 64) = d_i$. So all these values are possible.\nThis gives us the following distinct subgroups:\n1.  $d=2 \\implies \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n2.  $d=4 \\implies \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n3.  $d=8 \\implies \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n4.  $d=16 \\implies \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n5.  $d=32 \\implies \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2, the center of $Q_{128}$)\n6.  $d=64 \\implies \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese are **six** distinct subgroups. They are all cyclic and proper subgroups of $Q_{128}$, so they are distinct from the subgroup found in Case 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is:\n$\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Group Identification:** Correctly identify the group as $Q_{128}$ and use its specific presentation with $x^{64}=1$ and $y^2=x^{32}$.\n2.  **Power Definition:** Remember that $G^n$ is the subgroup *generated* by $n$-th powers, not just the set of them.\n3.  **Element Power Calculation:** The calculation $(yx^i)^2 = x^{32}$ is a key step that simplifies the entire problem. Any mistake here would lead to an incorrect result.\n4.  **Case Distinction:** The analysis hinges on splitting the problem into two cases based on the parity of the exponent $n$.\n5.  **GCD Property:** Using $\\langle x^n \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(n, \\text{ord}(x))} \\rangle$ is essential for identifying the cyclic subgroups generated by powers.\n6.  **Redundancy of Generators:** For even $n$, showing that the generator $x^{32k}$ is contained within $\\langle x^{\\gcd(n, 64)} \\rangle$ is crucial to simplify the form of $G^n$.\n7.  **Exhaustiveness:** We must ensure we've found all possible subgroups. The argument shows that any $G^n$ must be of one of the two forms derived, and we've counted all possibilities for each form.\n8.  **Distinctness:** The final set of subgroups must be checked for distinctness. Here, one subgroup is non-abelian ($Q_{128}$), while the other six are cyclic subgroups of different orders, so they are all distinct.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
