    "Answering this question involves analyzing the homotopy groups of the spaces involved and the effect of the map on these groups. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n\nLet's break down the problem into steps:\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\nThe map is $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n*   **Domain:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Here $\\Sigma$ is the reduced suspension, $\\Omega$ is the based loop space, and $\\wedge$ is the smash product.\n*   **Codomain:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^p \\wedge S^q \\cong S^{p+q}$, we have $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$. So, the codomain is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\nThe map is therefore $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$. This map is a well-known map in homotopy theory, often related to the generalized Whitehead product or second-order Hopf invariant.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain\nTo find the connectivity of the map, we first need to know the connectivity of the spaces themselves. The connectivity of a space $Z$ is the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(Z)=0$ for all $i \\le n$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the loop spaces:**\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected. The loop space $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected, with the first non-trivial homotopy group being $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $S^6$ is 5-connected. The loop space $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected, with the first non-trivial homotopy group being $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the smash product:**\n    Let $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. The connectivity of a smash product of CW-complexes $A \\wedge B$ is $\\text{conn}(A) + \\text{conn}(B) + 2$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(W) = \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8$.\n    This calculation is off. It should be $\\text{conn}(A) + \\text{conn}(B) + 1$. No, we should use homology.\n    Let's check the homology. The integral homology of $\\Omega S^{2n}$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$ in dimensions $k(2n-1)$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_*(\\Omega S^4)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$ in dimensions $3, 6, 9, \\dots$.\n    *   $\\tilde{H}_*(\\Omega S^6)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$ in dimensions $5, 10, \\dots$.\n    By the Künneth formula for smash products, $\\tilde{H}_k(W) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i+j=k} \\tilde{H}_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_j(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    The lowest degree non-trivial group is for $k=3+5=8$. $\\tilde{H}_8(W) \\cong \\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, $W$ is 7-connected. By the Hurewicz theorem, $\\pi_8(W) \\cong H_8(W) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the domain:**\n    The domain is $X = \\Sigma W = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $W$ is 7-connected, its suspension $\\Sigma W$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n    The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(X)$. By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\pi_8(W) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the codomain:**\n    The codomain is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$. Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, its loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\n    The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, and their first non-trivial homotopy group is in degree 9 and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The map $f_*$ on homotopy groups is an isomorphism $0 \\to 0$ for all $i < 9$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group ($\\pi_9$)\nWe need to determine if $f_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$ is an isomorphism. This amounts to determining if the map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by $\\pm 1$.\n\nThe map $f$ is the adjoint of a map $f^{ad}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$. On the level of homotopy groups, we analyze $f^{ad}_*: \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$. The relation is $f_* \\circ \\Sigma_* = (f^{ad})_*$, where $\\Sigma_*: \\pi_8 \\to \\pi_9$ is the suspension isomorphism. Thus, $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$ if and only if $f^{ad}_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_8$.\n\nThe map $f^{ad}$ can be understood as a composition of two maps:\n1.  A map $c: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega S^9$, related to the Samelson product. This map captures the \"commutator\" of loops in $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$ and is known to induce an isomorphism on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_8$.\n2.  A map $g: \\Omega S^9 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$, which arises from the geometry of fibrations relating smash and wedge products. This map induces the suspension homomorphism $E: \\pi_k(\\Omega S^9) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^9) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{k+2}(S^{10})$. On $\\pi_8$, this is the map $E: \\pi_9(S^9) \\to \\pi_{10}(S^{10})$. By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, this is an isomorphism.\n\nSince $f^{ad}_* = g_* \\circ c_*$ and both $g_*$ and $c_*$ are isomorphisms on $\\pi_8$, the composite $f^{ad}_*$ is also an isomorphism. Consequently, $f_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$ is an isomorphism.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the map on the next homotopy group ($\\pi_{10}$)\nSince $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the connectivity is at least 9. To check if it is 10, we must check if $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$ (which is true) and an epimorphism for $i=10$. We check the map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$.\n\n*   **Target group:** $\\pi_{10}(Y) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. By the Freudenthal theorem, $E: \\pi_{10}(S^9) \\to \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$ is an isomorphism. From tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{10}(S^9) \\cong \\pi_1^S(S^0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, $\\pi_{10}(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n*   **Source group:** $\\pi_{10}(X) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6))$. Since $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = 7$, we are within the range of the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem ($10 < 2 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 15$). So, $\\pi_{10}(X) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    The space $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, so by the Hurewicz Isomorphism Theorem, we can approximate this group by computing homology.\n    $\\pi_9(W) \\cong H_9(W; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\tilde{H}_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Using the Künneth formula, $\\tilde{H}_9(W) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=9} \\tilde{H}_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_j(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    As stated before, $\\tilde{H}_i(\\Omega S^4)$ is non-zero only for $i=3, 6, 9, \\dots$. And $\\tilde{H}_j(\\Omega S^6)$ is non-zero only for $j=5, 10, \\dots$. For positive integers $i,j$, there is no pair $(i,j)$ such that $i$ is a multiple of 3, $j$ is a multiple of 5, and $i+j=9$. Thus, $\\tilde{H}_9(W) = 0$.\n    This implies $\\pi_9(W) = 0$, so $\\pi_{10}(X)=0$.\n\n*   **The map on $\\pi_{10}$:** The map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$ is a map from $0$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This map is not an epimorphism (surjection).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion on Connectivity\n*   For $i<9$, $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism ($0 \\to 0$).\n*   For $i=9$, $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism ($\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$), and thus is also an epimorphism. This satisfies the condition for connectivity 9.\n*   For $i=10$, $\\pi_{10}(f)$ is not an epimorphism.\nThe definition requires finding the largest $k$ such that $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\nFor $k=9$, the conditions are met. For $k=10$, the condition that $\\pi_{10}(f)$ is an epimorphism fails. Therefore, the connectivity is 9."
