    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify Reactants, Reagents, and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring, with defined stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemistry and Conformation of the Substrate**\n*   The stereochemical designators (1S, 2R) for a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane indicate that the bromo group and the methyl group are **cis** to each other.\n*   For a cyclohexane ring, we must consider its chair conformations to analyze the reaction. There are two possible chair conformations for a cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, which are in equilibrium.\n    *   **Conformer A:** One substituent is axial, and the other is equatorial. (e.g., Bromo group axial, methyl group equatorial).\n    *   **Conformer B:** A ring flip occurs. The axial substituent becomes equatorial, and the equatorial one becomes axial. (e.g., Bromo group equatorial, methyl group axial).\n*   **Determine the most stable conformer:** The stability of a conformer is determined by steric strain, primarily from axial substituents. A methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is much bulkier than a bromo group (A-value ≈ 0.4 kcal/mol). Therefore, the conformer that places the larger methyl group in the equatorial position is significantly more stable.\n    *   **Most Stable Conformer:** Bromine is **axial**, and the methyl group is **equatorial**. The reaction will primarily proceed from this more stable and abundant conformation.\n\n**3. Apply the Stereochemical Requirement for an E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 elimination mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (both groups must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down).\n*   In our stable conformer, the leaving group (Br) is already in an **axial** position, which is perfect for an E2 reaction.\n\n**4. Identify Possible β-Hydrogens and Resulting Products**\n*   We need to find β-hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the bromine) that are axial. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has an equatorial methyl group. Therefore, its other substituent, a hydrogen, must be **axial**. This axial hydrogen at C2 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene** (a trisubstituted, more stable alkene, also known as the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen at C6 is also anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene** (a disubstituted, less stable alkene, also known as the Hofmann product).\n\n**5. Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity)**\n*   The choice between forming the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) and the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene) depends on the base.\n*   The base is potassium **tert-butoxide**, which is very **bulky**.\n*   Bulky bases have difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n    *   The axial proton on C2 is sterically shielded by the adjacent equatorial methyl group on the same carbon.\n    *   The axial proton on C6 is on a simple -CH₂- group and is much more sterically accessible.\n*   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially attack and remove the more accessible proton on C6.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism on the most stable conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (where Br is axial and CH₃ is equatorial). The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, selectively removes the less sterically hindered axial proton from C6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
