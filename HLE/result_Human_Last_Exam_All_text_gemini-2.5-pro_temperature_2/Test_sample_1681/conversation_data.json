    "This problem asks for the equilibrium point of a Prisoner's Dilemma game when played in a quantum setting. We are given the payoff matrix and the ability to design an optimal initial state.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Classical Game**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game in a classical context. The payoff matrix is:\n```\n         Player B\n         Cooperate (C)   Defect (D)\n P C     (5, 5)          (0, 7)\n l D\n a\n y\n e\n r\n A\n```\nThe payoffs are typically denoted as (R, S, T, P):\n*   **R (Reward):** 5, for mutual cooperation (C, C).\n*   **S (Sucker):** 0, for cooperating while the opponent defects (C, D).\n*   **T (Temptation):** 7, for defecting while the opponent cooperates (D, C).\n*   **P (Punishment):** 1, for mutual defection (D, D).\n\nIn classical game theory, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect.\n*   If Player B cooperates, Player A gets 7 by defecting vs. 5 by cooperating. Defection is better.\n*   If Player B defects, Player A gets 1 by defecting vs. 0 by cooperating. Defection is still better.\n\nSince Defect is the dominant strategy for both players, the unique Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), leading to a payoff of **(1, 1)**. This outcome is suboptimal because both players would be better off with the (5, 5) payoff from mutual cooperation. This is the \"dilemma\".\n\n**2. Introducing the Quantum Framework**\n\nIn the quantum version of the game, specifically using the widely-adopted Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, the game structure is modified:\n*   **Quantum States:** The classical strategies `C` and `D` correspond to basis states, typically `|0>` and `|1>`.\n*   **Initial State:** The game begins with a shared entangled initial state. The prompt allows us to \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This means we can choose the level of entanglement. To resolve the dilemma, maximal entanglement is chosen. The initial state is created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the state `|CC>` (or `|00>`): `|ψ_initial> = J|00>`.\n*   **Quantum Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer just C or D, but unitary operators `(U_A, U_B)` acting on their respective qubits. The classical strategies `C` (Identity operator, `I`) and `D` (Pauli-X operator, `σ_x`) are a subset of the available quantum strategies.\n\n**3. Finding the Quantum Equilibrium**\n\nThe introduction of entanglement and a larger strategy space fundamentally changes the game's dynamics. The key findings from the study of quantum Prisoner's Dilemma are:\n\n*   **A New \"Quantum\" Strategy (Q):** A new type of strategy emerges, which has no classical counterpart. This is a specific unitary operator, often denoted as `Q`, that players can choose.\n*   **Elimination of the Dilemma:** When the initial state is maximally entangled, the classical (Defect, Defect) equilibrium is no longer stable. A player has an incentive to unilaterally switch from the classical `D` strategy to the quantum `Q` strategy, as it yields a higher payoff.\n*   **The New Equilibrium Point:** A new, stable Nash Equilibrium appears. This equilibrium is the strategy pair **(Q, Q)**. At this equilibrium, neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n*   **The Equilibrium Payoff:** The most significant result is that the payoff at this new `(Q,Q)` equilibrium is **(R, R)**. This is the payoff for mutual cooperation. The dilemma is resolved because rational self-interest (playing the Nash Equilibrium strategy `Q`) now leads to the Pareto optimal outcome.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis above:\n1.  The equilibrium point in the quantum game is the strategy profile `(Q, Q)`.\n2.  The payoff for this equilibrium is `(R, R)`.\n3.  From the given payoff matrix, the value for `R` (mutual cooperation) is **5**.\n4.  Therefore, the equilibrium point results in a payoff of **(5, 5)**.\n\nThe \"equilibrium point\" in this quantum context is the stable state the game settles into, where both players receive a payoff of 5.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n*   **Classical Equilibrium:** Correctly identified as (D, D) -> (1, 1).\n*   **Quantum Framework:** Used the standard EWL protocol.\n*   **Initial State Design:** Assumed maximal entanglement as it's the \"optimal\" design choice for resolving the dilemma, as allowed by the prompt.\n*   **Nash Equilibrium Concept:** Correctly applied the concept to the expanded quantum strategy space.\n*   **Key Result:** Leveraged the well-established result that a new equilibrium (Q, Q) emerges, yielding the Pareto optimal payoff (R, R).\n*   **Final Answer Interpretation:** The question asks for the \"equilibrium point\". The most meaningful answer in this context is the resulting payoff, as it demonstrates the resolution of the dilemma. The payoff is symmetric, (5, 5). The value associated with this equilibrium is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
