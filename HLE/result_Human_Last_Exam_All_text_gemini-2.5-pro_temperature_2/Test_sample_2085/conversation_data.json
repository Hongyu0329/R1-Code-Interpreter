    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Name's Origin and Context:**\n    *   The name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized form of a name from Late Antiquity.\n    *   It is recorded as the name of a Frankish chieftain who lived in the 4th century in Gaul.\n    *   While the prompt calls it a \"Gaulish name,\" it is more accurately a Germanic (Frankish) name that has been Latinized, possibly with influence from Gaulish, the local language.\n\n2.  **Etymological Breakdown of \"Odobeccus\":**\n    *   The name can be broken into two parts: `Odo-` and `-beccus`.\n    *   **`Odo-`**: This is the primary name-forming element. It derives from the Proto-Germanic root `*audaz`, which means \"wealth, riches, prosperity.\" This is a very common element in Germanic names.\n    *   **`-beccus`**: This ending corresponds to the Latin word `beccus`, which means \"beak.\" This word itself was borrowed by Latin from the Gaulish word `beccos`. The Gaulish word survived into modern French as `bec` (beak).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Name's Composition and Plausibility:**\n    *   A name meaning \"Wealth-Beak\" is possible, but compound names for Frankish nobles typically used two Germanic elements. Examples include Sigebert (\"Victory-Bright\") or Childebert (\"Battle-Bright\").\n    *   A mix of a Germanic root (`Odo-`) and a Gaulish root (`-beccus`) is less common.\n\n4.  **Consider Scholarly Interpretation (The Corruption Theory):**\n    *   Many historians and linguists believe that the `-beccus` part of the name is a scribe's error or a \"folk etymology\" by the Latin writer (like Gregory of Tours).\n    *   It is widely proposed that `-beccus` is a corruption of the common Germanic name ending **`-bald`**, which means \"bold\" or \"audacious\".\n    *   Therefore, the original Frankish name was very likely **`*Audobald`** (or Audobaud). This name, meaning \"Bold in Wealth\" or \"Audaciously Rich,\" is a much more typical Frankish name structure. The Roman writer, perhaps unfamiliar with the Frankish `bald`, substituted it with the familiar-sounding Gallo-Roman word `beccus`.\n\n5.  **Trace the Linguistic Evolution to Modern French:**\n    *   Now, we trace the evolution of the likely original name, `*Audobald`, into French.\n    *   The first part, **`Audo-`**, evolved in Old French to `Ode-` or `Eude-`. The name `Eudes` (and `Odon`) is the direct French equivalent of the single-element name `Odo`.\n    *   The second part, **`-bald`**, regularly evolved into **`-baud`** in French. This ending is found in many French names of Germanic origin, such as `Thibaud` (from Theobald) and `Renaud` (from Reginald).\n\n6.  **Combine the Elements to Find the Equivalent:**\n    *   By combining the French evolution of both parts, `Audo-` (`Eude-`) and `-bald` (`-baud`), we arrive at the French equivalent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized corruption of the original Frankish name `*Audobald`. Following the natural linguistic sound changes from Frankish to Modern French:\n*   `Audo-` becomes `Eude-`.\n*   `-bald` becomes `-baud`.\n\nTherefore, the proper French equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" is **Eudebaud**.\n\n<<<Eudebaud>>>"
