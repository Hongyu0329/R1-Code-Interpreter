The specific procedures would involve immediate medical management of her uncontrolled diabetes, followed by dental emergency care including wound debridement, antibiotics, and analgesia. Replantation of the avulsed teeth is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay. The definitive treatment plan, after healing and glycemic control, would be a Removable Partial Denture (RPD). The key cells of interest are the non-viable Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells on the lost teeth, and the fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells involved in the compromised wound healing process.

If a denture is chosen, the most appropriate type would be a **Cast Metal Framework RPD** made from a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy** with acrylic teeth and base.

The abutment teeth would be:
*   **Left Second Premolar (#25):** To provide primary posterior support and retention.
*   **Left Central Incisor (#21):** To provide primary anterior support.
*   **Right Canine (#13) or First Premolar (#14):** To provide crucial indirect retention and cross-arch stabilization, preventing rotational dislodgement of the denture.
