    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the total number of electrons (N).**\n\nFirst, identify the atoms in the molecule and their atomic numbers (which correspond to the number of electrons for a neutral atom).\n*   Carbon (C): Z = 6\n*   Hydrogen (H): Z = 1\n*   Silicon (Si): Z = 14\n*   Fluorine (F): Z = 9\n\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. Let's count the atoms:\n*   1 Carbon atom\n*   3 Hydrogen atoms (2 from CHâ‚‚ and 1 from SiHF)\n*   1 Silicon atom\n*   1 Fluorine atom\n\nThe total number of electrons (N) is the sum of the electrons from each atom:\n$N = (1 \\times 6) + (3 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 14) + (1 \\times 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\nThe molecule is a neutral, even-electron species. For a Full CI calculation, we are typically interested in the singlet ground state (Total Spin S=0). In this case, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**2. Determine the total number of basis functions (K).**\n\nNext, we need to find the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set.\n*   **6-31G**: A split-valence basis set. Core orbitals are represented by one function (a contraction of 6 Gaussians). Valence orbitals are split into two functions (one from 3 Gaussians, one from 1 Gaussian).\n*   **\\*\\***: The double asterisk indicates the addition of polarization functions. The first '*' adds d-type functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. The second '*' adds p-type functions to hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Careful Point**: Standard Pople basis sets as implemented in most quantum chemistry packages use 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) and 3 p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$). We will use this convention.\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom type:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: Valence is 1s. This is split into 2 s-type functions by '31G'. The second '*' adds a set of p-functions (3 functions).\n    *   Number of functions = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C)** (2nd-row heavy atom): Core is 1s (1 function). Valence is 2s and 2p. The '31G' splits the valence shell, providing 2 s-type functions and 2 sets of p-type functions (2 * 3 = 6 functions). The first '*' adds a set of d-functions (6 functions).\n    *   Number of functions = 1 (1s core) + 2 (2s valence) + 6 (2p valence) + 6 (d polarization) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Fluorine (F)** (2nd-row heavy atom): Same counting rules as Carbon.\n    *   Number of functions = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si)** (3rd-row heavy atom): Core is 1s, 2s, 2p. Valence is 3s, 3p. The standard 6-31G scheme gives 4 s-type functions and 3 sets of p-type functions (3 * 3 = 9 functions). The first '*' adds a set of d-functions (6 functions).\n    *   Number of functions = 4 (s) + 9 (p) + 6 (d) = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of basis functions (K) for the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\n$K = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n$K = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 19) + (1 \\times 15)$\n$K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$ basis functions (spatial orbitals).\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of CSFs for a Singlet State (S=0).**\n\nThe number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a system with total spin S, N electrons, and K spatial orbitals can be found using the genealogical construction method. For a singlet state (S=0), the number of CSFs is the number of determinants with spin projection $M_S=0$ minus the number of determinants with spin projection $M_S=1$.\n\n*   Number of determinants for a given $M_S$: $\\binom{K}{N_\\alpha} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta}$, where $N_\\alpha = N/2 + M_S$ and $N_\\beta = N/2 - M_S$.\n\n*   **For $M_S=0$**: $N_\\alpha = 16$, $N_\\beta = 16$.\n    Number of determinants = $\\binom{64}{16} \\binom{64}{16}$.\n\n*   **For $M_S=1$**: $N_\\alpha = 17$, $N_\\beta = 15$.\n    Number of determinants = $\\binom{64}{17} \\binom{64}{15}$.\n\n*   **Number of Singlet CSFs**:\n    $N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{17} \\binom{64}{15}$\n\n**4. Final Calculation.**\n\nWe need to compute the values of the binomial coefficients.\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 703,642,887,247,480$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 1,989,441,499,508,000$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 230,230,281,481,400$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = (703,642,887,247,480)^2 - (1,989,441,499,508,000) \\times (230,230,281,481,400)$\n$N_{CSF} = 495,113,919,865,426,162,395,521,440,000 - 458,021,487,850,257,002,844,208,000,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 37,092,432,015,169,159,551,313,440,000$\n\nThis can be written in scientific notation as approximately $3.709 \\times 10^{28}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the integer calculated above.\n\n<<<37092432015169159551313440000>>>"
