    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the specific value measured *between* heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Key pieces of information provided are:\n    *   It's a \"beat-to-beat interval.\"\n    *   It's captured using PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n    *   It's the fundamental value used to compute HRV.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The value being described is a measure of time. Specifically, it is the time duration that elapses from one heartbeat to the very next heartbeat. HRV is not the measure of a single interval but the analysis of the *variation* in a sequence of these intervals over time.\n\n3.  **List and Analyze Potential Terms (Careful Points):** Several terms are used for this time interval, and their usage often depends on the context, such as the measurement technology or the stage of data processing.\n\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is a very accurate and general term. It refers to the time interval between consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the technology used to measure it.\n    *   **R-R Interval (RRI):** This is the most common term used in scientific literature, especially in the context of HRV. It originates from ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurements, where the 'R' represents the prominent R-peak in the QRS complex of the electrical signal. The RRI is the time between two successive R-peaks. Even when data is collected from other sources like PPG, the term \"R-R interval\" is often used by convention to refer to the beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI):** This term is specific to PPG technology, as mentioned in the question. A PPG sensor detects the peak of the blood volume pulse wave with each heartbeat. Therefore, the time between two consecutive peaks is technically called the Peak-to-Peak Interval.\n    *   **Normal-to-Normal (NN) Interval:** This term refers to the data *after* it has been processed for HRV analysis. Raw beat-to-beat intervals (whether RRIs or PPIs) may contain errors from motion artifacts or physiological arrhythmias (ectopic beats). For accurate HRV calculation, these abnormal intervals are filtered out. The remaining intervals, representing the time between two consecutive *normal* sinus rhythm heartbeats, are called NN intervals. Essentially, the HRV metrics are calculated from a series of NN intervals.\n\n4.  **Synthesize to Find the Best Answer:**\n    *   The question describes the raw data captured between beats (\"beat-to-beat intervals\").\n    *   While \"Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)\" is the most technically correct term for PPG data, **\"R-R Interval (RRI)\"** is the most widely recognized and universally used term in the field of HRV analysis, often used as a synonym for any beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is also correct and more general.\n    *   \"NN Interval\" is what is ultimately used for the computation, representing a cleaned-up version of the raw interval.\n\n    Given the context of HRV, the most common and standard term used to refer to the beat-to-beat time value is the R-R Interval.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe value computed as the time between heartbeats, used for calculating HRV, is most commonly referred to as the **R-R Interval (RRI)**. It is also known more generally as the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n<<<R-R Interval (or Inter-beat Interval)>>>"
