    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find a specific anatomical detail about the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   **Subject:** *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid dinosaur.\n*   **Anatomical Feature:** The \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a hollow or indentation.\n*   **Specific Detail:** The number of \"depressions\" (which are small hollows, pits, or fossae) contained *within* the lacrimal recess.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Information Sources**\nTo answer such a specific paleontological question, we must refer to the primary scientific literature describing the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. The most important specimen is the holotype skull (SMNS 58022). The key papers describing this skull are:\n1.  Sues, H. D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil*.\n2.  Sales, M. A. F., & Schultz, C. L. (2017). *The Skull of the Spinosaurid Irritator challengeri (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Albian of Brazil*. This is a more recent and detailed re-description.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Scientific Descriptions**\nWe need to examine what these papers say about the lacrimal recess.\n\n*   **Analysis of Sues et al. (2002):** This paper first describes the feature, stating: \"Within this space [the medially expanded portion of the lacrimal], there is a large, subcircular lacrimal recess...\". The paper does not explicitly state the number of smaller depressions within this main recess. It does note \"a row of four small pneumatic foramina\" located elsewhere on the lacrimal, but not *inside* the recess itself.\n\n*   **Analysis of Sales & Schultz (2017):** This later paper provides a more thorough re-examination of the skull's anatomy. When describing the lacrimal bone, the authors explicitly state: \"The lacrimal recess itself bears at least **three subsidiary fossae**.\" A fossa is a depression or hollow. They even name these three depressions based on their positions: the anterodorsal, posterodorsal, and ventral subsidiary fossae.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Formulate the Answer**\nThe original 2002 description identified the main lacrimal recess but did not detail its internal structure. The more recent and focused 2017 study specifically re-examined this feature and found that the main lacrimal recess is subdivided into three smaller depressions, or \"subsidiary fossae\". Therefore, the most accurate and up-to-date answer is based on the findings of Sales & Schultz (2017).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains three depressions (subsidiary fossae).\n\n<<<3>>>"
