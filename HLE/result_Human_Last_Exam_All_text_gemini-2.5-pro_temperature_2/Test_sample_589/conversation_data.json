    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe user's question is composed of several key, specific elements that must all be present in the film:\n1.  **Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** The character must be a teenager.\n4.  **Object:** The teenager is riding a pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward an oncoming car*.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\nTo find the correct film, we must be careful about potential misinterpretations or common cinematic tropes that might seem similar but do not match all criteria.\n*   **\"Teenager\":** This typically means a character between 13 and 19 years old. However, in coming-of-age stories, a character aged 11 or 12 might be contextually what the user recalls.\n*   **\"Pink Bike\":** The color is a very specific detail. A red, orange, or other colored bike would not match the query. This detail is a strong identifier.\n*   **\"Pedal directly toward an oncoming car\":** This specific action describes a game of \"chicken\" or an act of extreme defiance. It is different from being chased by a car or accidentally riding in front of one. The direction of travel is crucial.\n*   **\"Major Film Studio\":** This includes the \"Big Five\" studios (Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros., Disney, Sony) and other significant \"mini-major\" distributors like Lionsgate.\n*   **Possibility of Conflation:** It is common for people to merge details from different movies. The final answer must come from a single film where all elements co-exist in one scene.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\nSeveral popular films feature some, but not all, of the required elements. Let's analyze the most likely candidates:\n\n1.  ***Napoleon Dynamite* (2004):**\n    *   **Match:** This film was produced by Fox Searchlight/Paramount (major studios) and famously features a teenager, Deb, who rides a **pink bike**.\n    *   **Mismatch:** The crucial action is missing. At no point does Deb (or any other teenager) pedal her pink bike directly toward an oncoming car. The character Kip (who is an adult) has a near-miss with a truck while on his pink bike, but it is not a deliberate act of pedaling towards it.\n\n2.  ***It* (2017):**\n    *   **Match:** This is a Warner Bros. (major studio) film featuring several teenage characters. One of them, Beverly Marsh, has a **pink bike**. There is also a major antagonistic element involving the bully Henry Bowers's car.\n    *   **Mismatch:** The action is incorrect. The Losers' Club, including Beverly, are shown pedaling their bikes *away from* the oncoming car to escape. They do not pedal *toward* it.\n\n3.  ***Akeelah and the Bee* (2006):**\n    *   **Match:** This film was produced/distributed by Lionsgate (a major studio). The protagonist, Akeelah, is an 11-year-old on the cusp of her teenage years. The film contains a very specific scene that perfectly matches the described action: Akeelah, to prove her courage, **pedals her bike directly toward an oncoming truck** in a game of \"chicken\" before swerving away at the last second.\n    *   **Mismatch:** There is one incorrect detail. Akeelah's bike is **yellow**, not pink.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nNo known film perfectly matches every single detail in the query. This suggests the possibility of a misremembered detail. However, among the candidates, *Akeelah and the Bee* is the only film that contains the specific, complex, and dramatic action of a young protagonist on a bike pedaling directly toward an oncoming vehicle. This action is far more specific and memorable than a static object's color. It is highly probable that this is the film being referenced, with the color of the bike being the one misremembered detail.\n\n<<<Akeelah and the Bee>>>"
