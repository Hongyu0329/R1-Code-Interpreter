    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Context**\n\nThe question is set within the framework of finite-temperature quantum field theory. Key elements of this framework for a neutral scalar field are:\n\n*   **Partition Function ($Z$):** The central object in thermal equilibrium is the partition function, which is expressed as a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations $\\phi(x)$.\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Spacetime:** The path integral is formulated in Euclidean spacetime. Real time $t$ is replaced by imaginary (Euclidean) time $\\tau = it$. For a system at temperature $T$, the Euclidean time dimension is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$ (with units where Boltzmann's constant $k_B=1$).\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** For a bosonic field like the neutral scalar $\\phi$, the field configurations must be periodic in Euclidean time: $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$.\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** The weight of each field configuration in the path integral is determined by the Euclidean action, $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$, where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Euclidean Action and Isolate the Operator**\n\nLet's consider a free neutral scalar field with mass $m$. The Minkowski Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_M = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$. In Euclidean space, this becomes the Euclidean Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$.\n\nThe Euclidean action is:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nTo identify the operator in the inner product, we need to rewrite the action in a quadratic form $\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\phi \\cdot D \\cdot \\phi$. We can achieve this using integration by parts on the kinetic term $(\\partial_E \\phi)^2$.\n$\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, (\\partial_E \\phi)^2 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)$\nUsing integration by parts, $\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du$, for one of the derivatives:\n$= \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\left[ \\partial_\\mu^E(\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_E^2 \\phi) \\right]$, where $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$.\n\nThe first term is a total derivative. By Gauss's theorem, it can be converted to a surface integral over the boundary of our $(d+1)$-dimensional spacetime. The surface term at spatial infinity vanishes because we assume the fields decay there. The surface term in the time direction vanishes due to the periodic boundary conditions.\nTherefore, the kinetic term becomes $\\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2) \\phi(x)$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the action, we get:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\left[ \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2) \\phi(x) + m^2\\phi(x)^2 \\right]$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\n**Step 3: Define the Inner Product and Identify ($D_\\phi$)**\n\nThe notation $(\\psi_1, \\psi_2)$ in the context of function spaces usually denotes the standard $L^2$ inner product, defined by an integral over the domain:\n$(\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\psi_1(x) \\psi_2(x)$\n\nThe question asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$. This represents the inner product of the field $\\phi$ with another field that results from an operator $D$ acting on $\\phi$, i.e., $D_\\phi \\equiv D\\phi$. So we are evaluating:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x) [D \\phi(x)]$\n\nBy comparing this general form with the expression for the action we derived in Step 2:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$\nwe can directly identify the operator $D$.\n\nThe operator is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n$D = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$\n\nTherefore, the inner product in the question is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nThis expression is precisely twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Momentum Space Representation (Matsubara Formalism)**\n\nFor a more explicit representation, we can work in momentum space. The periodic boundary condition in Euclidean time discretizes the corresponding momentum component. We expand the field in a Fourier series in time and a Fourier integral in space:\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d\\mathbf{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\nwhere $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies. The Euclidean four-momentum is $p_E = (\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$.\n\nIn momentum space, the differential operator $D$ becomes a simple multiplicative factor. The action of the derivatives is:\n$\\partial_\\tau \\to i\\omega_n$\n$\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{p}$\nSo the operator $(-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$ becomes $(\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2)$. This is the eigenvalue of the operator $D$ for the momentum mode $p_E$.\n\nSubstituting the Fourier expansion into the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ and performing the spacetime integral yields:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^d\\mathbf{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2)$\n\nThis expression explicitly shows how the inner product is a sum over all Fourier modes, weighted by the eigenvalues of the kinetic operator, which are simply the inverse of the free thermal propagator.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the quadratic form that defines the free part of the Euclidean action.\n\n1.  **Identification:** It is identified from the free Euclidean action, $S_{E, \\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\n2.  **Operator:** The operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $D = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$.\n3.  **Configuration Space Expression:** In configuration space, the inner product is given by the integral:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n4.  **Momentum Space Expression:** In momentum space (using Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n=2\\pi nT$), the expression is diagonal:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^d\\mathbf{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2)$\n\nBoth expressions represent the same quantity, which is equal to twice the free Euclidean action ($2S_{E, \\text{free}}$).\n\n<<<In configuration space, the inner product is $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$, where $-\\partial_E^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2)$. In momentum space, this is equivalent to $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^d\\mathbf{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2)$, where $\\omega_n=2\\pi nT$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies. This entire expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}$.>>>"
