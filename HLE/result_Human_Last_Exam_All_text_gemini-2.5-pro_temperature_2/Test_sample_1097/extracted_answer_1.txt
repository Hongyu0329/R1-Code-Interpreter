M is the set of all real-valued continuous functions $u$ on the interval $[0, 1]$ such that $u(0)=u(1)=0$ and the supremum norm of $u$ is bounded by a constant $R$, i.e., $\|u\|_{\infty} = \sup_{x \in [0,1]} |u(x)| \le R$. This set must be equipped with the metric $d(u,v)=\|u-v\|_{\infty}$. The constant radius $R>0$ must be chosen to satisfy the conditions $e^R/8 \le R$ and $R < \ln(8)$. A valid choice would be $M = \{ u \in C[0,1] \mid u(0)=u(1)=0, \|u\|_{\infty} \le 1 \}$.
