    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n1.  **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The size of the group is given as 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with $G = SD_{2^9}$, so $n=9$.\n    The specific presentation is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$\n    $|G| = 2^9 = 512$. The order of the element $r$ is $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$. The cyclic subgroup $C = \\langle r \\rangle$ has order 256 and is of index 2 in $G$.\n    The elements of $G$ can be written uniquely in the form $r^j$ or $sr^j$ for $0 \\le j < 256$.\n\n2.  **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H = G^k$, where $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The set $G^k$ is not guaranteed to be a subgroup in general, so we must check for closure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the set of k-th powers, $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^k$ for different integers $k$ and check if it forms a subgroup. We can analyze two cases for $k$: odd and even.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer**\n\nIf $k$ is odd, then $\\gcd(k, |G|) = \\gcd(k, 512) = \\gcd(k, 2^9) = 1$.\nFor any finite group $G$, if $\\gcd(k, |G|) = 1$, the map $\\phi_k: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi_k(g) = g^k$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$. This means the image of the map, which is the set $G^k$, is equal to the entire group $G$.\nSince $G$ is a subgroup of itself, $G$ is a power subgroup. This is generated by any odd $k$.\nThis gives us our first power subgroup: $H_1 = G$.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. The set $G^k$ consists of the k-th powers of all elements in $G$. We analyze the two types of elements separately.\n\n*   **Powers of elements in $C = \\langle r \\rangle$:**\n    For an element $r^j \\in C$, its k-th power is $(r^j)^k = r^{jk}$. The set of all such powers is $\\{r^{jk} \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. This forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. Let's call this set $A_k$.\n\n*   **Powers of elements not in $C$:**\n    For an element $sr^j$, we first compute its square:\n    $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = s(r^j s)r^j = s(s r^{j(2^7-1)})r^j = r^{j(2^7-1)}r^j = r^{j(2^7)} = r^{128j}$.\n    Now, the k-th power is $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2m} = ((sr^j)^2)^m = (r^{128j})^m = r^{128jm}$.\n    The set of all such powers is $\\{r^{128jm} \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. This set forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(128m, 256)} \\rangle$. Let's call this set $B_k$.\n\nSo for even $k=2m$, the set of powers is $G^k = A_k \\cup B_k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{\\gcd(128m, 256)} \\rangle$.\nFor this union of two subgroups to be a subgroup, one must be contained in the other. Both are subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle$, so this condition is always met. The resulting subgroup is the larger of the two.\n\nLet $d_A = \\gcd(k, 256)$ and $d_B = \\gcd(128m, 256) = \\gcd(64k, 256)$. The subgroup $G^k$ will be $\\langle r^{\\min(d_A, d_B)}\\rangle$ if we are talking about which subgroup is larger, however it is generated by $\\gcd(d_A, d_B)$. Let's use the $v_2$ notation (p-adic valuation for $p=2$).\nThe generator for $\\langle r^a \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^b \\rangle$ is $r^{\\gcd(a,b)}$. But since this is a union of sets which we verified formed a subgroup, it must be the larger subgroup. Let's see:\n$v_2(d_A) = v_2(\\gcd(k, 2^8)) = \\min(v_2(k), 8)$.\n$v_2(d_B) = v_2(\\gcd(k \\cdot 64, 2^8)) = \\min(v_2(k)+6, 8)$.\nSince $v_2(k) < v_2(k)+6$, we have $\\min(v_2(k), 8) \\le \\min(v_2(k)+6, 8)$.\nThis means $v_2(d_A) \\le v_2(d_B)$, which implies that $d_A$ divides $d_B$ (as they are powers of 2).\nTherefore, $\\langle r^{d_A} \\rangle \\supseteq \\langle r^{d_B} \\rangle$.\nThe union is $G^k = A_k \\cup B_k = A_k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\nSo, for any even integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n\nThe generator of the subgroup is $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$. Since $d$ must divide 256, $d$ must be a power of 2.\n$k$ is even, so $k=2^p \\cdot q$ where $p \\ge 1$ and $q$ is odd.\n$d = \\gcd(2^p \\cdot q, 2^8) = 2^{\\min(p, 8)}$.\nSince $p \\ge 1$, the possible values for $\\min(p, 8)$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\nEach of these values gives a distinct subgroup:\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 1$: $d=2^1=2$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=2$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 2$: $d=2^2=4$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=4$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 3$: $d=2^3=8$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=8$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 4$: $d=2^4=16$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=16$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 5$: $d=2^5=32$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=32$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 6$: $d=2^6=64$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=64$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 7$: $d=2^7=128$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. (e.g., for $k=128$)\n*   $\\min(p, 8) = 8$: $d=2^8=256$. Subgroup is $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$. (e.g., for $k=256$)\n\nThis gives us 8 distinct power subgroups for even values of $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the total number of distinct power subgroups**\n\nCombining the results from both cases:\n1.  For any odd $k$, we get the subgroup $G$.\n2.  For even $k$, we get the 8 distinct subgroups $\\langle r^{2^i} \\rangle$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 8$. These are $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, and $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct. Therefore, the total number of power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\n**Final List of Power Subgroups:**\n1.  $G = SD_{512}$\n2.  $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n8.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n9.  $\\{e\\}$\n\nThere are 9 power subgroups in total.\n\n>>> 9"
