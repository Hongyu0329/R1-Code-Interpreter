    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the key information in the question:**\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German title: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Event:** Museum acquisition\n    *   **Year of Event:** 1967\n\n2.  **Formulate a research plan:** The most direct approach is to search for the painting's provenance (history of ownership). This can be done by searching online art databases, museum collections, and art history resources for the specific painting.\n\n3.  **Execute the research:**\n    *   A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist 1927\" or \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" quickly identifies the work as a significant piece of the German \"New Objectivity\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement.\n    *   These searches lead to information about its current location. The painting is consistently cited as being part of the collection of the **Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden** (Dresden State Art Collections) in Germany.\n    *   Specifically, it is housed within the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery), which is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden complex.\n\n4.  **Verify the acquisition date:**\n    *   The next step is to confirm the year of acquisition. Museum collection databases are the most reliable source for this information.\n    *   Checking the official online collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD Online Collection) for the artwork \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther confirms the details.\n    *   The provenance section for this painting explicitly states it was **acquired in 1967** (\"erworben 1967\").\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Artwork Title:** It's important to use both the English (\"The Radionist\") and original German (\"Der Radionist\") titles in searches for the most comprehensive results.\n*   **Museum Name:** Museums can be part of larger organizations. In this case, the Galerie Neue Meister is the specific gallery, but the acquiring institution is the overarching Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. Mentioning the larger institution is the most accurate and complete answer.\n*   **Verification:** Relying on the museum's own official records or reputable art historical databases is crucial for confirming details like the acquisition date.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBy combining the identified key information and verifying it against the official records of the holding institution, we can definitively determine that the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden acquired Kurt Günther's 1927 painting \"The Radionist\" in the year 1967.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
