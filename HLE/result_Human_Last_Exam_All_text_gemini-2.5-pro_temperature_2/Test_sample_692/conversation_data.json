    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question requires us to find a specific point in time that was physically recorded by a native American civilization before 1492, using their own writing system. Key elements are:\n*   **Earliest Date:** Not the earliest writing or artifact, but the earliest specific calendar date.\n*   **Recorded:** Inscribed on a durable medium like stone.\n*   **Pre-Columbian Civilization:** Cultures like the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, etc.\n*   **Aboriginal Writing System:** Using indigenous scripts, such as glyphs.\n\n**Step 2: Distinguish Between Earliest Writing, Earliest Calendar Sign, and Earliest Absolute Date**\nIt is crucial to differentiate between three related but distinct concepts:\n*   **Earliest Writing:** The oldest known example of a writing system in the Americas is the **Cascajal Block**, attributed to the Olmec civilization and dated to circa 900 BCE. However, this block does not contain any recognizable date.\n*   **Earliest Calendar Glyph:** The earliest known use of a calendar glyph is found on **Monument 3 at San José Mogote**, a Zapotec site in Oaxaca, Mexico. Dated to around 600 BCE, it includes a glyph representing the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day sacred calendar. While this is a calendar record, it is not an \"absolute date\"—it is a day name that repeats every 260 days and doesn't fix the event in a specific year.\n*   **Earliest Absolute Date:** For an absolute date (one fixed in linear time), we must look for artifacts using the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system records the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date (most often correlated to August 11, 3114 BCE).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Artifacts with Long Count Dates**\nSeveral artifacts from the Epi-Olmec and early Maya cultures feature very early Long Count dates. The three most important candidates are:\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** An Epi-Olmec monument from Veracruz, Mexico.\n2.  **The Tuxtla Statuette:** A small greenstone Epi-Olmec sculpture.\n3.  **El Baúl Stela 1:** An early Maya monument from Guatemala.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Dates on the Artifacts**\nThe Long Count dates are written as a sequence of numbers representing periods of time (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Winal, K'in). We can directly compare these numbers to see which is earliest.\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** The date recorded is **7.16.6.16.18**.\n*   **El Baúl Stela 1:** The date recorded is **7.19.15.7.12**.\n*   **Tuxtla Statuette:** The date recorded is **8.6.2.4.17**.\n\nBy comparing the lead number (the B'ak'tun), we see that the Tuxtla Statuette's date (starting with 8) is much later than the other two (starting with 7). Comparing the Tres Zapotes and El Baúl dates, we look at the second number (the K'atun): 16 is earlier than 19. Therefore, the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C is the earliest of the known Long Count dates.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the Earliest Long Count Date to the Gregorian Calendar**\nThe date on Tres Zapotes Stela C, **7.16.6.16.18**, represents a specific number of days past the Long Count's starting point. Using the standard Goodman-Martínez-Thompson (GMT) correlation, this corresponds to the date:\n*   **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Reconstruction:** The B'ak'tun number \"7\" on Tres Zapotes Stela C was damaged and had to be reconstructed by scholars. However, this reconstruction is widely accepted based on the archaeological context and stylistic comparison with other early stelae.\n*   **Specificity of \"Date\":** The answer relies on interpreting \"date\" as a specific, non-repeating point in linear time, which is best represented by the Long Count system, rather than a repeating day name from a shorter calendar cycle.\n*   **System Origin:** Although the Long Count calendar is famously associated with the Classic Maya, its origins are older, with the earliest examples coming from the Epi-Olmec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe earliest known specific date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on the Epi-Olmec monument, Tres Zapotes Stela C. The date, written in the Long Count system, is 7.16.6.16.18, which correlates to September 3, 32 BCE.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
