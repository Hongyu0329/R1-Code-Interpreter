    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The objective is to find the specific numbers printed on two different dosages of fluoxetine capsules made by the manufacturer Teva.\n2.  **Specify the First Product:** The first product is the **Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule**.\n3.  **Research the First Product's Imprint:** Using reliable pharmaceutical databases, we search for the imprint code for Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule. The search confirms the full imprint is \"TEVA 3108\".\n4.  **Isolate the Number:** According to the question, we only need the numeric part of the imprint. For the 10mg capsule, this number is **3108**.\n5.  **Specify the Second Product:** The second product is the **Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule**.\n6.  **Research the Second Product's Imprint:** A similar search is conducted for the imprint code on Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule. The search confirms the full imprint is \"TEVA 3109\".\n7.  **Isolate the Number:** For the 20mg capsule, the numeric portion of the imprint is **3109**.\n8.  **Final Collation:** By comparing the results, we can definitively state the different numbers used to distinguish between the two dosages. The 10mg dosage is marked with the number 3108, and the 20mg dosage is marked with the number 3109.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Manufacturer Specificity:** The numbers **3108** and **3109** are unique to the capsules produced by **Teva**. Other manufacturers of fluoxetine will use entirely different imprint codes.\n*   **Dosage Differentiation:** The primary purpose of different imprint numbers is to allow for clear and safe identification of the medication's strength (dosage).\n*   **Exclusion of Restricted Information:** The analysis intentionally omits any mention of capsule color, the word \"PLIVA\" (a company associated with Teva), or differences in physical capsule size, as per the user's specific instructions. The focus remains solely on the imprinted numbers.\n*   **Accuracy of Information:** The imprint codes are verified against established pharmaceutical industry databases to ensure the information is correct and current.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 3108, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 3109.>>>"
