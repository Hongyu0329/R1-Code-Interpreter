    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Vaccine Type: \"All-or-Nothing\"**\n    *   An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine works by conferring perfect, complete immunity to a certain fraction of the vaccinated population.\n    *   Let's denote the fraction of vaccinated individuals who gain this perfect immunity as `f`.\n    *   The remaining fraction, `1 - f`, of vaccinated individuals receives no protection at all. Their susceptibility to infection remains the same as that of an unvaccinated person.\n\n2.  **Define the First Quantity: \"Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy\" (`VE_pe`)**\n    *   `VE_pe` is defined as the proportional reduction in the probability of infection resulting from a single exposure event.\n    *   The formula is: `VE_pe = 1 - (Probability of infection per exposure in vaccinated / Probability of infection per exposure in unvaccinated)`.\n    *   Let `p_u` be the probability of an unvaccinated person getting infected from a single exposure.\n    *   Let's calculate the average probability of infection per exposure for a randomly chosen vaccinated person (`p_v`). This is a weighted average based on the two outcomes of the all-or-nothing vaccine:\n        *   For the fraction `f` who are immune, the probability of infection is 0.\n        *   For the fraction `1 - f` who are not protected, the probability of infection is `p_u`.\n        *   Therefore, the average probability `p_v = (f * 0) + ((1 - f) * p_u) = (1 - f) * p_u`.\n    *   Now, we can calculate `VE_pe`:\n        `VE_pe = 1 - (p_v / p_u) = 1 - ((1 - f) * p_u) / p_u = 1 - (1 - f) = f`.\n    *   **Conclusion 1:** The per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`) is exactly equal to `f`, the fraction of the vaccinated population that is successfully immunized.\n\n3.  **Define the Second Quantity: \"1 - Incidence Rate Ratio\" (`1 - IRR`)**\n    *   The Incidence Rate (IR) is the rate at which new infections occur in a population over time (e.g., cases per person-year).\n    *   The Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR`) is `IR_vaccinated / IR_unvaccinated`.\n    *   The quantity `1 - IRR` is a standard measure of vaccine efficacy often calculated from clinical trials or observational cohort studies.\n    *   Let `IR_u` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated population. Since this entire group is susceptible (by definition), this rate represents the baseline risk for any susceptible person in the study population (assuming equal exposure rates for all).\n    *   Now, let's calculate the overall incidence rate for the vaccinated group (`IR_v`). This group is a mixture:\n        *   The fraction `f` is immune, so their incidence rate is 0.\n        *   The fraction `1 - f` is not protected, so their incidence rate is the same as the unvaccinated group, `IR_u`.\n        *   The overall `IR_v` is the weighted average: `IR_v = (f * 0) + ((1 - f) * IR_u) = (1 - f) * IR_u`.\n    *   Now we can calculate the `IRR`:\n        `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = ((1 - f) * IR_u) / IR_u = 1 - f`.\n    *   Finally, we calculate the desired quantity, `1 - IRR`:\n        `1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - f) = f`.\n    *   **Conclusion 2:** The efficacy measured by `1 - IRR` is also exactly equal to `f`, the fraction of the vaccinated population that is successfully immunized.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Quantities and Final Conclusion**\n    *   From our analysis, we found that `VE_pe = f`.\n    *   We also found that `1 - IRR = f`.\n    *   Therefore, `VE_pe = 1 - IRR`.\n    *   This means that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the efficacy calculated from the incidence rate ratio (`1 - IRR`) is a perfect estimate of the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`). Both measures reflect the same underlying biological reality: the proportion of people the vaccine successfully protects.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Assumption of Equal Exposure:** This analysis relies on the standard assumption that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have the same behavior and thus the same rate of exposure to the pathogen. If vaccinated individuals change their behavior (e.g., take more risks), this could bias the observed `IRR`.\n*   **Contrast with \"Leaky\" Vaccines:** For a \"leaky\" (or partial efficacy) vaccine that reduces the risk of infection by a certain percentage for *everyone* who is vaccinated, the `1 - IRR` also correctly estimates the `VE_pe`. The key insight is that `1 - IRR` is a measure of the average reduction in infection risk for the vaccinated group, and under standard assumptions, this is equivalent to the per-exposure efficacy, regardless of whether the protective mechanism is all-or-nothing or leaky.\n\nFinal answer: `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the `VE_pe`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
