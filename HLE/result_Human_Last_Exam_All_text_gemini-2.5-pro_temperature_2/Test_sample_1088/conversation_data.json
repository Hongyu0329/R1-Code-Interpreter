    "This question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. The number of primitive Gaussians is atom-dependent. Since the question does not specify an atom or a molecule, it is inherently ambiguous. However, the notation `6-311G**` itself provides definitions for both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and for hydrogen atoms. A comprehensive answer requires analyzing the basis set for both types of atoms. We will assume a representative second-row heavy atom (like Carbon) and a hydrogen atom, and calculate the total number of primitives required to define the basis set for this pair, as this encompasses the full definition of \"6-311G**\".\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the basis set name `6-311G**`**\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core electrons. The core atomic orbitals are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). This applies to heavy atoms (Li and beyond).\n*   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence electrons. It indicates a \"triple-zeta\" valence shell, meaning each valence orbital is represented by three CGFs.\n    *   The first CGF (inner valence) is a contraction of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second CGF (middle valence) consists of **1** uncontracted PGF.\n    *   The third CGF (outer valence) consists of **1** uncontracted PGF.\n    *   Thus, each valence orbital is described by a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, confirming the type of functions used.\n*   `**` (or `(d,p)`): These are polarization functions, which are typically uncontracted single Gaussians.\n    *   The first asterisk `*` adds one set of **d-type polarization functions** to heavy atoms. A standard set contains 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$). This adds 6 PGFs.\n    *   The second asterisk `*` adds one set of **p-type polarization functions** to hydrogen atoms. A set of p-functions contains 3 functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$). This adds 3 PGFs.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of primitives for a representative heavy atom (Carbon)**\n\nWe will use Carbon (C), a second-row atom, as our representative heavy atom. Its electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$.\n\n1.  **Core primitives (1s orbital):** The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   Number of core primitives = **6** PGFs.\n\n2.  **Valence primitives (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `-311` rule applies. Each valence orbital is described by 3+1+1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   For the 2s orbital: **5** PGFs.\n    *   For the three 2p orbitals ($2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z$): 3 orbitals Ã— 5 PGFs/orbital = **15** PGFs.\n    *   Total valence primitives = 5 + 15 = 20 PGFs.\n\n3.  **Polarization primitives (d-functions):** The first `*` applies.\n    *   This adds a set of 6 Cartesian d-functions. Each is a single primitive.\n    *   Number of polarization primitives = **6** PGFs.\n\n4.  **Total for Carbon:** Summing the primitives from all parts:\n    *   Total PGFs for C = 6 (core) + 20 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = **32** PGFs.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of primitives for a Hydrogen atom (H)**\n\nHydrogen has no core electrons. Its electron configuration is $1s^1$.\n\n1.  **Core primitives:** Hydrogen has no core.\n    *   Number of core primitives = **0** PGFs.\n\n2.  **Valence primitives (1s orbital):** The `-311` rule applies to the 1s valence orbital.\n    *   Number of valence primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n\n3.  **Polarization primitives (p-functions):** The second `*` applies.\n    *   This adds a set of 3 p-functions. Each is a single primitive.\n    *   Number of polarization primitives = **3** PGFs.\n\n4.  **Total for Hydrogen:** Summing the primitives:\n    *   Total PGFs for H = 0 (core) + 5 (valence) + 3 (polarization) = **8** PGFs.\n\n**Step 4: Acquire the final answer**\n\nTo give a single numerical answer for what is \"in a 6-311G** basis set\", we sum the number of primitives for the two types of atoms it defines: a representative heavy atom (Carbon) and a Hydrogen atom. This approach accounts for every part of the basis set's name.\n\n*   Total Primitives = (Primitives for C) + (Primitives for H)\n*   Total Primitives = 32 + 8 = 40\n\n<<<40>>>"
