    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the two isomer products.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type and Governing Rule**:\n    The starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, a conjugated polyene. It undergoes a ring-closing reaction under thermal conditions. The conjugated system has four double bonds, which means it involves **8 π-electrons**.\n    According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules and Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, an electrocyclic reaction involving 4n π-electrons (where n=2 here) under thermal conditions proceeds via a **conrotatory** mechanism. This is because the reaction is controlled by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which for an 8π system is ψ₄. The terminal p-orbitals of ψ₄ have opposite phases, and a conrotatory motion is required to bring lobes of the same phase together to form a new σ-bond.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Reactant's Reactive Conformer**:\n    The stereochemical outcome of the electrocyclic reaction depends on the geometry of the substituents at the termini of the reacting polyene system (C2 and C9). The substituents at C2 are a methyl group (from C1) and a hydrogen. The substituents at C9 are a methyl group (from C10) and a hydrogen. We need to determine the relative orientation of these two methyl groups in the reactive conformation, which is a helical, all-s-cis like structure.\n\n    We can trace the stereochemical relationships set by the Z/E double bonds:\n    *   At the **C2=C3 (Z)** bond, the methyl group (C1) and the continuing chain at C4 are on the same side.\n    *   At the **C4=C5 (Z)** bond, the C3 and C6 parts of the chain are on the same side.\n    *   At the **C6=C7 (Z)** bond, the C5 and C8 parts of the chain are on the same side.\n    *   At the **C8=C9 (E)** bond, the C7 part of the chain and the terminal methyl group (C10) are on opposite sides.\n\n    By tracing these relationships through the helical chain, we find that the methyl group at C2 and the methyl group at C9 are effectively **trans** to each other with respect to the average plane of the polyene. This arrangement is described as **out/in**, where one methyl group lies on the convex face of the helix (\"out\") and the other lies on the concave face (\"in\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conrotatory Ring Closure**:\n    With an `out/in` arrangement of the terminal methyl groups, we can analyze the two possible conrotatory pathways (clockwise/clockwise vs. counter-clockwise/counter-clockwise) and the resulting product stereochemistry.\n    Let's define the groups at C2 as Me(out)/H(in) and at C9 as Me(in)/H(out).\n\n    *   **Pathway 1 (e.g., both ends rotate clockwise)**:\n        *   At C2, the `out` substituent (Me) rotates to one face of the new ring (e.g., 'up'), and the `in` substituent (H) rotates to the other face ('down').\n        *   At C9, the `out` substituent (H) rotates 'up', and the `in` substituent (Me) rotates 'down'.\n        *   The groups that end up on the same face ('up') are Me from C2 and H from C9. They are `cis` to each other.\n        *   The groups that end up 'down' are H from C2 and Me from C9. They are also `cis` to each other.\n        *   From this, we deduce the relationship between the two methyl groups: Me(C2) is 'up' while Me(C9) is 'down'. This is a **trans** relationship. Thus, this pathway leads to the **trans-isomer B**.\n\n    *   **Pathway 2 (both ends rotate counter-clockwise)**:\n        A similar analysis shows this pathway also leads to the **trans-isomer B**. (Specifically, Me(C2) would be 'down' and Me(C9) would be 'up', which is still a `trans` relationship).\n\n    This analysis suggests that the main reactive conformer (the all-s-cis helix) exclusively produces the trans-isomer B. The formation of the cis-isomer A implies it must arise from a different, higher-energy pathway, for example, from a less stable reactive conformer which has an `out/out` relationship of the methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Apply Torquoselectivity to Predict the Major Product**:\n    Torquoselectivity is a principle that states a bulky substituent at a rotating terminus prefers to rotate \"outward\" (away from the interior of the forming ring) to minimize steric strain in the transition state.\n\n    *   For the reaction producing trans-B from the `out/in` conformer, we have two conrotatory modes.\n        *   **One mode** involves the `out` methyl at C2 rotating outward and the `in` methyl at C9 also rotating outward (away from the core of the helix). This pathway has two favorable rotations.\n        *   **The other mode** involves both methyl groups rotating inward, which is sterically hindered and highly disfavored.\n    *   The low-energy, torquochemically favored pathway leads to the **trans-isomer B**.\n\n5.  **Predict the Ratio of A to B**:\n    The pathway to the `trans-isomer B` is doubly favored by torquoselectivity, indicating a very low energy transition state. The formation of the `cis-isomer A` would have to proceed through a much higher energy transition state (e.g., from a strained, alternative conformer). Because the reaction is under kinetic control, the product distribution is determined by the relative energies of the transition states. The significantly lower activation energy for the formation of B means it will be the **major product**, while A will be the **minor product**.\n\n    Quantifying the ratio requires knowing the energy difference between the transition states. A typical energy difference for such sterically controlled reactions is in the range of 1-2 kcal/mol. An energy difference (ΔΔG‡) of ~1.4 kcal/mol at room temperature corresponds to a product ratio of about 10:1. Therefore, FMO theory combined with an analysis of steric effects predicts that the ratio of A:B will be approximately 1:9.\n\nFinal Answer Prediction: The trans-isomer B is the major product, and the cis-isomer A is the minor product. The ratio of A to B is approximately 1:9."
