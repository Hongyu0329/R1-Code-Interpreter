    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question seeks to identify a specific Christian theologian. The criteria for this theologian are:\n    *   They must have developed \"specialized terminology.\"\n    *   This terminology must be able to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n    *   The framework must be applicable to two specific theological concepts: the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural law at the time of the Fall (Genesis 3).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Theological Concepts:**\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle. Theologically, a miracle is an event that deviates from the normal, observed course of nature (e.g., human reproduction requires both a male and female gamete). A framework to explain this would need to account for God's ability to act outside of, or suspend, these natural laws.\n    *   **The Fall and Changes in Natural Law:** This is a more specific and advanced theological idea. It posits that the consequences of Adam and Eve's sin were not just spiritual and moral but also physical and cosmological. This view suggests that the very laws governing the physical universe might have been altered by God as a result of the Fall—for example, the introduction of principles like entropy, decay, carnivory, or physical futility (\"thorns and thistles\"). A framework to explain this requires more than just accounting for a one-off miracle; it needs to explain a permanent shift in the \"operating system\" of the universe.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Theologians:**\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (c. 4th-5th century):** Augustine spoke of miracles as God bringing forth latent potentials (*rationes seminales* or \"seminal reasons\") that He had placed in creation from the beginning. This explains miracles as part of God's grand plan, not as violations of nature. However, it does not directly propose a *change* in the fundamental laws of nature as a result of the Fall.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (c. 13th century):** Aquinas made a distinction between God's \"ordained power\" (how He usually works through the natural laws He established) and His \"absolute power\" (what He could possibly do). A miracle, for Aquinas, is God acting outside the established order of nature. This explains miracles like the virgin birth but does not focus on the idea that the entire \"established order\" itself was fundamentally changed after the Fall. His focus was more on the corruption of human nature.\n    *   **John Calvin (c. 16th century):** Calvin and other Reformers focused heavily on God's providence—His meticulous, sovereign control over all events. While this view accommodates miracles, the primary theological project was not to develop a specific philosophical vocabulary for how the physical laws themselves might have been rewritten.\n    *   **Jonathan Edwards (c. 18th century):** This American theologian and philosopher is the strongest candidate. He engaged deeply with the science of his day (e.g., Newton). He developed a metaphysical system often described as \"continuous creation\" or a form of occasionalism.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** Edwards' central idea is that the \"laws of nature\" have no independent power. They are simply descriptions of the *regular, consistent, and habitual manner* in which God wills the universe to exist from moment to moment. He refers to this as God's \"arbitrary constitution\" or \"stated method\" of acting. \"Arbitrary\" here doesn't mean random, but rather that it is established by God's will and could have been otherwise.\n        *   **Applicability to Virgin Birth:** In this framework, the virgin birth is not a \"violation\" of law. It is simply an instance where God chose to will an event into being in a way that deviated from His *usual* method (i.e., normal conception).\n        *   **Applicability to the Fall:** This is where Edwards' system is uniquely suited. He explicitly argued that the physical consequences of the Fall could be explained by God altering the very \"constitution\" of nature. Before the Fall, God might have upheld the world according to one set of regularities (laws). After the Fall, as a judicial act, He began upholding the world according to a new set of regularities that included processes of decay, friction, and corruption that were previously absent. This constitutes a direct \"change in the laws of nature.\"\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** While other theologians dealt with miracles and providence, Jonathan Edwards is the one who developed a specific philosophical and theological framework (continuous creation) and the associated terminology (\"arbitrary constitution,\" \"stated methods\") to describe not only singular miracles like the virgin birth but also a systematic alteration of the laws of nature as a direct consequence of the Fall.\n\n***\n<<<Jonathan Edwards>>>"
