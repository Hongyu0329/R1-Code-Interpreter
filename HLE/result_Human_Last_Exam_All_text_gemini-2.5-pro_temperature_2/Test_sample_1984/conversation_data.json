    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nEquilibrium points (or stationary points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $\n\nThe quadratic term inside the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $\n\nThis equation gives two solutions, which are the equilibrium points:\n$ x_1 = 0 $\n$ x_2 = 1 $ (This is a root with multiplicity 2).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $f'(x)$, at that point. The rule is:\n*   If $f'(x_{eq}) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_{eq}) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_{eq}) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need another method.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to determine the stability of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability for the inconclusive case using a phase line**\n\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point $x=1$.\nThe term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. It is positive for all $x \\neq 1$.\nTherefore, the sign of $f(x)$ for $x \\neq 1$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n\n*   **Consider a point slightly to the left of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=0.9$):**\n    For $x=0.9$, $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(0.9) = -(0.9)(0.9-1)^2 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, solutions starting slightly to the left of 1 will move further to the left (away from 1).\n\n*   **Consider a point slightly to the right of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=1.1$):**\n    For $x=1.1$, $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(1.1) = -(1.1)(1.1-1)^2 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) < 0$, solutions starting slightly to the right of 1 will move to the left (towards 1).\n\nFor an equilibrium point to be stable, all nearby solutions (from both the left and the right) must converge to it. At $x=1$, solutions from the right converge to 1, but solutions from the left move away from 1. This type of equilibrium is called semi-stable, and by definition, it is **not stable**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibria**\n\nFrom our analysis, only the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m$.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final result.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Finding all equilibria:** It's important to find all the roots of $f(x)=0$. Factoring the polynomial is crucial.\n2.  **Stability Test:** The first derivative test is the quickest method.\n3.  **Inconclusive Case:** Recognizing that $f'(x_{eq}) = 0$ means the test is inconclusive is a key step. Do not assume stability or instability.\n4.  **Alternative Stability Analysis:** When the first derivative test fails, analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of the equilibrium point (phase line analysis) is a reliable method.\n5.  **Definition of Stability:** A point is only stable if solutions from *both* sides converge to it. A semi-stable point is considered unstable.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Perform the final arithmetic or algebraic substitution as requested.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$m = 1$\nThe required value is $m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
