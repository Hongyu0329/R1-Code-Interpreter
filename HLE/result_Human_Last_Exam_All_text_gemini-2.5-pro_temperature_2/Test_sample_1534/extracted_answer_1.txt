The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **fin lobes** (also known as posterior pedal lobes) and the **vasomotor lobes**. The **giant fiber lobe**, which is closely integrated with the posterior part of the palliovisceral lobe, is also located in this rearmost position.
