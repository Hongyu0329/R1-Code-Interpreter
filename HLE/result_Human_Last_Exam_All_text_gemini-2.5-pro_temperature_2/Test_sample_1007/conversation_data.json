    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\nThe goal is to identify the classical ballet step from the list where the dancer finishes with their feet in the exact same arrangement as when they started (e.g., if they start in 5th position with the right foot in front, they end in 5th position with the right foot in front). We will analyze each option based on a standard starting position of 5th position.\n\n**1. A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Description:** \"Entrechat\" means interweaving or braiding. \"Six\" refers to six movements or crossings of the legs in the air. An entrechat with an even number (like four, six, eight) starts and ends on two feet.\n*   **Action:** The dancer jumps from 5th position. The legs open and cross three times in the air (each open and cross is a movement, totaling six). The sequence of leg positions is: open, beat back, open, beat front, open, close. This series of beats results in the feet switching places.\n*   **Ending Position:** 5th position, but the foot that was in front is now in the back (e.g., left foot front). This is known as *changé* (changed).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**2. B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position.\n*   **Description:**\n    *   **Échappé:** To escape. A jump from a closed position (5th) to an open position (2nd or 4th).\n    *   **Battu:** Beaten. As the legs close from the open position, they beat together.\n    *   **Changé:** Changed. The name of the step explicitly states that the feet change position.\n*   **Action:** Jump from 5th to 2nd position. Then, jump from 2nd position, beating the legs together before landing in 5th position with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** 5th position, with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**3. C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Description:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble. It is a jump where the working foot brushes out, the dancer pushes off the supporting leg, and the legs \"assemble\" together in the air before landing on two feet simultaneously.\n*   **Action:** Assemblé has several common variations:\n    *   **Assemblé dessus (over):** The working leg closes in front of the supporting leg. This *changes* the feet.\n    *   **Assemblé dessous (under):** The working leg closes behind the supporting leg. This *does not change* the feet. For example, starting with the right foot in front, the left (back) foot can brush out to the side, and the dancer lands with the right foot still in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** It can be either changed or unchanged, depending on the type of assemblé performed.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since a standard and common version of assemblé (*assemblé dessous*) ends in the exact same position it started, this is a possible correct answer.\n\n**4. D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Description:**\n    *   **Glissade:** To glide. A traveling step used to connect other steps.\n    *   **Derrière:** Behind. This indicates that as the step finishes, the working foot closes *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Action:** Starting with the right foot in front, the dancer glides the back (left) foot out to the side, transfers weight, and brings the front (right) foot to close *behind* the left foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** 5th position, but the foot that started in front (right) is now in the back, and the foot that started in back (left) is now in front. It is a changing step.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position. (Note: A *glissade devant* would not change the feet).\n\n**5. E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** 5th position (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Description:** A \"gurgling\" step. It is a decorative jump, like a *pas de chat* but with each leg performing a *rond de jambe* (circle of the leg) in the air.\n*   **Action:** The front foot (right) picks up and does a quick *rond de jambe en dehor* (outward circle) as the dancer jumps. The second leg (left) then picks up and does a *rond de jambe en dedans* (inward circle). The dancer lands with the feet switched.\n*   **Ending Position:** 5th position, with the foot that was originally in front now in the back (e.g., left foot front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**Final Careful Consideration:**\nAmong the given options, A, B, D, and E describe specific steps that, by their standard definition and execution, always result in the feet changing their front/back orientation. Only \"Assemblé\" (C) is a category of step that has a very common variant (*assemblé dessous*) which explicitly ends in the same position from which it started. Therefore, it is the only step listed that fulfills the condition of the question.\n\n<<<C>>>"
