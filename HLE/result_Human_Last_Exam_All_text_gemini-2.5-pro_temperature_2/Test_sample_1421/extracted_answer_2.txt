The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by the functional integral $Z = \int_{\text{APBC}} \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$. In this expression, $\mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi$ is the integration measure over all configurations of the anticommuting (Grassmann) fermion fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$. The integral is weighted by the factor $e^{-S_E}$, where $S_E$ is the Euclidean action of the system. Crucially, the integral is taken over only those field configurations that satisfy the Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (APBC) in the imaginary time direction $\tau$: $\psi(0, \mathbf{x}) = -\psi(\beta, \mathbf{x})$, where $\beta=1/(k_BT)$ is the inverse temperature.
