    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**Analysis of the Line**\n\nThis line is an iambic senarius (also known as an iambic trimeter), a meter common in Roman comedy (e.g., Plautus, Terence). An iambic senarius consists of six iambic feet (an iamb is S L). However, this meter allows for frequent substitutions to create a more varied and natural-sounding rhythm.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Elision:** When a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the first vowel is \"elided\" or dropped in pronunciation. Here, `bene` ends with an '-e' and `esse` begins with an 'e'. Thus, `ben(e) esse` occurs.\n2.  **Syllable Quantity:** A syllable is long (L) if it contains a long vowel/diphthong or if its short vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short (S).\n3.  **Final Syllable (*syllaba anceps*):** The last syllable of the line can be treated as long regardless of its natural quantity to complete the final foot.\n4.  **Metrical Substitutions:** In iambic senarius, an iamb (S L) can be replaced by a spondee (L L), an anapest (S S L), a dactyl (L S S), or a tribrach (S S S).\n5.  **Brevis Brevians (Iambic Shortening):** A feature of early Latin verse where a long syllable, preceded by a short syllable in an iambic sequence (S L), could be pronounced as short. This is a possibility but we will find it is not required for this line.\n\n**Step-by-step Scansion:**\n\n1.  **Initial Syllabification and Elision:**\n    *   The line is: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n    *   The words `bene esse` elide to be pronounced as if one word, `benesse`.\n    *   The line is syllabified as: `et / ti / bi / be / nes / se / so / li / quom / si / bi / sit / ma / le`. This gives a total of 14 syllables.\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Quantities:**\n    *   `et`: **L** (long by position, as the vowel 'e' is followed by two consonants: 't' and the 't' from `tibi`).\n    *   `tibi`: `ti` is **S** and `bi` is **S**. Both have short vowels by nature.\n    *   `benesse` (`ben(e) esse`): This is scanned as three syllables.\n        *   `be-`: **S** (short 'e').\n        *   `-nes-`: **L** (long by position, as the short 'e' is followed by the consonant cluster '-ss-').\n        *   `-se`: **S** (the final 'e' of an infinitive like `esse` is short).\n    *   `soli`: The `o` is naturally long, and the dative ending `-i` is long. So, `so` is **L** and `li` is **L**.\n    *   `quom`: **L** (this is equivalent to `cum` and is a closed syllable, making it long).\n    *   `sibi`: `si` is **S** and `bi` is **S**. Both have short vowels by nature.\n    *   `sit`: **L** (long by position, as the short vowel 'i' is followed by two consonants: 't' and the 'm' from `male`).\n    *   `male`: `ma` is **S** (short 'a'). The final syllable `-le` is *anceps* and is taken as **L** to form the final iambic foot.\n\n3.  **Assembling the Metrical Sequence:**\n    The sequence of long (L) and short (S) syllables is:\n    `L S S S L S L L L S S L S L`\n\n4.  **Dividing into Six Feet:**\n    Now we parse this 14-syllable sequence into the six feet of an iambic senarius, using the allowed substitutions.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` → **L S S** (This is a **Dactyl**, a valid substitution).\n    *   **Foot 2:** `be nes` → **S L** (This is an **Iamb**, the base foot). Note that the word `benesse` is split across two feet.\n    *   **Foot 3:** `se so` → **S L** (This is an **Iamb**). Words are split across this foot boundary (caesura).\n    *   **Foot 4:** `li quom` → **L L** (This is a **Spondee**, a valid substitution). The word `soli` is split.\n    *   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` → **S S L** (This is an **Anapest**, a common substitution).\n    *   **Foot 6:** `ma le` → **S L** (This is an **Iamb**).\n\n**Final Scansion:**\n\nThe complete scansion of the line is a Dactyl, followed by two Iambs, a Spondee, an Anapest, and a final Iamb.\n\nL S S | S L | S L | L L | S S L | S L\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
