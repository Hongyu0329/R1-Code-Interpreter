The laboratory made a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) check was fundamentally flawed. They used *Bacillus subtilis* to test the agar, but this bacterium is naturally resistant to chloramphenicol. The expected result when using this organism is growth, regardless of whether the antibiotic is active or not. When they observed this expected growth on the Batch 3 QC plate, they incorrectly interpreted it as a successful test, giving them false confidence. This flawed QC completely masked the critical underlying error: the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed and rendered inactive when it was mistakenly autoclaved.
