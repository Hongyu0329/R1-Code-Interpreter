    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified in humans to date. The term \"member\" can be interpreted in a few ways, which is an important point of careful consideration.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 family member\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs) that are highly conserved across animal species and share a similar nucleotide sequence, especially in their \"seed region.\" This sequence similarity means they tend to regulate a similar set of target messenger RNAs.\nThe number of \"members\" can refer to:\n1.  **Unique mature miRNA sequences:** These are the final, functional miRNA molecules. Some distinct genes can produce identical mature miRNAs.\n2.  **Precursor miRNA genes (gene loci):** These are the distinct genes in the human genome that are transcribed to produce the precursor stem-loop structures which are then processed into mature miRNAs.\n\nIn genomics and molecular biology, when referring to the size of a gene family, it is most common and precise to count the number of distinct gene loci. We will proceed with this definition as it is the most frequently cited in scientific literature.\n\n**Step 3: Consult authoritative databases**\nThe primary and most reliable database for microRNA sequences, nomenclature, and annotation is **miRBase**. We will use the information cataloged in miRBase (latest release) to identify the human let-7 family members.\n\n**Step 4: List and count the human let-7 family genes**\nBased on miRBase and established scientific consensus, the human let-7 family consists of the following precursor miRNA genes:\n\n*   **let-7a:** Encoded by three distinct genes (paralogs).\n    1.  `hsa-let-7a-1`\n    2.  `hsa-let-7a-2`\n    3.  `hsa-let-7a-3`\n    *(These three genes all produce the identical mature let-7a-5p miRNA sequence).*\n\n*   **let-7f:** Encoded by two distinct genes.\n    4.  `hsa-let-7f-1`\n    5.  `hsa-let-7f-2`\n    *(These two genes produce the identical mature let-7f-5p miRNA sequence).*\n\n*   **Other let-7 members:** The following are each encoded by a single gene.\n    6.  `hsa-let-7b`\n    7.  `hsa-let-7c`\n    8.  `hsa-let-7d`\n    9.  `hsa-let-7e`\n    10. `hsa-let-7g`\n    11. `hsa-let-7i`\n\n*   **miR-98:** This miRNA is structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family due to its high sequence homology. It is also encoded by a single gene.\n    12. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final total**\nBy summing up all the distinct precursor miRNA genes listed in Step 4, we get the total number of let-7 family members identified in the human genome.\n\nTotal = 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = **12**\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   The definition of \"member\" is critical. Counting gene loci is the most precise and commonly accepted method for family size in genomics.\n*   Some mature miRNAs (let-7a and let-7f) are encoded by more than one gene. These multiple genes (paralogs) must be counted individually.\n*   miR-98 is included in the let-7 family due to high sequence similarity and functional relationship.\n*   The primary source for this information is the miRBase database, which is the standard reference for miRNA research.\n\n<<<12>>>"
