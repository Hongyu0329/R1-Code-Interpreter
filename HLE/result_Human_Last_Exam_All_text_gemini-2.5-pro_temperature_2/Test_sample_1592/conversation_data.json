    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec.\n*   It is situated on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n*   Geographically, this places it in the western part of Quebec.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret \"Waskaganish Gathering Place\"\n*   The phrase \"Waskaganish gathering place\" most likely refers to the community of Waskaganish itself or its immediate surroundings, which are traditional Cree lands for gathering.\n*   For the purpose of measuring distance to a large geographical entity like a province, using the location of the town of Waskaganish is a precise and sufficient reference point.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories\n*   The question asks for the closest province or territory **outside of Quebec**.\n*   We need to consider all the provinces and territories that border Quebec:\n    *   **To the west:** The province of **Ontario**.\n    *   **To the south:** The province of **New Brunswick** (and several US states).\n    *   **To the east:** The province of **Newfoundland and Labrador**.\n    *   **To the north:** The territory of **Nunavut**. The border runs through Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay, and includes all islands in James Bay.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighboring Province/Territory\n*   **Waskaganish vs. Newfoundland and Labrador:** The Quebec-Labrador border is far to the east of Waskaganish (several hundred kilometers). This is not a close candidate.\n*   **Waskaganish vs. New Brunswick:** The border with New Brunswick is far to the south-southeast of Waskaganish (hundreds of kilometers away). This is also not a close candidate.\n*   **Waskaganish vs. Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay. The largest and closest of these islands to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island. The distance from Waskaganish across the bay to Akimiski Island is significant, approximately 220 km (about 137 miles).\n*   **Waskaganish vs. Ontario:** Waskaganish is located very close to the western border of Quebec. The border between Quebec and Ontario is a land border that runs south from James Bay. The Billy Diamond Highway, which leads to Waskaganish, crosses into Ontario a relatively short distance west of the community. The straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border is only about 55-60 km (about 35 miles).\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~60 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut border (Akimiski Island): ~220 km\n*   Distances to Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are much greater.\n\nComparing these distances, it is clear that the provincial border of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the territorial border of Nunavut.\n\nFinal Answer: The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
