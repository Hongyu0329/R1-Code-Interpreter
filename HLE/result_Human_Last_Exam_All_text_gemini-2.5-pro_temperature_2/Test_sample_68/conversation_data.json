    "This question requires an understanding of knot theory, specifically the concept of knot coloring.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understanding Knot Coloring:**\n    The coloring of a knot diagram, in the sense of Fox n-coloring, involves assigning an integer from a set of \"colors\" `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` to each arc of the knot. The assignment must follow a specific rule at every crossing.\n    *   **Arcs:** The segments of the knot diagram from one undercrossing to the next.\n    *   **Coloring Rule:** At any given crossing, let the color of the over-crossing arc be `z`, and the colors of the two under-crossing arcs be `x` and `y`. The rule is that `2z ≡ x + y (mod n)`. This can also be written as `x + y - 2z ≡ 0 (mod n)`.\n    *   **Non-Trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs have the same color. A non-trivial coloring must use at least two different colors. The existence of a non-trivial n-coloring is a knot invariant.\n\n2.  **The Algebraic Structure:**\n    The set of colors `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` combined with the modular arithmetic used in the coloring rule forms an algebraic structure. This is the set of integers modulo `n`, denoted as `Z_n`. More generally, this is a type of quandle known as an Alexander Quandle `R_n`. The question asks for the number of elements in the smallest such structure, which means we need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` that allows a non-trivial coloring.\n\n3.  **The Condition for n-Colorability:**\n    A knot K can be non-trivially colored with `n` colors if and only if `n` is a divisor of the *determinant* of the knot, `det(K)`. The knot determinant is a positive integer associated with the knot. So, the task is to find the determinant of the figure eight knot and then find its smallest divisor greater than 1.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Figure Eight Knot (4₁):**\n    The figure eight knot is the simplest non-trivial knot after the trefoil. It has 4 crossings.\n    *   Let's label the 4 arcs of a standard diagram of the figure eight knot as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n    *   We can write a system of linear equations based on the coloring rule for each of the 4 crossings. For a standard diagram, one possible set of equations is:\n        1.  Crossing 1: `x₁ + x₃ - 2x₂ = 0 (mod n)`\n        2.  Crossing 2: `x₂ + x₄ - 2x₃ = 0 (mod n)`\n        3.  Crossing 3: `x₁ + x₂ - 2x₄ = 0 (mod n)`\n        4.  Crossing 4: `x₃ + x₄ - 2x₁ = 0 (mod n)`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Knot Determinant:**\n    To find the determinant, we write these equations in matrix form, `M * x = 0`.\n    ```\n      [ 1  -2   1   0 ] [x₁]\n      [ 0   1  -2   1 ] [x₂]\n      [ 1   1   0  -2 ] [x₃]\n      [-2   0   1   1 ] [x₄]\n    ```\n    (Note: The exact matrix depends on the labeling of the arcs and crossings, but the resulting determinant is an invariant).\n    The determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(m-1)x(m-1)` submatrix (a cofactor), where `m` is the number of crossings. Here, `m=4`. Let's delete the last row and last column.\n    The submatrix `M'` is:\n    ```\n      [ 1  -2   1 ]\n      [ 0   1  -2 ]\n      [ 1   1   0 ]\n    ```\n    Now, we calculate the determinant of this submatrix:\n    `det(M') = 1 * (1*0 - (-2)*1) - (-2) * (0*0 - (-2)*1) + 1 * (0*1 - 1*1)`\n    `det(M') = 1 * (2) + 2 * (2) + 1 * (-1)`\n    `det(M') = 2 + 4 - 1 = 5`\n    The determinant of the figure eight knot is `|det(M')| = 5`.\n\n6.  **Finding the Smallest Number of Colors:**\n    A non-trivial n-coloring exists if `n` is a divisor of the knot determinant and `n > 1`.\n    *   The determinant is 5.\n    *   The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n    *   We need `n > 1`, so the only option is `n = 5`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The smallest integer `n > 1` that allows coloring the figure eight knot is 5. Therefore, the smallest algebraic structure (`Z₅`) that allows this coloring has 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
