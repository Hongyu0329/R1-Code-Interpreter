The final product is the ketone formed from the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by an aqueous workup. The key transformations are the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene skeleton, the conversion of the tertiary alcohol at C2 to a ketone, the formation of a new C-C bond between C2' of the cyclopentyl ring and C5 of the norbornene skeleton, and the shifting of the double bonds to form new C=C bonds at C1=C6. The resulting structure is a complex bridged polycyclic ketone, as depicted in the image: https://i.imgur.com/KqBaxGq.png
