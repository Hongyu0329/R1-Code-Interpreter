    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary goal is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, denoted by A.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the Contextual Information:** The question mentions a \"Markov quiver\" and a specific value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\).\n    *   A **Markov quiver** is related to the cluster algebra approach to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The solutions to this equation are called Markov numbers.\n    *   The matrix A is the Cartan matrix associated with this quiver, which is of type \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\). In the theory of Lie algebras, Cartan matrices of *affine type* (like \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\)) are known to have a determinant of 0.\n    *   The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) refers to a specific Markov number. The Markov triples include (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 5), and (1, 5, 13). So, 13 is indeed a Markov number.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question provides the matrix A explicitly with the phrase \"where: A = ...\". This indicates that this is the exact matrix we need to work with. The information about the Markov number \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) serves to identify the specific mathematical context but does not alter the entries of the matrix A itself. Therefore, we can proceed to calculate the determinant of the given matrix without needing to use the value 13.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method for Calculation:** We can compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using several methods.\n    *   Method 1: The Rule of Sarrus (or cofactor expansion).\n    *   Method 2: Row or column operations to simplify the matrix.\n    We will demonstrate the calculation using both methods for verification.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is given by the formula:\n\\( \\det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\)\n\nFor our matrix A:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nCalculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these back into the formula:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2(3) - (-1)(-3) + (-1)(3) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 2: Row Operations**\n\nThe determinant of a matrix remains unchanged if we add a multiple of one row to another row.\nLet's perform the operation: Row 1 -> Row 1 + Row 2 + Row 3.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe new Row 1 will be:\n*   1st element: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   2nd element: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   3rd element: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\nSo, the new Row 1 is [0, 0, 0]. The matrix becomes:\n\\[\nA' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Careful Point:** A matrix with a row or column consisting entirely of zeros has a determinant of 0. Since the row operation we performed does not change the determinant, we have \\( \\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0 \\).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth calculation methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix A is 0. This aligns with the theoretical properties of the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\), which is the context indicated by the \"Markov quiver\".\n\nFinal Answer: The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
