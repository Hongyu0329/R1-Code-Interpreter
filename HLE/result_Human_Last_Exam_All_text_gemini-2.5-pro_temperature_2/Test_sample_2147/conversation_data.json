    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine what \"X-Y\" stands for in the context of Pavel Milyukov's statement.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Claim:** The question states that Pavel Milyukov denounced \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\". This specific and strong metaphor is the key to identifying the target of his criticism.\n\n2.  **Contextualize Pavel Milyukov:** Pavel Milyukov was a prominent Russian historian and politician. He was the leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). Contrary to the premise of the question, he was a well-known \"Westernizer\" who believed Russia's future lay in adopting Western-style liberal democracy and constitutional monarchy. The part about him \"frequently accusing the Western culture\" is likely a mischaracterization of his views. However, the 'stagnant swamp' quote is very famous and can be traced.\n\n3.  **Trace the \"Stagnant Swamp\" Quote:** This phrase is famously associated with a powerful speech Milyukov delivered to the State Duma (the Russian parliament) on November 1, 1916. This was a critical moment during World War I when the Russian government was perceived as deeply incompetent and its war effort was failing.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target of the Speech:** In this speech, Milyukov launched a devastating attack on the government of the day. He listed numerous government failures and scandals, accusing the ministers of gross incompetence and hinting at treason. He famously punctuated each point by asking, \"Is this stupidity or is it treason?\" («Что это — глупость или измена?»).\n\n5.  **Connect the Quote to the Target:** Milyukov was quoting a German newspaper which described the political atmosphere in Russia, but he used it to directly criticize the government ministers for creating and operating within this environment of corruption, confusion, and decay. The \"stagnant swamp\" was his metaphor for the political situation created by the ruling ministers under Prime Minister Boris Stürmer, whom many suspected of being pro-German.\n\n6.  **Determine \"X-Y\":** The group of people Milyukov was denouncing, whose actions he characterized with the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor, was the ruling cabinet of the government. Therefore, \"X-Y\" refers to the **Tsarist Ministers**. The placeholder \"X-Ys\" fits this plural noun phrase perfectly.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The premise that Milyukov was a critic of \"Western culture\" is misleading. He was a strong advocate for Western political models. His criticism was aimed squarely at the Russian autocracy's failings.\n*   Milyukov was not denouncing a social or cultural group in the broader sense but a specific political body: the government ministers in power in late 1916.\n*   While he used the phrase 'stagnant swamp', he was describing the political situation that the ministers had created and were operating in. The ministers themselves were the target of the denunciation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of Pavel Milyukov's famous speech on November 1, 1916, the \"X-Ys\" he denounced in connection with the phrase 'stagnant swamp' were the ministers of the Imperial Russian government.\n\n<<<Tsarist Ministers>>>"
