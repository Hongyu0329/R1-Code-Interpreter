    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific character from William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. The criteria for this character are:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They must have described the religious practices of that city to other characters.\n3.  This description must include a clear, recognizable reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings*\n*The House of the Wolfings* focuses on a tribe of Goths (the Markmen) preparing to defend their homeland, the Mark, from a Roman legion. Most of the main characters, like the war-leader Thiodolf and his foster-daughter Hall-Sun, have lived their entire lives within the Mark. Their knowledge of Romans is primarily as enemies and invaders, not from visiting their cities. This means the character in question is likely an outsider or someone with a unique backstory.\n\nOne character fits this profile: **Otter**. He is a captive from another tribe, the Laxings, who was taken in by the Wolfings and became a trusted friend to Thiodolf. His backstory is explored in the novel, revealing he has experiences beyond the world of the Wolfings.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the Specific Event in the Text\nWe need to find the section of the book where a character recounts a visit to a Roman city. Chapter XVI is explicitly titled \"Otter tells of the Roman City.\" This chapter is dedicated to Otter recounting his past to the Wolfings.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Content of Otter's Story\nIn Chapter XVI, Otter explains that as a boy, he was captured not by the Wolfings, but by the Romans. He was taken as a slave to a great Roman city, where he lived for some time before eventually escaping and finding his way to the Mark. During this monologue, he describes the marvels and horrors of the Roman city, including its architecture, technology, and customs.\n\nThe most critical part of his tale for answering the question is his description of Roman temples and religious imagery. He speaks of the gods the Romans worship, filtering his observations through his own Germanic cultural lens.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Reference to Romulus and Remus\nWithin his description of Roman religion, Otter gives a very precise account of a famous Roman image. He says:\n\n\"...I saw the image of their god whom they call the War-father, and he is a wolf of the she-kind, and twin men-children she suckleth, and one of them, they say, was the first father of their folk...\"\n\nThis description is a clear and unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth:\n*   **\"the War-father\"**: Otter's interpretation of Mars, the god of war, who was the mythical father of the twins.\n*   **\"a wolf of the she-kind, and twin men-children she suckleth\"**: A direct description of the famous Capitoline Wolf statue, which shows a she-wolf nursing the infants Romulus and Remus.\n*   **\"one of them... was the first father of their folk\"**: This refers to Romulus, who, according to legend, went on to found the city of Rome.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Careful Point 1**: It's important to recognize that the character would not use the names \"Romulus\" or \"Remus.\" They would describe the scene as they, an outsider, perceived it. Otter's description is a perfect example of this.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The link to the Wolfing tribe's name is significant. Otter is describing the founding myth of his people's enemies, which revolves around a benevolent she-wolf, to a tribe that calls themselves the \"Wolfings.\" This creates a powerful dramatic irony.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: The character who performs this action is not one of the central Wolfing-born protagonists but rather the adopted outsider, Otter, whose backstory serves as a device to provide the reader and the other characters with vital exposition about the Roman enemy.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the character as Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
