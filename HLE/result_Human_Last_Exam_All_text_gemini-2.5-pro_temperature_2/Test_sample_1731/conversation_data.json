    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory. Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Physical System: Light Quanta (Photons)**\n\n*   **Particle Type:** Photons are bosons, meaning they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. Multiple photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Indistinguishability:** Photons are indistinguishable from one another.\n*   **Particle Number:** A crucial property of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like in a blackbody cavity) is that the number of photons is not conserved. They can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of the container. This physical reality is captured in the statistical mechanics framework by setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n\n**2. The Role of Large Deviation Theorems**\n\nThe question specifically mentions the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems from probability theory provide the rigorous mathematical foundation for the methods of statistical mechanics.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem concerns the probability of observing an empirical distribution that deviates from a known underlying distribution. In the context of statistical mechanics, it justifies the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. It essentially states that the macroscopic state (defined by a distribution of particles over energy levels) with the highest number of corresponding microscopic arrangements (i.e., maximum entropy) is overwhelmingly the most probable state to be observed at equilibrium.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem concerns the probability of the sample mean of random variables deviating from the true expectation. In statistical mechanics, this justifies the use of the **canonical ensemble**. It shows that for a system in thermal contact with a large reservoir, the probability of its energy deviating significantly from the mean energy is exponentially small. Minimizing the \"rate function\" from Cramer's theorem to find the most probable state is equivalent to minimizing the Helmholtz free energy (`F = E - TS`), which for a fixed mean energy `E` is equivalent to maximizing the entropy `S`.\n\n**Conclusion from Large Deviation Theory:** Both theorems direct us to use the same method: find the particle distribution `{n_i}` that **maximizes the entropy `S`** of the system, subject to the relevant physical constraints.\n\n**3. Setting up the Maximization Problem**\n\n*   **Entropy of a Boson Gas:** For a system of indistinguishable bosons distributed over energy levels `ε_i`, where level `i` has a degeneracy of `g_i` states and is occupied by `n_i` particles, the statistical entropy (from Boltzmann's formula `S = k_B ln W`) is given by:\n    `S = k_B * Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - g_i ln(g_i) ]`\n    (assuming `g_i >> 1`).\n\n*   **Constraints:**\n    1.  **Mean Energy:** The total energy of the system is held at a constant average value `<E>`. So, `Σ_i n_i ε_i = <E>`.\n    2.  **Particle Number:** As established, the particle number is not conserved (`μ=0`), so there is **no** constraint on `Σ_i n_i`.\n\n**4. Solving for the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` subject to the energy constraint. We want to maximize the function:\n`L = S/k_B - β (Σ_i n_i ε_i - <E>)`\nwhere `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\nSetting the derivative with respect to `n_j` to zero: `∂L/∂n_j = 0`\n`∂/∂n_j [ (n_j + g_j) ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j ln(n_j) - g_j ln(g_j) ] - β ε_j = 0`\n`[ ln(n_j + g_j) + 1 - ln(n_j) - 1 ] - β ε_j = 0`\n`ln( (n_j + g_j) / n_j ) = β ε_j`\n`1 + g_j / n_j = exp(β ε_j)`\n`n_j / g_j = 1 / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)`\n\nThis gives the average number of particles per state at energy `ε_j`, which is the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential. The Lagrange multiplier is identified with the inverse temperature: `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy `<E>`**\n\nTo find a specific value for `<E>`, we must sum over all possible states. For photons in a three-dimensional cavity of volume `V`, the energy levels form a continuum. We replace the sum with an integral and use the density of states `g(ε)dε` (the number of available states for a photon with energy between `ε` and `ε+dε`).\n\n*   **Density of States:** For photons (massless, spin-1 bosons with two polarization states), `g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`.\n\nThe mean energy is the integral of the energy per state (`ε`) times the number of particles per state (`n(ε)/g(ε)`) times the number of states (`g(ε)dε`):\n`<E> = ∫₀^∞ ε * [1 / (exp(ε/(k_B T)) - 1)] * [(8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2] dε`\n`<E> = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ∫₀^∞ ε^3 / (exp(ε/(k_B T)) - 1) dε`\n\nBy performing a substitution `x = ε/(k_B T)`, the integral becomes a standard form `∫₀^∞ x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx = π⁴/15`. The final result is:\n`<E> = (8π^5 k_B^4 V / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\nThis is the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**. The mean energy is proportional to `T^4`.\n\n**6. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy `S`**\n\nWe could substitute the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula and integrate, but a simpler method is to use a fundamental thermodynamic relation. For a grand canonical ensemble, the grand potential `Φ` is given by `Φ = <E> - TS - μ<N>`.\n\n*   For photons, `μ=0`, so `Φ = <E> - TS`. This means `S = (<E> - Φ) / T`.\n*   The grand potential can be calculated from the partition function: `Φ = -k_B T ln(Z_G)`.\n*   `ln(Z_G) = - ∫₀^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - exp(-ε/(k_B T))) dε`.\n*   Evaluating this integral (typically via integration by parts) yields a simple and famous relation for a gas of massless particles:\n    `Φ = -1/3 <E>`\n\nNow we can easily find the entropy:\n`S = (<E> - (-1/3 <E>)) / T = (4/3) <E> / T`\nSubstituting the expression for `<E>`:\n`S = (4 / (3T)) * [(8π^5 k_B^4 V / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4]`\n`S = (32π^5 k_B^4 V / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3`\nThe entropy is proportional to `T^3`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the temperature `T` and volume `V` of the system.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (`<E>`):**\n`<E> = (8π^5 k_B^4 V / (15 h^3 c^3)) T^4`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (`S`):**\n`S = (32π^5 k_B^4 V / (45 h^3 c^3)) T^3`\n\nWhere:\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `h` is Planck's constant.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature.\n*   `V` is the volume of the cavity.\n\n<<<**Mean Energy <E> = (8π⁵k_B⁴V / (15h³c³))T⁴**\n**Entropy S = (32π⁵k_B⁴V / (45h³c³))T³**>>>"
