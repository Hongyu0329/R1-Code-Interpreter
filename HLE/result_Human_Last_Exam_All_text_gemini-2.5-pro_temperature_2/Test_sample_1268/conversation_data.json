    "Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms in the question:**\n    *   **Squarefree natural number $(N)$:** A natural number $N$ that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. Examples: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, ... This number $N$ is the parameter defining the mathematical objects we are studying. In number theory, a squarefree integer $d$ (which can be $\\pm N$) is used to define a quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$.\n    *   **Lattice and Covolume $(V)$:** A lattice $\\Lambda$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The covolume $V$ of a lattice $\\Lambda$ is the volume of its fundamental domain. In the context of a number field $K$, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ forms a lattice when embedded into a real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via the canonical embedding. For a quadratic field ($n=2$), the covolume $V$ is related to the field's discriminant $\\Delta_K$.\n    *   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is not standard. Given the context of geometry of numbers, it likely refers to an invariant of the lattice related to a norm. The subscript $\\infty$ strongly suggests the infinity norm (or max norm), defined as $\\|(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i} |x_i|$. The term \"maximum norm\" is unusual, but the most plausible interpretation in this context is the largest of the successive minima of the lattice, which for dimension $n=2$ is the second successive minimum, denoted $\\lambda_2$. Let's assume $k_{k,\\infty} = \\lambda_{2, \\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Establish the mathematical setting:**\n    *   Let $N$ be a squarefree natural number. Let $d$ be a squarefree integer such that $|d|=N$ (so $d=\\pm N$, excluding $d=1$).\n    *   Consider the quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. Its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ under the canonical embedding.\n    *   The covolume of this lattice is $V = \\text{covol}(\\Lambda)$. Specifically, $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$ for a real quadratic field ($d>0$) and $V = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$ for an imaginary quadratic field ($d<0$).\n\n3.  **Introduce the concept of successive minima:**\n    *   For a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a norm, the $i$-th successive minimum $\\lambda_i$ is the smallest radius $r$ such that the ball of radius $r$ contains at least $i$ linearly independent lattice vectors. We are interested in $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ for the infinity norm in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Minkowski's Second Theorem:**\n    *   Minkowski's second theorem provides a bound on the product of successive minima. For a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a 0-symmetric convex body $C$, the theorem states:\n        $\\frac{2^n}{n!} \\frac{\\text{covol}(\\Lambda)}{\\text{vol}(C)} \\le \\lambda_1 \\cdots \\lambda_n \\le 2^n \\frac{\\text{covol}(\\Lambda)}{\\text{vol}(C)}$.\n    *   In our case, $n=2$ and the norm is the infinity norm. The unit ball $C$ is the square $[-1,1]^2$, so its volume is $\\text{vol}(C)=4$. The covolume is $V$.\n    *   Substituting these values into the theorem:\n        $\\frac{2^2}{2!} \\frac{V}{4} \\le \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\le 2^2 \\frac{V}{4}$\n        $\\frac{V}{2} \\le \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\le V$.\n    *   From this, we have an upper bound on $\\lambda_2$: $\\lambda_2 \\le V / \\lambda_1$. To find an upper bound for $\\lambda_2$ in terms of $V$, we need a lower bound for $\\lambda_1$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the first successive minimum $(\\lambda_1)$ for our specific lattices:**\n    *   **Case 1: Real Quadratic Field ($d=N>0$).**\n        The lattice vectors are of the form $(\\sigma_1(x), \\sigma_2(x)) = (a+b\\sqrt{d}, a-b\\sqrt{d})$ for $x=a+b\\sqrt{d} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. The product of the components is the field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(x)$, which is an integer. For any non-zero $x$, $|N(x)| \\ge 1$.\n        Let $v = (v_1, v_2)$ be a non-zero lattice vector. Then $|v_1 v_2| \\ge 1$.\n        The infinity norm is $\\|v\\|_\\infty = \\max(|v_1|, |v_2|)$.\n        So, $\\|v\\|_\\infty^2 = (\\max(|v_1|, |v_2|))^2 \\ge |v_1 v_2| \\ge 1$.\n        This implies $\\|v\\|_\\infty \\ge 1$ for any non-zero lattice vector. Thus, $\\lambda_1 \\ge 1$.\n        The integer $1 \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is mapped to the vector $(1,1)$, whose infinity norm is $1$.\n        Therefore, for real quadratic fields, $\\lambda_1 = 1$.\n    *   **Case 2: Imaginary Quadratic Field ($d=-N<0$).**\n        The lattice vectors are $(\\text{Re}(x), \\text{Im}(x))$ for $x \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$.\n        If $d \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$. The lattice is spanned by $(1,0)$ and $(0, \\sqrt{N})$. Non-zero vectors are $(m, n\\sqrt{N})$ for integers $m, n$ not both zero. The infinity norm is $\\max(|m|, |n|\\sqrt{N})$. The minimum norm is $\\min(1, \\sqrt{N})=1$ (since $N\\ge2$ for squarefree). Thus, $\\lambda_1=1$.\n        If $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$. The lattice is spanned by $(1,0)$ and $(1/2, \\sqrt{N}/2)$. The shortest non-zero vector corresponds to $x=1$ (norm 1) or $x = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$ (norm $\\max(1/2, \\sqrt{N}/2)=\\sqrt{N}/2$ for $N \\ge 3$), and possibly others. The minimal norm $\\lambda_1$ is $\\min(1, \\sqrt{N}/2)$. This is always $\\le 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the upper bound for the second successive minimum $(\\lambda_2)$:**\n    *   We use the inequality $\\lambda_2 \\le V/\\lambda_1$.\n    *   **For real quadratic fields**: Since $\\lambda_1 = 1$, we get $\\lambda_2 \\le V$. This shows that $V$ is an upper bound. This bound can be approached, for example in fields with large regulators.\n    *   **For imaginary quadratic fields**: A more detailed analysis shows that, in fact, $\\lambda_2 = V$.\n        *   For $d \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$, the lattice vectors are $(m, n\\sqrt{N})$ and $V=\\sqrt{N}$. We have $\\lambda_1 = 1$, achieved by $(1,0)$. The shortest linearly independent vector from $(1,0)$ must have $n\\neq0$. The shortest such vectors are $(m, \\pm\\sqrt{N})$. The minimum norm is for $m=0$, giving $(0, \\pm\\sqrt{N})$, with norm $\\sqrt{N}$. Thus $\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{N} = V$.\n        *   For $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $V = \\sqrt{N}/2$. For $N \\ge 7$, $\\lambda_1=1$ (from $(1,0)$). The shortest linearly independent vector has form $(m+n/2, n\\sqrt{N}/2)$ with $n \\ne 0$. For $n=1$, we get norms $\\ge \\sqrt{N}/2$. We can find a vector with norm $\\sqrt{N}/2$. For example for $x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}$, the vector is $(1/2, \\sqrt{N}/2)$ with norm $\\sqrt{N}/2$. Thus $\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{N}/2=V$.\n        *   For the exceptional case $d=-3, N=3$, we found $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $V=\\sqrt{3}/2$. So $\\lambda_2=V$ here as well.\n\n7.  **Final conclusion:**\n    In both real and imaginary quadratic fields derived from squarefree integers $N$, the second successive minimum with respect to the infinity norm, $\\lambda_2$, satisfies the inequality $\\lambda_2 \\le V$. In the imaginary case, equality $\\lambda_2 = V$ holds. Therefore, the supremum for $\\lambda_2$ (which we interpret as $k_{k,\\infty}$) is $V$. The upper bound is $V$ itself."
