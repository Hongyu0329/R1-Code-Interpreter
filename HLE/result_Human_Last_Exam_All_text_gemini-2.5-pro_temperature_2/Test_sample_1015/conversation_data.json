    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A ballet step where the dancer bends the upper body backward from the waist. *Cambré* means \"arched,\" and *derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, expressive upper body, and a highly structured, step-by-step training system. It emphasizes purity of line and correct placement above all.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet technique developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, energy, athleticism, and a distinct aesthetic with long lines, deep pliés, and an emphasis on the musicality and dynamics of movement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method**\n*   **Core Principle:** Stability and control. The primary goal is to isolate the movement of the upper body from a stable lower body.\n*   **Hip Placement:** The hips must remain perfectly square to the front and directly over the supporting feet. There is no forward or sideways displacement of the pelvis. This is a strict rule to ensure a pure line and to build core and back strength correctly.\n*   **Movement Initiation:** The bend is initiated high in the back, from the thoracic spine (between the shoulder blades), creating a long, even curve rather than a sharp break at the lower back.\n*   **Head and Arms (Port de Bras):** The head follows the line of the spine gracefully, often looking up and back. The arms typically move through established positions (e.g., from first to fifth) in a coordinated and lyrical manner. The head is the last to return to the starting position.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method**\n*   **Core Principle:** Dynamism, depth, and speed. The aesthetic often prioritizes a more extreme range of motion and a quality of being slightly \"off-balance.\"\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the key difference. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the dancer is taught to press the hips *forward* as the upper body goes back. This forward thrust of the pelvis acts as a counterbalance, allowing for a greater arch, particularly in the lower back.\n*   **Movement Initiation:** The movement can feel more like a full-body action rather than an isolated spinal bend. The forward push of the hips is integral to the initiation of the backbend.\n*   **Overall Quality:** The Balanchine *cambré* often has a quicker, more \"thrown\" or \"whipped\" quality compared to the sustained, controlled Vaganova version, although it can also be performed slowly in adagio work. The deeper bend achieved through the hip placement is a hallmark of the style.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods based on the provided answer choices**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While the style of the arms and hands (*port de bras*) might differ slightly, the fundamental pathways are not the primary distinguishing feature of the *cambré* itself. Both methods use coordinated arm movements.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and defining technical difference. Vaganova insists on stationary hips, while Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips. This mechanical difference fundamentally changes the execution and aesthetic of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a *cambré* can be done at any tempo in either method. Speed is a general characteristic, not the defining difference of this specific step's technique.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. The Balanchine hip placement *allows* for a deeper bend, but the hip placement itself is the core technical divergence.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Both methods use specific, coordinated head movements. While there may be stylistic variations, the principle of the head following the line of movement is common to both. It is not the most fundamental point of contrast.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and foundational difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the treatment of the hips. The Vaganova method maintains a static, square pelvis, whereas the Balanchine method uses a forward displacement of the hips to achieve greater depth and dynamism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
