    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of designing a deadbeat observer.\n\n### **1. Problem Formulation**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear system:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith the matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`, `B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`, `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe goal is to design an observer of the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nwhere `x_hat(k)` is the state estimate and `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)` is the estimated output. We need to find the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\nThe condition is that the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, must become identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is the definition of a deadbeat observer.\n\n### **2. Observation Error Dynamics**\n\nFirst, we derive the dynamics of the observation error `e(k)`:\n`e(k + 1) = x(k + 1) - x_hat(k + 1)`\n`e(k + 1) = (Ax(k) + Bu(k)) - (Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(Cx(k) - Cx_hat(k)))`\n`e(k + 1) = A(x(k) - x_hat(k)) - LC(x(k) - x_hat(k))`\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to converge to zero in a finite number of steps, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be a nilpotent matrix. This means that for some integer `q`, `(A - LC)^q = 0`. A necessary and sufficient condition for a matrix to be nilpotent is that all of its eigenvalues are zero.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` must therefore be `λ^n = 0`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector `x(k)`. In this case, `n = 4`.\nSo, our objective is to find a gain matrix `L` such that the characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` is `λ^4`.\n\n### **3. Careful Point: System Observability**\n\nBefore designing the observer, we must ensure the system is observable. An observer can only be designed if the pair `(A, C)` is observable. The system is observable if the observability matrix `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^(n-1)]` has full rank (`rank(O) = n = 4`).\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n`CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\nThe observability matrix up to the first power is `O_2 = [C; CA] = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`.\nThe rank of `O_2` is 3, which is less than 4.\n\nWe continue with `CA^2`:\n`CA^2 = CA * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\nNow, let's form the matrix `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]` which is a 6x4 matrix. The rows `[1 0 0 0]`, `[1 0 0 1]`, `[-2 0 1 0]`, and `[2 1 0 -3]` are linearly independent, meaning the rank of `O_3` is 4.\nSince `rank(O_3) = 4`, the system is observable. The observability index is `ν=3`, which is the shortest time in which the error can be made zero.\n\n### **4. Deriving the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nWe need to find a `L` (a 4x2 matrix) such that `det(λI - (A - LC)) = λ^4`.\nLet `L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]^T`.\nFirst, compute `LC`:\n`LC = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] = [l11+l12, 0, 0, l12; l21+l22, 0, 0, l22; l31+l32, 0, 0, l32; l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]`\n\nNext, form `A_c = A - LC`:\n`A_c = [-1-(l11+l12),  0,   0,   1-l12;`\n     ` 1-(l21+l22),   0,   0,   2-l22;`\n     ` -(l31+l32),    1,   0,  -1-l32;`\n     `-1-(l41+l42),  0,   1,  -1-l42]`\n\nNow, we compute the characteristic polynomial `det(λI - A_c)`. For simplicity, let `di = li1+li2`.\n`det(λI - A_c) = det([λ+1+d1,  0,   0,  -(1-l12); -(1-d2),  λ,   0,  -(2-l22); d3, -1, λ, 1+l32; 1+d4, 0, -1, λ+1+l42])`\n\nThis determinant calculation is complex. A key simplification arises if we make a specific choice. Notice that if `l12=1`, the last column of `A-LC` simplifies significantly. This choice also simplifies the characteristic polynomial calculation drastically.\nLet's make the simplifying choice `l12 = 1`. Then the matrix `λI - A_c` becomes:\n`det([λ+1+d1,  0,   0,   0; -(1-d2),  λ,   0,  -(2-l22); d3, -1, λ, 1+l32; 1+d4, 0, -1, λ+1+l42])`\nThe determinant of this matrix can be computed by expanding along the first row:\n`det = (λ+1+d1) * det([λ, 0, -(2-l22); -1, λ, 1+l32; 0, -1, λ+1+l42])`\nThe smaller 3x3 determinant is:\n`det_3x3 = λ(λ(λ+1+l42) - (-1)(1+l32)) - (2-l22)(1) = λ(λ^2+(1+l42)λ + (1+l32)) - 2+l22`\n`det_3x3 = λ^3 + (1+l42)λ^2 + (1+l32)λ - 2 + l22`\n\nSo, `char_poly = (λ+1+d1) * (λ^3 + (1+l42)λ^2 + (1+l32)λ - 2+l22)`\nExpanding this expression:\n`char_poly = λ^4 + (1+l42)λ^3 + (1+l32)λ^2 + (-2+l22)λ + (1+d1)λ^3 + (1+d1)(1+l42)λ^2 + (1+d1)(1+l32)λ + (1+d1)(-2+l22)`\n`char_poly = λ^4 + (1+l42+1+d1)λ^3 + (1+l32+(1+d1)(1+l42))λ^2 + (-2+l22+(1+d1)(1+l32))λ + (1+d1)(-2+l22)`\n\nWe equate the coefficients of `λ^3, λ^2, λ^1, λ^0` to zero.\n1.  `Coeff(λ^0)`: `(1+d1)(-2+l22) = 0`  => `d1 = -1` or `l22 = 2`.\n2.  `Coeff(λ^1)`: `-2+l22 + (1+d1)(1+l32) = 0`\n3.  `Coeff(λ^2)`: `1+l32 + (1+d1)(1+l42) = 0`\n4.  `Coeff(λ^3)`: `1+l42 + 1+d1 = 0`\n\nLet's assume `d1 = -1` (from equation 1). Since we chose `l12=1`, `d1 = l11+l12 = l11+1 = -1`, which gives `l11 = -2`.\nSubstitute `d1=-1` into the other equations:\n2.  `-2+l22 + (0)(1+l32) = 0` => `-2+l22 = 0` => `l22 = 2`.\n3.  `1+l32 + (0)(1+l42) = 0` => `1+l32 = 0` => `l32 = -1`.\n4.  `1+l42 + 0 = 0` => `1+l42 = 0` => `l42 = -1`.\n\nThis provides a consistent solution for some elements of `L`.\n\n### **5. Final Gain Matrix**\n\nThe solved values are:\n*   `l11 = -2`\n*   `l12 = 1` (our initial choice)\n*   `l22 = 2`\n*   `l32 = -1`\n*   `l42 = -1`\n\nThe calculation of the characteristic polynomial did not depend on `d2, d3, d4` due to the choice of `l12=1`, which zeroed out parts of the determinant calculation. This means the values `l21`, `l31`, `l41` are not constrained by our pole placement requirement. Since the problem asks for \"an\" observer gain matrix, we can select the simplest choice for these free parameters by setting them to zero.\nLet `l21=0, l31=0, l41=0`.\n\nThe final gain matrix `L` is:\n`l11 = -2`, `l12 = 1`\n`l21 = 0`, `l22 = 2`\n`l31 = 0`, `l32 = -1`\n`l41 = 0`, `l42 = -1`\n\nSo, `L = [[-2, 1], [0, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [0, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
