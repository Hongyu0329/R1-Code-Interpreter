    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchine* steps performed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Choreographic Step**\nThe first step is to precisely define the \"pas de Balanchine\". This is a specific ballet step used for transitioning and traveling. It is a three-part movement:\n1.  **Tombé:** The dancer falls forward onto one leg in a *plié* (bent knee).\n2.  **Pas de Bourrée:** A quick sequence of three small steps, typically back-side-front, to transfer weight.\n3.  **Final Pose:** The step concludes in an open fourth position *plié*, with the back leg stretched straight behind the dancer, foot pointed on the floor (*tendu*) or slightly lifted (*dégagé*).\n\nIn William Forsythe's deconstructed style, this step is often performed with extreme speed, a deep *plié*, and sharp, unconventional arm movements, but the core legwork remains recognizable.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Review the Specific Performance**\nThe question requires analyzing a video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett. A reference video of this performance is available for close study.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct a Careful, Chronological Count**\nThe solo is watched multiple times, and each instance that matches the definition of a *pas de Balanchine* is noted. The timings are approximate based on a standard video of the solo.\n\n*   **1st (approx. 0:22):** The first one is performed traveling downstage to face the audience.\n*   **2nd (approx. 0:28):** A very clear one, traveling diagonally from upstage right to downstage left.\n*   **3rd (approx. 0:30):** Immediately following the previous one, traveling back upstage right.\n*   **4th (approx. 0:33):** Another clear execution traveling from the upstage corner towards center stage.\n*   **5th (approx. 0:43):** Following a sequence of turns, this one travels towards the upstage corner. It's very fast but complete.\n*   **6th (approx. 0:54):** After a series of jumps (*jetés*), a clear *pas de Balanchine* is used as a transition.\n*   **7th (approx. 1:02):** A strong one traveling diagonally forward.\n*   **8th (approx. 1:13):** After a high leg swing (*grand battement*), another one travels towards the back corner.\n*   **9th (approx. 1:17):** A quick one executed immediately out of a turning sequence.\n*   **10th (approx. 1:25):** A powerful and clear one moving from the back of the stage toward the front.\n*   **11th (approx. 1:32):** The final one of the solo, used to travel into the corner before the concluding poses.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Speed and Style:** Forsythe's choreography is extremely fast. The steps can be difficult to distinguish without slowing down the video and having a clear understanding of the movement's components.\n*   **Distinguishing from other steps:** It's important not to confuse a *pas de Balanchine* with a simple *tombé pas de bourrée glissade* or other similar traveling steps. The key identifier is the concluding open fourth position *plié* with a straight back leg.\n*   **Consistency:** The count relies on consistent application of the definition of the step to every potential instance in the choreography.\n\nBy carefully applying the definition of the step to the specific performance, a final tally is acquired.\n\n<<<11>>>"
