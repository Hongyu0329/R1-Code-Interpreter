    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Premises**\n*   **Premise 1: JTB Definition of Knowledge:** Knowledge is defined as a Justified True Belief (K=JTB). This means for a person (S) to know a proposition (P), three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (The Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes P (The Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (The Justification condition).\n*   **Premise 2: Limited Epistemic States:** The only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. This is an artificial constraint that simplifies the model of a mind's relationship to a proposition. A person can either *know* something or *believe* it, with no other options.\n*   **Premise 3: Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. This directs our focus away from cases where JTB conditions are met by luck and towards more fundamental, structural problems with the definition itself under the given constraints.\n\n**2. List Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The Status of the \"Belief\" Condition (B):** JTB defines knowledge as a *type* of belief. This means if you are in a state of Knowledge, you are necessarily also in a state of Belief (`K` implies `B`). We must analyze how this interacts with the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two *available* states. This phrasing could imply they are mutually exclusive options.\n*   **The Status of the \"Justification\" Condition (J):** The justification for a belief must come from somewhere. It must be grounded in other beliefs, experiences, or knowledge. Under the constraint, any mental state that acts as a justification must itself be either a Belief or Knowledge. This sets up a critical dilemma.\n*   **The Interaction of Premises:** The problems will arise not from the JTB definition in isolation, but from the tension between the JTB definition and the highly restrictive model of epistemic states.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the careful points above, we can identify two distinct problems that emerge for the JTB definition.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 1: The Contradictory Status of Belief**\n\n1.  The JTB definition asserts that knowledge is a specific *kind* of belief (one that is both true and justified). Therefore, for any proposition P, if you know P, you must also believe P. The state of 'Knowledge' contains the state of 'Belief'.\n2.  However, the question's constraint states that \"our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief.\" This phrasing presents them as two distinct, selectable categories. If someone asks \"What is your epistemic state regarding P?\", the only valid answers are \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n3.  This implies that the two states are **mutually exclusive**. If you are in the state of 'Knowledge', you cannot simultaneously be in the state of 'Belief'. Your state is one or the other.\n4.  This creates a direct contradiction. JTB says you *must* believe what you know. But the constrained model says if you know it, your state is Knowledge, not Belief. Therefore, the 'Belief' condition of the JTB definition can never be satisfied for something that is known.\n\n*   **In short:** JTB requires knowledge to be a belief, but the model's rules imply that if a state is knowledge, it is not a belief.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2: The Infinite Regress or Weak Foundation of Justification**\n\n1.  The JTB definition requires that a belief must be justified to count as knowledge. Let's analyze the nature of this justification (J). A justification relies on other evidence or reasons. These reasons must be held in some epistemic state by the person.\n2.  According to the constraint, the epistemic states grounding the justification must be either **Knowledge** or **Belief**. This creates a dilemma.\n3.  **Option A (Justification is based on Knowledge):** If the justification for knowing proposition P rests on knowing another proposition Q, then Q must also be justified. This justification for Q must rest on knowing some other proposition R, and so on. This creates an infinite regress (`K(P) ← J(Q) ← K(Q) ← J(R) ← K(R)...`). One can never reach a foundational piece of knowledge.\n4.  **Option B (Justification is based on Belief):** If the chain of justification terminates in a mere belief—one that is not itself known—then the entire structure of justification is weak. How can a simple belief, which lacks the status of knowledge and may be false, provide a strong enough warrant to turn another belief into Knowledge? This makes the foundation for knowledge precarious and seemingly insufficient.\n\n*   **In short:** The 'Justification' condition forces a choice: either an infinite regress of knowledge or a weak foundation built on mere belief.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Contradiction of States:** The JTB definition requires knowledge to be a type of belief. However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two available epistemic states implies they are mutually exclusive. This makes it logically impossible for a state to be 'Knowledge' because it can't simultaneously satisfy the 'Belief' condition.\n\n2.  **The Regress of Justification:** The 'Justification' condition must be grounded in another epistemic state. According to the constraint, this state must be either Knowledge or Belief. If it's Knowledge, it leads to an infinite regress of justification. If it's Belief, the justification for Knowledge is built on a weak foundation that is not itself known.\n>>>"
