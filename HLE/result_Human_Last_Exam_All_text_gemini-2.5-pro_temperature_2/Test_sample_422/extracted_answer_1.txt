The two problems are:

1.  **The Contradiction of States:** The JTB definition requires knowledge to be a type of belief. However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two available epistemic states implies they are mutually exclusive. This makes it logically impossible for a state to be 'Knowledge' because it can't simultaneously satisfy the 'Belief' condition.

2.  **The Regress of Justification:** The 'Justification' condition must be grounded in another epistemic state. According to the constraint, this state must be either Knowledge or Belief. If it's Knowledge, it leads to an infinite regress of justification. If it's Belief, the justification for Knowledge is built on a weak foundation that is not itself known.
