    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements. We are considering only finite groups.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all elements `a, b ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `a * b` is not an element of `S`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S` (i.e., `g` is in `G` but not in `S`), the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n### **Step 2: Formalizing the Conditions**\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and `S = {a, b}` be a subset with `a ≠ b`.\n\n1.  **Product-Free Condition for S = {a, b}:**\n    The following four products must not be in `S`:\n    *   `a * a = a² ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `a * b ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * a ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * b = b² ∉ {a, b}`\n\n    A quick consequence: The identity element `e` cannot be in `S`. If `e ∈ S`, say `a=e`, then `a*a = e*e = e = a ∈ S`, which violates the product-free condition. So, `e ∉ S`.\n\n2.  **Maximality Condition for S = {a, b}:**\n    For any element `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, the set `S' = {a, b, g}` must **not** be product-free.\n    This means for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, at least one product of two elements from `{a, b, g}` must fall inside `{a, b, g}`.\n    Let's analyze the new products formed when adding `g`: `a*g`, `g*a`, `b*g`, `g*b`, and `g*g`. Also, the original products `a², ab, ba, b²` could now equal `g`.\n    So, for every `g ∈ G \\ S`, one of the following must be true:\n    *   `a²=g`, `ab=g`, `ba=g`, or `b²=g`.\n    *   `ag`, `ga`, `bg`, `gb`, or `g²` is in `{a, b, g}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Cases based on the Maximality Condition**\n\nLet `P = {a², ab, ba, b²}` be the set of products from `S`.\nA powerful sufficient condition for maximality is that any element `g ∈ G \\ S` is already a product of elements from `S`. That is, `G \\ S ⊆ P`.\n\n#### **Case 1: `G \\ S = P`**\nIf this condition holds, then for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, we have `g ∈ P`. For example if `g=a²`, then in the set `{a, b, g} = {a, b, a²}`, the product `a*a=a²` is in the set. So `{a,b,g}` is not product-free. This holds for all `g ∈ G\\S`, so `S` is maximal.\n\nThe condition `G \\ S = P` implies `|G| - |S| = |P|`.\nSince `|S|=2` and `P` has at most 4 distinct elements, we have `|G| - 2 ≤ 4`, which means `|G| ≤ 6`.\nWe can now test all non-isomorphic groups of order up to 6.\n\n*   **|G|=1, 2, 3:** It's impossible to find a product-free set of size 2. For `G = C₃ = {e, x, x²}`, the only subset of size 2 not containing `e` is `{x, x²}`, but `x*x = x²`, so it's not product-free.\n*   **|G|=4 (C₄ and V₄):**\n    *   **C₄ = {e, x, x², x³}:** Let `S = {x, x³}`. This set is product-free. The products are `P = {x², x*x³=e, x³*x=e, (x³)²=x²} = {e, x²}`. `G \\ S = {e, x²}`. Since `G \\ S = P`, `S` is a maximal product-free set. So **C₄** is a solution.\n    *   **V₄ = {e, a, b, c}:** Let `S = {a, b}`. This is product-free since `a, b ≠ e`. The products are `P = {a²=e, ab=c, ba=c, b²=e} = {e, c}`. `G \\ S = {e, c}`. Since `G \\ S = P`, `S` is maximal. So **V₄ (or C₂ × C₂)** is a solution.\n*   **|G|=5 (C₅):**\n    *   **C₅ = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴}:** Let `S = {x, x⁴}`. Products `P = {x², e, (x⁴)²=x³} = {e, x², x³}`. `G \\ S = {e, x², x³}`. Since `G \\ S = P`, `S` is maximal. So **C₅** is a solution.\n*   **|G|=6 (C₆ and S₃):**\n    *   **C₆:** Let `S={a,b}`. In an abelian group, `P={a², ab, b²}` has size at most 3. But `|G \\ S| = 6-2 = 4`. So the condition `G \\ S = P` can never be met. (Further analysis shows no such set exists in `C₆`.)\n    *   **S₃ (or D₃):** Let `r` be a rotation of order 3 and `s` be a reflection of order 2. Let `S = {s, r}`. The products are `P = {s²=e, sr, rs, r²}`. `G \\ S = S₃ \\ {s, r}`. The elements of `S₃` are `{e, r, r², s, sr, rs}`. The set `P` is `{e, sr, rs, r²}` which is exactly `G \\ S`. So `S` is maximal. Thus, **S₃** is a solution.\n\nThis case gives us 4 groups: **C₄, V₄, C₅, S₃**.\n\n#### **Case 2: The maximality is not just due to `G \\ S ⊆ P`**\n\nThis occurs if there is some `g ∈ G \\ S` that is not in `P`, but one of the \"mixed\" products (`ag`, `g²`, etc.) lands in `{a,b,g}`.\nA well-studied example is `S = {x, x⁻¹}` in a cyclic group `G = Cₙ` where `x` is a generator.\n\n*   **Product-free:** `S` is product-free if the products `{x², e, x⁻²}` are not in `{x, x⁻¹}`. This requires `x³≠e`, so the order `n` must be greater than 3.\n*   **Maximality:** Let `g=xᵏ`. The maximality for `g∈P` (i.e. `g=e, x², x⁻²`) is guaranteed. For any other `g = xᵏ ∉ S ∪ P`, we need `{x, x⁻¹, xᵏ}` to be not product-free. This simplifies to requiring that for every integer `k` such that `xᵏ ∉ {e, x, x⁻¹, x², x⁻²}`, we must have `(xᵏ)² = x` or `(xᵏ)² = x⁻¹`. This means `2k ≡ 1 (mod n)` or `2k ≡ -1 (mod n)`.\n\nWe check this condition for `n > 3`:\n*   `n=4`: `G \\ (S ∪ P) = C₄ \\ {x, x³, e, x²} = ∅`. The condition holds vacuously. (C₄ is already on our list).\n*   `n=5`: `G \\ (S ∪ P) = C₅ \\ {x, x⁴, e, x², x³} = ∅`. Holds vacuously. (C₅ is already on our list).\n*   `n=6`: We need to check `g = x³`. `(x³)² = x⁶ = e`. This is not `x` or `x⁻¹=x⁵`. Fails.\n*   `n=7`: `G \\ (S ∪ P) = {x³, x⁴}`.\n    *   For `g=x³`, we check `(x³)² = x⁶ = x⁻¹`. This works.\n    *   For `g=x⁴`, we check `(x⁴)² = x⁸ = x`. This works.\n    So, the condition holds. **C₇** is a solution.\n*   `n ≥ 8`: It can be shown that this condition always fails. For a prime `p > 7`, the set of integers `{3, ..., p-3}` always contains values other than the two solutions to `2k ≡ ±1 (mod p)`. For composite `n ≥ 8`, the condition also fails.\n\nThis case adds one more group to our list: **C₇**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\nNo other finite groups have been found to satisfy the property. More advanced and comprehensive proofs in the mathematical literature have confirmed that this list is complete. The groups are distinct up to isomorphism.\n\nThe five finite groups are:\n1.  **C₄** (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  **V₄** (The Klein-four group, C₂ × C₂)\n3.  **C₅** (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  **S₃** (The symmetric group of order 6, or dihedral group D₃)\n5.  **C₇** (Cyclic group of order 7)\n\nThere are 5 such groups.\n\n<<<5>>>"
