    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Molecule and the Labeling Pattern:**\n    *   The starting molecule is glucose.\n    *   It is specifically labeled with the Carbon-13 isotope at positions 1 and 4. This is 1,4-¹³C glucose.\n    *   The structure of glucose is a 6-carbon sugar. We can number the carbons as follows:\n        ```\n              C1=O (aldehyde group)\n              |\n              C2-OH\n              |\n              C3-OH\n              |\n              C4-OH \n              |\n              C5-OH\n              |\n              C6H2OH \n        ```\n    *   In 1,4-¹³C glucose, the carbons labeled are **C1** and **C4**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Metabolic Pathway:**\n    *   The question specifies that the molecule goes through **glycolysis**.\n    *   Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reactions of Glycolysis for CO₂ Production:**\n    *   Glycolysis consists of 10 enzymatic reactions. We need to examine these reactions to see if any of them release carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The overall, net reaction for glycolysis is:\n        Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate (C₃H₃O₃⁻) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n    *   The starting molecule, glucose, has 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The final products, two pyruvate molecules, each have 3 carbon atoms.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the products is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Conclusion:**\n    *   **Critical Point:** The number of carbon atoms is conserved throughout the entire glycolytic pathway. The 6-carbon glucose molecule is simply split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   There are **no decarboxylation reactions** (reactions that remove a carboxyl group as CO₂) in any of the 10 steps of glycolysis.\n    *   Therefore, **glycolysis itself does not release any CO₂ molecules**, regardless of whether they would be labeled or not.\n    *   CO₂ is released in subsequent steps of cellular respiration, such as the pyruvate decarboxylation (link reaction) that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and during the citric acid (TCA) cycle. However, the question strictly limits the scope to the process of **glycolysis**.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Question:** How many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules will be released?\n*   **Pathway:** Glycolysis.\n*   **Analysis:** Glycolysis does not produce any CO₂ molecules.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number of CO₂ molecules released is zero. Therefore, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released is also zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
