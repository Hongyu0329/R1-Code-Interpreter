    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation...\"**: This indicates that the key to solving the riddle lies in understanding the work of a specific scholar named Veronika Campan. Our first step is to identify her area of expertise. A quick search reveals she is a scholar in theology and philosophy, often writing about biblical texts.\n2.  **\"...at the end of HIS work...\"**: This tells us we are looking for a famous text or a set of laws. The phrase \"end of HIS work\" suggests we should focus on the concluding part of this text.\n3.  **\"...HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"**: This is a very specific clue. It points to a rule or law that deals with desiring things that belong to other people. This strongly suggests the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is located at the end of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).\n4.  **\"...HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"**: This is the most complex clue. In the same set of laws (the Ten Commandments), there is a famous \"prohibition against representation\"â€”the Second Commandment, which forbids making graven images or idols. Campan's interpretation likely highlights a contradiction or tension: to forbid coveting specific material possessions (\"house,\" \"ox,\" \"donkey\"), the law must name them, thus creating a mental *representation* of them. This act of listing and naming \"naturally ignores\" the spirit of the earlier, sweeping ban on representation.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   The subject \"HE\" is the traditional author or transmitter of the work in question.\n*   \"HIS work\" is the Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue.\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" refers specifically to the Second Commandment.\n*   The addressing of \"another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment.\n*   The core of the puzzle is Veronika Campan's philosophical interpretation that the Tenth Commandment's specific list of items is a form of representation that counteracts the aniconic principle of the Second Commandment.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  Based on the analysis, \"HIS work\" is the Ten Commandments.\n2.  In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Ten Commandments were given by God to a specific person on Mount Sinai, who then delivered them to the people.\n3.  This person is considered the great lawgiver of the Israelites.\n4.  This figure's name is Moses. The laws he delivered are foundational to the Torah (the first five books of the Bible), which is often referred to as the Law of Moses.\n5.  Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses. The full name commonly used in English is simply Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
