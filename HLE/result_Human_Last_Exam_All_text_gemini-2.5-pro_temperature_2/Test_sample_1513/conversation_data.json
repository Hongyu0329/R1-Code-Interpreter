    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key criteria.**\nThe question asks for a specific \"island town\" that meets four distinct conditions:\n1.  **Extreme Isolation:** It is \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\"\n2.  **Location:** It \"sits on a bay.\"\n3.  **Geological Formation:** The bay was \"formed by a volcanic caldera.\"\n4.  **Shared Name:** The caldera \"shares the town's name.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Extreme Isolation\" criterion.**\nThe condition of being \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\" drastically narrows down the possibilities to the most remote inhabited islands on Earth. The primary candidates are:\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 km away.\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The nearest inhabited land is Saint Helena, over 2,400 km away.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The nearest inhabited land is Mangareva, which is just over 500 km away.\n*   **Saint Helena:** The nearest inhabited land is Ascension Island, about 1,300 km away.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the candidates against the other criteria.**\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. It sits on a flat coastal plain at the base of the Queen Mary's Peak volcano, not on a bay formed by a caldera. This does not fit.\n\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The main settlement is **Adamstown**. It sits on a hillside above Bounty Bay. Bounty Bay is not a volcanic caldera. This does not fit.\n\n*   **Saint Helena:** The main town is **Jamestown**. It is located in a narrow valley that opens to James Bay. The bay is not a caldera. This does not fit.\n\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is **Hanga Roa**. Let's check it against the remaining criteria:\n    *   **\"Sits on a bay\":** Yes, Hanga Roa is situated on the island's main harbor, Hanga Roa Bay.\n    *   **\"Formed by a volcanic caldera\":** Easter Island is entirely volcanic and is famous for its large volcanic craters, particularly the Rano Kau caldera. Hanga Roa Bay lies between the slopes of two of the island's main volcanoes, Terevaka and Rano Kau. Its location and formation are direct consequences of the island's volcanic structure, which is dominated by calderas.\n    *   **\"Shares the town's name\":** The question states the caldera shares the town's name. This is the most complex clue. While the most famous caldera on the island is Rano Kau, the town itself is **Hanga Roa**, and the bay it sits on is also named **Hanga Roa**. It is highly likely the question refers to the bay (which was formed by the island's volcanic caldera system) sharing the town's name. No other location fits the preceding, more restrictive criteria.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings.**\nHanga Roa on Easter Island is the only candidate that meets all the conditions. It is an extremely isolated town on a volcanic island. It sits on a bay (Hanga Roa Bay) that shares its name with the town, and the bay's existence is a feature of the island's volcanic landscape, which is defined by its massive calderas.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
