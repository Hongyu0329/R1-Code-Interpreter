    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues Provided in the Question**\n\nLet's break down the question into its key components:\n\n*   **Clue 1: Association with Andrei Voznesensky.** The man in question was the subject of a work by the famous Soviet/Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n*   **Clue 2: The Quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\".** This is a specific description from Voznesensky's work, indicating the man was involved in exploration or sea voyages, and was portrayed as a pioneer.\n*   **Clue 3: The Quote \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".** This is a crucial point. It tells us that for a long time, the man's burial site was unknown or lost.\n*   **Clue 4: The Timeline \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s\".** This narrows down the possibilities significantly. The mystery of the lost grave was solved around this specific period.\n*   **Final Question:** We need to find the man's last name.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues**\n\n1.  The first step is to identify the work by Andrei Voznesensky. The quotes are from his famous rock opera (and preceding poem) **\"Juno and Avos\"** (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work tells the story of a real historical figure.\n\n2.  The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count **Nikolai Rezanov**. He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer who led an expedition to Russian America (Alaska) and California in the early 19th century. The ships in his expedition were named the *Juno* and the *Avos*. This fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer. The opera romanticizes his journey, fitting the \"joy-discovering\" description.\n\n3.  Now let's consider the lost grave. Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while on his return journey. He was buried in the Voskresensky Cathedral cemetery. However, over the subsequent decades and centuries, the cathedral was demolished by the Soviet government (1930s-1960s) and the cemetery was lost. For a very long time, the exact location of his grave was unknown, which perfectly matches Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\n4.  Finally, we connect this to the timeline. The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the Soviet Union sparked renewed public interest in Rezanov's story. This led to an official search for his lost grave in Krasnoyarsk. In the late 1980s (specifically, around 1989), researchers and archaeologists located what is believed to be the original burial site. This event provides the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question and perfectly aligns with the timeline given in the riddle.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Answer**\n\nAll the clues point to a single historical figure whose story was popularized by Andrei Voznesensky. His profession matches, the mystery of his grave is central to his legend, and the rediscovery of the grave occurred in the specified time frame. The man's last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
