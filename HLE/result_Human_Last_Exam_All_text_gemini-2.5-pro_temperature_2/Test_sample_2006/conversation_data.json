    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Haiku**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Title:** The title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". This is presented as a question. The most likely interpretation is a homophone puzzle. \"The Bays\" sounds like \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the 'B's'?\" The haiku itself must contain the clues to identify these 'B's. The plural form \"Bays\" suggests there is more than one.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Haiku's Thematic Clues:** The poem's language points towards a military and historical theme, specifically concerning aviation.\n    *   \"tempest\": A violent storm, often used metaphorically for war or conflict.\n    *   \"winds of change\": A phrase suggesting a significant shift in power, strategy, or technology.\n    *   This context makes it highly probable that the 'B's are famous B-series military bombers of the United States Air Force. The three lines of the haiku likely correspond to clues for three of these bombers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyzing the third line - \"A divine one yields\".**\n    This line is the most intricate and key to solving the puzzle. It cleverly provides two answers.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"A ... one\" points directly to the **B-1** Lancer bomber.\n    *   **Clue 2:** \"divine one\" is a powerful description of the **B-2 Spirit** bomber, whose name implies a divine or supernatural entity.\n    *   **Connecting Word:** The word \"yields\" describes the relationship between the two. The B-1 program was the predecessor, which \"yielded\" to the more advanced B-2 stealth bomber program. Thus, this single line points to both the **B-1** and the **B-2**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyzing the first line - \"An August tempest\".**\n    Now that we have two 'B's, we need to find the third. This line points to a significant military \"tempest\" linked to the month of August.\n    *   **Historical Event:** In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. This act triggered the international response that became the Gulf War, which included the massive air campaign known as Operation Desert Storm.\n    *   **The Bomber:** The iconic long-range heavy bomber that played a critical role in this conflict was the **B-52** Stratofortress. It flew from bases around the world to deliver devastating payloads, truly representing a \"tempest\" and a \"wind of change\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyzing the second line - \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\".**\n    With the three answers (B-1, B-2, B-52) identified from the other two lines, this middle line serves to complete the 5-7-5 syllable structure of the haiku.\n    *   **Thematic Reinforcement:** It provides thematic context, as all three of these bombers were revolutionary aircraft that brought significant \"winds of change\" to military strategy and geopolitics. While \"Twice fifteen\" (30) could be a red herring pointing to a more obscure plane like the B-30, it is more likely that this line acts as the structural and thematic core of the poem, rather than containing a distinct third puzzle. The puzzle is structured with clues in lines 1 and 3.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assembling the Final Answer.**\n    The \"B's\" identified from the haiku are:\n    1.  B-1 Lancer\n    2.  B-2 Spirit\n    3.  B-52 Stratofortress\n\n    The final instruction is to present the answer in alphabetical order.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   The title \"The Bays\" must be correctly interpreted as \"The B's\".\n*   The language of the haiku strongly suggests a military aircraft theme.\n*   The third line (\"A divine one yields\") is a dual clue, which is the main key to solving the riddle correctly and avoiding dead ends.\n*   The first line (\"An August tempest\") refers to a specific historical event (the lead-up to the Gulf War) to identify the B-52.\n*   The second line (\"Twice fifteen...\") is best understood as thematic filler that completes the haiku structure, rather than a clue to be deciphered arithmetically, which leads to confusion.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nArranging the identified bombers in alphabetical order gives: B-1, B-2, B-52.\n\n<<<B-1, B-2, B-52>>>"
