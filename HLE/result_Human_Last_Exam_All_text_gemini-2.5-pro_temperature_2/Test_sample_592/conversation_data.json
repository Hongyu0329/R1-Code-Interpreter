    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Deconstruct the provided information:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (English title: *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to a US city.\n3.  **Recall or research the plot of *Ovosodo*:** The film follows the life of the protagonist, Pietro, growing up in Livorno, Italy. A key figure in his life is his wealthy and rebellious best friend, Tommaso.\n4.  **Focus on Tommaso's character arc:** Tommaso is restless and feels trapped by his provincial life, despite his family's wealth. He dreams of becoming a rock star. This dissatisfaction leads him to make a drastic decision to leave Italy.\n5.  **Determine the destination:** As part of his quest to \"make it\" in the music world and escape his background, Tommaso moves to the United States. The specific city he moves to is explicitly mentioned in the film, as he communicates with Pietro from his new home. The city is renowned as a hub for artists and musicians, fitting his aspirations.\n6.  **Confirm the city:** Film synopses and character analyses confirm that Tommaso moves to New York City to pursue his musical dreams.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Protagonist vs. Supporting Character:** It's important to note that Tommaso is not the main protagonist of the film; that is Pietro (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini). Tommaso is the protagonist's best friend, and his journey is a major sub-plot.\n*   **Actor Confirmation:** The question correctly identifies Marco Cocci as the actor playing Tommaso.\n*   **Destination Specificity:** The film doesn't just say \"America\"; it specifies the city, which is central to Tommaso's ambitions as an aspiring musician.\n\nBased on the analysis of the film's plot, the US city Tommaso moves to is New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
