    "An internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in a 2-category is given by a pair of 1-morphisms (functors) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, along with 2-morphisms (natural transformations) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ and $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$ that satisfy the triangle identities. The question asks for the number of such adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. So we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n1.  **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n2.  **1-morphisms:** A 1-morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$. These are the morphisms in the standard simplex category $\\Delta$.\n3.  **2-morphisms:** The category $\\Delta$ is viewed as a \"locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$\". This means for any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, the hom-set $\\mathrm{Hom}([m],[n])$ is a poset. The order is given by the pointwise comparison: a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$, which means $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$. Since it is a poset, there is at most one 2-morphism between any two 1-morphisms.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize an adjunction in this context.\n\nFor an adjunction $(L, R)$ with $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$:\n*   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ is a 2-morphism. By the definition above, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, i.e., for all $x \\in [m]$, $x \\le (R \\circ L)(x)$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$ is a 2-morphism. This means $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, i.e., for all $y \\in [n]$, $(L \\circ R)(y) \\le y$.\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied. Thus, an adjunction is precisely a pair of order-preserving maps $(L,R)$ satisfying these two inequalities. This is the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$.\n\nThe condition for a Galois connection is often stated as: for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$,\n$L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the number of such adjunctions.\n\nAn adjunction is specified by the pair $(L, R)$. However, in a Galois connection, $L$ uniquely determines $R$ and vice-versa, using the formulas:\n*   $R(y) = \\max \\{x \\in [m] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$\n*   $L(x) = \\min \\{y \\in [n] \\mid x \\le R(y)\\}$\n\nSo, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of maps $L$ that can be the left part of an adjunction, or equivalently, the number of maps $R$ that can be the right part.\n\n1.  **Condition on L:** For $R$ to be well-defined for all $y$, the set $\\{x \\in [m] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$ must be non-empty and have a maximum for every $y$. This is always true as $[m]$ is finite. A map $L$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For an order-preserving map between totally ordered sets, this is true for all non-empty suprema. However, preservation of the supremum of the empty set must also hold. The supremum of the empty set is the bottom element. Thus, we must have $L(\\bot_{[m]}) = \\bot_{[n]}$, which translates to $L(0) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Condition on R:** For $L$ to be well-defined for all $x$, the set $\\{y \\in [n] \\mid x \\le R(y)\\}$ must be non-empty for every $x \\in [m]$. This is guaranteed if $R$ preserves all infima (meets). For totally ordered sets, this reduces to preserving the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element. So, we must have $R(\\top_{[n]}) = \\top_{[m]}$, which translates to $R(n) = m$.\n\nTherefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$. This is also equal to the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37)=23$. We can calculate either of these.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the combinatorial calculation.\n\nLet's calculate the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37)=23$.\nAn order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$ is defined by a sequence of integers $(R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37))$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37) \\le 23$.\nThe condition $R(37)=23$ fixes the last value. So we need to count the number of sequences $(R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36))$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\n\nWe use a standard combinatorial technique (\"stars and bars\" or mapping to sets) to count these maps. An order-preserving map from $[N]$ to $[M]$ corresponds to choosing $N+1$ integers with replacement from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, M\\}$.\nThe formula for the number of order-preserving maps from $[N]$ to $[M]$ is $\\binom{M+N+1}{N+1}$.\n\nIn our case, we are counting maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$. So, $N=36$ and $M=23$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36 + 1} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$. This means counting sequences where $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 23\\}$ to $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. By re-indexing, this is the same as counting order-preserving maps from $[22]$ to $[37]$.\nHere, $N=22$ and $M=37$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{37 + 22 + 1}{22 + 1} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nSince $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The two counts are identical, which confirms our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial(60, 23)>>>"
