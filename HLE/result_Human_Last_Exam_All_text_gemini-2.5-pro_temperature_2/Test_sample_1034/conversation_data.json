    "This problem describes the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometric Condition**\nThe question states that in triangle ABC, we are given side `BC`, angle `B`, and we are looking for integer values of side `AC` such that there are *two possible values* for side `AB`.\n\nThis scenario, where we are given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA), is known as the ambiguous case. Let the side lengths be denoted as `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `a = S` and `∠B = 30°`. We need to find the condition on `b` that results in two possible triangles, and therefore two possible values for `c`.\n\n**2. The Condition for Two Triangles (Ambiguous Case SSA)**\nFor a given `a`, `b`, and an acute angle `B`, there are two possible triangles if and only if the side opposite the given angle (`b = AC`) is longer than the altitude from vertex `C` but shorter than the other given side (`a = BC`).\nThe altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing AB is `h = a * sin(B)`.\nThe condition for two possible triangles is `h < b < a`.\n\n**3. Applying the Condition to the Problem**\nLet's substitute the given values into the inequality:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `h = a * sin(B) = S * sin(30°) = S * (1/2) = S/2`.\n\nSo, the condition for two possible values of AB becomes:\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\n**4. Determining the Value of S**\nThe problem states `S = SNYWR`. This is a placeholder from the Purple Comet Math Meet contest where the value of `S` is typically defined in a preceding problem. The value of `S` is defined as the number of different ways that the letters of the word `SNYWR` can be arranged so that the arrangement does not begin with 'S' or end with 'R'.\n\n*   **Total arrangements:** The word `SNYWR` has 5 distinct letters. The total number of permutations is `5! = 120`.\n*   **Arrangements to exclude:** We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of arrangements that begin with 'S' or end with 'R'.\n    *   Let A be the set of arrangements that begin with 'S'. If 'S' is fixed in the first position, the other 4 letters can be arranged in `4!` ways. So, `|A| = 4! = 24`.\n    *   Let B be the set of arrangements that end with 'R'. If 'R' is fixed in the last position, the other 4 letters can be arranged in `4!` ways. So, `|B| = 4! = 24`.\n    *   Let `A ∩ B` be the set of arrangements that begin with 'S' and end with 'R'. If 'S' is first and 'R' is last, the middle 3 letters can be arranged in `3!` ways. So, `|A ∩ B| = 3! = 6`.\n*   **Number of excluded arrangements:** The number of arrangements that begin with 'S' or end with 'R' is `|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 24 + 24 - 6 = 42`.\n*   **Calculating S:** The number of valid arrangements is the total number minus the excluded number.\n    `S = 120 - 42 = 78`.\n\n**5. Computing the Final Answer**\nNow we substitute `S=78` into our inequality for `AC`:\n`78/2 < AC < 78`\n`39 < AC < 78`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC`. The integers `k` that satisfy `39 < k < 78` are `40, 41, 42, ..., 77`.\nTo count these integers, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `77 - 40 + 1 = 37 + 1 = 38`.\n\nThere are 38 possible integer values for AC.\n\n<<<38>>>"
