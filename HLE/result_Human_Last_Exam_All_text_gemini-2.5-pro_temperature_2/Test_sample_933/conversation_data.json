    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Product:** The question is about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$). The most direct and common method involves reacting its constituent elements: Xenon ($Xe$) and Fluorine ($F_2$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Synthesis Reaction:** The balanced chemical equation for the most common synthesis method is:\n    $Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Nature of the Reaction:** Xenon is a noble gas, which means it is generally very unreactive. Fluorine is the most electronegative and reactive element. Forcing a noble gas to react requires significant energy input to overcome the activation energy barrier. This energy is typically supplied in the form of heat, although other methods like UV radiation or electric discharge can also be used. The question specifies \"any method,\" but we must consider efficiency. The thermal (heating) method is the most common and efficient for producing pure samples on a lab scale.\n\n4.  **Examine the Role of Reaction Conditions (Temperature, Pressure, Reactant Ratio):** The synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions. Different conditions lead to different products:\n    *   **Xenon Difluoride ($XeF_2$):** Forms when there is a large excess of Xenon gas, often at slightly lower temperatures or through photochemical methods.\n    *   **Xenon Tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$):** Forms under specific conditions where the amount of fluorine is greater than that for $XeF_2$ production, but not excessive.\n    *   **Xenon Hexafluoride ($XeF_6$):** Forms at higher temperatures and with a large excess of fluorine gas.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Temperature Option for Efficiency:** We need to find the *coldest* temperature at which the production is *still efficient*. \"Efficient\" implies a good yield in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** At this high temperature, especially with the necessary excess of fluorine, the reaction tends to proceed further to form Xenon hexafluoride ($XeF_6$). This would make the production of $XeF_4$ less efficient as it would be contaminated with or replaced by $XeF_6$.\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely cited, \"textbook\" temperature for the efficient synthesis of $XeF_4$. The original synthesis by Claassen, Selig, and Malm in 1962, which is still the standard, involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio to 400 °C at approximately 6 atmospheres of pressure. This temperature provides enough energy for the reaction to proceed at a good rate while minimizing the formation of the other fluorides, thus leading to an efficient process with high yield of $XeF_4$.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate between xenon and fluorine is very slow. While some product might form over a very long period, it would not be considered an \"efficient\" synthesis. Furthermore, lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of $XeF_2$, not $XeF_4$.\n    *   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, and F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for a thermal reaction between Xenon and Fluorine. The reaction rate would be negligible, and thus the production would be effectively zero. While these low temperatures might be used to collect the products from a high-energy process like electric discharge, they are not the reaction temperatures for an efficient synthesis.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Efficiently\" is key:** This word rules out conditions that are too slow (low temperature) or that produce significant amounts of undesired byproducts (too high temperature, wrong reactant ratio).\n*   **Balancing Act:** The synthesis is a balance. Enough heat is needed to make the reaction happen, but not so much that an undesired product ($XeF_6$) is formed. 400 °C is the established sweet spot.\n*   **The \"Coldest\" Temperature:** The question asks for the coldest temperature where production is *still* efficient. Comparing the viable options, 400 °C is colder than 600 °C. Temperatures below 400 °C, such as 200 °C, are generally considered inefficient for this specific synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the established optimal temperature that balances reaction rate and product selectivity for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride. While higher temperatures can work, they favor $XeF_6$ formation. Lower temperatures result in an impractically slow reaction. Therefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature on the list where efficient production is achieved.\n\n<<<B>>>"
