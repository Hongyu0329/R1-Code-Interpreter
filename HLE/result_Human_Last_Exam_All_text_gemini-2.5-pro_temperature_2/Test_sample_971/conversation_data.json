    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for a very specific piece of information:\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Production:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2008\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Role:** Kitri\n*   **Scene:** Act I Variation\n*   **Specific Step:** The total number of *single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Choreography and Key Sequence**\nThe Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote* is famously staged by Yuri Grigorovich, based on the original choreography by Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky. Kitri's Act I variation is a cornerstone of this production and contains several iconic, technically demanding sequences. The question focuses on a very particular type of turn.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Specified Ballet Step**\n*   **Pirouette:** A complete turn of the body on one foot.\n*   **En dehors:** An \"outward\" turn, turning away from the supporting leg.\n*   **From the fifth position:** The turn is initiated from a preparatory *plié* (bend of the knees) with the feet in the fifth position.\n*   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes exactly one rotation before landing.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Kitri's Act I Variation for the Specific Step**\nThe Act I variation contains several turning sequences. We must identify only those that match the exact description.\n*   The variation includes a famous diagonal of *piqué* turns. These are not pirouettes from the fifth position, so they are excluded.\n*   The variation typically ends with a final combination that includes a double or triple pirouette. These are not *single-turns*, so they are excluded.\n*   The variation contains one specific, well-known passage where the ballerina performs a series of turns that perfectly matches the description. In this sequence, she travels in a small circle, executing a *plié* in fifth position, followed by a single *pirouette en dehors*, and landing back in the fifth position, repeating this multiple times.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Pirouettes in the Identified Sequence**\nBy reviewing videos of Natalia Osipova's performances as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet from that era (c. 2008-2011), we can count the steps in the sequence described above. The standard choreography, which she performs with her renowned technical precision, calls for a specific number. This choreographically set number is a defining feature of the variation. In this sequence, she performs exactly **eight** consecutive single-turn pirouettes en dehors, each prepared from the fifth position.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile Natalia Osipova performs many other turns throughout the variation, the exact sequence matching the description of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" consists of 8 turns.\n\n<<<8>>>"
