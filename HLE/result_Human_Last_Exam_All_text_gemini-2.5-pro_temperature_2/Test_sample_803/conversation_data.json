    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset S of a group G is product-free if for any two elements s₁, s₂ ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), their product s₁s₂ is not in S. This can be written as S⋅S ∩ S = ∅. As a consequence, the identity element 1_G cannot be in a product-free set S for any non-trivial group, because 1_G * 1_G = 1_G ∈ S would violate the condition.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set S is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set S fills G:** A subset S of a group G fills G if G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1_G}, where S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}. This means every non-identity element of G is either in S or its inverse is in S.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group G is filled if **every** maximal by inclusion product-free set in G fills G.\n*   **The Group G:** We are looking for nonabelian groups G of order |G| = 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of G**\n\nLet G be a group of order 2q^m where q is an odd prime.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, G has a Sylow q-subgroup P of order q^m and a Sylow 2-subgroup K of order 2.\n*   The number of Sylow q-subgroups, n_q, must satisfy n_q ≡ 1 (mod q) and n_q must divide |G|/|P| = 2.\n*   So, n_q can be 1 or 2.\n    *   If n_q = 2, then 2 ≡ 1 (mod q), which means q divides 1. This is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, n_q must be 1. This means the Sylow q-subgroup P is unique and hence is a normal subgroup of G.\n*   The Sylow 2-subgroup K has order 2, so K = <x> for some element x with x² = 1_G.\n*   Since P is normal in G, G is a semidirect product G = P ⋊ K = P ⋊ <x>.\n*   The group G being nonabelian means the action of x on P by conjugation is non-trivial. That is, there exists at least one element p ∈ P such that xpx⁻¹ = xpx ≠ p.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing a specific maximal product-free set**\n\nWe will now construct a specific product-free set and test if it is maximal and if it fills G. If we can find just one maximal product-free set that does not fill G, then by definition, G is not a filled group.\n\n*   Since P is a normal subgroup of index 2 in G, the group G is partitioned into two cosets: P and Px.\n*   Let's define the set S = Px. S is the set of all elements in G that are not in P.\n*   **Is S product-free?**\n    *   Let s₁, s₂ be two elements in S. Then s₁ = p₁x and s₂ = p₂x for some p₁, p₂ ∈ P.\n    *   Their product is s₁s₂ = (p₁x)(p₂x) = p₁(x p₂ x⁻¹)x² = p₁(x p₂ x)1_G.\n    *   Since P is a normal subgroup, the conjugate x p₂ x is also an element of P.\n    *   Therefore, the product s₁s₂ is a product of two elements of P (p₁ and x p₂ x), which means s₁s₂ ∈ P.\n    *   Since S = Px and P ∩ Px = ∅, the product s₁s₂ is not in S.\n    *   Thus, S = Px is a product-free set.\n*   **Is S maximal?**\n    *   To check for maximality, we must show that for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n    *   Since G = P ∪ Px and S = Px, the elements g ∈ G \\ S are precisely the elements of P. Let g ∈ P.\n    *   We need to check if S ∪ {g} is product-free. It is not product-free if we can find two elements in S ∪ {g} whose product is also in S ∪ {g}.\n    *   Let's try to express g as a product of two elements from S.\n    *   Let s₁ = gx and s₂ = x.\n        *   Is s₁ ∈ S? Since g ∈ P, gx ∈ Px = S. Yes.\n        *   Is s₂ ∈ S? Since x = 1_G * x and 1_G ∈ P, x ∈ Px = S. Yes.\n    *   The product is s₁s₂ = (gx)x = g(x²) = g(1_G) = g.\n    *   We have shown that any element g ∈ P can be written as a product of two elements from S. Since g ∈ P, g is not in S. This corresponds to the case where `g = s₁s₂` for `s₁,s₂ ∈ S`. This shows that for any g∉S, the set S ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n    *   Therefore, S = Px is a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n*   **Does S fill G?**\n    *   A set S fills G if G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1_G}.\n    *   We have S = Px.\n    *   The set of inverses is S⁻¹ = (Px)⁻¹ = x⁻¹P⁻¹ = xP. Since P is a normal subgroup, xP = Px. So S⁻¹ = Px = S.\n    *   So, S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1_G} becomes S ∪ S ∪ {1_G} = S ∪ {1_G} = Px ∪ {1_G}.\n    *   The group G is G = P ∪ Px.\n    *   The set Px ∪ {1_G} is equal to G if and only if P = {1_G}.\n    *   However, the group G is nonabelian, so its order 2q^m must be greater than 2. This means P is a non-trivial subgroup. So, P \\ {1_G} is non-empty.\n    *   The set S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {1_G} = Px ∪ {1_G} is missing all the non-identity elements of P. Thus, it does not fill G.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis in Step 3 holds for any nonabelian group G of order 2q^m for an odd prime q. We have constructed a set S = Px (where P is the Sylow q-subgroup and x is an involution) and have shown that:\n1.  S is a maximal product-free set.\n2.  S does not fill G.\n\nSince a group G is filled only if **every** maximal product-free set fills it, and we have found one that does not, we can conclude that no such group is a filled group.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of this order. Based on this direct analysis, the set of such groups is empty.\n\nFinal Answer Check: This is a powerful and general argument. It appears to apply to any group with a subgroup of index 2 that contains an involution in its complement (which is always true for G of order 2q^m). While some specific groups like the quaternion group Q_8 are known to be exceptions to similar general rules, Q_8 is of order 8 = 2*2², so q=2 is not an odd prime. Therefore, the exceptions do not apply to the case in the question. The conclusion that there are no such groups is robust based on the definitions provided."
