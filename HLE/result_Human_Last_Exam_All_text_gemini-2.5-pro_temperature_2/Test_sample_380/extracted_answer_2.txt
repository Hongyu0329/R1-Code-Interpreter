The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral structure of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). The angle between the local magnetic field and the radial direction at L1 is typically around 45 degrees.

The practice of using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in a GSE coordinate system) to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is a common and practical approximation, not a statement that the local field is radial. The justification for this approximation is as follows:

1.  **Convenience and Convention:** Spacecraft data is usually provided in fixed coordinate systems like GSE, where the Y-Z plane is perpendicular to the Sun-Earth (radial) line. Using these components directly is computationally simple, especially for analyzing large datasets.

2.  **Robustness of Polarization Signature:** The primary purpose of the normalized magnetic helicity calculation is often to determine the sense of polarization (left-hand or right-hand), which is given by the sign (+ or -) of the helicity. Although the choice of a misaligned plane will cause the magnitude of the calculated helicity to be less than one, the sign (the sense of rotation) is preserved. This is because projecting a rotating vector onto a different plane does not reverse its direction of rotation. This makes the approximation sufficient for wave identification.

3.  **Alternative Rigorous Method:** For detailed, high-precision studies of specific wave events, a more physically accurate method called Minimum Variance Analysis (MVA) is employed. MVA is used to determine the actual direction of wave propagation, and the helicity is then calculated in the plane perpendicular to that direction. The existence and use of MVA underscore that using the radial-perpendicular components is a known approximation, trading some accuracy for simplicity.

In summary, the method does not assume the local field is radial. Instead, it leverages a convenient, fixed coordinate system with the understanding that the most critical piece of information for wave identification—the sign of the polarization—is reliably obtained.
