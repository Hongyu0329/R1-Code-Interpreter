    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Preparatory Verse:** Before listing the names of the Prophets, the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, states that it is obligatory to know the names of twenty-five of them. This serves as an introduction to the list. This verse is:\n    *   **Arabic:** تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Transliteration:** *Tafṣīlu khamsatin wa ʿishrīna lazim, Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim.*\n    *   **Meaning:** The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding, upon every legally responsible person, so verify and take this benefit.\n    *   This is generally considered **Bayt (Verse) 28** in standard editions of the poem. It introduces the list but does not contain any names itself.\n\n2.  **Locate the Starting Verse of the List:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins immediately in the following verse. This is the first verse that contains the names.\n    *   **Arabic:** هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسٌ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ *** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Transliteration:** *Hum Ādamun Idrīsun Nūḥun Hūdun maʿ, Ṣāliḥin wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ.*\n    *   **Meaning:** They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with Salih, and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\n    *   This is **Bayt (Verse) 29**. This is the beginning of the range requested in the question.\n\n3.  **Trace the Verses Containing the List:** The poem continues to list the names in sequence over several verses:\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa'.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Mentions Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, and Yahya.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Verse of the List:** The list concludes in the next verse, which mentions the final two prophets in the list of twenty-five, 'Isa (Jesus) and our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to by the name 'Taha' and described as the 'Seal of the Prophets'.\n    *   **Arabic:** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنكَ الْغَيّْ *** عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلاةُ وَالسَّلامُ وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *   **Transliteration:** *ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ʿanka l-ghayy, ʿAlayhimuṣ-ṣalātu was-salāmu...*\n    *   **Meaning:** 'Isa and Taha, the Seal; leave deviance. Upon them be prayers and peace...\n    *   This is **Bayt (Verse) 34**. This verse concludes the list of names.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of verses (abyat) can sometimes differ by one or two lines between various prints and manuscripts. However, the sequence of verses presented here (28 through 34) is the standard and most widely recognized one.\n*   **The Introductory Verse (Bayt 28):** It is crucial to note that Bayt 28 commands the knowledge of the 25 prophets but does not list them. The actual listing begins in Bayt 29.\n*   **Prophet Muhammad's Name:** The final prophet, Muhammad ﷺ, is referred to as 'Taha' (طَهَ), which is one of his names derived from the opening of Surah Taha in the Qur'an. He is also identified by his title \"Khātim\" (خَاتِمٌ), the Seal.\n*   **Scope:** The range specifically covers the verses where the names are explicitly mentioned, as per the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt 29 to Bayt 34.\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 34>>>"
