    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including the careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the functional dependence of the **bare Green's function ($G_0$)** on the **single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)** within the framework of the **Feynman path integral formalism**.\n\nTo answer this, we need to:\n1.  Define what the bare Green's function is.\n2.  Set up its representation using a Feynman path integral.\n3.  Choose the appropriate action ($S_0$) that describes the non-interacting system.\n4.  Evaluate the path integral by working in a convenient basis.\n5.  Extract the final expression for $G_0$ and identify its explicit dependence on $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: The question specifically asks about the *bare* Green's function, $G_0$. This is the propagator for a particle in a *non-interacting* system, described by a quadratic action $S_0$. The full Green's function, $G$, would be for an interacting system and would include corrections (self-energy) to $G_0$.\n\n2.  **Path Integral Formalism**: For fermionic systems, the fields ($\\psi, \\psi^*$) in the path integral are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The overall structure of the final result is analogous for bosons (using complex fields), but the derivation details differ. We will proceed with the fermionic case, which is standard.\n\n3.  **Choice of Basis**: The path integral is intractable in an arbitrary basis. The key step is to transform to a basis where the action $S_0$ becomes diagonal. For a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and translational invariance, this is the momentum-frequency basis (or more generally, the energy eigenstate-frequency basis).\n\n4.  **Action Convention**: There are different sign conventions for the action in the path integral literature. A common convention (which we will adopt) relates the imaginary-time evolution operator to the Hamiltonian as $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$, which leads to an action of the form $S_0 = \\int d\\tau \\, \\psi^*(-\\partial_\\tau - \\hat{H}_0)\\psi$. This choice results in a final expression for $G_0$ that is common in textbooks.\n\n5.  **Definition of Energy Eigenvalues**: The term $\\epsilon_k$ typically represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue of the state $|k\\rangle$ *measured relative to the chemical potential* $\\mu$. That is, if the Hamiltonian eigenvalue is $E_k$, then $\\epsilon_k = E_k - \\mu$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe two-point time-ordered Green's function is defined as the expectation value of two field operators. In the path integral formalism, this becomes a functional average weighted by $e^{-S}$, where $S$ is the action. For the bare Green's function ($G_0$), we use the non-interacting action ($S_0$). In an operator-free formalism, $G_0$ is simply defined as the inverse of the quadratic operator that constitutes the action. Let's build it from the ground up. The non-interacting action, by definition, can be written abstractly as:\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int d\\tau' \\int dx' \\int d\\tau \\int dx \\, \\psi^*(x', \\tau') G_0^{-1}(x', \\tau'; x, \\tau) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nOur goal is to find $G_0$ by first finding the explicit form of the kernel $G_0^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions described by a single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$, the action in imaginary time $\\tau$ is:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nHere, $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., $-\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu$). For convenience, we will set $\\hbar=1$ and use a sign convention popular in modern field theory by starting from a Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L} = \\psi^*(-\\partial_\\tau - \\hat{H}_0)\\psi$, giving the action:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 3: Transforming to the Energy-Frequency Basis**\n\nTo evaluate this, we switch to a basis that diagonalizes the operator $(-\\partial_\\tau - \\hat{H}_0)$.\n*   **Hamiltonian part**: We use the eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$, denoted by $|k\\rangle$, such that $\\hat{H}_0|k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k|k\\rangle$. The label 'k' can represent momentum or any other complete set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Time part**: We perform a Fourier series expansion in imaginary time, introducing the fermionic Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$, where $\\beta=1/k_B T$.\n\nThe field $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ is expanded as:\n$\\psi(x, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V\\beta}} \\sum_{k,n} e^{ik \\cdot x - i\\omega_n \\tau} c_{k,n}$\nSubstituting this into the action and applying the operators:\n*   $\\hat{H}_0$ acting on $e^{ik \\cdot x}$ gives the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   $-\\partial_\\tau$ acting on $e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$ gives the eigenvalue $i\\omega_n$.\n\n**Step 4: The Diagonalized Action**\n\nAfter substituting the expansion into the action and performing the integrals over space and imaginary time, the orthonormality of the basis functions ($e^{ik \\cdot x}$ and $e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$) diagonalizes the action:\n$\\int d^d x \\, e^{-ik' \\cdot x} e^{ik \\cdot x} = V\\delta_{k,k'}$\n$\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, e^{i\\omega_{n'} \\tau} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} = \\beta\\delta_{n,n'}$\n\nThe action simplifies to a sum over independent modes $(k, n)$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} c_{k,n}^* (i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k) c_{k,n}$\n\n**Step 5: Deriving the Green's Function**\n\nComparing our result from Step 4 with the abstract definition from Step 1, we can identify the inverse bare Green's function in this basis. The action is of the form $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} c_{k,n}^* G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) c_{k,n}$.\nBy direct comparison, we have:\n$G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k$\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$ is simply the inverse of this expression:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\left( G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThis final expression explicitly shows the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   The dependence is algebraic: $G_0$ is the reciprocal of a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   Physically, this relationship is profound. The Green's function describes the propagation of a particle. Its poles (where its denominator is zero) correspond to the allowed energies of particle-like excitations. By performing an analytic continuation from imaginary frequency to real energy ($i\\omega_n \\to E + i\\delta$), the condition for the pole of $G_0$ is $E - \\epsilon_k = 0$, or $E = \\epsilon_k$.\n*   This means the poles of the bare Green's function are located precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting system. The energies $\\epsilon_k$ completely define the propagation characteristics of the free particles described by $G_0$.\n\nIn summary, the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ directly enter the denominator of the bare Green's function, defining its pole structure and thus its entire analytical form in the energy-momentum representation.\n\n<<<G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}>>>"
