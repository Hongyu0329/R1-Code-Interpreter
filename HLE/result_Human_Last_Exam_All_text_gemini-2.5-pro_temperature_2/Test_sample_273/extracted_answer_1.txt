No. It is not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction because any such configuration is unstable with respect to scaling of its size. The energy functional lacks a term that can confine the soliton and prevent it from either collapsing to a point or expanding indefinitely. This is a direct consequence of Derrick's theorem on the stability of localized solutions.
