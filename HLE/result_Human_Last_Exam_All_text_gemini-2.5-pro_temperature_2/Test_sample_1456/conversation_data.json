    "This problem asks for the largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Concepts\n\nFirst, we must be precise about the terminology used in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a topological space that is compact, connected, and metrizable. Examples include a closed interval `[a,b]`, a circle, a square, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum is nondegenerate if it contains more than one point. A single point is a \"degenerate\" continuum. The question explicitly requires the two continua, say `X` and `Y`, to be nondegenerate.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `Comp(X, p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that there exists a *proper subcontinuum* of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. (A subcontinuum is a subset that is itself a continuum; it is proper if it is not the entire space `X`).\n    *   An important property is that the set of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`. That is, every point belongs to exactly one composant.\n    *   The number of composants of a continuum can vary greatly. For example, a simple arc `[0,1]` has only one composant. An indecomposable continuum (one that cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua) has uncountably many composants.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. (The product of compact spaces is compact, and the product of connected spaces is connected).\n\n### Step 2: Relating Composants of the Product to Individual Composants\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the structure of the composants of the product space `Z = X × Y`. There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that describes this relationship.\n\n**Theorem:** The composants of the product space `X × Y` are precisely the Cartesian products of the composants of `X` and the composants of `Y`.\n\nIn other words, a set `C` is a composant of `X × Y` if and only if it can be written as `C = C_X × C_Y`, where `C_X` is a composant of `X` and `C_Y` is a composant of `Y`.\n\nThis implies a direct relationship between the *number* of composants. If we let `Num(S)` denote the number of composants of a space `S`, then this theorem leads to the following conclusion:\n\n`Num(X × Y) = Num(X) × Num(Y)`\n\n### Step 3: Maximizing the Number of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants of `X × Y`. Based on the formula from Step 2, this is equivalent to maximizing the product `Num(X) × Num(Y)`, where `X` and `Y` can be any nondegenerate continua.\n\nTo maximize this product, we should choose `X` and `Y` such that they individually have the largest possible number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Number of Composants for a Single Continuum\n\nNow we must ask: what is the maximum possible number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum `X`?\n\n1.  **Locally connected continua:** If a continuum `X` is locally connected (like an interval, circle, or square), it has only **one** composant, which is `X` itself.\n2.  **Indecomposable continua:** If a continuum `X` is indecomposable, it is known to have `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., `2^ℵ₀`) distinct composants. Each of these `c` composants is a dense, connected, first-category subset of `X`. Examples of nondegenerate indecomposable continua include the pseudo-arc and the Knaster \"buckethandle\" continuum.\n3.  **Other cases:** There exist continua with any finite number of composants (`n ≥ 2`) or a countably infinite number of composants (`ℵ₀`).\n\nThe largest of these possibilities is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, the maximum value for `Num(X)` for a nondegenerate continuum `X` is `c`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants for the product `X × Y`, we select `X` and `Y` to maximize `Num(X)` and `Num(Y)`.\n\n*   Choose `X` to be a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum (e.g., the pseudo-arc). Then `Num(X) = c`.\n*   Choose `Y` to be a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum (e.g., another pseudo-arc or the same one). Then `Num(Y) = c`.\n\nNow we calculate the number of composants of their product:\n\n`Num(X × Y) = Num(X) × Num(Y) = c × c`\n\nUsing cardinal arithmetic, we know that `c = 2^ℵ₀`. Therefore:\n\n`c × c = (2^ℵ₀) × (2^ℵ₀) = 2^(ℵ₀ + ℵ₀) = 2^ℵ₀ = c`\n\nThe product of the cardinality of the continuum with itself is still the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is achieved when both continua are chosen to be indecomposable. In this case, the number of composants is `c × c`, which is equal to `c`. This is an uncountable infinity, specifically the cardinality of the real numbers."
