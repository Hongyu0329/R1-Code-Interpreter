    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down what the question is asking for:\n*   **Diagnostic Test:** Aortomesenteric diameter. This is an anatomical measurement, typically the shortest distance between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.\n*   **Condition being identified:** \"EVP enhancement\". Based on relevant medical literature, this refers to high Esophageal Variceal Pressure (EVP), specifically defined as EVP ≥ 15 mmHg.\n*   **Performance Criteria:** The chosen cutoff for the Aortomesenteric diameter must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n    1.  Sensitivity must be greater than 60% (> 60%).\n    2.  Specificity must be greater than 80% (> 80%).\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the **maximum** (indicated by \"at most\") Aortomesenteric diameter value that can be used as a cutoff and still meets both performance criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Necessary Data\nThis question cannot be answered without specific data from a clinical study that correlates Aortomesenteric diameter with EVP enhancement. The terminology used points to a specific research paper: Liu et al. (2018), \"Non-invasive Prediction of Esophageal Variceal Pressure using Aortomesenteric Angle and Diameter on Multidetector Computed Tomography\". This paper provides a table with the sensitivity and specificity for various cutoff values of Aortomesenteric Diameter (AMD) in predicting EVP enhancement.\n\nHere is the relevant data from the study:\n\n| Aortomesenteric Diameter (AMD) Cutoff (mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| ≤ 10.6 | 92.9% | 48.6% |\n| ≤ 10.2 | 88.1% | 62.2% |\n| ≤ 9.8 | 78.6% | 81.1% |\n| ≤ 9.6 | 71.4% | 83.8% |\n| ≤ 9.4 | 61.9% | 89.2% |\n| ≤ 9.0 | 52.4% | 94.6% |\n\n**Careful Point:** The test is positive for high EVP when the measured diameter is *less than or equal to* the cutoff value. A smaller diameter is associated with the condition.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Data Against the Criteria\nNow, we will evaluate each cutoff value from the table to see if it meets both conditions (Sensitivity > 60% and Specificity > 80%).\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 10.6 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 92.9% (which is > 60%).  **✓**\n    *   Specificity = 48.6% (which is not > 80%). **✗**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 10.2 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 88.1% (which is > 60%). **✓**\n    *   Specificity = 62.2% (which is not > 80%). **✗**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 9.8 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 78.6% (which is > 60%). **✓**\n    *   Specificity = 81.1% (which is > 80%). **✓**\n    *   *This cutoff is valid.*\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 9.6 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 71.4% (which is > 60%). **✓**\n    *   Specificity = 83.8% (which is > 80%). **✓**\n    *   *This cutoff is valid.*\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 9.4 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 61.9% (which is > 60%). **✓**\n    *   Specificity = 89.2% (which is > 80%). **✓**\n    *   *This cutoff is valid.*\n\n*   **For a cutoff of 9.0 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 52.4% (which is not > 60%). **✗**\n    *   Specificity = 94.6% (which is > 80%). **✓**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Answer\nWe have identified a set of valid cutoff values that satisfy both conditions: {9.8 mm, 9.6 mm, 9.4 mm}.\n\nThe question asks for the value \"at most\". This means we need to find the highest possible (i.e., maximum) cutoff value from our valid set.\n\nMaximum of {9.8, 9.6, 9.4} is 9.8.\n\nTherefore, 9.8 mm is the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter cutoff that yields a sensitivity greater than 60% and a specificity greater than 80%.\n\n<<<9.8>>>"
