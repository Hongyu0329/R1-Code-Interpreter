    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"unique architectural feature\" that was present in the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which was removed by the city administration in the year 1950.\n\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, the square in front of the Pantheon.\n*   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon is mentioned to identify the square, but the feature is not part of the Pantheon itself.\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This implies a man-made structure that was a notable part of the square's landscape.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** The removal happened in or around 1950. This is the most critical piece of information for narrowing down the possibilities.\n*   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible for the removal.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n1.  **Distinguish the Piazza from the Pantheon:** The feature was in the square, not on the church building. This rules out features like the Pantheon's famous Bernini-designed bell towers (the \"donkey's ears\"), which were removed much earlier, in 1883.\n2.  **Focus on the 1950 Date:** Many changes have occurred in the piazza over the centuries. The Fontana del Pantheon was modified, and the historic fish market was cleared away in the late 19th century. The date 1950 is specific and excludes these earlier events.\n3.  **Interpret \"Architectural Feature\":** This term can be interpreted broadly to include significant urban infrastructure that defines the visual and functional character of a space, not just a building or a monument.\n4.  **Consider the Context:** What was happening in Rome around 1950? It was the post-war era, a time of modernization. Rome was also preparing for the 1950 Holy Year (Giubileo), which often spurred major urban cleaning and reorganization projects. The city was actively replacing its older tram network with buses, which were considered more modern and flexible.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n1.  Researching historical changes to the Piazza della Rotonda specifically around the year 1950 points away from buildings or monuments being removed.\n2.  Historical photographs of the piazza from the first half of the 20th century clearly show a significant feature that is no longer present today: a tram line.\n3.  The tram tracks ran directly through the piazza, passing very close to the Pantheon's portico and the central fountain. The system also included overhead electrical wires and support poles. This infrastructure was a dominant feature of the square for decades.\n4.  The Rome tram network underwent a major downsizing in the post-WWII period. Many lines in the historical center were decommissioned and replaced by bus routes to \"liberate\" monuments from the visually intrusive tracks and wires.\n5.  The tram line passing through the Piazza della Rotonda (part of the circular route) was one of those decommissioned around this period. The year 1950, being the Holy Year, was a key year for these \"beautification\" and modernization projects. The removal of the tram tracks and wires by the city fits all the criteria in the question: it was a significant feature, it was located in the piazza, it was removed by the city administration, and the removal happened right around 1950.\n\nThe unique architectural feature was, therefore, the tram line that crossed the square.\n\n<<<The tram line>>>"
