    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to identify the tallest historical (i.e., real) mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*, after excluding Mount Olympus, which is established as the tallest.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Baseline Mountain - Mount Olympus**\nThe *Iliad* constantly refers to Mount Olympus as the home of the gods. It is a real mountain range in northern Greece. Its highest peak, Mytikas, is approximately 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). This is the #1 mountain and serves as our point of exclusion.\n\n**Step 3: Scan the *Iliad* for other mentions of historical mountains**\nWe must find other real mountains that are explicitly named in the epic. Several key candidates emerge:\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is critically important to the plot. Zeus often sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War unfold. This Mount Ida is located in the Troad region of modern-day Turkey, overlooking the site of Troy.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the \"topmost peak of wooded Samothrace\" to get his own view of the battle, as he is siding with the Achaeans against Zeus's wishes. Samothrace is a real Greek island, and its prominent mountain is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the mighty ash spear of Achilles. In Book 16, it is described as the \"Pelian ash, which Cheiron had given to his dear father from the peak of Pelion.\"\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to trick Zeus. Her journey takes her \"from Athos she stepped down upon the billowing sea\" on her way to Lemnos. Mount Athos is a very real and prominent mountain on a peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Heights of the Candidate Mountains**\nTo answer the question, we need the modern, scientifically measured elevations of these historical mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** ~2,918 meters (for reference only).\n*   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida (modern name: Kaz Dağı):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** ~1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Step 5: Rank the Mountains and Find the Tallest After Olympus**\nNow we can create a ranked list of the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* by their height:\n\n1.  Mount Olympus (~2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Athos (~2,033 m)**\n3.  Mount Ida (~1,774 m)\n4.  Mount Pelion (~1,624 m)\n5.  Mount Samothrace (~1,611 m)\n\nAfter excluding Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain on the list is Mount Athos.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Historical vs. Mythological:** The question specifies \"historical,\" meaning we must consider mountains that exist in the real world, which all of the above do.\n2.  **Explicit Mention:** The mountain must be named in the text of the *Iliad*. All candidates listed have clear references in the epic.\n3.  **Correct Identification:** It's important to correctly identify the mountains. For example, the Mount Ida of the *Iliad* is the one near Troy, not the one on Crete (which is also famous in Greek mythology but not central to the *Iliad*'s geography).\n4.  **Elevation Data:** The conclusion depends on accurate elevation data for each mountain.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy listing the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and comparing their real-world elevations, we find that Mount Athos is the second tallest, exceeded only by Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
