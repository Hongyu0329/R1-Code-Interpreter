    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question into Key Clues**\nThe question provides two distinct and crucial pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n*   **Clue A (The Quote):** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue B (The Author Description):** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. Analyze Clue A: The Quote**\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work that is fierce, powerful, primal, and emotionally gripping. It implies high stakes, perhaps violence or intense passion, and a narrative that is relentlessly forceful.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This metaphor points to intellectual depth, intricate structure, and strategic complexity. A chess game has a limited set of pieces and rules, yet the number of possible variations is immense. This suggests the novel is masterfully constructed, with every element serving a purpose, creating a complex and layered experience within a concise framework.\n*   **Synthesis of the Quote:** Borges is describing a book that is both viscerally powerful and intellectually complex. It combines raw energy with precise, calculated artistry.\n\n**3. Analyze Clue B: The Author Description**\n*   **\"Continuator ... of Faulkner\":** This indicates that the author was deeply influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner is known for his complex narrative structures, non-linear timelines, multiple perspectives, stream-of-consciousness style, and themes rooted in the history and decay of the American South. Many authors of the Latin American Boom were heavily influenced by him.\n*   **\"...(and simplifier) of Faulkner\":** This is the most critical part of the clue. It narrows the field significantly. The author in question doesn't just imitate Faulkner's complexity but rather distills it. They take Faulkner's thematic depth and structural innovation and present them in a more concentrated, accessible, or poetically sparse form. Instead of Faulkner's long, winding sentences, this author's prose might be more direct and concise, even while building a similarly fragmented and profound world.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Candidate**\n*   We are looking for a major Latin American novel praised by Borges. The author must have a clear connection to Faulkner but be recognized for a sparer style.\n*   Several Latin American authors were influenced by Faulkner, but **Juan Rulfo** is the one who most perfectly fits the description of a \"simplifier.\" His masterpiece, *Pedro Páramo*, is famously short and written in a spare, laconic, and haunting style.\n*   Despite its brevity, *Pedro Páramo* has a highly complex and fragmented structure, shifting between time periods, perspectives, and the worlds of the living and the dead. This perfectly matches the idea of the \"variety that a chess duel can achieve\" — immense complexity within a limited space.\n*   The story's content, dealing with a ghost town, brutal history, and inescapable fate, certainly possesses the \"intensity of a tiger.\"\n*   Checking the source, it is confirmed that Borges wrote these exact words in his prologue to a 1983 edition of Juan Rulfo's novel. He celebrated the book as a masterpiece that managed to be profound and structurally innovative without being impenetrable like some of its Modernist predecessors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe clues point directly to a specific work by a specific author, praised in a specific text by Borges.\n\n*   **Novel:** *Pedro Páramo*\n*   **Author:** Juan Rulfo\n*   **Context:** Borges's prologue to the novel.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
