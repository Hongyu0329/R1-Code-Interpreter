    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the Japanese character 謄.\n\n1.  **Analyze the character's structure:** The character 謄 is composed of two parts arranged side-by-side, in a left-right configuration.\n    *   The left part is: 月\n    *   The right part is: 滕\n\n2.  **Identify the radical (部首, bushu):** For characters with a left-right structure like this, the left component is almost always the radical. Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 月.\n\n3.  **Determine the name of the radical:** The radical 月 has different names depending on its position and the concept it represents.\n    *   When the radical 月 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as a `hen` (へん).\n    *   There are two common names for the 月 radical in this position:\n        *   **Tsukihen (つきへん):** Used when the character is related to the moon. Examples include 朗 (bright) and 期 (period).\n        *   **Nikuzuki (にくづき):** Used when the character is related to the body, flesh, or organs. This form is a graphical corruption of the radical 肉 (niku, flesh). Examples include 腹 (stomach) and 腕 (arm).\n    *   Sometimes, this radical component can also originate from 舟 (fune, boat), as is the case here in the character 謄 (via its phonetic component).\n    *   **Careful Point:** For dictionary classification purposes, even when the etymology isn't directly \"flesh\", the radical 月 on the left side is commonly referred to as `nikuzuki` unless it is explicitly related to the moon. This is because the \"flesh\" meaning is far more common for this radical shape.\n\n4.  **Select the correct name for 謄:** The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\". This has no direct relationship with the \"moon\". Following standard Japanese dictionary conventions, the radical 月 in this character is classified as `nikuzuki`.\n\n5.  **Provide the Hepburn transcription:** The Japanese name for the radical is にくづき. The Hepburn romanization of this is \"Nikuzuki\".\n\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
