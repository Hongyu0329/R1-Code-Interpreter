    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Target Molecule:** A 100-amino acid peptide.\n    *   **Key Feature 1 (Length):** At 100 residues, the peptide is relatively long. This is an important consideration for the synthesis method.\n    *   **Key Feature 2 (Composition):** It contains a specific unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine (AzF), at a defined position ('X').\n    *   **Objective:** Identify the *most helpful* technique to synthesize this specific molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n\n    *   **A) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):**\n        *   **How it works:** Amino acids are added sequentially to a peptide chain growing on a solid resin support.\n        *   **Pros for this problem:** SPPS is the standard method for incorporating a wide variety of unnatural amino acids. A properly protected derivative of azido phenylalanine can be readily used in the synthesis cycle just like any natural amino acid.\n        *   **Cons for this problem:** The primary drawback is the peptide length. The efficiency of each coupling step is not 100%. For a 100-aa peptide, this involves approximately 99 coupling and 99 deprotection steps. Even with a very high efficiency of 99% per step, the cumulative yield of the final full-length product becomes extremely low (e.g., 0.99^199 â‰ˆ 13.5%). Furthermore, side reactions, incomplete couplings, and aggregation of the long peptide chain on the resin make purification of the target peptide from a complex mixture of shorter, failed sequences extremely difficult.\n        *   **Conclusion:** SPPS alone is not a practical or helpful method for a peptide of this length.\n\n    *   **B) Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*):**\n        *   **How it works:** The gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a plasmid, which is then expressed by a host organism like *E. coli*. The cell's natural machinery (ribosomes) synthesizes the peptide.\n        *   **Pros for this problem:** This method is excellent for producing long polypeptides (>50 aa) cost-effectively and at high yields.\n        *   **Cons for this problem:** The cell's translational machinery can only use the 20 standard, proteinogenic amino acids for which there are corresponding codons and tRNA molecules. It cannot recognize or incorporate azido phenylalanine.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used to make this peptide.\n\n    *   **C) Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):**\n        *   **How it works:** NCL is a \"semi-synthetic\" technique that chemically joins two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments to form a larger peptide. Typically, one fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine.\n        *   **Application to this problem:** This is a viable strategy. The 100-aa peptide could be split into two or more smaller fragments. For instance, it could be divided into two ~50-aa fragments. The fragment containing the UAA (AzF) would be synthesized using SPPS (a 50-aa length is more manageable for SPPS). The other fragment could be made either by SPPS or, more efficiently, by recombinant expression. The two purified fragments would then be ligated together.\n        *   **Careful Points:** This method requires careful planning of the fragmentation site, as it typically relies on the presence of a Cysteine residue. While a powerful technique, it is multi-step (synthesis of fragments, purification of fragments, ligation reaction, final purification), making it complex.\n\n    *   **D) Recombinant Protein Expression using an Expanded Genetic Code (Genetic Code Expansion):**\n        *   **How it works:** This is an advanced form of recombinant expression that overcomes the limitation of the standard 20 amino acids. It involves introducing an \"orthogonal\" aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair into the expression host (*E. coli*). This engineered synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and attaches it to its partner tRNA. This tRNA is engineered to recognize a specific, reassigned codon (usually the amber stop codon, TAG).\n        *   **Application to this problem:** This method is perfectly suited for the task. A gene for the 100-aa peptide is designed, but the codon at the position for 'X' is changed to TAG. This gene is expressed in the engineered *E. coli* strain in the presence of azido phenylalanine in the growth medium. When the ribosome encounters the TAG codon, the engineered tRNA delivers AzF, incorporating it into the growing peptide chain.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is arguably the *most helpful* technique. It combines the main advantage of recombinant expression (efficient synthesis of long peptides) with the ability to site-specifically incorporate the desired UAA. The entire 100-aa peptide is produced in a single *in vivo* synthesis process. Azido phenylalanine is one of the most well-established UAAs used in this technique.\n\n### Summary and Final Choice\n\n*   **SPPS:** Fails due to length.\n*   **Standard Recombinant:** Fails due to the unnatural amino acid.\n*   **NCL:** A good, but complex and multi-step, solution.\n*   **Recombinant with Expanded Genetic Code:** An elegant, single-process solution that directly addresses both the length and UAA challenges. It is the most powerful and direct method for this specific problem.\n\nTherefore, recombinant protein expression using an expanded genetic code is the most helpful technique.\n\n<<<Recombinant protein expression using an expanded genetic code.>>>"
