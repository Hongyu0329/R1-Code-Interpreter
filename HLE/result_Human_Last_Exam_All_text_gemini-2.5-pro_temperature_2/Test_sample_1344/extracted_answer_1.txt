The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst composed of:
1.  **Metal:** Hafnium (Hf), chosen for its superior thermal stability, which is essential for surviving the high-temperature hydrogenolysis conditions.
2.  **Ligand:** A robust, ansa-bridged Constrained Geometry Catalyst (CGC) type ligand (e.g., a silicon-bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido framework), selected for its ability to create a thermally stable, single active site with a highly open coordination sphere that is accessible to both olefin monomers and bulky polymer chains.
3.  **Support:** Sulfated Zirconia (SZ), chosen to act as a solid superacid support that both heterogenizes the catalyst and functions as a built-in activator to generate the active cationic metal center, eliminating the need for soluble co-catalysts.
