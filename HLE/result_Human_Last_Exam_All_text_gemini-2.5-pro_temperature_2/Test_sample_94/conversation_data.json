    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question to identify key clues.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific physicist. The clues provided are:\n1.  He is a physicist.\n2.  He is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This is a crucial detail, suggesting his main contribution lies there.\n3.  He discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n4.  The discovery was initiated by an accidental observation made by a \"custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This unique anecdote is the strongest clue.\n\n**Step 2: Focus on the most unique clue - the anecdote.**\nThe story of a custodial worker accidentally discovering an optical illusion is highly specific. This event is historically associated with Stanford University. A janitor was cleaning a large concave searchlight mirror and was startled to see a strange, three-dimensional, floating image of his own face. He reported this curiosity to a physics professor at the university.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the physicist involved in the anecdote.**\nThe professor to whom the custodian reported this phenomenon was **Paul Kirkpatrick**. He and his graduate student, A.V. Baez (father of singers Joan Baez and Mimi Fari√±a), investigated the effect. They found that the single concave mirror produced a pseudoscopic (depth-inverted) real image. Their further work led to the development of an apparatus using two crossed concave mirrors that produces a well-known illusion of a solid object floating in open space, often sold as a physics toy called \"Mirage\" or a \"3D Hologram Generator.\"\n\n**Step 4: Verify the \"microscopy\" connection.**\nThe question states the physicist is \"better known\" for his work in microscopy. We need to check if Paul Kirkpatrick's primary fame aligns with this. Indeed, Paul Kirkpatrick's most significant contribution to physics is the invention of the **Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system**. This system uses two curved mirrors at a grazing incidence angle to focus X-rays. The K-B system became a fundamental technology in the field of **X-ray microscopy**, as well as in X-ray telescopes (like NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory) and other applications requiring focused X-ray beams. Therefore, he is definitively famous for his work that is foundational to the microscopy field.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings.**\nPaul Kirkpatrick is the physicist who investigated the real image optical effect first seen by a janitor cleaning a concave mirror at Stanford. His most acclaimed work, the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, is a cornerstone of X-ray microscopy. All parts of the question align perfectly with the career and discoveries of Paul Kirkpatrick.\n\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
