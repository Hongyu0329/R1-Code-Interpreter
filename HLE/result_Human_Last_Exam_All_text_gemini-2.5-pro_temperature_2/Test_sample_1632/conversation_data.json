    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers.\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of points, starting from an origin (0,0), where each consecutive point is a single step away (up, down, left, or right).\n*   **n-step walk:** A walk consisting of n moves.\n*   **Self-avoiding:** The walk never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The function representing the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks. Our goal is to find a(10).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis for Small `n`\nWe can determine the first few values of a(n) by direct enumeration.\n\n*   **For n = 1:**\n    *   From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1).\n    *   All are valid 1-step self-avoiding walks.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **For n = 2:**\n    *   We extend each of the 4 walks from n=1. For the second step, the only forbidden move is the one that immediately reverses the first step (e.g., if the first move was right, the second cannot be left).\n    *   This leaves 3 valid choices for the second step for each of the 4 initial walks.\n    *   **a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12**\n\n*   **For n = 3:**\n    *   We extend the 12 walks from n=2. Again, the only immediate restriction is not reversing the previous step, leaving 3 choices. We must check if any of these moves could land on a previously visited point (i.e., the origin).\n    *   A 3-step walk cannot return to the origin. This is due to a parity constraint: to return to (0,0), the number of 'up' moves must equal 'down', and 'left' must equal 'right'. This requires an even number of total steps. Since n=3 is odd, it's impossible to return to the origin.\n    *   Therefore, all 3 non-reversing moves are valid for each of the 12 paths.\n    *   **a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36**\n\n*   **For n = 4:**\n    *   Starting from the 36 walks of length 3, we consider the next step. Naively, this would be `36 * 3 = 108` walks.\n    *   **Careful Point:** For n=4, it is now possible for a walk to intersect itself by returning to the origin. This happens if a 3-step walk ends at a point adjacent to the origin, e.g., (0,1), (1,0), etc.\n    *   We must count how many of the 36 paths of length 3 end at a neighbor of the origin. Let's find the number of paths from (0,0) to (1,0) in 3 steps:\n        1.  (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)\n        2.  (0,0) -> (0,-1) -> (1,-1) -> (1,0)\n        There are 2 such paths.\n    *   By symmetry, there are 2 paths to each of the 4 neighbors of the origin. This gives a total of `4 * 2 = 8` paths that end adjacent to the origin.\n    *   For these 8 paths, one of the 3 possible non-reversing moves is forbidden (the one that returns to the origin). So these 8 paths only generate `8 * 2 = 16` valid 4-step walks.\n    *   The other `36 - 8 = 28` paths do not end adjacent to the origin, so all 3 of their non-reversing continuations are valid. They generate `28 * 3 = 84` valid 4-step walks.\n    *   **a(4) = (8 * 2) + (28 * 3) = 16 + 84 = 100**\n\n### Step 3: Recognizing the Complexity for Larger `n`\nAs `n` increases, this manual calculation becomes extremely difficult. For n=5, a walk can self-intersect by hitting the first point of the walk (p5=p1). For n=6, it could form a 2x2 square (p6=p2) or other shapes. The number of intersection cases to consider grows rapidly.\n\nThis is a famous and computationally hard problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). Values for larger `n` have been determined through extensive computer enumeration.\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Final Answer\nSince calculating a(10) from first principles is not feasible by hand, we refer to the known, tabulated sequence for self-avoiding walks on a square lattice. This is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nThe value for a(10) is determined computationally to be 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
