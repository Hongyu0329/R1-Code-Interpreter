    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron and its Orientation**\n*   An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   A key property of the icosahedron is that it has a center of symmetry (also known as point symmetry or an inversion center). This means that for any point on the icosahedron, the point directly opposite it through the center is also on the icosahedron.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is resting horizontally on the ground.\n*   Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, if one face is horizontal at the bottom, its opposite face will be perfectly parallel and horizontal at the top. The axis passing through the centers of these two opposite faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Level of the Water Surface**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water,\" which means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   Due to the center of symmetry described in Step 1, the horizontal plane that passes exactly through the center of the icosahedron will cut its volume into two equal halves.\n*   Therefore, when the tank is half-filled, the surface of the water must coincide with this central horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cross-Section at the Water Level**\n*   The problem now reduces to finding the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane.\n*   To do this, we can analyze the positions of the 12 vertices relative to this plane. We can group the vertices by their vertical height.\n    *   There are 3 vertices forming the top horizontal face.\n    *   There are 3 vertices forming the bottom horizontal face.\n    *   This leaves 6 vertices remaining. These 6 vertices form a \"belt\" around the equator of the icosahedron. They are not all at the same height. Instead, they form two layers: 3 vertices are in a horizontal plane just above the central plane, and the other 3 are in a horizontal plane just below the central plane.\n*   Crucially, no vertices of the icosahedron lie exactly on the central horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   Since no vertices lie on the water's surface plane, the boundary of the water's surface must be formed by the lines where the icosahedron's edges pass through the plane.\n*   An edge can only cross the central plane if it connects a vertex above the plane to a vertex below the plane.\n*   The edges that cross the central plane are those connecting the 3 vertices in the layer just above the center to the 3 vertices in the layer just below the center.\n*   It can be shown through a more detailed geometric analysis (or by using the symmetries) that there are exactly 6 such edges.\n*   These 6 edges intersect the central plane at 6 points, which become the vertices of the shape of the water surface. Therefore, the shape is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Regularity of the Hexagon**\n*   As established in Step 1, the icosahedron has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis perpendicular to the water surface. Any shape on the water surface must also have this 3-fold symmetry.\n*   Furthermore, the center of symmetry of the icosahedron lies at the center of the water surface. This means the shape must also have point symmetry.\n*   A hexagon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and point symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. All its sides will be of equal length, and all its internal angles will be equal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the water surface forms a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The central symmetry of the icosahedron is the most critical concept.\n*   Understanding that \"half-filled\" precisely defines the water level to be the central plane is the key step.\n*   The final shape is determined by the cross-section, which can be deduced by considering the arrangement of vertices and edges relative to this plane.\n*   Combining the rotational symmetry and the central symmetry is a powerful way to conclude that the resulting hexagon must be regular without performing complex coordinate calculations.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
