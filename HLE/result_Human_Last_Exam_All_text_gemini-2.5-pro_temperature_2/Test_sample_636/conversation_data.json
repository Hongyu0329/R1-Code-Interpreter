    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` are at specific locations. This is a classic control theory problem known as pole placement or pole assignment.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\n*   System matrices are given as:\n    `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The control law is `u = Fx`, leading to a closed-loop system matrix:\n    `A_cl = A + BF`\n*   The desired eigenvalues (poles) for the closed-loop system are:\n    `λ = -1 ± j`, which are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a matrix has its roots at the eigenvalues. For the desired eigenvalues, the characteristic polynomial `p_des(s)` is:\n`p_des(s) = (s - λ₁)(s - λ₂)`\n`p_des(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_des(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²`:\n`p_des(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\nSince `j² = -1`:\n`p_des(s) = (s + 1)² + 1 = s² + 2s + 1 + 1`\n`p_des(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system `A_cl`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix `F` connects the state `x` (2x1) to the input `u` (2x1). Therefore, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nNow, compute `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[1*f₁ + 2*f₃, 1*f₂ + 2*f₄], [1*f₁, 1*f₂]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**4. Find the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, denoted `p_act(s)`, is found by calculating `det(sI - A_cl)`.\n`sI - A_cl = [[s, 0], [0, s]] - [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n`sI - A_cl = [[s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃,  -(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)], [-(1 + f₁), s - f₂]]`\n\nNow, calculate the determinant:\n`p_act(s) = (s + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃)(s - f₂) - (-(1 + f₂ + 2f₄))(-(1 + f₁))`\n`p_act(s) = s² - f₂s + s - f₂ - f₁s + f₁f₂ - 2f₃s + 2f₃f₂ - (1 + f₁)(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)`\nExpanding and collecting terms by powers of `s`:\n`p_act(s) = s² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)s + (-f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄ + f₁ + f₁f₂ + 2f₁f₄)`\n`p_act(s) = s² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)s + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n\n**5. Equate the Polynomials and Solve for `F`**\n\nWe match the coefficients of `p_act(s)` with `p_des(s) = s² + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of `s¹`:**\n    `1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ = 2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Coefficient of `s⁰` (constant term):**\n    `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ - 2f₃f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄ = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can find a specific solution by making a simplifying choice. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`. This simplifies the equations significantly:\n\n*   **Equation 1 becomes:**\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2(0) = -1`\n    `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n\n*   **Equation 2 becomes:**\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ - 2(0)f₂ + 2(0) + 2f₁(0) = -3`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n1) `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2) `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstituting `f₂ = -2` back into equation (1):\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`f₁ = 1`, `f₂ = -2`, `f₃ = 0`, `f₄ = 0`.\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **System Formulation:** The problem specifies the closed-loop dynamics as `A + BF`. In many textbooks, the standard formulation is `A - BK` with feedback `u = -Kx`. Always follow the notation given in the problem statement.\n2.  **Matrix Dimensions and Multiplication:** Ensure that matrix dimensions are compatible and that the order of multiplication is correct (`BF` is not the same as `FB`).\n3.  **Algebraic Errors:** The expansion of the determinant to find the characteristic polynomial is prone to sign errors. It should be performed carefully and double-checked.\n4.  **Underdetermined System:** For multi-input systems, pole placement often results in an underdetermined system of equations for the feedback gains. This implies that there are degrees of freedom and multiple (in fact, infinite) solutions exist. The approach of setting some gains to zero is a valid way to find one such solution. Any arbitrary choice that satisfies the equations is a correct answer.\n5.  **Verification:** Although not strictly required, it's a good practice to verify the result. If we plug `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]` back in, we get `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`. The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is `det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2`, which matches our desired polynomial.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nFollowing the steps above, by defining the desired characteristic polynomial `s² + 2s + 2` and equating its coefficients with those of the symbolic characteristic polynomial of `A+BF`, we derive a system of equations for the elements of `F`. By making a simplifying assumption (`f₃=0, f₄=0`) to resolve the underdetermined nature of the system, we solve for the remaining elements to find a valid feedback gain matrix.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
