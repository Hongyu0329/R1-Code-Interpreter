    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the **most likely mechanism** that explains two key phenomena concerning gene duplicates:\n    *   **Retention:** How are both copies of a duplicated gene kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding being lost? The most common fate of a duplicate gene is becoming a non-functional pseudogene and eventually disappearing, so any mechanism for retention must counteract this tendency.\n    *   **Divergence:** How do the two gene copies evolve to become different from each other in sequence and/or function?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where a DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, essentially \"copy-pasting\" from one gene to the other. This process makes gene copies *more similar* to each other, acting as a force of homogenization. Therefore, it works *against* divergence and does not explain how two distinct functional copies are maintained.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a duplicated gene accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. It becomes a \"pseudogene.\" This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene and represents its functional *loss*, not its *retention* as a useful part of the genome. While the sequence of a pseudogene does diverge, the mechanism doesn't explain the retention of two *functional* genes.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure and can accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may confer a completely new, beneficial function.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, once the new function is established and is beneficial, natural selection will act to retain this second copy.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the gene copy must diverge in sequence to acquire the new function.\n        *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism depends on the rare occurrence of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation. In the time it takes for this to happen, the duplicate gene is redundant and at high risk of being disabled by more common, loss-of-function mutations (i.e., pseudogenization).\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions (pleiotropy) or was expressed in multiple tissues or developmental stages. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable *different* subfunctions. For example, if the original gene was active in both liver and muscle, one duplicate might lose the liver-specific function while the other loses the muscle-specific function.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, now both gene copies are required to perform the original set of functions. Neither can be lost without a fitness cost. This provides a strong selective pressure for retaining both copies.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the accumulation of different mutations in regulatory or coding regions causes the two copies to diverge.\n        *   **Likelihood:** This mechanism relies on common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. It provides a passive and relatively fast route to making both gene copies essential, thereby \"rescuing\" them from the fate of pseudogenization. Because it doesn't require a rare, beneficial mutation to occur, it is often considered a more probable initial mechanism for retaining duplicate genes.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes a macroevolutionary pattern where a lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels such diversification, adaptive radiation is not a *molecular mechanism* for retaining or diverging individual genes. It is a process at the level of species and populations, not genes.\n\n3.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n\n    Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the **most likely** mechanism.\n\n    *   Subfunctionalization provides a more immediate and probable path to retention because it relies on common loss-of-function mutations to partition existing functions, quickly making both copies indispensable.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rare gain-of-function mutation to occur before the gene is silenced, making it a higher hurdle to overcome initially.\n\n    Therefore, subfunctionalization is considered a more likely mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes, which then allows for their subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
