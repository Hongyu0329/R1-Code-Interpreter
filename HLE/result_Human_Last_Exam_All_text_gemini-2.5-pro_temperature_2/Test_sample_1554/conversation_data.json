    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  They belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  They analyzed or \"decomposed\" the notion of a **\"hallmark\"** (or a related concept like a sign, mark, or indicator).\n3.  Their decomposition specifically involved the categories of **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Key Terms\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland between the World Wars. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The search must be limited to this group.\n*   **Hallmark/Sign:** This concept relates to semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. A \"hallmark\" is something that indicates the presence or nature of something else. In the philosophical context of this school, the Polish word *znak* (sign or mark) is the most likely term being translated as \"hallmark.\"\n*   **Symptoms and Signals:** This is the specific distinction made by the philosopher.\n    *   A **symptom** (in Polish, *oznaka*) is a natural sign. There is a causal or natural correlation between the sign and what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n    *   A **signal** (in Polish, *sygnał*) is a conventional sign. The relationship between the sign and its meaning is established by rule, agreement, or intention. For example, a green traffic light is a signal to proceed.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the Concepts to a Philosopher from the School\nWe need to examine the work of the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School, particularly their contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language/semiotics.\n\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** Focused on the foundations of philosophy, intentionality, and the theory of objects. While influential, this specific semiotic distinction is not his most famous contribution.\n*   **Jan Łukasiewicz & Alfred Tarski:** Primarily known for their groundbreaking work in formal logic.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** Known for his work on reism (or concretism) and praxiology (the theory of efficient action).\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** This philosopher is a prime candidate. He made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. He developed a theory of meaning and was deeply interested in the analysis of language and signs.\n\n### Step 4: Final Identification\nA review of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's work confirms that he is the philosopher who made this precise distinction. In his analyses of semiotics and the foundations of language, he categorized signs (*znaki*) into two main types:\n1.  **Symptoms (*oznaki*):** Natural signs linked by a causal relationship to the object they indicate.\n2.  **Signals (*sygnały*):** Conventional signs whose meaning derives from an established rule or convention, central to human language and communication.\n\nThis distinction was a fundamental part of his theory of meaning and his efforts to create a clear, analytical philosophical language. The term \"hallmark\" in the question is a functional synonym for the general concept of a \"sign\" (*znak*) that Ajdukiewicz analyzed.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
