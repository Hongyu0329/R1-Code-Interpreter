    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Curve and the Field**\n\n*   **Curve:** $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is $d=5$. The genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n*   **Field:** We are working over a local field $K$ with a valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$. This is the standard 2-adic valuation on $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. So we consider the curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**2. Determine the Type of Reduction using Newton Polygons**\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is determined by the clustering of the branch points of the cover $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. The branch points are the roots of $f(x)$ and possibly the point at infinity. The clustering is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the differences between branch points.\n\nLet's find the valuations of the roots of $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1 = 0$. We use the Newton polygon for $f(x)$ with respect to the valuation $v_2$. The vertices of the polygon are given by $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n*   $a_5 = 2 \\implies v_2(a_5)=1$\n*   $a_3 = 2 \\implies v_2(a_3)=1$\n*   $a_0 = 1 \\implies v_2(a_0)=0$\n*   Other coefficients are 0 ($v_2(0)=\\infty$).\n\nThe points to plot are $(5,1)$, $(3,1)$, and $(0,0)$. The lower convex hull of these points forms the Newton polygon.\n*   A segment connects $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-0}{3-0} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The horizontal length of this segment is 3. This indicates that there are 3 roots with 2-adic valuation $v_2(\\alpha) = 1/3$.\n*   A segment connects $(3,1)$ and $(5,1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-1}{5-3} = 0$. The horizontal length of this segment is 2. This indicates that there are 2 roots with 2-adic valuation $v_2(\\beta) = 0$.\n\nThese fractional valuations imply that the roots lie in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The denominator of the valuation slope (3) indicates that we need an extension with ramification index $e$ being a multiple of 3.\n\n**3. Analyze the Branch Points and their Clustering**\n\nThe map from the curve $C$ to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$ is ramified at the 5 roots of $f(x)$ and at $x=\\infty$. We need to determine how these 6 branch points cluster.\nTo analyze the point at infinity, we change coordinates. Let $x = 1/u$ and $z = w/u^3$. The equation becomes:\n$(w/u^3)^2 = 2/u^5 + 2/u^3 + 1$\n$w^2/u^6 = (2 + 2u^2 + u^5)/u^5$\n$w^2 = u(2 + 2u^2 + u^5) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u$.\nThe point $x=\\infty$ corresponds to $u=0$.\nThe branch points in the $u$-plane are the roots of $g(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u = 0$. Let's analyze the valuations of these roots.\n$g(u)=0$ has the root $u_0=0$. The other roots are the roots of $u^5 + 2u^2 + 2 = 0$.\nThe Newton polygon for $u^5 + 2u^2 + 2 = 0$ has vertices at $(5, v(1)=0)$, $(2, v(2)=1)$, and $(0, v(2)=1)$.\n*   A segment connects $(0,1)$ and $(2,1)$ with slope 0 (length 2). This corresponds to 2 roots with valuation 0.\n*   A segment connects $(2,1)$ and $(5,0)$ with slope $\\frac{0-1}{5-2} = -1/3$ (length 3). This corresponds to 3 roots with valuation $1/3$.\n\nSo the 6 branch points in the $u$-plane cluster into two groups based on their valuation:\n1.  **Cluster 1 ($B_1$):** Points with non-zero valuation. This includes the 3 roots with valuation $1/3$ and the root $u=0$ (which has valuation $\\infty$). So $|B_1| = 4$.\n2.  **Cluster 2 ($B_2$):** Points with valuation 0. This includes the 2 roots with valuation 0. So $|B_2| = 2$.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Stable Reduction**\n\nThe partition of branch points $W = B_1 \\cup B_2$ with $|B_1|=4$ and $|B_2|=2$ determines the structure of the stable reduction. The special fiber of the stable model will consist of two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$, meeting at a single point (a node).\nThe genus $g_i$ of each component is given by the formula $g_i = (|B_i|-2)/2 + 1/2 \\cdot(\\text{number of odd cycles in a graph related to the cluster})$. A simpler formula is $g_i = \\lfloor(|B_i|-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n*   For $C_1$, corresponding to $B_1$, the genus is $g_1 = \\lfloor(|B_1|-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$. So $C_1$ is an elliptic curve.\n*   For $C_2$, corresponding to $B_2$, the genus is $g_2 = \\lfloor(|B_2|-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$. So $C_2$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve $C$ has a special fiber consisting of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting transversely at one point, which is a node (double point).\n\n**5. Calculate the Conductor Exponent**\n\nFor a curve with semi-stable reduction, the exponent of its conductor, $f$, can be calculated from the geometry of its stable model's special fiber. A standard formula for the conductor exponent of the Jacobian of the curve is $f_{\\mathcal{J}} = g - \\text{rank}(H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}))$, where $\\Gamma$ is the dual graph of the special fiber.\nHere, the dual graph consists of two vertices (for $C_1$ and $C_2$) and one edge (for the node connecting them). This graph has no cycles, so its first Betti number $\\text{rank}(H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}))$ is 0. The genus of the original curve is $g=2$.\nHowever, the reduction of the Jacobian is an extension of a torus by an abelian variety of good reduction. The rank of the torus is $b_1(\\Gamma)$, but we need to take into account that one of the components is an elliptic curve. The rank of the toric part of the reduced Jacobian is the number of independent cycles in the graph plus the sum of the genera of the components, minus the genus of the total special fiber. A more direct approach is via the formula for the conductor of the curve itself.\nThe Deligne-Saito formula for the conductor exponent for a semistable curve is $f_v = \\delta_v$. For a special fiber composed of smooth components $C_i$ with genera $g_i$ meeting transversely at nodes, $\\delta_v$ is given by\n$\\delta_v = 2g - 2 - \\sum_{i} (2g_i - 2 + n_i)$, where $n_i$ is the number of nodes on component $C_i$.\n\n*   For $C_1=E$, $g_1=1$ and it has one node, so $n_1=1$. Contribution is $2(1)-2+1 = 1$.\n*   For $C_2=\\mathbb{P}^1$, $g_2=0$ and it has one node, so $n_2=1$. Contribution is $2(0)-2+1 = -1$.\nThe sum is $\\sum(2g_i-2+n_i) = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\nThe formula is actually $\\delta_v = (\\text{# of components}) - (\\text{# of conn. components}) + \\sum (2g_i - 2 + n_i)$\nThe conductor of the curve $C$ is given by $f = \\sum_{i=1}^k(2g_i - 2 + n_i) - (2g-2)$. $f = 0 - (2(2)-2) = -2$. No, this must be positive.\nLet's use a simpler formula for $\\delta_v = 2g_{geom}(\\mathcal{X}_s) - 2g + c$, where $g_{geom}$ is arithmetic genus and $c$ is the number of components.\nLet's use the reliable formula: $\\delta = (g - rk H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})) + (g - \\sum g_i)$.\nThe dual graph has $b_1 = 0$. So $\\delta = (2-0) + (2-(1+0))=2+1=3$?\nLet's try one more formula which is commonly cited for the conductor exponent $f = 2g_{geom}(X_s) - 2g + 2c - s$, where $s$ is the number of connected components of the special fiber, and $c$ is the number of irreducible components.\nThe geometric genus $p_g(X_s) = \\sum(g_i-1) + \\text{rank} H_1(\\Gamma) + s$. $p_g(X_s) = (1-1)+(0-1)+0+1=0$. No.\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber $p_a(X_s)=\\sum g_i + \\text{rank}H_1 - s + 1 = 1+0-1+1=1$. This is wrong, it should be $g=2$. $p_a = \\sum g_i + N-c+1 = 1+0+1-2+1=1$.\n\nThe Artinian part of the conductor for the Jacobian variety, $\\delta_J$, is given by $2g - 2g_a(X_s)$. The conductor of the curve is $2\\delta_J$.\nThe arithmetic genus is $p_a(X_s) = \\sum p_a(C_i) + \\sum_{P \\in Sing} (\\text{mult}_P-1)$.\n$p_a(X_s) = g_1+g_2+(\\text{number of nodes}) = 1+0+1 = 2$.\nSo $\\delta_J = 2g - 2p_a(X_s) = 2(2)-2(2) = 0$. That would mean good reduction of the Jacobian, which is not true.\n\nLet's trust the calculation for the Swan conductor: $\\delta_v = 2g - (g_{ss} + t)$, where $g_{ss}=\\sum g_i$ is the semistable part of the genus, and $t$ is the toric rank. Here $g_{ss}=1, t=1$, giving $\\delta_v = 2(2) - (1+1) = 2$.\nThis value represents the sum of thicknesses of all nodes. Since we have only one node, its thickness must be 2.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve meeting at a single double point. The conductor exponent for this reduction is 2. For a semi-stable model, the conductor exponent is the sum of the thicknesses of the nodes in the special fiber. Since there is only one node, its thickness must be equal to the conductor exponent.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the double point is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
