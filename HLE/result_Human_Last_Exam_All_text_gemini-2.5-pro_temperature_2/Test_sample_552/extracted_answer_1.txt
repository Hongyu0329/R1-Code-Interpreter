In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, "On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat," Albert Einstein did not cite any other scientist's work, including any lectures. The paper is famous for its lack of references, as Einstein derived his theory from first principles.
