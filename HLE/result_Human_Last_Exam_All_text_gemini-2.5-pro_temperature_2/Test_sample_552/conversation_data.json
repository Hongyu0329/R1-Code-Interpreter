    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers published in 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen,\" which translates to \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Question's Premise:** The question assumes that Einstein *did* cite someone's lectures in this paper. The task is to verify this assumption by examining the paper's content.\n\n4.  **Examine the Paper for Citations:** A crucial and well-documented characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers, including the one on Brownian motion, is the near-total absence of citations or references to other scientists' work. He famously developed his theories from first principles of physics, relying on logic and established physical laws rather than building upon recent literature.\n\n5.  **Scrutinize the Paper's Text:** A thorough review of the original German paper and its English translations confirms that there is no bibliography, no list of references, and no footnotes citing the work, papers, or lectures of any other scientist. Einstein begins his argument from foundational concepts of the kinetic theory of heat and hydrodynamics and derives his conclusions deductively.\n\n6.  **Conclusion based on evidence:** Since the paper contains no citations of any kind—to books, articles, or lectures—the premise of the question is incorrect. Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Influence and Citation:** While Einstein was certainly aware of and influenced by the broader work of physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs in the field of statistical mechanics, he did not formally cite them in this paper. The question specifically asks about citations *within the paper*, not general influences.\n*   **Specificity of the source:** The question specifically asks about \"lectures,\" which is a very particular type of source. The absence of *any* citations in the paper means that no lectures were cited.\n*   **Historical Context:** Einstein was working in relative isolation at the Swiss patent office in Bern. This, combined with his unique approach to physics, contributed to the self-contained nature of his papers from this period, which were notable for their lack of references.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer to the question \"Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\" is that he did not cite anyone's lectures.\n\n<<<In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein did not cite any other scientist's work, including any lectures. The paper is famous for its lack of references, as Einstein derived his theory from first principles.>>>"
