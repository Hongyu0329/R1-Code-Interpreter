The general finite transformation on the coordinate $x$, denoted by $x'$, is given by solving the flow equation generated by the Lie algebra. The infinitesimal generators for $t$ and $x$ are $\tau = C$ and $\xi(t) = A e^{k_1 t} + B$, where $A, B, C$ are arbitrary constants. The resulting transformation depends on whether time translation is included ($C \ne 0$).

There are two possible forms for the transformation:

1.  **If there is no time translation component (C = 0):**
    $x' = x + \epsilon(A e^{k_1 t} + B)$

2.  **If time translation is included (C â‰  0):**
    $x' = x + \frac{A}{k_1 C} e^{k_1 t}(e^{k_1 C \epsilon} - 1) + B \epsilon$

Here, $\epsilon$ is the parameter of the Lie group.
