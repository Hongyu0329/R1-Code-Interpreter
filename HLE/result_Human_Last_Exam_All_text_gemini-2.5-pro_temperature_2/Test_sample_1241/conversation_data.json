    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. This requires finding the stationary (or equilibrium) distribution of the continuous-time Markov process described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ denote the stationary probability of being in state $i$.\n\n2.  **Formulate Stationary Equations:** In the stationary state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_{i}'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. Applying this to the given system of differential equations yields a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$  (Eq. 1)\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$ (Eq. 2)\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$ (Eq. 3)\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$ (Eq. 4)\n\n    Additionally, the probabilities must sum to 1, which provides the normalization condition:\n    *   $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (Eq. 5)\n\n    The system of equations from the derivatives is linearly dependent (summing them gives 0=0). We can solve the system by using any three of the first four equations along with the normalization equation.\n\n3.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We will express $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n\n    *   From Eq. 1:\n        $\\lambda_{01}P_{0} = \\lambda_{10}P_{1} \\implies P_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} P_1$\n\n    *   From Eq. 3:\n        $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} \\implies P_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} P_1$\n\n    *   From Eq. 4:\n        $\\lambda_{31}P_{3} = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} \\implies P_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} P_2$\n\n4.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** Now, substitute the given values for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n    *   $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n    *   $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n    *   $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n    *   $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n    Let's calculate the coefficients for the relationships between probabilities:\n    *   $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n    *   $P_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008} P_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} P_1 = P_1$. **(Careful point: Perform addition in the denominator first).**\n    *   Since $P_2 = P_1$, we can substitute this into the equation for $P_3$:\n        $P_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} P_2 = 1 \\cdot P_2 = P_1$.\n    *   So we have the simple relationships: $P_2 = P_1$ and $P_3 = P_1$.\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Condition:** Substitute these expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ into Eq. 5:\n    *   $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n    *   $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) = 1$\n\n6.  **Calculate $P_1$:**\n    *   First, simplify the term in the parenthesis using a common denominator to maintain precision:\n        $\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$\n    *   The equation becomes: $P_1 \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n    *   Solving for $P_1$: $P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n7.  **Calculate $P_0$:**\n    *   Using the relation $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$:\n    *   $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$. **(Careful point: Notice the cancellation of 0.019, which simplifies the calculation and reduces error).**\n\n8.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for the sum $P_0 + P_1$:\n    *   $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n    *   $P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n    *   Performing the final division:\n        $\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding the result to six decimal places gives 0.946252.\n\n<<<0.946252>>>"
