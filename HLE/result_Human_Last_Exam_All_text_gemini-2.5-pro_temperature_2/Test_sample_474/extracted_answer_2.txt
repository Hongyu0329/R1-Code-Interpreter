The proposed approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome is to provide a recognizable warning signal to natural predators. The primary predators of bumblebees, such as birds, have vastly different visual systems than humans. Birds are typically tetrachromatic, meaning they can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to trichromatic humans. Two bumblebee species that appear identical to a human may have different UV patterns and thus be easily distinguished by a bird. Conversely, species that look different to humans may share UV patterns, making them functional mimics to a predator. Because the study uses human perception as a proxy for predator perception, it is measuring the wrong thing. The resulting clusters would not necessarily reflect the actual mimicry rings that have evolved in response to natural selection pressure from predators. Therefore, the methodology is fundamentally flawed for addressing the ecological function of mimicry.
