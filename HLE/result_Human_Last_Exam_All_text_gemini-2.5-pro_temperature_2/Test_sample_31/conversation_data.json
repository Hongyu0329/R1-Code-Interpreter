    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe goal is to \"fully identify the PLL case.\" In the context of the CFOP method, this means not only determining which of the 21 PLLs it is but also its orientation. Knowing the orientation is crucial for executing the correct algorithm from the correct angle without needing to rotate the cube. For example, for a T-perm, we need to know where the solved \"bar\" is to execute the algorithm correctly.\n\n### Step 2: Define a \"State\" to be Identified\nA \"state\" is a unique visual pattern presented by the side stickers of the last layer. We need to count how many such unique states exist across all 21 PLLs and the solved state.\n\nLet's analyze the rotational symmetry of the patterns for each PLL case:\n*   **Solved State:** There is only 1 solved state.\n*   **Symmetrical PLLs:** Some PLLs look the same from multiple angles.\n    *   **H-Perm:** Swaps opposite edges. The pattern looks identical from all 4 sides. (1 unique state)\n    *   **Z-Perm:** Swaps adjacent edges. The pattern also looks identical from all 4 sides. (1 unique state)\n    *   **Y-Perm:** Swaps two pairs of diagonal corners. This creates \"headlights\" (matching corner colors) on two opposite faces. Looking at a face with headlights is different from looking at a face without them. This gives 2 unique states (views).\n    *   **E-Perm:** Swaps two diagonal corners. The pattern of stickers on adjacent faces is different, but opposite faces have mirrored patterns. This results in 2 unique states (views).\n*   **Asymmetrical PLLs:** Most PLLs have no rotational symmetry in their sticker patterns. This means that each of the 4 possible viewing angles (Front, Right, Back, Left) presents a unique pattern that must be distinguished. The 16 asymmetrical PLLs are: Ua, Ub, T, F, Ja, Jb, Ra, Rb, V, Na, Nb, Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd. For each of these, there are 4 unique states to identify (16 PLLs * 4 orientations/PLL = 64 states).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Total Number of States\nLet's sum the number of unique states:\n*   Solved: 1\n*   H-Perm: 1\n*   Z-Perm: 1\n*   Y-Perm: 2\n*   E-Perm: 2\n*   16 Asymmetrical PLLs: 16 * 4 = 64\n*   **Total States to Distinguish = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 64 = 71 states.**\n\n### Step 4: Apply Information Theory (The Pigeonhole Principle)\nWe need to determine the minimum number of stickers to look at to get enough information to distinguish between these 71 states.\n\n*   Each non-top-facing sticker on the last layer can be one of 4 colors (the colors of the 4 side faces: e.g., Green, Red, Blue, Orange).\n*   Therefore, looking at one sticker gives us one of 4 possible pieces of information.\n*   If we look at **'n'** stickers, the total number of unique combinations of colors we can see is 4ⁿ.\n*   This number of combinations must be greater than or equal to the number of states we need to distinguish.\n\nLet's test values of 'n':\n*   If **n = 1**, we can see 4¹ = 4 combinations. This is not enough to distinguish 71 states.\n*   If **n = 2**, we can see 4² = 16 combinations. This is not enough.\n*   If **n = 3**, we can see 4³ = 64 combinations. Since 64 is less than 71, by the pigeonhole principle, it is impossible to assign a unique code to each of the 71 states. There will be at least one case where two different states produce the same set of 3 sticker colors, making them indistinguishable. Thus, 3 stickers are not enough.\n*   If **n = 4**, we can see 4⁴ = 256 combinations. Since 256 is greater than 71, it is theoretically possible to find a specific set of 4 stickers whose colors can uniquely identify any of the 71 states.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that a minimum of 3 stickers is insufficient. A minimum of 4 stickers is theoretically required. Detailed analysis by the speedcubing community has also confirmed that while some pairs of PLLs can be hard to distinguish, a well-chosen set of 4 stickers is indeed sufficient for full 1-look recognition. Therefore, the minimum number of stickers that *must* be seen is 4."
