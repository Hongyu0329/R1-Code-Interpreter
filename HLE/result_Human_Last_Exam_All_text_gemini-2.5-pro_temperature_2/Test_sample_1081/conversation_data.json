    "An analysis of the question, leading to the final answer, is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem's Core Concept**\nThe question asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. This is not a count of individual tori, but a count of the number of distinct classes of these tori, where two tori are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an element of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Tori Classes to the Weyl Group**\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields that provides a direct link between the classes of rational maximal tori and the structure of the group's Weyl group. The theorem states:\n*   The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of \"$F$-conjugacy classes\" of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\nThe Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure induces an automorphism of the Weyl group $W$. Two elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are said to be $F$-conjugate if there exists some $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Case of Type $E_8$**\nTo apply the theorem, we must understand the Weyl group $W$ for a group of type $E_8$ and the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on it.\n*   **Weyl Group:** The Weyl group is determined by the root system, so for a group of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is $W(E_8)$.\n*   **Frobenius Action:** The action of $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ depends on whether the group $G$ is *split* or *twisted*. A group is split if its Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms that are used to \"twist\" the group structure. The Dynkin diagrams corresponding to simple Lie algebras $B_n$, $C_n$, $G_2$, $F_4$, $E_7$, and $E_8$ are rigid, meaning they have no non-trivial automorphisms. Consequently, any algebraic group of these types defined over any field (including $\\mathbb{F}_q$) must be split.\n*   **Conclusion for $E_8$:** Since the group $G$ of type $E_8$ is split, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on its Weyl group $W(E_8)$. That is, for any element $x \\in W(E_8)$, we have $F(x) = x$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Conjugacy Condition**\nWith the Frobenius action being trivial ($F(x)=x$), the condition for $F$-conjugacy, $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$, simplifies to:\n$w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$\nThis is the definition of ordinary conjugacy within the group $W(E_8)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori classes is simply the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Number of Conjugacy Classes of $W(E_8)$**\nThe problem is now reduced to a known combinatorial result about the finite group $W(E_8)$. The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types was famously computed by R. W. Carter in the 1970s.\n*   In his paper \"Conjugacy Classes in the Weyl Group\" (Compositio Mathematica, 1972), Carter provides tables listing these numbers. For the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, the number of conjugacy classes is 112.\n\nThis number is a constant and does not depend on the specific finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, because the group is always split.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the analysis above:\n1.  The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n2.  For a group of type $E_8$, the group is split, so the Frobenius action on $W$ is trivial.\n3.  Therefore, the number of $F$-conjugacy classes is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n4.  The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is a known result, which is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
