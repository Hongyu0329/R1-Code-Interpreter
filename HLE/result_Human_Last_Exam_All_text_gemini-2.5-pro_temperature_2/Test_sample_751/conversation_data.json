    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n**The System:**\nx(k+1) = A * x(k)\ny(k) = C * x(k)\n\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Dual System**\nThe principle of duality states that the observability of a system (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T). We will convert this dual system into Controllable Canonical Form (CCF).\n\nThe dual system is defined by (A_d, B_d), where:\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\n**Step 2: Select an Output for Transformation**\nSince the system has multiple outputs, the observer canonical form is not unique. It depends on which output (or linear combination of outputs) is chosen to perform the transformation. A standard approach is to use the first output row from C that makes the pair (A, c_i) observable.\n\nLet's use the first row of C: `c1 = [0, 1, 0]`.\nThe observability of (A, c1) corresponds to the controllability of the dual pair (A_d, b_d), where `b_d = c1^T`.\nb_d = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\n**Step 3: Transform the Dual System (A_d, b_d) to Controllable Canonical Form (CCF)**\n\n*   **Characteristic Polynomial:** First, find the characteristic polynomial of A (which is the same as A_d), p(λ) = det(λI - A).\n    det([[λ-1, -1, 0], [-2, λ-1, -1], [0, -2, λ]])\n    = (λ-1)[(λ-1)λ - 2] - (-1)[-2λ]\n    = (λ-1)(λ^2 - λ - 2) - 2λ\n    = λ^3 - λ^2 - 2λ - λ^2 + λ + 2 - 2λ\n    = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2\n    The coefficients are a1 = -2, a2 = -3, a3 = 2.\n\n*   **Controllability Matrix of the Dual System:** Calculate the controllability matrix Qc = [b_d, A_d*b_d, A_d^2*b_d].\n    b_d = [0, 1, 0]^T\n    A_d*b_d = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\n    A_d^2*b_d = A_d * [2, 1, 1]^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [2, 1, 1]^T = [4, 5, 1]^T\n    Qc = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]\n    Since det(Qc) = 2 ≠ 0, the dual system (A_d, b_d) is controllable.\n\n*   **Transformation Matrix for CCF:** Find the matrix `P` that transforms the dual system state `x_d` to the CCF state `z_d` via `x_d = P * z_d`. One formula for `P` is `P = Qc * W`, where `W` is constructed from the polynomial coefficients.\n    W = [[a2, a1, 1], [a1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\n    P = Qc * W = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\n    P = [[0, 2, 0], [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Transformation Matrix for the Observer Canonical Form (OCF)**\n\nThe transformation `z = T_o⁻¹x` takes the original system (A, C) to OCF (A_o, C_o). The transformation matrix `T_o` is related to the dual system's transformation matrix `P` by `T_o = (P⁻¹)^T = P⁻ᵀ`.\n\n*   **Calculate P⁻¹:**\n    det(P) = -2\n    adj(P) = [[-1, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]]\n    P⁻¹ = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = [[1/2, 0, -1], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 1, 0]]\n\n*   **Calculate T_o = P⁻ᵀ:**\n    T_o = (P⁻¹)^T = [[1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the New Matrix C in OCF**\nThe new state space matrices are given by A_o = T_o⁻¹AT_o and C_o = CT_o. We only need to find C_o.\n\nC_o = C * T_o\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n*   **First row of C_o:**\n    [0, 1, 0] * T_o = [0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0, 0*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0] = [0, 0, 1]\n\n*   **Second row of C_o:**\n    [1, 1, 0] * T_o = [1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0, 1*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0] = [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]\n\nSo, the new C matrix is:\nC_o = [[0, 0, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Duality:** The core idea is that the observability of (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of (A^T, C^T).\n2.  **Canonical Form Choice:** For multi-output systems, the OCF depends on the output vector chosen for the transformation. We chose the first row of C, `c1`, which is a standard procedure when not otherwise specified.\n3.  **Transformation Formulas:** There are different conventions for canonical forms and their corresponding transformation matrices. The method used here (`A_ccf` with coefficients in the last row, transformation `x_d=P z_d` where `P = Qc * W`, and `T_o=P^{-T}`) is a consistent set.\n4.  **Matrix Calculations:** Each step involving matrix multiplication, finding determinants, and calculating inverses must be performed carefully. The results have been checked for consistency (e.g., verifying `P^{-1}A_dP` yields the correct `A_{ccf}`).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n[[0, 0, 1],\n [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
