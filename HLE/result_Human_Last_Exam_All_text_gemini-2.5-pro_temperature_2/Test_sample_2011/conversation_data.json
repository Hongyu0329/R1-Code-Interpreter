    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` having exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet `G` be a graph with `V(G)` as its set of vertices, where `|V(G)| = 128`.\nLet `S(G)` be the set of integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph `K_k`.\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible value of `|S(G)|` over all possible graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Relate \"induced clique\" to the standard definition of a clique**\n- An **induced subgraph** `G[V']` for a vertex subset `V' \\subseteq V(G)` consists of the vertices `V'` and all edges from `G` that connect two vertices in `V'`.\n- A **complete graph** `K_k` is a graph on `k` vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n- A **clique** in a graph `G` is a subset of vertices `C \\subseteq V(G)` where every two distinct vertices in `C` are adjacent in `G`.\n\nLet's establish the connection: A graph `G` has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k` if and only if there is a clique of size `k` in `G`.\n- **(⇒)** If `G` has an induced `K_k`, then there exists a vertex subset `V'` with `|V'|=k` such that `G[V']` is a `K_k`. By definition of an induced subgraph and a complete graph, this means every pair of vertices in `V'` is connected by an edge in `G`. Therefore, `V'` is a clique of size `k`.\n- **(⇐)** If `G` has a clique `C` of size `k`, then `|C|=k`, and every pair of vertices in `C` is adjacent. Consider the induced subgraph `G[C]`. Its vertices are `C`, and its edges are all edges of `G` between vertices in `C`. Since `C` is a clique, `G[C]` has all `k(k-1)/2` possible edges, making it a `K_k`.\n\nThus, the set of possible induced clique sizes `S(G)` is the same as the set of sizes of all cliques present in `G`.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the set of clique sizes `S(G)`**\nLet `\\omega(G)` denote the **clique number** of `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n- By definition, there exists a clique of size `\\omega(G)` in `G`, so `\\omega(G) \\in S(G)`.\n- Also, by definition, there is no clique of size greater than `\\omega(G)`.\n- Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 \\le k < \\omega(G)`. Let `C_{max}` be a largest clique in `G`, with `|C_{max}| = \\omega(G)`. We can choose any subset `C_k` of `C_{max}` with `|C_k|=k`. Since all vertices in `C_{max}` are pairwise adjacent, all vertices in its subset `C_k` must also be pairwise adjacent. Therefore, `C_k` is a clique of size `k`, which means `k \\in S(G)`.\n\nFrom these points, we conclude that the set of all clique sizes that can be found in `G` is the set of all integers from 1 up to the size of the maximum clique.\n`S(G) = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., \\omega(G)\\}`.\n\n**Step 4: Restate the problem in terms of clique number**\nThe number of different clique sizes is the size of the set `S(G)`, which is `|S(G)| = \\omega(G)`.\nThe original problem is therefore equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number, `\\omega(G)`, for any graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices.\nMaximize `\\omega(G)` subject to `|V(G)| = 128`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the maximum possible clique number**\nThe size of a clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices in that graph. For a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices, any clique `C` must be a subset of `V(G)`, so `|C| \\le |V(G)| = 128`.\nThis means `\\omega(G) \\le 128`.\n\n**Step 6: Show that this maximum is achievable**\nWe need to demonstrate that there exists a graph `G` on 128 vertices for which `\\omega(G) = 128`.\nConsider the complete graph `G = K_{128}`. This is a graph with 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n- The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the maximum clique size is `\\omega(K_{128}) = 128`.\n- In this graph, for any integer `k` between 1 and 128, we can select any `k` vertices. This subset of vertices will form a clique of size `k`, and thus induce a `K_k`.\n- The set of all possible clique sizes in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n- The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible value of `\\omega(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices, which is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n\nThe final answer is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
