    "This is a combinatorial problem related to Tverberg's theorem in geometry. Let's break down the question to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, let's understand the terminology and the premises given in the question.\n\n*   **Set `X`**: A set of `n` points in `d`-dimensional Euclidean space `ℝ^d`.\n*   **Partition `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` of `n`**: This means `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` are positive integers such that `a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_r = n`. These are the sizes of the parts in a partition.\n*   **Condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ d+1`**: This is a technical condition on the size of each part. It is a known condition for the existence of the special set `X` mentioned in the question (from a result by Bárány and Onn).\n*   **Tverberg Partition**: A Tverberg `r`-partition of `X` is a partition of the set `X` into `r` non-empty subsets, let's call them `Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_r`, such that the intersection of their convex hulls is non-empty. That is, `conv(Y_1) ∩ conv(Y_2) ∩ ... ∩ conv(Y_r) ≠ ∅`.\n*   **The Crucial Premise**: The question states, \"For any partition `a_1, ..., a_r` of `n` [...], there exists a set `X` [...] such that **every** Tverberg partition of `X` induces the same partition on `n` given by the parts `a_1, ..., a_r`.\"\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Crucial Premise\nThis premise is the key to the entire problem. The phrasing \"induces the same partition on `n` given by the parts `a_1, ..., a_r`\" is specific. It doesn't just mean that the *sizes* of the parts of any Tverberg partition are a permutation of `(a_1, ..., a_r)`. It implies something much stronger.\n\nLet's think of the `n` points of `X` as being pre-grouped into `r` specific, disjoint sets, let's call them `C_1, C_2, ..., C_r`, where `|C_i| = a_i` for each `i = 1, ..., r`. The set `X` is the union of these `r` sets: `X = C_1 ∪ C_2 ∪ ... ∪ C_r`. The \"partition on `n` given by the parts `a_1, ..., a_r`\" refers to this specific set partition `{C_1, C_2, ..., C_r}`.\n\nThe premise can be rephrased as:\n*There exists a configuration of points `X` (pre-partitioned into sets `{C_1, ..., C_r}`) such that a partition of `X` into `{Y_1, ..., Y_r}` is a Tverberg partition if and only if `{Y_1, ..., Y_r}` is identical to the original partition `{C_1, ..., C_r}`.*\n\nIn other words, for this specially constructed set `X`, there is a **unique unordered Tverberg partition**. This unique partition is precisely the one we started with, `{C_1, ..., C_r}`. The existence of such a set `X` is a non-trivial result from combinatorial geometry, which we are asked to take as given.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Tverberg Partitions\nThe question asks for \"the number of Tverberg's partitions\". In combinatorics, this typically refers to the number of *ordered* partitions. An ordered partition is a tuple `(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_r)`, where the order of the sets matters.\n\nBased on our interpretation from Step 2, we know that the only sets that can form a Tverberg partition are `C_1, C_2, ..., C_r`. The Tverberg condition `∩ conv(Y_i) ≠ ∅` is only satisfied if `{Y_1, ..., Y_r} = {C_1, ..., C_r}`.\n\nSo, any ordered Tverberg partition `(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_r)` must be a permutation of the tuple `(C_1, C_2, ..., C_r)`.\n\n*   Let's check if every permutation works. The condition for an ordered partition `(C_{σ(1)}, C_{σ(2)}, ..., C_{σ(r)})` (where `σ` is a permutation of `{1, ..., r}`) to be a Tverberg partition is `conv(C_{σ(1)}) ∩ conv(C_{σ(2)}) ∩ ... ∩ conv(C_{σ(r)}) ≠ ∅`.\n*   This intersection is the same regardless of the order of the sets. It is simply `∩_{i=1}^r conv(C_i)`.\n*   Since `{C_1, ..., C_r}` is a Tverberg partition (by our premise), this intersection is non-empty.\n*   Therefore, any ordering of the sets `C_1, ..., C_r` results in a valid ordered Tverberg partition.\n\n### Step 4: The Final Calculation\nWe need to count the number of ways to order the `r` sets `C_1, C_2, ..., C_r`.\n\n*   The sets `C_i` are disjoint and non-empty, so they are all distinct subsets of `X`. This is true even if some of them have the same size (e.g., if `a_i = a_j` for `i ≠ j`, the sets `C_i` and `C_j` are still different as they consist of different points).\n*   We are counting the number of permutations of `r` distinct objects.\n*   The number of permutations of `r` distinct objects is `r!` (r-factorial).\n\nThis result depends only on `r`, the number of parts in the partition, and not on the dimension `d` or the specific sizes `a_i` of the parts (as long as they satisfy the given condition `1 ≤ a_i ≤ d+1` which guarantees the existence of `X`).\n\nFor example, if `r=4`, there are `4! = 24` such partitions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of Tverberg's partitions of the specially constructed set `X` is the number of ways to order the `r` fixed sets that form the unique unordered Tverberg partition. This is the number of permutations of `r` distinct items.\n\n<<<r!>>>"
