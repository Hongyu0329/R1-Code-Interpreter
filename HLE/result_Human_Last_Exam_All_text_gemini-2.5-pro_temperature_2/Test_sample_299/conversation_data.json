    "An analysis of the problem to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Initial analysis of the function `f`**\n\nThe equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$. Let's analyze the properties that any solution $f$ must have.\n\n1.  **Domain and Codomain:** The function $f$ is defined from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ and is continuous.\n2.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we must have $x_1=x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n3.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We will analyze these two cases separately.\n4.  **Range:** The range of $f(f(x))$ is the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. Let $Ran(f)$ be the range of $f$. Then the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ implies that $f(Ran(f)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Limits at infinity:** Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its limits as $x \\to \\infty$ and $x \\to -\\infty$ exist. Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = K$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $L < K$. The range of $f$ is the open interval $(L, K)$.\n2.  **Behavior of f(f(x)) at infinity:**\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $e^x \\to \\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\infty$.\n    *   Let $y=f(x)$. As $x\\to\\infty$, $y \\to L^+$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y)$.\n    *   Since $f$ is decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, as its argument decreases, its value increases. The supremum of the values of $f$ is $K$. Thus, $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = K$.\n    *   Comparing the two results, we must have $K = \\infty$.\n3.  **Behavior of f(f(x)) at negative infinity:**\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $e^x \\to 0$. So, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$.\n    *   Let $y=f(x)$. As $x\\to-\\infty$, $y \\to K^- = \\infty$. The limit becomes $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = L$.\n    *   Comparing these two results, we must have $L = 0$.\n4.  **Summary for the decreasing case:** If a strictly decreasing solution $f$ exists, it must satisfy $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. This implies that $f$ is a continuous, strictly decreasing function that maps $\\mathbb{R}$ onto $(0, \\infty)$. In particular, $f(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n5.  **Existence of a fixed point:** Consider the auxiliary function $g(x) = f(x) - x$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} (f(x)-x) = \\infty - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (f(x)-x) = 0 - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is continuous and goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a real number $x_0$ such that $g(x_0)=0$, which implies $f(x_0) = x_0$. This point $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n6.  **Contradiction:** If such a fixed point $x_0$ exists, let's evaluate $f(f(x_0))$:\n    *   Since $f(x_0)=x_0$, we have $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   From the original equation, we have $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $x_0 = e^{x_0}$. However, the equation $x=e^x$ has no real solutions (the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ never intersect).\n7.  **Conclusion for decreasing case:** This contradiction proves that no such strictly decreasing function $f$ can exist.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Limits at infinity:** Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = K$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$, with $L < K$.\n2.  **Behavior of f(f(x)) at infinity:**\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\infty$. Let $y=f(x) \\to K$. Then $\\lim_{y\\to K^-} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, it cannot have a vertical asymptote. This is only possible if $K=\\infty$.\n3.  **Behavior of f(f(x)) at negative infinity:**\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$. Let $y=f(x) \\to L^+$. Then $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is continuous, this implies that $L$ must be a finite number and $f(L)=0$. Let's call $L=M$.\n4.  **Summary for the increasing case:** An increasing solution $f$ must satisfy $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$ (for some finite $M$), and $f(M)=0$.\n5.  **Properties of the range:** The range of $f$ is $(M, \\infty)$. Since $f(M)=0$, the value 0 must be in the range of $f$. This requires $M<0$.\n6.  **Existence of solutions:** The existence of such functions is a known result in the study of functional equations, particularly those involving fractional iteration (finding a \"half-iterate\" $f$ for a given function $g$ such that $f \\circ f = g$). It can be shown that solutions exist.\n7.  **Constructing solutions:**\n    *   For any chosen value of $M<0$, we can construct a solution.\n    *   The construction relies on defining $f$ (or its inverse $h=f^{-1}$) on a particular interval and then using the functional equation to extend the definition to the entire domain.\n    *   The condition on $f$ translates to its inverse $h=f^{-1}:(M, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $h(h(y))=\\ln y$ for $y>0$, with $h(0)=M$.\n    *   The construction proceeds by choosing an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing bijection $\\psi: [e^M, 1] \\to [0, e^M]$. This will be the definition of $h$ on the interval $[e^M, 1]$ (this is consistent with the known points $h(e^M)=0$ and $h(1)=e^M$).\n    *   Once this seed function $\\psi$ is chosen, the functional equation $h(h(y))=\\ln y$ uniquely determines the function $h$ on its entire domain $(M,\\infty)$.\n8.  **Counting the solutions (finding the cardinality):**\n    *   The choice of the seed function $\\psi$ is not unique. There are infinitely many ways to define a strictly increasing continuous function between two points. The set of all such possible functions $\\psi$ has the cardinality of the continuum, which is denoted by $C$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   Furthermore, we can make this construction for any initial choice of $M<0$. There are also $C$ possible choices for $M$.\n    *   Each unique pair $(M, \\psi)$ generates a different, unique solution $f$. For different $M$'s, the ranges are different. For the same $M$ but different $\\psi$'s, the functions differ on the seed interval, so they are different functions.\n    *   The total number of solutions is therefore the product of the number of choices for $M$ and the number of choices for $\\psi$, which is $C \\times C = C$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$ contains no strictly decreasing functions. It does contain strictly increasing functions. The number of such increasing functions is the cardinality of the continuum, as shown by a constructive argument.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $C = 2^{\\aleph_0}$."
