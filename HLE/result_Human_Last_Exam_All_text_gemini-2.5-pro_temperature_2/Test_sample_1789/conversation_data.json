    "Answering this question involves several steps of analysis based on poset theory, specifically related to Dilworth's theorem and its variations on the divisor poset.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the core question\nThe question asks for the size of the largest possible set $S$ that can be formed by taking the union of 20 antichains from the set of integers $\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$, where $N = 823564528378596$. The integers are ordered by the divisibility relation, forming a partially ordered set (poset), often called the divisor poset.\n\n-   **Poset:** A set with a partial order relation. Here, the set is $P = \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ and the relation is 'divides'. We write $a|b$ if $a$ divides $b$.\n-   **Antichain:** A subset $A \\subseteq P$ where no two distinct elements are comparable. In this context, for any two distinct numbers $x, y \\in A$, neither $x|y$ nor $y|x$.\n-   **Union of 20 antichains:** We are looking for 20 antichains $A_1, A_2, ..., A_{20}$ such that the size of their union, $|A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup ... \\cup A_{20}|$, is maximized.\n\n### Step 2: Translating the condition on the set $S$\nLet $S$ be a set that is a union of $k=20$ antichains, i.e., $S = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup ... \\cup A_{20}$. We need to understand what property this imposes on the set $S$.\n\nConsider a chain in $S$. A chain is a sequence of elements $x_1, x_2, ..., x_m$ from $S$ such that $x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_m$. Since all elements in a chain must be distinct, we must have $x_i \\ne x_j$ for $i \\ne j$.\n\nFor any two distinct elements in a chain, say $x_i$ and $x_j$ with $i < j$, we have $x_i | x_j$. By definition, two comparable elements cannot belong to the same antichain.\nLet's assign a \"color\" to each element of the chain from the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 20\\}$. For each element $x_j$ in the chain, we can define its color $c(x_j)$ as the index of the first antichain it belongs to: $c(x_j) = \\min\\{i \\mid x_j \\in A_i\\}$.\n\nIf we take any two elements from the chain, $x_i$ and $x_j$ with $i \\neq j$, they are comparable. Therefore, they cannot be in the same antichain. This means their colors must be different, $c(x_i) \\neq c(x_j)$.\nSince there are $m$ elements in the chain, we need at least $m$ distinct colors. However, we only have $k=20$ colors available (the indices of the antichains). This implies that the length of any chain in $S$ cannot exceed 20. So, $m \\le 20$.\n\nThis means the property of being a \"union of 20 antichains\" is equivalent to the property that \"the longest chain has a length of at most 20\".\n\n### Step 3: Reformulating the problem\nThe original problem is now transformed into an equivalent one: What is the maximum size of a subset $S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ that contains no chain of length 21? (A longest chain of length at most 20 means there is no chain of length 21).\n\nThis is a well-known problem in extremal set theory for the divisor poset. The question is to find the size of the largest subset of $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that does not contain a divisor chain of length $k+1$. For this problem, we have $k=20$.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the known theorem\nA theorem, sometimes attributed to ErdÃ¶s and others, states that the maximum size of a subset of $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that contains no divisor chain of length $k+1$ is given by the formula:\nSize = $N - \\lfloor N / 2^k \\rfloor$.\n\nThis result can be understood by constructing a set with this property and size, and then proving its maximality. One such set is $S = \\{x \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid x > \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor \\}$. Let's verify this set has no chain of length $k+1$.\nIf $x_1, ..., x_{k+1}$ is a chain in $S$, then $x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_{k+1}$.\nWe must have $x_{i+1} \\ge 2x_i$ for all $i$. Thus, $x_{k+1} \\ge 2^k x_1$.\nSince $x_1 \\in S$, we have $x_1 \\ge \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor + 1$.\nCombining these, $x_{k+1} \\ge 2^k (\\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor + 1) = 2^k\\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor + 2^k$.\nLet $N = q \\cdot 2^k + r$, where $q = \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor$ and $0 \\le r < 2^k$.\nThen $x_{k+1} \\ge 2^k q + 2^k = (N - r) + 2^k$.\nSince $r < 2^k$, we have $r \\le 2^k - 1$. So, $-r \\ge -(2^k-1) = 1-2^k$.\nTherefore, $x_{k+1} \\ge N - r + 2^k \\ge N + (1 - 2^k) + 2^k = N+1$.\nThis implies $x_{k+1} > N$, which contradicts the fact that $x_{k+1} \\in S \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$.\nThus, the set $S$ indeed has no chain of length $k+1$. Its size is $N - \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor$. This is known to be the maximum possible size.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation\nWe need to apply the formula with our given values:\n-   $N = 823564528378596$\n-   The number of antichains is 20. This implies the maximum chain length is 20. So, we are looking for a set with no chain of length 21. In the formula $N - \\lfloor N / 2^k \\rfloor$ for \"no chain of length k+1\", we set $k=20$.\n\nFirst, calculate $2^{20}$:\n$2^{10} = 1024$\n$2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1048576$.\n\nNext, calculate the floor of $N/2^{20}$:\n$\\lfloor N / 2^{20} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\rfloor$.\nUsing a calculator capable of handling large integers:\n$823564528378596 \\div 1048576 = 785412312500$ with a remainder.\nSo, $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor = 785412312500$.\n\nFinally, compute the size of the largest union:\nSize = $N - \\lfloor N / 2^{20} \\rfloor$\nSize = $823564528378596 - 785412312500$\nSize = $822779116066096$.\n\n<<<822779116066096>>>"
