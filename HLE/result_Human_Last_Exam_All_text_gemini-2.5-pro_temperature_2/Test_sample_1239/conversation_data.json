    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations requires finding the transformations that leave the equations invariant. This is a classic problem in the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the equations for the velocity field $u(t, x) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, x)$ are given by:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + (u \\cdot \\nabla) u = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 u$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot u = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ (kinematic viscosity) and $\\rho$ (density) are positive constants. A symmetry of this system is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, x)$ and dependent variables $(u, p)$ that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such symmetries forms a Lie group. We are asked for the dimension of this group, which is equivalent to the dimension of its Lie algebra, whose elements are the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Symmetry Generators**\nWe seek the infinitesimal generators of the form $X = \\xi(t,x,u,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\phi_i(t,x,u,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\psi_i(t,x,u,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} + \\eta(t,x,u,p) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$. A systematic, though lengthy, calculation using the prolongation of the vector field $X$ yields the full set of generators. However, we can identify most of them based on physical principles and then confirm with established results.\n\n**Step 3: The Galilean Group Symmetries**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are expected to be invariant under Galilean transformations, which describe the symmetries of classical mechanics. The Galilean group has 10 dimensions. Its generators are:\n1.  **Time translation (1 generator):** The equations do not explicitly depend on $t$. This gives the generator $\\partial_t$.\n2.  **Space translations (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under shifting the spatial origin. This gives the generators $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n3.  **Space rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic. This gives rise to generators for rotations about each axis, for instance, $J_3 = x_1 \\partial_{x_2} - x_2 \\partial_{x_1} + u_1 \\partial_{u_2} - u_2 \\partial_{u_1}$. There are three such independent generators.\n4.  **Galilean boosts (3 generators):** These correspond to transforming to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity. A boost with velocity $c$ corresponds to the transformation $t' = t, x' = x - ct, u'(t', x') = u(t, x) - c$. This can be shown to leave the Navier-Stokes equations invariant (with $p'(t',x')=p(t,x)$). The corresponding infinitesimal generators are $G_i = t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n\nCounting these up, we have $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ dimensions from the Galilean group.\n\n**Step 4: Scaling Symmetry**\nBeyond the Galilean symmetries, the Navier-Stokes equations possess a scaling symmetry. This is not obvious from physical intuition alone but comes from a detailed analysis. The transformation is:\n$t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad x' = \\lambda x, \\quad u' = \\lambda^{-1} u, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\nThis one-parameter group of scaling transformations is a symmetry. Its infinitesimal generator is:\n$D = 2t \\partial_t + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$.\nThis adds one more dimension to the symmetry algebra.\n\n**Step 5: Total Dimension of the Finite-Dimensional Algebra**\nSumming up the dimensions from all identified generators:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Space Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nThis 11-dimensional Lie algebra is the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \\ge 3$.\n\n**Step 6: The Issue of Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries**\nA careful point to consider is that the pressure $p$ is only determined up to a function of time. The transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$ for any arbitrary function $f(t)$ leaves the gradient $\\nabla p$ unchanged and thus is also a symmetry of the momentum equation. This corresponds to an infinite-dimensional algebra of generators of the form $f(t) \\partial_p$. These are often called \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetries. When asked for \"the dimension\" of the symmetry group, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry algebra, effectively quotienting out this infinite-dimensional ideal. Under this standard interpretation, the answer is the finite number we calculated.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the standard analysis of Lie symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions, the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries is composed of time translation (1), space translations (3), space rotations (3), Galilean boosts (3), and a scaling transformation (1). The total dimension is the sum of the number of generators for each of these transformations.\n\nDimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
