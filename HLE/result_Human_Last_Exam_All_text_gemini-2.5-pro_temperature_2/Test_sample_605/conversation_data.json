    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the input and verify the Calabi-Yau condition\n\nThe problem provides a Calabi-Yau link, which corresponds to a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$. This threefold is represented as a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, denoted as $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n\n*   **Weights of the ambient space:** The weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n*   **Defining polynomial:** The hypersurface $X$ is the zero set of the polynomial $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n*   **Calabi-Yau condition:** For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, it must be defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ such that the degree is equal to the sum of the weights. That is, $d = \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i$.\n\nLet's check this condition.\n1.  **Sum of weights:**\n    $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    So, the degree of the defining polynomial must be $d=225$.\n\n2.  **Degree of the polynomial:** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous of degree $d$ if every monomial term has a weighted degree equal to $d$. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1} z_2^{a_2} z_3^{a_3} z_4^{a_4} z_5^{a_5}$ is $\\sum a_i w_i$. Let's check each term of the given polynomial:\n    *   $z_1^8z_3$: $8(22) + 1(49) = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n    *   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4(22) + 3(29) + 1(49) = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n    *   $z_1z_2^7$: $1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n    *   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $1(22)+1(29)+1(49)+1(50)+1(75) = 225$.\n    *   $z_2z_3^4$: $1(29) + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n    *   $z_4^3z_5$: $3(50) + 1(75) = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   $z_5^3$: $3(75) = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The second term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has a weighted degree of 224, while all other terms have a degree of 225. This indicates a typo in the provided polynomial. For the hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, all terms must have the same degree, $d=225$. Fortunately, the specific form of the polynomial is not needed to calculate topological invariants like the Crawley-Nordström invariant. Only the weights $w_i$ and the degree $d$ are required. We proceed by assuming $d=225$.\n\n### Step 2: State the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, $N_{CN}$, for a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ is defined as:\n$N_{CN} = \\frac{1}{2} c_2(X) \\cdot H$\nwhere $c_2(X)$ is the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, and $H$ is the ample generator of the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ (the hyperplane class).\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $X_d$ in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, \\dots, w_5)$, the intersection number $c_2(X) \\cdot H$ can be computed with the following formula, which generalizes the result for smooth hypersurfaces in standard projective space:\n$c_2(X) \\cdot H = \\left( \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 5} w_i w_j \\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{\\prod_{k=1}^5 w_k}$\n\n**Careful Point:** This formula relies on a generalization of the adjunction formula for Chern classes to the case of weighted projective spaces (which are orbifolds). It is the standard formula used in this context.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the components of the formula\n\nWe need to calculate the three parts of the formula: $\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j$, $d$, and $\\prod w_k$.\n\n1.  **Degree $d$:**\n    $d = \\sum w_i = 225$.\n\n2.  **Sum of pairwise products of weights, $\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j$:**\n    We use the identity: $\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i^2 \\right]$.\n    *   $(\\sum w_i)^2 = 225^2 = 50625$.\n    *   $\\sum w_i^2 = 22^2 + 29^2 + 49^2 + 50^2 + 75^2$\n        $= 484 + 841 + 2401 + 2500 + 5625$\n        $= 11851$.\n    *   $\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j = \\frac{1}{2} (50625 - 11851) = \\frac{38774}{2} = 19387$.\n\n3.  **Product of weights, $\\prod w_k$:**\n    $\\prod_{k=1}^5 w_k = 22 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 75$\n    $= (22 \\cdot 50) \\cdot 29 \\cdot (49 \\cdot 75)$\n    $= 1100 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 3675$\n    $= 1100 \\cdot (29 \\cdot 3675) = 1100 \\cdot 106575$\n    $= 117232500$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The calculation of these large numbers must be done carefully to avoid arithmetic errors. Re-checking the product confirms it is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $c_2(X) \\cdot H$ and the final invariant\n\nNow we substitute the calculated values into the formula for $c_2(X) \\cdot H$:\n$c_2(X) \\cdot H = 19387 \\cdot \\frac{225}{117232500}$\n\nFirst, let's simplify the fraction $\\frac{225}{117232500}$:\nUsing prime factorizations:\n$225 = 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$\n$117232500 = (22)(29)(49)(50)(75) = (2 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (29) \\cdot (7^2) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5^2) \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5^2) = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29$.\n$\\frac{225}{117232500} = \\frac{3^2 \\cdot 5^2}{2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29} = \\frac{3}{2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29}$\nThe denominator is: $4 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29 = 100 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 319 = 100 \\cdot 15631 = 1563100$.\nSo, $\\frac{225}{117232500} = \\frac{3}{1563100}$.\n\nNow substitute this back:\n$c_2(X) \\cdot H = 19387 \\cdot \\frac{3}{1563100} = \\frac{58161}{1563100}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant:\n$N_{CN} = \\frac{1}{2} c_2(X) \\cdot H = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{58161}{1563100} = \\frac{58161}{3126200}$.\n\nThe numerator is $58161 = 3 \\cdot 19387$. The denominator's prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 11, 29. Since 19387 is not divisible by any of these primes, the fraction is irreducible.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated to be $\\frac{58161}{3126200}$.\n\n<<<58161/3126200>>>"
