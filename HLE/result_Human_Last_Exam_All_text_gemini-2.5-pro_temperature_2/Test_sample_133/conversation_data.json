    "This is a game of Connect 4, and the player 'O' is to move. The goal is to find all the optimal moves for 'O' to win as fast as possible. An optimal move is one that leads to the quickest possible victory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define \"Optimal Move\" and Search Strategy**\nThe goal is to win \"as fast as possible\". This means we must prioritize moves in the following order:\n*   **Win in 1 move:** An immediate move that creates a line of four 'O's.\n*   **Win in 3 moves:** A move that forces a win on 'O's next turn. This typically involves creating two simultaneous threats that the opponent ('X') cannot block with a single move.\n*   And so on for wins in 5 moves, etc.\n\n**2. Analyze for a Win in 1 Move**\nLet's examine if 'O' can win on this turn by placing a single disc to form a line of four. We check all directions for existing lines of three 'O's that can be completed.\n*   **Horizontal:** The longest horizontal sequence of 'O's is two, at `d4` and `e4`. There is no way to complete a four-in-a-row with one move.\n*   **Vertical:** The longest vertical sequence of 'O's is two, at `d4` and `d5`. A move at `d3` would create a line of three, but it would not be a winning move on this turn.\n*   **Diagonal (Up-Right /):** There is a line of three 'O's at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. To win with this line, 'O' would need to place a disc at `f3`. However, the next available space in column 'f' is `f4`. Therefore, `f3` is not a playable move on this turn.\n*   **Diagonal (Down-Right \\):** There are no three-in-a-row formations for 'O' in this direction.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no immediate winning moves for 'O'. The fastest possible win is not in 1 move.\n\n**3. Analyze for a Win in 3 Moves (Forced Win)**\nNext, we look for moves that create a situation where 'X' cannot stop 'O' from winning on the subsequent turn. This usually involves creating an \"open-ended three-in-a-row\", which creates two winning spaces.\n*   **Key Formation:** The board has two adjacent 'O's in the middle, at `d4` and `e4`. This is a powerful setup.\n*   **Analyzing Move `c4`:**\n    *   If 'O' plays at `c4`, it creates a horizontal line of three 'O's: `c4-d4-e4`.\n    *   This line is \"open-ended\" because there are empty, playable spaces on both ends: `b4` and `f4`.\n    *   'O' now threatens to win on the next turn by playing at either `b4` (to make `b4-c4-d4-e4`) or `f4` (to make `c4-d4-e4-f4`).\n    *   'X' can only make one move and can therefore only block one of these two winning spaces.\n    *   If 'X' blocks `b4`, 'O' wins at `f4`. If 'X' blocks `f4`, 'O' wins at `b4`.\n    *   Therefore, the move `c4` forces a win for 'O' on the next turn (a win in 3 total moves). **`c4` is an optimal move.**\n*   **Analyzing Move `f4`:**\n    *   Similarly, if 'O' plays at `f4`, it creates a different horizontal line of three 'O's: `d4-e4-f4`.\n    *   This line is also open-ended, with playable empty spaces at `c4` and `g4`.\n    *   'O' now threatens to win on the next turn by playing at either `c4` (to make `c4-d4-e4-f4`) or `g4` (to make `d4-e4-f4-g4`).\n    *   'X' can only block one of these threats.\n    *   Therefore, the move `f4` also forces a win for 'O' on the next turn. **`f4` is an optimal move.**\n\n**4. Analyze Other Potential Moves**\n*   **Analyzing Move `d3`:** This move creates a vertical three-in-a-row (`d3-d4-d5`) and threatens to win at `d2`. However, this is a single threat. 'X' will simply play at `d2` to block it. This does not lead to a forced win and results in a slower victory compared to `c4` or `f4`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are no winning moves in 1 turn, the fastest possible win is in 3 turns. The two moves that guarantee this victory are `c4` and `f4`. They are the only optimal moves.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
