Let `D_k = 100 \sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1}` for `k \in \{1, ..., n\}`, noting that the sum is zero if the lower limit `k+1` is greater than the upper limit `n`.

The maximum amount of water left is given by:

1.  If `m > D_1` (i.e., `m > 100 \sum_{j=2}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1}`):
    The amount of water left is `100 - m + 100 \sum_{j=2}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1}`

2.  If `m \le D_1`:
    Let `k` be the unique integer `\in [2, n]` such that `D_k \le m < D_{k-1}`.
    The amount of water left is `100k - (2k-1)\left(m - 100 \sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1}\right)`
