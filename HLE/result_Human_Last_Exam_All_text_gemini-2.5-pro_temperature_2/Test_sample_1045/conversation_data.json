    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atom count of toluene.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C₇H₈.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are linear combinations of primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **The hyphen \"-\"** separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals.\n*   **The first number (6)** describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (31)** describe the valence orbitals. This means the valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of functions (a \"double-zeta\" representation).\n    *   The first number **(3)** means the inner part of the valence shell is represented by one contracted function per orbital, each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The second number **(1)** means the outer part of the valence shell is represented by one contracted function per orbital, each made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted functions for each Hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons. Therefore, only the \"31G\" part of the notation applies.\n*   The 1s orbital is split into two functions:\n    *   An inner part represented by 1 CGF (from 3 primitives).\n    *   An outer part represented by 1 CGF (from 1 primitive).\n*   **Total per H atom = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted Gaussian functions.**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted functions for each Carbon (C) atom.**\n*   Carbon is a second-row element, so it has both core and valence electrons.\n*   **Core orbitals (1s):** The \"6-\" part applies. The 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"-31G\" part applies. The valence shell is split.\n    *   **Inner part (from the \"3\"):** This creates one set of valence functions. There is one s-type orbital (2s) and three p-type orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). This gives 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer part (from the \"1\"):** This creates a second, more diffuse set of valence functions. Again, there is one s-type orbital and three p-type orbitals. This gives 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total per C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C₇H₈).**\n*   Total CGFs = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\n*   Total CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n*   Total CGFs = 63 + 16\n*   **Total CGFs = 79**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Distinguish between Primitive and Contracted Gaussians:** The question asks for *contracted* functions, not the more numerous *primitive* functions.\n2.  **Atom-Specific Interpretation:** The basis set notation applies differently to Hydrogen (no core) than to second-row elements like Carbon (has a core).\n3.  **Count All Orbitals:** For Carbon, remember to count the functions for both the s and p orbitals in the valence shell (1 s-function and 3 p-functions per set).\n4.  **Split Valence:** The \"31\" in 6-31G means the valence shell is represented by two basis functions for each atomic orbital (e.g., the 2s atomic orbital is represented by two s-type basis functions), hence the term \"split-valence\".\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   Total functions = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
