    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the coordinates of the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Initial Setup**\nThe goal is to find the central pixel of a line drawn between the starting point P1(1, 1) and the ending point P2(11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n**2. Calculate Deltas and Determine the Major Axis**\n*   First, we calculate the change in x (`dx`) and the change in y (`dy`).\n    *   `dx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10`\n    *   `dy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n*   We compare `dx` and `dy` to determine the slope's steepness.\n    *   Since `dx (10) > dy (4)`, the slope of the line is less than 1. This means the line is \"gentle\" or \"x-major\".\n    *   Therefore, the algorithm will always increment `x` by 1 at each step and decide whether to increment `y`.\n\n**3. Determine the Total Number of Pixels and the Central Pixel's Position**\n*   For an x-major line, the total number of pixels to be plotted is `dx + 1`.\n*   Total pixels = 10 + 1 = 11.\n*   Since the total number of pixels (11) is an odd number, there is a single unique central pixel.\n*   The position of this central pixel in the sequence is `(Total Pixels + 1) / 2 = (11 + 1) / 2 = 6`.\n*   So, we need to find the coordinates of the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm.\n\n**4. Apply Bresenham's Line Algorithm**\nThe algorithm uses a decision parameter `p` to decide when to increment the minor axis coordinate (`y` in this case).\n\n*   **Initial Decision Parameter:** The formula for the initial decision parameter is `p = 2 * dy - dx`.\n    *   `p = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`\n\n*   **Iteration and Pixel Generation:** We start at the first pixel (1, 1) and iterate until we find the 6th pixel.\n    *   The rule for updating `p` is:\n        *   If `p < 0`, the next point is `(x+1, y)` and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2 * dy`.\n        *   If `p >= 0`, the next point is `(x+1, y+1)` and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 1:** Start at **(1, 1)**. Initial `p = -2`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 2:** Current pixel is (1, 1), `p = -2`.\n        *   Since `p < 0`, we don't increment `y`. The next `x` is 2.\n        *   The next pixel is **(2, 1)**.\n        *   Update `p`: `p = -2 + 2 * 4 = 6`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 3:** Current pixel is (2, 1), `p = 6`.\n        *   Since `p >= 0`, we increment `y`. The next `x` is 3.\n        *   The next pixel is **(3, 2)**.\n        *   Update `p`: `p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 4:** Current pixel is (3, 2), `p = -6`.\n        *   Since `p < 0`, we don't increment `y`. The next `x` is 4.\n        *   The next pixel is **(4, 2)**.\n        *   Update `p`: `p = -6 + 2 * 4 = 2`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 5:** Current pixel is (4, 2), `p = 2`.\n        *   Since `p >= 0`, we increment `y`. The next `x` is 5.\n        *   The next pixel is **(5, 3)**.\n        *   Update `p`: `p = 2 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`.\n\n    *   **Pixel 6 (The Central Pixel):** Current pixel is (5, 3), `p = -10`.\n        *   Since `p < 0`, we don't increment `y`. The next `x` is 6.\n        *   The next pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n        *   This is the 6th pixel in our sequence, which we identified as the central one.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe list of pixels begins with (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), ... The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence of 11 pixels. Based on the step-by-step execution of Bresenham's algorithm, the coordinates of the 6th pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
