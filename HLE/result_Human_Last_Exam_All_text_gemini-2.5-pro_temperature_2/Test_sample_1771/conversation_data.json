    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the PIE verb form *seh₂g-ie-ti.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂giéti` (The accent is conventionally placed on the thematic vowel in this type of present tense formation).\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`, meaning 'to track, seek out, perceive'. The Hittite `sākizzi` ('he gives a sign') and Latin `sāgīre` ('to be keen-nosed, perceive acutely') are cited cognates.\n*   **Root Structure:** The root contains a sibilant `*s`, a vowel `*e`, a laryngeal `*h₂`, and a voiced velar stop `*g`. The laryngeal `*h₂` has an \"a-coloring\" effect.\n*   **Suffix:** `-ieti` is the 3rd person singular thematic present indicative suffix (`-ie/o-` is the stem-forming suffix, `-ti` is the personal ending).\n\n### Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nThe PIE form `*seh₂giéti` undergoes several regular sound changes on its path to Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Vowel change (Laryngeal influence):** The sequence PIE `*eh₂` becomes a long `*ā` in Pre-Germanic. So, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāg-`.\n*   **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This is a chain shift of consonants.\n    *   Voiced stops become voiceless stops. Thus, PIE `*g` becomes PGmc `*k`.\n    *   Applying this to our Pre-Germanic root `*sāg-`, it becomes `*sāk-`.\n    *   (Note: Verner's Law, which voices fricatives when the preceding PIE accent is not on the root, does not apply to the `*k` from PIE `*g`.)\n*   **Germanic Vowel Shift:** The long `*ā` inherited from PIE (via `*eh₂`) becomes a long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic. So, `*sāk-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n*   **Verb Class & Ending:** The PIE `*-ye/o-` present becomes the Class I weak verb in Germanic, which uses a stem-forming suffix `*-ja-`. The PIE ending `*-ti` becomes PGmc `*-þi` or `*-þ` (Grimm's law: `t` > `þ`). The 3rd person singular present indicative form combines the stem and ending.\n*   **Final Proto-Germanic Form:** The stem is `*sōk-` + `*-ija-` (the form of the suffix after a long root syllable). The 3rd person singular ending is `*-iþ`. This gives us the PGmc form **`*sōkijiþ`** (often cited in a more simplified form as `*sōkiþ`). The infinitive would be `*sōkijaną`.\n\n### Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages\n\n**A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijiþ`.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The `*i` or `*j` in the stem `*-iji-` causes the back vowel `*ō` in the root to be fronted. The sound `*ō` becomes `*œ̄` (a long, front, rounded vowel). So, `*sōk-` -> `*sœ̄k-`.\n*   **Ending Change:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` develops into Proto-Norse `*-iʀ` and then Old Norse `*-ir`.\n*   **Final Old Norse Form:** `*sœ̄kiʀ` -> **`sœkir`**. (This is the 3rd p. sg. of the verb `sœkja` 'to seek, prosecute').\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijiþ`.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `*i` or `*j` triggers umlaut. In Old English, PGmc `*ō` is fronted to `*ē`. So, `*sōk-` -> `*sēk-`.\n*   **Palatalization:** In the West-Germanic dialects, a velar consonant (`*k` or `*g`) before a front vowel (like the `i` that caused umlaut) is palatalized. In Old English, `*k` becomes the affricate `/tʃ/`, spelled `<c>` or `ċ`. So `*sēk-` -> `*sēċ-` (`/se:tʃ-/`).\n*   **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` in standard West-Saxon Old English. The `i` of the stem is retained and surfaces as `e`.\n*   **Final Old English Form:** `*sēk-ijiþ` -> `*sēċiþ` -> **`sēceþ`** (or `sēċeþ`). (This is the 3rd p. sg. of the verb `sēcan` 'to seek').\n\n**C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkijiþ`.\n*   **Loss of `*j`:** In Pre-Old High German, the glide `*j` was lost very early when it followed a heavy syllable (like the long vowel in `*sōk-`). This loss occurred *before* the process of i-umlaut took full effect. Therefore, the root vowel `*ō` is not fronted.\n*   **OHG Diphthongization:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. So, `*sōk-` -> `*suok-`.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This is the key change differentiating High German. The voiceless stop `*k` is shifted. When it appears between vowels (as in `*suok-i-`), it becomes a voiceless fricative `*hh` (`/xx/`), spelled `<hh>` or `<ch>`.\n*   **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-it` in Old High German.\n*   **Final Old High German Form:** Putting the pieces together: `*suok-` + `*hh` + `-it` gives **`suohhit`**. (This is the 3rd p. sg. of the verb `suohhen` 'to seek').\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijiþ* (or *sōkiþ*); **Old Norse:** *sœkir*; **Old English:** *sēceþ* (or *sēċeþ*); **Old High German:** *suohhit*.>>>"
