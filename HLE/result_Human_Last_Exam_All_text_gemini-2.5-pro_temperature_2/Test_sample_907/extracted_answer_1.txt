a) For the case of negligible interaction, the absorption cross-section is given by the sum of contributions from each independent molecule, resulting in an absorption peak at the single-molecule transition frequency $\omega_{eg}$ with an intensity proportional to the number of molecules $N$:
$\sigma_a(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega |\vec{\mu}|^2}{3\hbar c \epsilon_0} \delta(\omega - \omega_{eg})$

b) When near-neighbor interactions ($J$) are included, delocalized Frenkel exciton states are formed. Due to an optical selection rule, only the $k=0$ exciton state is optically active. This concentrates the entire absorption strength into a single peak, shifted from the monomer frequency:
$\sigma_b(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega |\vec{\mu}|^2}{3\hbar c \epsilon_0} \delta\left(\omega - \left(\omega_{eg} + \frac{2J}{\hbar}\right)\right)$
where $\vec{\mu}$ is the single-molecule transition dipole moment.
