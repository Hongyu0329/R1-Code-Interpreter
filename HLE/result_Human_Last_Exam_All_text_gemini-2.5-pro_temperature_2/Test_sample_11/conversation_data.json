    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first piece of legislation passed in the modern State of Israel (i.e., from 1948 onwards) that contained the explicit term \"good faith\".\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **\"Statute in the modern State of Israel\":** This refers to a law passed by the Israeli Knesset after the establishment of the state in May 1948. This can include entirely new legislation or Knesset-approved consolidations and translations of pre-state (British Mandate) law into Hebrew, known as a \"New Version\" (*Nusach Hadash*).\n    *   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The statute must contain the literal phrase for \"good faith\" in its text. In Hebrew, this phrase is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). A law that merely implies a duty of fairness without using this specific term would not qualify.\n\n3.  **Survey of Potential Candidates:**\n    *   A common misconception might point to the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing good faith as a general, overarching principle in Israeli civil law through its sections 12 (duty to act in good faith in negotiations) and 39 (duty to act in good faith in the performance of a contract). However, the year 1973 suggests it might not be the *first*.\n    *   Searching for earlier statutes reveals several other instances. The **Land Law, 1969**, uses the term \"purchaser in good faith\" in section 10. This predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   Going back further, the **Agency Law, 1965**, imposes a duty on an agent to act with loyalty and in good faith (section 8). This is earlier than the Land Law.\n    *   The **Standard Contracts Law, 1964**, also mentions acting \"in good faith\" in the context of certain legal defenses (section 13). This is earlier still.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Earliest Statute:** The search for the earliest instance requires looking at legislation from the first decade of the state. During this period, Israel was still operating largely under the British Mandate laws it had inherited, but the Knesset was beginning the process of replacing or re-issuing them as Israeli statutes.\n\n5.  **The \"New Version\" Statutes:** The Knesset created \"New Versions\" (*Nusach Hadash*) of many important Mandate-era ordinances. These were official Hebrew-language restatements of the law, passed by the authority of the Knesset, and thus count as statutes of the State of Israel.\n\n6.  **The Correct Answer:** The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**, is one such statute. It is the official Israeli version of the Mandate-era law on checks and other negotiable instruments. Section 28 of this ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who takes a bill of exchange, among other conditions, \"in good faith\" (*be'tom-lev*). Enacted in 1957, this statute predates all the other major civil laws mentioned above (Standard Contracts Law of 1964, Agency Law of 1965, Land Law of 1969, and Contracts Law of 1973). Therefore, it stands as the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly use the term \"good faith\".\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question is about the *explicit* mention of the term, not the introduction of the underlying legal idea, which existed in sources like English equity law that were absorbed into Israeli law prior to any specific statute.\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Popularize\":** The Bills of Exchange Ordinance *introduced* the term into Israel's statutory books. The later Contracts Law *popularized* it and elevated it to a foundational principle of the entire legal system.\n*   **\"New Version\" Status:** It's crucial to understand that a \"New Version\" is not just a translation but a formal act of the legislature, making it a statute of the State of Israel.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
