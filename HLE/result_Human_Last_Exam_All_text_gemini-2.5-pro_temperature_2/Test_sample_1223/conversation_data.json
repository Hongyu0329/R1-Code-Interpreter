    "Answering this question requires combining several deep results from continuum theory. Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a key example.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $M$, the composant of $p$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $M$ that contain $p$. For a decomposable continuum, there is only one composant, the entire space. For a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, there are uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) distinct composants.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the maximal compactification of $Y$.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** For a locally compact, non-compact space $Y$, the remainder is the set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, so the remainder is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of the Remainder**\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the topological structure of the remainder $R$. A crucial result by the mathematician J. T. Rogers, Jr., connects the structure of this remainder to a property of the original continuum $X$ called aposyndesis.\n\n    *   **Aposyndesis:** A continuum $X$ is said to be *aposyndetic* at a point $x$ if for every other point $y \\in X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, there exists a subcontinuum $M$ in $X$ such that $x$ is in the interior of $M$ and $y$ is not in $M$ ($x \\in \\text{int}(M)$ and $y \\notin M$). If this condition fails for some $y$, $X$ is *non-aposyndetic* at $x$.\n\n    The structure of the remainder $R$ depends on whether $X$ is aposyndetic at the point $x$. There are two possibilities:\n\n    *   **Case 1: $X$ is aposyndetic at $x$.** In this case, the remainder $R$ is a single, non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **Case 2: $X$ is non-aposyndetic at $x$.** In this case, the remainder $R$ consists of exactly two disjoint, non-degenerate, indecomposable continua.\n\n    Both cases are possible.\n    *   An example for Case 1 is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a hereditary indecomposable continuum that is *aposyndetic* at every point. Thus, if $X$ is the pseudo-arc, for any $x \\in X$, the remainder $R$ will be a single indecomposable continuum.\n    *   An example for Case 2 is a **Cook continuum**. There exist hereditary indecomposable continua (constructed by H. Cook) that are *non-aposyndetic* at every one of their points. If $X$ is such a continuum, then for any $x \\in X$, the remainder $R$ will have two components.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Composants in Each Case**\n    The question asks for the number of *composants* of the remainder $R$. We must determine this number for each of the two possible structures of $R$.\n\n    *   **Number of Composants in Case 1:** The remainder $R$ is a single, non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum. A fundamental theorem of continuum theory states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many pairwise disjoint composants. The cardinality of this set of a composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n    *   **Number of Composants in Case 2:** The remainder $R$ is the union of two disjoint continua, say $R = K_1 \\cup K_2$. In this case, $K_1$ and $K_2$ are both proper subcontinua of $R$. Since $R$ can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, it is, by definition, a *decomposable* continuum. A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant, which is the entire space itself.\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum Possible Number**\n    From our analysis, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder can be either:\n    *   $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (if $R$ is a single indecomposable continuum)\n    *   1 (if $R$ is the union of two disjoint continua, making it decomposable)\n\n    The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of a composants. Comparing the two possible outcomes, the maximum is clearly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder depends on the choice of the hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ and the point $x$. If the remainder is indecomposable (e.g., when $X$ is the pseudo-arc), it has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. If the remainder is decomposable (e.g., when $X$ is a Cook continuum which is non-aposyndetic at $x$), it has 1 composant. The maximum of these possible values is $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
