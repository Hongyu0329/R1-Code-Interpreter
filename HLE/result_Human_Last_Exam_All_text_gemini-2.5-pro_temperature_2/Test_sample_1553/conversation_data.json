    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the novel and its main character.**\nThe novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Polish author Jacek Dukaj. The main character, or protagonist, is Adam Zamoyski.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the central relationship in the novel.**\nAdam Zamoyski's most significant and developed relationship in the story is with a character named Angelika Angle. She is an \"ink\" (a being of pure information), and she acts as Adam's guide and partner in the complex far-future world he has been resurrected into.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the concept of \"marriage\" within the book's context.**\nThe world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a post-singularity, posthuman reality where human concepts like marriage do not directly translate. There is no traditional marriage ceremony for Adam Zamoyski. The term \"marries\" must be interpreted thematically rather than literally.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the union that serves as the equivalent of a marriage.**\nThe relationship between Adam and Angelika evolves from guide-and-subject to a deep, romantic, and symbiotic partnership. The climax of their relationship arc involves a profound union or fusion, merging their beings in a way that is far more intimate and binding than a traditional marriage. This ultimate partnership is the functional and thematic equivalent of marriage within the story's narrative.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity of the partner.**\nGiven that Angelika Angle is the character with whom the protagonist, Adam Zamoyski, forms this ultimate, life-defining bond, she is the correct answer to the question.\n\n<<<Angelika Angle>>>"
