    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, can be found by calculating the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\nThe polynomial is given by\n$$ P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) $$\nWe can simplify the term in the product:\n$1+y+y^2+y^3 = (1+y)(1+y^2)$.\nLetting $y_i = x^{3^i}$, the polynomial is\n$$ P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) $$\nLet's define $A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$ and $B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$, so that $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\nThe quantity we want is the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$, which we denote by $[P(x)P(x^{-1})]_0$.\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = A(x)B(x)A(x^{-1})B(x^{-1}) = [A(x)A(x^{-1})][B(x)B(x^{-1})]$.\nLet $Q_A(x) = A(x)A(x^{-1})$ and $Q_B(x) = B(x)B(x^{-1})$. We need to find the constant term of $Q_A(x)Q_B(x)$.\n$Q_A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})$.\n$Q_B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{2\\cdot 3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot 3^i})$.\n\nA term in the expansion of $Q_A(x)$ is formed by choosing one term from each factor $(2+x^{3^i}+x^{-3^i})$. This gives a term of the form $c_A \\cdot x^{\\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\epsilon_i 3^i}$, where $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The coefficient $c_A$ is the product of coefficients chosen from each factor, which is 2 for a constant and 1 for $x^{\\pm 3^i}$.\nSimilarly, a term in $Q_B(x)$ is of the form $c_B \\cdot x^{\\sum_{i=0}^{19} 2\\delta_i 3^i}$, where $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\nThe constant term of $Q_A(x)Q_B(x)$ is the sum of products of coefficients of terms $x^K$ from $Q_A(x)$ and $x^{-K}$ from $Q_B(x)$. So we need to find exponents $K$ which are common to both expansions.\nAn exponent from $Q_A(x)$ is $K_A = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\epsilon_i 3^i$ and from $Q_B(x)$ is $K_B = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\delta_i (2 \\cdot 3^i)$.\nFor the product to have a constant term, we must have $\\sum \\epsilon_i 3^i + \\sum 2\\delta_i 3^i = 0$, which can be written as $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} (\\epsilon_i + 2\\delta_i)3^i = 0$.\nThis equation can be satisfied non-trivially, making direct summation difficult.\n\nLet's use an alternative approach. The problem has a structure amenable to a transfer matrix method.\nLet $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$. The value $S$ is the sum of coefficients of terms whose exponents sum to 0 in the product of $Q_A(x)$ and $Q_B(x)$.\nThis leads to the equation $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} (\\epsilon_i + 2\\delta_i)3^i=0$, where $\\epsilon_i, \\delta_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\nThis implies $\\sum \\epsilon_i 3^i = -2 \\sum \\delta_i 3^i$.\nA number has a unique balanced ternary representation (base 3 with digits $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\nLet $E = \\sum \\epsilon_i 3^i$ and $K = \\sum \\delta_i 3^i$. Both $E$ and $K$ have unique balanced ternary representations given by the sequences $(\\epsilon_i)$ and $(\\delta_i)$.\nThe equation is $E = -2K$. Also $-2K = K - 3K = \\sum \\delta_i 3^i - \\sum \\delta_i 3^{i+1} = \\sum (\\delta_i - \\delta_{i-1})3^i$ (assuming $\\delta_{-1}=\\delta_{20}=0$).\nBy uniqueness of representation, we must have $\\epsilon_i = \\delta_i - \\delta_{i-1}$ for $i=0,...,19$, and $\\delta_{19}=0$ ensures the largest power matches.\nSince $\\epsilon_i$ must be in $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, we must have $|\\delta_i - \\delta_{i-1}| \\le 1$.\nAs $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$, this forbids transitions from $-1$ to $1$ and from $1$ to $-1$ for the sequence of $\\delta_i$.\nThe total sum of squares is a sum over all valid sequences $\\delta = (\\delta_{-1}, \\delta_0, ..., \\delta_{19})$ where $\\delta_{-1}=0, \\delta_{19}=0$ and $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ with $|\\delta_i - \\delta_{i-1}| \\le 1$.\nThe term for a given sequence is $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (\\text{coeff for }\\epsilon_i)(\\text{coeff for }\\delta_i)$.\nThe coefficient for choosing $x^{\\epsilon_i 3^i}$ is $c(\\epsilon_i) = (2 \\text{ if } \\epsilon_i=0 \\text{ else } 1)$.\nThe coefficient for choosing $x^{2\\delta_i 3^i}$ is $c(\\delta_i) = (2 \\text{ if } \\delta_i=0 \\text{ else } 1)$.\nThe sum is over paths of length 20, starting and ending at state 0. Let the states be $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\nThe weight of a transition from state $a=\\delta_{i-1}$ to $b=\\delta_i$ is $W_{ab} = c(b-a)c(b)$.\nLet's build the transition matrix $T$, with rows indexed by $a$ and columns by $b$ (for states -1, 0, 1):\n$T_{a,b} = W_{a,b}$ if $|b-a|\\le 1$, and 0 otherwise.\n$T_{-1,-1}=c(0)c(-1)=2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n$T_{-1,0}=c(1)c(0)=1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n$T_{-1,1}=0$ (invalid transition).\n$T_{0,-1}=c(-1)c(-1)=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$T_{0,0}=c(0)c(0)=2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n$T_{0,1}=c(1)c(1)=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$T_{1,-1}=0$ (invalid transition).\n$T_{1,0}=c(-1)c(0)=1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n$T_{1,1}=c(0)c(1)=2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\nThe matrix is $T=\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 4 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe total sum is the central element of $T^{20}$, corresponding to paths of length 20 from state 0 to state 0.\nLet $v_n$ be the number of weighted paths of length $n$ ending at state 0. $u_n$ (ending at -1), $w_n$ (ending at 1).\nInitial state is $(u_0, v_0, w_0) = (0, 1, 0)$.\nThe recurrence relations are:\n$u_{n+1} = 2u_n+v_n$\n$v_{n+1} = 2u_n+4v_n+2w_n$\n$w_{n+1} = v_n+2w_n$\nBy symmetry, $u_n=w_n$.\n$v_{n+1} = 4u_n+4v_n$, so $u_n = (v_{n+1}-4v_n)/4$.\n$u_{n+1} = 2u_n+v_n \\implies (v_{n+2}-4v_{n+1})/4 = 2(v_{n+1}-4v_n)/4 + v_n$.\n$v_{n+2}-4v_{n+1} = 2v_{n+1}-8v_n+4v_n = 2v_{n+1}-4v_n$.\n$v_{n+2} - 6v_{n+1} + 4v_n = 0$.\nThe characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 4 = 0$, with roots $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-16}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$.\nThe general solution is $v_n = A(3+\\sqrt{5})^n + B(3-\\sqrt{5})^n$.\nThe initial conditions are $v_0=1$ and $v_1 = 4u_0+4v_0=4(0)+4(1)=4$.\nFor $n=0$: $A+B=1$.\nFor $n=1$: $A(3+\\sqrt{5}) + B(3-\\sqrt{5}) = 4$.\n$3(A+B) + \\sqrt{5}(A-B) = 3+\\sqrt{5}(A-B) = 4 \\implies \\sqrt{5}(A-B)=1 \\implies A-B=1/\\sqrt{5}$.\nSolving for $A,B$: $A = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})$, $B = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})$.\nWe need to find $v_{20}$.\n$v_{20} = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})(3+\\sqrt{5})^{20} + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})(3-\\sqrt{5})^{20}$.\nLet $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ be the golden ratio. $3+\\sqrt{5}=2\\phi^2$ and $3-\\sqrt{5}=2\\phi^{-2}$.\n$v_{20} = \\frac{1}{2} (1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})(2\\phi^2)^{20} + \\frac{1}{2} (1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})(2\\phi^{-2})^{20}$\n$v_{20} = \\frac{2^{20}}{2} \\left[ (1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})\\phi^{40} + (1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}})\\phi^{-40} \\right]$\n$v_{20} = 2^{19} \\left[ (\\phi^{40}+\\phi^{-40}) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}(\\phi^{40}-\\phi^{-40}) \\right]$.\nUsing the definitions for Lucas numbers, $L_n=\\phi^n+(-\\phi)^{-n}$, and Fibonacci numbers, $F_n = \\frac{\\phi^n-(-\\phi)^{-n}}{\\sqrt{5}}$:\nFor even index 40, $L_{40} = \\phi^{40}+\\phi^{-40}$ and $F_{40}=\\frac{\\phi^{40}-\\phi^{-40}}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nSo, $v_{20} = 2^{19}(L_{40}+F_{40})$."
