    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process.\n*   In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons) as it passes through a suitable nonlinear optical medium.\n*   The fundamental physical requirement for this process to occur is that the medium must possess a significant **second-order nonlinear susceptibility**, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**. This tensor quantity describes how the material polarizes in response to the square of the incident electric field.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Requirement for a Non-Zero χ⁽²⁾**\n\n*   A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics dictates that the second-order susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is non-zero only in materials that **lack inversion symmetry**.\n*   Inversion symmetry (or centrosymmetry) means that the crystal structure looks identical if you invert it through a central point (i.e., for every atom at a position `(x, y, z)` relative to a center, there is an identical atom at `(-x, -y, -z)`).\n*   If a material possesses inversion symmetry, its bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Consequently, second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are forbidden in such materials.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Material: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) allotropes of boron, analogous to graphene.\n*   To determine if borophene can exhibit SPDC, we must analyze its crystal structure to see if it possesses inversion symmetry.\n*   Borophene can exist in several different structural phases (polymorphs), such as the commonly studied β₁₂ and χ₃ phases.\n*   Let's examine the symmetry of these ideal, planar structures. The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric. For instance, the β₁₂ phase has the space group Pmmm, and the χ₃ phase has Cmmm. Both of these space groups have a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Draw a Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ requires the material's crystal structure to lack inversion symmetry.\n3.  Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) have a centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n4.  Therefore, the intrinsic bulk (in-plane) χ⁽²⁾ of borophene is zero.\n5.  This means that the primary mechanism for SPDC is absent in ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The analysis assumes an ideal, defect-free, flat, and perfectly crystalline nanosheet. In practice, defects, vacancies, strain, or ripples (out-of-plane buckling) could locally break the inversion symmetry. This might lead to a very weak, localized SPDC signal, but it is not an intrinsic property of the material and would be highly inefficient compared to non-centrosymmetric crystals.\n*   **\"Free-standing\" is key:** The question specifies \"free-standing.\" If the borophene were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the symmetry of the overall system, potentially enabling a nonlinear response. The \"free-standing\" condition rules out this possibility.\n*   **Higher-order effects:** While the dominant electric-dipole-based SPDC is forbidden, extremely weak processes related to electric-quadrupole or magnetic-dipole interactions might exist in principle, but they are generally negligible and not what is typically meant by SPDC.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the material's fundamental properties, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that their crystal structure possesses inversion symmetry, which makes their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) zero, forbidding the process.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion because their crystal structure is centrosymmetric, resulting in a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a prerequisite for this process.>>>"
