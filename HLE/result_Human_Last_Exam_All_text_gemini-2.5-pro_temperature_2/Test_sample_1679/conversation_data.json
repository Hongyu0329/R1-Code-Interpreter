    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Components of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for three specific things:\n1.  The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must be the *first* such winner chronologically to meet the criteria.\n3.  It must depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on-screen.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Luxor Obelisk\"**\n\nIt's crucial to understand what a \"Luxor Obelisk\" is. There are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\nTherefore, the film could feature a scene in either Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt, to qualify.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners**\n\nWe will examine the winners in chronological order, looking for films set in or featuring scenes in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1920s - 1930s:**\n    *   *Wings* (1927/1928): Set partially in France during WWI, but it does not feature a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937): Set in Paris, but the key outdoor scenes are not filmed at the Place de la Concorde. There is no clear depiction of the obelisk.\n    *   Other winners from this era (*The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Gone with the Wind*, etc.) are not set in the required locations.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   *Casablanca* (1943): This film features famous flashback scenes set in Paris. However, these scenes primarily show the Arc de Triomphe and shots along the Seine. The Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are not shown.\n    *   The other winners of the 1940s (*Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Mrs. Miniver*, *The Best Years of Our Lives*, etc.) do not have scenes in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1950s:**\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This is a very strong candidate. The film is a musical love letter to the city of Paris and features numerous landmarks. The Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk as its centerpiece, is clearly and beautifully depicted, particularly during the film's long, climactic ballet sequence. This is the first definitive, on-screen depiction among the Best Picture winners.\n\n*   **Subsequent Winners:**\n    *   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956): This film features scenes in both Paris and Egypt. It shows the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk. However, its release year (1956) is after *An American in Paris* (1951).\n    *   *Gigi* (1958): This film is also set in Paris and shows many cityscapes, but it too comes after 1951.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAfter a chronological review, while earlier films were set in Paris, there is no clear and confirmed on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk. The first film to win Best Picture that definitively and memorably shows the Luxor Obelisk (the one located in the Place de la Concorde) is *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
