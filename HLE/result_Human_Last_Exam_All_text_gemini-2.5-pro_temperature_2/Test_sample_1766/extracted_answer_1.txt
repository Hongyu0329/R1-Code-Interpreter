For the state j = 3/2, the eigenvalues of J² is (15/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ, -(3/2)ħ.
For the state j = 1/2, the eigenvalues of J² is (3/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ.
In summary, the common eigenvalue pairs (Eigenvalue of J², Eigenvalue of Jz) are:
( (15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ ), ( (15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ ), ( (15/4)ħ², -(1/2)ħ ), ( (15/4)ħ², -(3/2)ħ ),
( (3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ ), ( (3/4)ħ², -(1/2)ħ ).
