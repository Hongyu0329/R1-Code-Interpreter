    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Purpose:** The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is designed to find the base-`c` representation of a non-negative integer `n`. It works by repeatedly dividing the number `n` by the base `c` and recording the remainders as the digits of the new representation.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Dominant Operation:** The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop (Step 2). The total running time will be primarily determined by how many times this loop executes and what operations are performed inside it.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as the variable `q` is greater than 0.\n    *   In the first step, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, the variable `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that in each iteration, the value that is used to calculate the next quotient is effectively divided by `c`.\n    *   The loop will terminate when `n` has been divided by `c` enough times that the result (`q`) is 0.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The value of `q` after `k` iterations will be approximately `n / c^(k+1)`. The loop stops when this value becomes 0, which happens when `n / c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`.\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the number of iterations is of the order `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop:**\n    *   Within each iteration of the `while` loop, the following operations are performed:\n        *   `i := i + 1`: one increment (addition).\n        *   `x := q`: one assignment.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: one division and one floor operation.\n        *   `a_i := x - qc`: one multiplication and one subtraction.\n    *   In standard computational models (like the unit-cost RAM model), these basic arithmetic operations are assumed to take constant time, i.e., O(1).\n    *   Therefore, the total work done inside each iteration of the loop is constant.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Cost of Operations Outside the Loop:**\n    *   Step 1 (initialization) involves a fixed number of operations: assignment, division, multiplication, and subtraction. This takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   Step 3 (return) is also a constant time operation, O(1).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Total Time Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the sum of the time for initialization, the time for all loop iterations, and the time for the return statement.\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations × Time per Iteration) + (Time for Step 3)\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1) + O(1)\n    *   T(n) = O(log_c(n))\n\n7.  **Final Simplification:** In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm does not affect the asymptotic class because logarithms of different bases differ only by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`). Since `c` is a constant `(c ≥ 2)`, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, we can simplify `O(log_c(n))` to `O(log n)`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The analysis depends on the magnitude of the input integer `n`.\n*   The base `c` is treated as a constant.\n*   The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numbers the size of `n` or smaller can be done in constant time. This is a standard assumption unless a specific bit-complexity model is required.\n*   The number of iterations is directly related to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
