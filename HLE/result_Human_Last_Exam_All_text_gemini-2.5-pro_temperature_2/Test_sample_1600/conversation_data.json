    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question\nThe question asks for a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n\n*   **Order 2n**: In QED, the order of a diagram is typically determined by the number of vertices, which corresponds to the power of the coupling constant. A diagram with `V` vertices is of order `V/2` in the fine-structure constant Î±. The number of loops `L` in a propagator diagram is equal to this order. Therefore, a diagram of order 2n in the problem statement corresponds to a diagram with `2n` vertices and `L = n` loops.\n*   **a(3)**: We need to find the number of diagrams for n=3. This means we are looking for diagrams with `2*3 = 6` vertices, which corresponds to `L = 3` loops.\n*   **Electron or Photon Propagators**: These are two-point function diagrams, representing the propagation of a particle. It's a known property in QED that the number of topologically distinct self-energy diagrams is the same for both the electron and the photon at any given loop order.\n*   **Non-vanishing Feynman diagrams**: This means we count all topologically distinct, connected diagrams that contribute a non-zero value. This includes both one-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams and reducible diagrams.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposing the problem\nAny connected propagator diagram is either:\n1.  **One-Particle Irreducible (1PI)**: The diagram cannot be split into two separate pieces by cutting a single internal propagator line.\n2.  **Reducible**: The diagram can be split by cutting a single internal line. A reducible diagram is essentially a chain of two or more 1PI diagrams.\n\nThe total number of diagrams for `n` loops, `a(n)`, is the sum of the number of `n`-loop 1PI diagrams and the number of `n`-loop reducible diagrams.\n`a(n) = (Number of n-loop 1PI diagrams) + (Number of n-loop reducible diagrams)`\n\nLet `I_n` be the number of topologically distinct 1PI diagrams with `n` loops.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the number of 1PI diagrams\nThe number of 1PI QED self-energy diagrams at low loop orders is a known result from quantum field theory literature.\n*   For `n=1` (1 loop, 2 vertices): There is **1** diagram. So, `I_1 = 1`.\n*   For `n=2` (2 loops, 4 vertices): There are **2** diagrams (the \"nested/rainbow\" and \"overlapping/crossed\" diagrams). So, `I_2 = 2`.\n*   For `n=3` (3 loops, 6 vertices): The number of diagrams has been calculated and is known to be **7**. So, `I_3 = 7`.\n\n### Step 4: Enumerating all diagrams for n=3\nWe need to find `a(3)`, the total number of 3-loop diagrams. A 3-loop diagram can be a single 3-loop 1PI diagram, or a reducible diagram composed of lower-loop 1PI parts whose loop numbers sum to 3. This corresponds to the integer partitions of 3.\n\nThe partitions of 3 are:\n1.  `(3)`\n2.  `(2, 1)`\n3.  `(1, 1, 1)`\n\nWe calculate the number of diagrams for each partition:\n\n1.  **Partition (3)**: This represents a single 1PI diagram with 3 loops.\n    *   The number of such diagrams is `I_3 = 7`.\n\n2.  **Partition (2, 1)**: This represents a reducible diagram formed by chaining one 2-loop 1PI diagram and one 1-loop 1PI diagram.\n    *   Number of 2-loop 1PI diagram types: `I_2 = 2`.\n    *   Number of 1-loop 1PI diagram types: `I_1 = 1`.\n    *   To form a diagram, we pick one of each type and connect them. The number of distinct resulting topologies is the product `I_2 * I_1`.\n    *   Number of diagrams = `2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n3.  **Partition (1, 1, 1)**: This represents a reducible diagram formed by chaining three 1-loop 1PI diagrams.\n    *   Number of 1-loop 1PI diagram types: `I_1 = 1`.\n    *   Since there is only one type of 1-loop 1PI diagram, there is only one way to chain three of them together.\n    *   Number of diagrams = `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the final answer\nThe total number of 3-loop diagrams, `a(3)`, is the sum of the diagrams from all possible partitions.\n\n`a(3) = (Diagrams from partition 3) + (Diagrams from partition 2,1) + (Diagrams from partition 1,1,1)`\n`a(3) = 7 + 2 + 1`\n`a(3) = 10`\n\nThus, there are 10 non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 (3 loops) for the electron or photon propagators in QED.\n\n<<<10>>>"
