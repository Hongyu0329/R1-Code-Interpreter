    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nFirst, let's write out each function explicitly by substituting the previous one.\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1`\n\nWe need to identify the form of the integrand, which is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Recognizing the integrand's form.**\nThe integrand is a classic form `u'(x)/u(x)`, where `u(x) = F₃(x)`. The antiderivative (indefinite integral) of `u'(x)/u(x)` is `ln|u(x)|`.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is the antiderivative evaluated at the limits of integration:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1`\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze `F₃(x)` to handle the absolute value**\n\nLet's determine if `F₃(x)` is positive or negative in the interval `x ∈ [0, 1]`.\n*   For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is in the interval `[sin(0), sin(1)]`, which is `[0, sin(1)]`. Since `sin(1)` (in radians) is approximately 0.84, `sin(x)` is positive.\n*   `e^(sin(x))` will be in the interval `[e⁰, e^(sin(1))]`, which is `[1, e^(sin(1))]`. This is always positive.\n*   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` will be greater than or equal to `ln(2)`. Since `ln(2)` is positive (approx. 0.693), `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Justifying the removal of the absolute value.**\nSince `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can also be written as:\n`V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`**\n\n*   **Calculate `F₃(0)`:**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n    Since `sin(0) = 0` and `e⁰ = 1`:\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n*   **Calculate `F₃(1)`:**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Careful Point 3: Use radians for the trigonometric function.**\nThe argument of the sine function is `1`, which is assumed to be in radians unless degrees are specified.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final numerical value `V`**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the equation for `V`.\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nNow, we use a calculator to find the numerical value.\n1.  `sin(1)` ≈ 0.841471\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.841471` ≈ 2.319777\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.319777\n4.  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(3.319777)` ≈ 1.200020\n5.  `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.693147\n\nNow substitute these values back into the expression for `V`:\n`V = ln(1.200020) - ln(0.693147)`\n`V ≈ 0.182337 - (-0.366513)`\n`V ≈ 0.182337 + 0.366513`\n`V ≈ 0.54885`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final result**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54885`\n`10000 * V ≈ 5488.5`\n\n**Careful Point 4: Correctly round to the nearest integer.**\nThe number is `5488.5`. Standard rounding rules dictate that a value ending in `.5` is rounded up to the next integer.\nThe closest integer to `5488.5` is `5489`.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
