    "An analysis of the problem of finding the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves with a good-reduction Jacobian involves several key concepts from arithmetic geometry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup**\n\n*   We are given a smooth, projective, geometrically connected curve $C$ of genus $g=4$ over a complete discretely valued field $K$.\n*   The Jacobian variety $J = \\text{Jac}(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension 4.\n*   The condition \"the Jacobian has good reduction\" means its Néron model over the valuation ring $R \\subset K$ is an abelian scheme. This means the special fiber of the Néron model is an abelian variety over the residue field $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Jacobian reduction to the curve's stable reduction**\n\n*   The Deligne-Mumford stable reduction theorem ensures that, after a possible finite extension of the field $K$, the curve $C$ has a stable model $\\mathcal{C}$. The special fiber of this model, $\\mathcal{C}_k$, is a stable curve of arithmetic genus 4.\n*   A fundamental result by Raynaud connects the special fiber of the Jacobian's Néron model, $\\mathcal{J}_k$, to the Picard group of the special fiber of the curve's stable model, $\\mathcal{C}_k$. The relationship is given by the sequence:\n    $0 \\to T \\to \\text{Pic}^0(\\mathcal{C}_k) \\to \\mathcal{J}_k \\to 0$\n    where $T$ is an algebraic torus whose dimension is the first Betti number of the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathcal{C}_k$, i.e., $\\dim(T) = h^1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Since the Jacobian has good reduction, $\\mathcal{J}_k$ is a pure abelian variety. This forces the torus part $T$ of the semi-abelian variety $\\text{Pic}^0(\\mathcal{C}_k)$ to be trivial.\n*   For the torus $T$ to be trivial, its dimension must be zero. This means $h^1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   A connected graph has a first Betti number of zero if and only if it is a tree. Therefore, the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of the stable reduction $\\mathcal{C}_k$ must be a tree.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nThe special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is a connected, stable curve of arithmetic genus 4 whose dual graph $\\Gamma$ is a tree.\n\n*   **Genus Formula**: The arithmetic genus of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is given by $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = h^1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) + \\sum_{v \\in V(\\Gamma)} g(C_v)$, where $g(C_v)$ is the geometric genus of the component corresponding to the vertex $v$. Since $h^1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the formula simplifies to:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V(\\Gamma)} g(C_v) = g = 4$.\n    This means the sum of the geometric genera of the irreducible components of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ must be 4.\n\n*   **Stability Condition**: For $\\mathcal{C}_k$ to be a stable curve, its components must satisfy certain conditions related to how they intersect:\n    *   Any smooth rational component (genus 0, i.e., $g(C_v)=0$) must meet the other components in at least 3 points. In terms of the dual graph, the degree of a vertex $v$ with $g(v)=0$ must be at least 3.\n    *   Any smooth elliptic component (genus 1, i.e., $g(C_v)=1$) must meet the other components in at least 1 point. In the dual graph, the degree of a vertex $v$ with $g(v)=1$ must be at least 1. This condition is automatically satisfied for any vertex in a connected tree, except for the trivial tree with one vertex (which won't be genus 1 as the total genus is 4).\n\n**Step 4: Systematically list and count the possible types**\n\nWe classify the types of stable reductions based on the number of components ($|V(\\Gamma)|$), their genera, and the structure of the connecting tree, subject to the stability conditions. A \"type\" is a unique combination of a tree structure and a labeling of its vertices by genera.\n\nLet $n_g$ be the number of components of genus $g$. The classification proceeds by the number of rational components ($n_0$). We found that $n_0$ cannot be greater than 2.\n\n**Case 1: No rational components ($n_0 = 0$)**\nThe sum of the genera of the components is 4. The components all have genus $\\ge 1$.\n1.  **1 component**: The partition of 4 is {4}. The graph is a single vertex. A smooth genus 4 curve. (1 type)\n2.  **2 components**: The partitions of 4 are {3,1} and {2,2}. The tree is a single edge.\n    *   Genera {3,1}: A genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve connected at one node. (1 type)\n    *   Genera {2,2}: Two genus 2 curves connected at one node. (1 type)\n3.  **3 components**: The partition of 4 must be {2,1,1}. The tree is a path of length 2.\n    *   Genus 2 component is in the center, flanked by two genus 1 components. (1 type)\n    *   Genus 2 component is at an end, connected to a central genus 1 component. (1 type)\n4.  **4 components**: The partition of 4 must be {1,1,1,1}. There are two trees on 4 vertices.\n    *   The path graph $P_4$: A chain of four elliptic curves. (1 type)\n    *   The star graph $K_{1,3}$: A central elliptic curve connected to three others. (1 type)\nTotal for $n_0 = 0$: $1+1+1+2+2 = 7$ types.\n\n**Case 2: One rational component ($n_0 = 1$)**\nThe sum of the genera of the other components is 4. The rational component corresponds to a vertex with degree $\\ge 3$.\n5.  **4 components in total**: Genera must be {2,1,1,0}. The tree must have a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. The only tree on 4 vertices that does is the star graph $K_{1,3}$. The genus 0 component must be the center. (1 type)\n6.  **5 components in total**: Genera must be {1,1,1,1,0}. The tree must have a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. There are two such trees on 5 vertices.\n    *   Star graph $K_{1,4}$: Genus 0 component at the center (degree 4). (1 type)\n    *   Tree with degree sequence (3,2,1,1,1): Genus 0 component at the degree 3 vertex. (1 type)\nTotal for $n_0 = 1$: $1+2 = 3$ types.\n\n**Case 3: Two rational components ($n_0 = 2$)**\nThe sum of the genera of the other components is 4. The two rational components correspond to vertices with degree $\\ge 3$.\n7.  **6 components in total**: Genera must be {1,1,1,1,0,0}. We need a tree on 6 vertices with at least two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. The only such tree has degree sequence (3,3,1,1,1,1). The two genus 0 components must be the two vertices of degree 3. (1 type)\nTotal for $n_0 = 2$: 1 type.\n\n**Case 4: Three or more rational components ($n_0 \\ge 3$)**\nIt can be shown (e.g., by analyzing degree sum inequalities) that no such stable configuration exists.\n\n**Final Count**\nSumming the number of types from each case: $7 + 3 + 1 = 11$."
