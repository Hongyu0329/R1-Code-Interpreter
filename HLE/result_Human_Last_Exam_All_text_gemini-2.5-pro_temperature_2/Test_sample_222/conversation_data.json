    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. Let's define the sequences and DFTs involved:\n*   `x(n)` and `h(n)` are 4-point sequences (`n=0, 1, 2, 3`).\n*   `X(k) = DFT_4[x(n)] = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `H(k) = DFT_4[h(n)] = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. This is an 8-point sequence, `y(0)` through `y(7)`.\n*   We need to find `Y_4(k) = DFT_4[y(n)]`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence to its 8-point DFT\nFinding the N-point DFT of a 2N-point sequence is a known operation related to time-domain aliasing (or decimation).\n\nLet `y(n)` be the 8-point sequence. Its 4-point DFT, `Y_4(k)`, is defined as:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_4^{nk}` where `W_N = e^{-j*2*pi/N}`.\n\nWe can split the summation:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^{nk} + sum_{n=4}^{7} y(n) * W_4^{nk}`\n\nSince `W_4^{nk}` is periodic in `n` with period 4, we have `W_4^{(n+4)k} = W_4^{nk}`.\nLet `m = n-4` in the second sum. The sum becomes `sum_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^{(m+4)k} = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^{mk}`.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} [y(n) + y(n+4)] * W_4^{nk}`\n\nThis means that `Y_4(k)` is the 4-point DFT of the 4-point sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`.\n\nAnother key property of the DFT states that the DFT of this time-aliased sequence `z(n)` corresponds to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Let `Y_8(k) = DFT_8[y(n)]`. Then:\n`Y_4(k) = Y_8(2k)` for `k=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding the even-indexed terms of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`: `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` to the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`\nThe sequence `y(n)` is constructed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m=0,1,2,3`.\n*   The odd-indexed samples of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m=0,1,2,3`.\n\nThis is the standard structure for the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (DIT-FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y_8(k)` can be constructed from the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts (`X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively) using the following formulas:\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n    `Y_8(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    `Y_8(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the required terms of `Y_8(k)`\nWe need to calculate `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`.\n\n**Careful Point:** We need the values for `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^{-j*2*pi*2/8} = e^{-j*pi/2} = -j`\n\nNow let's compute each term.\n\n1.  **For `Y_8(0)`:**\n    Use the first formula with `k=0`.\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    `Y_8(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n2.  **For `Y_8(2)`:**\n    Use the first formula with `k=2`.\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    `Y_8(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n3.  **For `Y_8(4)`:**\n    Use the second formula with `k=0`.\n    `Y_8(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0)`\n    `Y_8(4) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n4.  **For `Y_8(6)`:**\n    Use the second formula with `k=2`.\n    `Y_8(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    `Y_8(6) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Assembly\nThe desired 4-point DFT, `Y_4(k)`, is composed of these calculated values:\n`Y_4(0) = Y_8(0) = 1`\n`Y_4(1) = Y_8(2) = -1 - j`\n`Y_4(2) = Y_8(4) = 1`\n`Y_4(3) = Y_8(6) = -1 + j`\n\nThus, the final 4-point DFT sequence is `{1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
