    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Question:**\n    *   **Film:** *Solaris* (1972) by Andrei Tarkovsky. It's important to specify this version, as it differs from Stanisław Lem's novel and the 2002 film adaptation.\n    *   **Character Action/Feeling:** A character expresses a specific feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This isn't just simple nostalgia; it's a more complex emotion involving shame and alienation.\n    *   **Objective:** Identify which character among the given options says or expresses this sentiment.\n\n2.  **Character Assessment and Likelihood:**\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins with him immersed in the nature surrounding his dacha (country home), complete with the sounds of rustling leaves and water. He is deeply connected to Earth. While he misses it profoundly, the specific sentiment of being *ashamed* to miss it is less characteristic of his direct, grief-driven character arc.\n    *   **B. Hari:** She is a \"Visitor\" or \"Guest,\" a recreation of Kris's dead wife by the Solaris ocean. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself, only those she derives from Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot miss something she never truly experienced.\n    *   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving crew members on the station when Kris arrives. He is weary, philosophical, and often drinks. He frequently engages Kris in long conversations about the purpose of their mission, the nature of humanity, and their disconnection from Earth. This personality type is a strong candidate for such a poignant and self-critical reflection.\n    *   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving crew member. He is cold, clinical, and relentlessly scientific in his approach. He views emotional responses as interference with his research. It is highly unlikely he would admit to such a sentimental feeling, let alone be ashamed of it. He is focused on studying and controlling the phenomenon of Solaris.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** A psychologist who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We see him only in a video recording he left for Kris. His message is a desperate warning about the \"Visitors\" and the moral crisis on the station. While he is in despair, the specific line about missing leaves is not part of his message.\n\n3.  **Locating the Specific Scene and Dialogue:**\n    *   The dialogue in question occurs during a key scene in the station's library. Kris, Snaut, Sartorius, and Hari have gathered. Snaut has been drinking and becomes particularly introspective.\n    *   In a rambling, philosophical monologue, Snaut reflects on their failed mission to understand the cosmos, suggesting that humanity only seeks a mirror for itself.\n    *   He then makes a very personal confession, recalling faint memories of Earth, specifically a garden and the sound of rustling leaves. He frames this sentimentality and longing not just as sadness, but as a source of shame—a weakness for a scientist who is supposed to be above such things, who has \"lost his cool\" in the face of the unknown.\n    *   He says (in translation): *\"We're in the unenviable position of people who've lost their cool. That's a cause for shame.\"* This is linked directly to his preceding memory of a garden and the rustling leaves he can no longer fully grasp. He is ashamed of this nostalgic vulnerability and the failure of scientific bravado it represents.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who expresses shame over missing the simple, terrestrial sound of rustling leaves is Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
