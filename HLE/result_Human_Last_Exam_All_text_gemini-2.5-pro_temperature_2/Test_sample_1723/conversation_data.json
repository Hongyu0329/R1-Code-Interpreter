    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known to produce a blue spore print.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a **single genus** of mushroom that is known for producing a **distinctly blue spore print**. A spore print is a key identification feature in mycology, made by placing a mushroom cap gills-down on a surface to collect the microscopic spores.\n\n**Step 2: Address Common Misconceptions**\nMany people confuse the color of the mushroom's body (fruiting body) with the color of its spore print. Several genera include species with blue bodies, but their spores are not blue. It's crucial to eliminate these common but incorrect candidates.\n\n*   **Genus *Lactarius* or *Lactifluus***: This genus includes the famous Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactifluus indigo*). This mushroom is a vibrant blue and even \"bleeds\" blue latex when cut. However, its spore print is a standard cream-to-yellowish color, not blue.\n*   **Genus *Entoloma***: This genus features some intensely blue species, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri* (the New Zealand Blue Mushroom). Despite its striking blue color, the entire *Entoloma* genus is characterized by its pink spore print.\n*   **Genus *Psilocybe***: The mushrooms in this genus are famous for their psychoactive properties and their tendency to bruise blue when damaged. This blue color is a chemical reaction, not the spore color. The spore print of *Psilocybe* species is purple-brown to dark purple-black.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate True Spore Print Colors**\nStandard mycological charts for gilled mushrooms list spore print colors as white, cream, yellow, pink, ochre, rusty-brown, olive-brown, purple-brown, and black. Noticeably, blue is absent from this list. This indicates that if such a genus exists, it is either extremely rare, not a typical gilled mushroom, or the color \"blue\" is used loosely.\n\n**Step 4: Search for the Obscure but Correct Answer**\nDeeper research into the broader fungal kingdom, beyond just gilled mushrooms, reveals a specific exception. The answer lies in a group of fungi known as **corticioid fungi**, or \"crust fungi.\"\n\n*   There is one specific genus of crust fungus that is scientifically documented as producing a spore deposit that is a shade of blue.\n*   The genus is **Byssocorticium**.\n*   Specifically, the species *Byssocorticium atrovirens* is noted by mycologists to produce a spore print described as \"pale greenish blue\" or \"pale sky blue.\"\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nWhile the question is slightly tricky because \"mushroom\" usually implies a cap-and-stem form and \"distinctly blue\" might be an overstatement for \"pale greenish blue,\" *Byssocorticium* is the only genus for which there is scientific evidence of a blue-tinged spore print. All other commonly suggested candidates are based on the incorrect assumption that the mushroom's body color matches its spore color. Therefore, based on factual evidence, *Byssocorticium* is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Byssocorticium>>>"
