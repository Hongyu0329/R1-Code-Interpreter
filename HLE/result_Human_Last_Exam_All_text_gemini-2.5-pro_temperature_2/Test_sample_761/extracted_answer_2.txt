No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are classified as nucleic acids. The fundamental reasons for this distinction are that (1) their monomers are nucleotides (composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base), not simple monosaccharides, and (2) these monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds to form a sugar-phosphate backbone, not by glycosidic bonds to form a chain of sugars.
