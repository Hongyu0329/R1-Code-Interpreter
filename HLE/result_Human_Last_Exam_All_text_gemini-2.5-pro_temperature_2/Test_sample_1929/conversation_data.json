    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Butadiene (1,3-butadiene):** The structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. It has four pi (π) electrons available for reaction.\n    *   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** The structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This molecule is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile (a \"diene-lover\") in a specific type of reaction. It has two pi (π) electrons available for reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Type of Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The \"4\" refers to the four π electrons of the diene, and the \"2\" refers to the two π electrons of the dienophile.\n    *   This reaction is concerted, meaning all bonds are broken and formed in a single step through a cyclic transition state. It is a powerful method for forming six-membered rings.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   For the reaction to occur, butadiene must adopt the less stable **s-cis conformation**, where the double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond. This allows the ends of the diene (carbon-1 and carbon-4) to react with the dienophile.\n    *   Three pairs of electrons move in a cyclic fashion:\n        *   The π bond between C1 and C2 of butadiene attacks one carbon of the dienophile's double bond, forming a new sigma (σ) bond.\n        *   The π bond of the dienophile attacks C4 of the diene, forming a second new σ bond.\n        *   The π bond between C3 and C4 of butadiene moves to form a new π bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   The overall result is the formation of a six-membered ring, specifically a derivative of cyclohexene.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   Let's label the carbons of butadiene as C1-C2-C3-C4 and the carbons of the dienophile as Cα(Cl₂)=Cβ(F₂).\n    *   New σ bonds will form between C1 and one of the dienophile carbons, and between C4 and the other dienophile carbon. A new π bond forms between C2 and C3.\n    *   The skeleton of the product is a cyclohexene ring where C2 and C3 from the diene form the new double bond. C1 and C4 become CH₂ groups in the ring. Cα and Cβ become saturated carbons in the ring, bearing their original substituents (Cl₂ and F₂).\n    *   The resulting ring structure will be:\n        ```\n             CH=CH\n           /     \\\n         H₂C     CH₂\n           |       |\n         C(Cl₂) - C(F₂)\n        ```\n        (or with the CCl₂ and CF₂ groups swapped, as discussed next).\n\n5.  **Consider Regiochemistry and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **Regiochemistry:** This concerns which way the unsymmetrical dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) adds to the symmetrical diene (butadiene). Let's consider the two possibilities:\n        1.  C1(diene) attacks CF₂ and C4(diene) attacks CCl₂.\n        2.  C1(diene) attacks CCl₂ and C4(diene) attacks CF₂.\n        However, because the diene is symmetrical (C1 and C4 are chemically equivalent), both orientations lead to the **same constitutional isomer**. Rotating the molecule from the second orientation will make it identical to the first. Therefore, only one product is formed.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Stereocenters are chiral carbons (carbons bonded to four different groups). In the product, the carbons bearing the halogens (CF₂ and CCl₂) are bonded to two identical atoms (two F's or two Cl's) and two carbon atoms within the ring, so they are not chiral. The other carbons are either part of a double bond (sp²) or are CH₂ groups. Thus, **no stereocenters are formed**, and there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\n6.  **Name the Final Product:**\n    *   The parent structure is a **cyclohexene**.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the double bond must be given the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n    *   We then number around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering in either direction around the ring gives the substituents at positions 4 and 5. For example, **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro** or **4,4-difluoro-5,5-dichloro**.\n    *   When the locant sets are identical, we use alphabetical order of the substituent names (\"chloro\" vs \"fluoro\"). \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n    *   Therefore, the chloro group is assigned the lower number (4).\n    *   The correct IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. Butadiene acts as the diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile. The reaction forms a six-membered ring product, 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
