    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) for objects that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua. Let's analyze each of these properties step-by-step to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n    *   *Compact* in the context of the plane ($R^2$) means the set must be closed and bounded. This rules out spaces like the entire plane, an open disk, or an infinite line.\n    *   *Connected* means the space is \"all in one piece\" and cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open subsets.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of $R^2$. This rules out spaces like the 2-sphere ($S^2$) or the torus.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous deformation) of the space onto itself, $f: X \\to X$, such that $f(x) = y$. In essence, the space looks topologically identical from every point. This is a very strong condition.\n\n**2. Identifying Potential Candidates and Ruling Out Simple Ones**\n\nLet's test some familiar planar continua to see if they are homogeneous:\n\n*   **A closed interval [a, b]:** This is a planar continuum, but it is **not** homogeneous. The endpoints (a and b) are topologically distinct from the interior points. Removing an endpoint leaves the space connected, while removing an interior point disconnects it.\n*   **A closed disk:** This is a planar continuum, but it is **not** homogeneous. A point on the boundary circle is different from a point in the interior. There is no self-homeomorphism of the disk that can map a boundary point to an interior one.\n*   **The Sierpinski Carpet:** This is a famous fractal which is a planar continuum. For a long time, it was an open question whether it was homogeneous. However, it was proven in 2016 (by Hoehn and Oversteegen) that the Sierpinski Carpet is **not** homogeneous. Different points have different neighborhood structures.\n\n**3. The Classification Theorem**\n\nThe question being asked is a famous classification problem in point-set topology. The complete solution is the result of decades of work by numerous mathematicians. The classification states that there are only a handful of objects that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n**4. The Complete List of Homeomorphism Classes**\n\nThe exhaustive list of homogeneous planar continua consists of exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n*   **Class 1: The Point**\n    *   A single point is compact, connected, and planar. It is \"trivially\" homogeneous because for any two points x and y, they must be the same point (x=y), and the identity map works as the required homeomorphism. This is often called the \"degenerate\" case.\n\n*   **Class 2: The Simple Closed Curve (The Circle)**\n    *   Any space homeomorphic to the standard circle, $S^1$. It is a planar continuum. It is homogeneous because any point on a circle can be rotated to any other point, and rotation is a homeomorphism. It was shown by Mazurkiewicz that any \"nice\" (locally connected) non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be a simple closed curve.\n\n*   **Class 3: The Pseudo-arc**\n    *   This is a much more exotic, fractal-like object. It is a planar continuum that is \"indecomposable\" (meaning it cannot be split into two proper subcontinua) and arc-like. Despite its complexity, R. H. Bing proved it is homogeneous. It is not locally connected. It is topologically distinct from a point and a circle.\n\n*   **Class 4: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n    *   This is another indecomposable continuum, formed by arranging pseudo-arcs in a circular fashion. It is also homogeneous and planar, and topologically distinct from the other three types.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe deep result from topology, finalized only in recent years, is that this list is complete. Any space that is a homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one, and only one, of these four examples.\n\n1.  The Point\n2.  The Simple Closed Curve\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
