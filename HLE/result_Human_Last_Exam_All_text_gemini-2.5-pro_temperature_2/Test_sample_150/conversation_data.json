    "Answering this question involves a three-stage process:\n1.  **Analyze the problem and the provided Java code.**\n2.  **Identify if the code is correct. If not, design a correct and optimal C solution.**\n3.  **Calculate the efficiency metrics (character comparisons and memory usage) for the optimal solution and format the final answer.**\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and the Provided Code\n\n**Problem Description Analysis:**\n*   **Initial State:** A single integer variable, `x`, is initialized to `0`.\n*   **Input:** An integer `n` followed by `n` lines. Each line contains a \"statement\".\n*   **Statements:** A statement is a 3-character string representing an operation on `x`.\n*   **Operations:**\n    *   Increment: Increases `x` by 1. Represented by `++X` or `X++`.\n    *   Decrement: Decreases `x` by 1. Represented by `--X` or `X--`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate and print the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n**Provided Java Code Analysis:**\nThe Java program reads the number of statements `t` and initializes a result variable `tresult` to 0. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads one statement string. The core logic is:\n```java\nif (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n{\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n{\n    tresult--;\n}  \n```\n\n**Careful Points & Flaws:**\n*   **Incomplete Cases:** The problem explicitly states that the operation and variable can be in any order. This gives four possible statements: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n*   **Code's Limitation:** The provided code only checks for `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`. It completely ignores the postfix versions `X++` and `X--`.\n*   **Conclusion on Correctness:** If the input contains `X++` or `X--`, the program will fail to modify the counter, leading to an incorrect final result. Therefore, **the program does not solve the problem correctly for all possible valid inputs.**\n\n### Step 2: Design an Optimal C Solution\n\nSince the provided code is incorrect, we need to design a correct and efficient C program. Efficiency here means fastest execution (fewest operations) and least memory usage.\n\n**Logic for an Efficient Solution:**\nInstead of comparing the whole string, we can find a single, unique characteristic of the statements. Let's examine the four possibilities:\n1.  `++X`\n2.  `X++`\n3.  `--X`\n4.  `X--`\n\nNotice the character at index 1 (the middle character) of each string:\n*   For `++X`, the middle character is `'+'`.\n*   For `X++`, the middle character is `'+'`.\n*   For `--X`, the middle character is `'-'`.\n*   For `X--`, the middle character is `'-'`.\n\nThis reveals a very simple and efficient rule: **If the character at index 1 is `+`, we increment `x`. Otherwise, it must be `-`, so we decrement `x`**. This check is sufficient to correctly identify the operation for all four cases.\n\n**Optimal C Implementation Outline:**\n1.  Include the `<stdio.h>` header.\n2.  In `main`, declare variables. To minimize memory, we analyze the constraints:\n    *   `1 <= n <= 150`: A `short int` (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient to store `n`.\n    *   `-150 <= x <= 150`: The final value `x` also fits in a `short int` (2 bytes).\n    *   Statement string: A buffer of `char statement[4];` is needed (3 characters + 1 null terminator), which is 4 bytes.\n3.  Read `n`.\n4.  Initialize `x = 0`.\n5.  Loop `n` times (e.g., using `while(n--)`).\n6.  Inside the loop, read the statement string using `scanf(\"%s\", statement);`.\n7.  Check `if (statement[1] == '+')`. If true, execute `x++`; otherwise, execute `x--`.\n8.  After the loop, print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Efficiency Metrics for the Optimal Solution\n\nWe need to calculate `x` (smallest number of character comparisons for `n=100`) and `y` (smallest memory size in Bytes).\n\n*   **x (Character Comparisons for n=100):**\n    The core logic `if (statement[1] == '+')` performs exactly **one character comparison** per statement. For 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`. It is impossible to do fewer comparisons, as we must inspect each statement string in some form to determine the operation.\n    *   `x = 100`\n\n*   **y (Smallest Memory Size in Bytes):**\n    This refers to the memory allocated for the main variables in the program. As determined in the design step, we can use:\n    *   `short int n;`: 2 bytes\n    *   `short int x;`: 2 bytes\n    *   `char statement[4];`: 4 bytes\n    The total memory footprint for these variables is `2 + 2 + 4 = 8` bytes. This is the minimal amount required for a robust and fast solution.\n    *   `y = 8`\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   **Does the program solve the problem?** No.\n*   **Answer Format:** `Nx+y`\n*   **Calculated Values:** `x=100`, `y=8`\n\nPlugging the values into the format gives `N100+8`.\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
