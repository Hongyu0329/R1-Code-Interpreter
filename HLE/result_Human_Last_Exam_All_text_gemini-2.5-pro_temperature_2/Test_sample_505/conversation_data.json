    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System Configuration:**\n    *   **Two patches of surface code:** This means we have two separate, physically independent surface codes. Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits that can be encoded in each patch.\n    *   **Two holes:** We have a total of two holes (also known as defects or punctures) that can be created in the code. These holes can be distributed among the two patches in any way.\n\n2.  **Determine the Logical Qubit Capacity of a Single Patch:**\n    *   **Baseline (No Holes):** A standard, planar surface code patch is constructed with specific boundary conditions (e.g., two \"rough\" boundaries and two \"smooth\" boundaries). This configuration allows for the encoding of exactly **one logical qubit** (`k=1`). The logical operators for this qubit are strings of Pauli operators that span the code from boundary to boundary.\n    *   **Adding Holes:** When a hole is created in a surface code patch (by deactivating stabilizer measurements in a specific region), it introduces new non-trivial topological features. Each hole effectively adds a new pair of boundaries to the code.\n    *   For each hole added, we can define a new, independent logical qubit. The logical Z operator for this new qubit can be defined as a closed loop of Pauli-Z operators encircling the hole. The corresponding logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operators connecting the hole to an outer boundary of the patch.\n    *   The logical operators for this \"hole qubit\" can be constructed to commute with the original \"boundary qubit\" and with any logical qubits defined by other holes on the same patch.\n    *   Therefore, the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes is given by the formula:\n        `k_patch = 1 (from boundaries) + h (from holes)`\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Distributions of the Holes:**\n    To find the *maximum* number of logical qubits, we must consider all possible ways to distribute the two available holes between the two patches.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Both holes on one patch.**\n        *   **Patch 1:** Has 2 holes (`h=2`).\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + h = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n        *   **Patch 2:** Has 0 holes (`h=0`).\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + h = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n        *   **Total logical qubits:** `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One hole on each patch.**\n        *   **Patch 1:** Has 1 hole (`h=1`).\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + h = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   **Patch 2:** Has 1 hole (`h=1`).\n        *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + h = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   **Total logical qubits:** `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both possible distributions of the two holes result in a total of 4 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this system is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The fact that there are two separate patches is crucial. If they were connected, the calculation would involve the topology of the combined surface.\n*   **Baseline Qubit:** A standard planar surface code patch is not an empty slate; it is specifically designed to encode one qubit. Forgetting this baseline qubit is a common mistake.\n*   **Holes as Qubit Sources:** Each hole provides the necessary topological structure to define exactly one additional logical qubit on its patch.\n*   **Maximization:** The question asks for the \"at most\" or maximum number. It's essential to check all valid configurations to find this maximum, though in this specific problem, all configurations yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is calculated by summing the capacities of the two patches under the possible distributions of the two holes. Both distributions (`(2,0)` and `(1,1)`) yield a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
