    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the specified quantity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"**\n\nIn the context of nuclear reactor physics and criticality, the neutron population is not perfectly constant but fluctuates due to the stochastic nature of processes like fission and absorption. The \"generalized pair correlation function\" is a mathematical tool to describe these fluctuations.\n\n*   It is formally the **covariance function** of the neutron density field, $n(\\mathbf{r}, E, t)$. The covariance measures the correlation between fluctuations at two different points in phase space (position $\\mathbf{r}$ and energy $E$) and at two different times ($t_1$ and $t_2$).\n*   Let $\\delta n(\\mathbf{r}, E, t) = n(\\mathbf{r}, E, t) - \\langle n(\\mathbf{r}, E, t) \\rangle$ be the fluctuation of the neutron density around its mean value. The generalized pair correlation function is:\n    $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, E_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, E_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_1, E_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_2, E_2, t_2) \\rangle$\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a function of two full sets of phase-space and time coordinates. The \"generalized\" aspect refers to its dependence on all variables ($\\mathbf{r}, E, t$), not just spatial separation like the simple pair correlation function $g(r)$ in statistical mechanics.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform\"**\n\nThe question asks for a specific mathematical operation on this correlation function.\n\n*   A **Fourier transform** converts a function from the time domain to the frequency domain, or from the spatial domain to the wavenumber (or momentum) domain.\n*   A \"**double Fourier transform**\" implies transforming with respect to both sets of coordinates: $(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1)$ and $(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$.\n*   Let's define the Fourier transform pair for time and space as:\n    $\\tilde{f}(\\omega) = \\int f(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt$\n    $\\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int f(\\mathbf{r}) e^{-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} d^3\\mathbf{r}$\n*   The full double transform would be a function of two wavenumbers ($\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{k}_2$) and two frequencies ($\\omega_1, \\omega_2$).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify based on physical assumptions (Stationarity)**\n\nPhysical systems are often statistically **stationary** in time, meaning the correlation depends only on the time difference, $\\tau = t_2 - t_1$.\n\n*   Under this assumption, $C(\\dots, t_1; \\dots, t_2)$ becomes $C(\\dots, \\tau)$.\n*   The time part of the Fourier transform simplifies. The Fourier transform of a correlation function with respect to the time lag $\\tau$ is known as the **spectral density**.\n*   This transform results in a function of a single frequency variable, $\\omega$.\n    $\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{r}_1, E_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, E_2; \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C(\\mathbf{r}_1, E_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, E_2; \\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau$\n*   **Careful Point:** Spatial homogeneity (dependence only on $\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$) is not generally assumed for a finite, heterogeneous reactor, which is why the spatial transform involves two wavevectors, $\\mathbf{k}_1$ and $\\mathbf{k}_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the common name in the Nuclear Criticality Community**\n\nThe core of the question is to identify the common term for the resulting quantity, $\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{k}_1, E_1; \\mathbf{k}_2, E_2; \\omega)$, within the specific field of nuclear criticality. This requires looking at the standard terminology used in key literature and by practitioners of noise analysis techniques (like the Rossi-alpha, Feynman-alpha, and Cf-252 source-driven methods).\n\n*   The Fourier transform of the time-correlation function between two signals is universally called the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. If the correlation is of a signal with itself, it's called the **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)**.\n*   Since the generalized pair correlation function connects two distinct points in phase space $(\\phi_1, \\phi_2)$, its temporal Fourier transform is a CPSD. This quantity, $\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{r}_1, E_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, E_2; \\omega)$, is the **space- and energy-dependent Cross-Power Spectral Density**.\n*   The final step is the double spatial Fourier transform, which converts the spatial variables $\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2$ into wavenumber variables $\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{k}_2$. This quantity describes the CPSD in the basis of spatial plane waves (or Fourier modes).\n*   In the seminal literature of reactor noise (by authors such as M.M.R. Williams, R.E. Uhrig, J.T. Mihalczo, I. PÃ¡zsit), the fundamental quantity describing the frequency spectrum of fluctuations is consistently referred to as the **Power Spectral Density**, or more specifically, the **Cross-Power Spectral Density**. This terminology is standard both for the quantities measured experimentally between detectors and for their theoretical counterparts in the underlying equations.\n*   While an analogy exists with the \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" from condensed matter physics, this term is not the most common one used by the nuclear criticality community, which tends to use the language of electrical engineering and signal processing.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function is the covariance of the neutron field. Its double space-time Fourier transform is the covariance spectrum expressed in the wavenumber-frequency domain. The standard and most common name for the Fourier transform of a cross-correlation function is the Cross-Power Spectral Density. The additional spatial transformation just expresses this quantity in a different basis (k-space instead of real space).\n\nTherefore, the quantity is best described as the k-space representation of the Cross-Power Spectral Density. The most common and fundamental name for the entity is **Cross-Power Spectral Density**.\n\n>>> Cross-Power Spectral Density"
