    "Answering the question \"What is the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1?\" requires a two-part analysis: finding an upper bound for the dimension and then showing this bound is achievable by constructing a suitable set.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Definition of a Sidon Set**\n\nA subset $A$ of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is called a **Sidon set** (also known as a $B_2$ set) if all sums of pairs of its elements are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, for any four elements $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$, the equation\n$$ a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4 $$\nimplies that the set of summands on the left is the same as the set on the right, i.e., $\\{a_1, a_2\\} = \\{a_3, a_4\\}$. This means that either $(a_1, a_2) = (a_3, a_4)$ or $(a_1, a_2) = (a_4, a_3)$.\n\n**2. Definition of Hausdorff Dimension**\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(S)$, of a set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a measure of its \"fractal\" dimension. It generalizes the notion of dimension to non-integer values. For instance, a line segment has dimension 1, while the middle-thirds Cantor set has dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63$.\n\n**3. Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nLet $A \\subset [0,1]$ be a Sidon set. We want to find an upper bound for its Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(A)$. The established result is that $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$. While the full proof is quite technical, here is a sketch of the main ideas.\n\n*   **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume there exists a Sidon set $A$ with $\\dim_H(A) > 1/2$.\n*   **Frostman's Lemma:** If $\\dim_H(A) = d$, then for any $s < d$, there exists a probability measure $\\mu$ supported on $A$ such that for any interval (or ball) $I$, its measure is bounded by $\\mu(I) \\le C |I|^s$, where $|I|$ is the length of the interval and $C$ is a constant. Since we assume $d>1/2$, we can choose $s$ such that $1/2 < s < d$.\n*   **Fourier Analysis / Second Moment Argument:** This property of the measure $\\mu$ imposes constraints on the decay of its Fourier coefficients $\\hat{\\mu}(n)$. On the other hand, the Sidon property of the set $A$ imposes a different kind of structural constraint on the measure $\\mu$ and its Fourier transform.\n*   **Contradiction:** A detailed analysis shows that these two constraints are contradictory. One common method (as in a 2018 paper by Lima and Moreira) involves using the measure $\\mu$ to construct a smoothed-out density function $f_\\epsilon(t) = \\mu([t-\\epsilon, t+\\epsilon])$. One can show that $\\|f_\\epsilon\\|_2^2 \\le C\\epsilon^{1+s}$ due to the dimension property. One also finds a lower bound for $\\|f_\\epsilon\\|_2^2$ related to the Sidon property. More advanced arguments use the fact that the Sidon property puts a strong constraint on the fourth moment of the measure's Fourier transform, $\\sum_n |\\hat{\\mu}(n)|^4$, while the dimension property gives information about the second moment, $\\sum_n |\\hat{\\mu}(n)|^2$. The tension between these properties leads to a contradiction if we assume $s > 1/2$.\n\nThis line of reasoning rigorously establishes that for any Sidon set $A \\subset [0,1]$, we must have $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n\n**4. Constructing a Sidon Set with Dimension 1/2**\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the *maximum* dimension, we must demonstrate the existence of a Sidon set that achieves this dimension. This proves that the bound is sharp.\n\n*   **Cantor-like Constructions:** The construction often involves building a generalized Cantor set. A simple approach is to define a set based on number expansions in a large base $M$:\n    $$ A = \\left\\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{d_k}{M^k} \\quad \\middle| \\quad d_k \\in D \\right\\} $$\n    where $D$ is a carefully chosen set of \"digits\".\n*   **Choice of Digits:** The set of digits $D$ must be a Sidon set of integers. Also, to prevent carries when adding numbers in $A$, the base $M$ must be chosen to be larger than twice the maximum digit in $D$.\n*   **The Dimension Formula:** The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by $\\dim_H(A) = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log M}$.\n*   **Achieving Dimension 1/2:** It is a known result in number theory that one can construct a Sidon set $D$ within the integers $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$ such that its size $|D|$ is approximately $\\sqrt{n}$.\n    *   Let's take such a Sidon set $D \\subset \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$ with $|D| \\approx \\sqrt{n}$.\n    *   We choose our base $M$ to prevent carries. Setting $M = 2n$ suffices, since the maximum sum of two digits will be less than $2(n-1)$, which is less than $M$.\n    *   The Hausdorff dimension of the resulting set $A$ is $\\dim_H(A) = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log M} \\approx \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{n})}{\\log(2n)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(n)}{\\log(2)+\\log(n)}$.\n    *   As we let $n \\to \\infty$, this dimension approaches $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log(n)}{\\log(n)} = 1/2$.\n\nThis argument shows we can construct Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to $1/2$. More complex constructions, such as those found in the literature (e.g., in S. Astels' thesis), can build a specific Sidon set whose dimension is exactly $1/2$.\n\n### Final Answer Conclusion\n\nCombining the two parts of the analysis:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is equal to $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
