    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:**\n    *   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n    *   **Artwork:** Self-portrait\n    *   **Year:** 1933\n    *   **Context:** Painted after escaping the Gestapo.\n    *   **Question:** What object does he hold as a symbol of resistance?\n\n2.  **Locate the specific artwork:** The painting in question is titled \"Selbstbildnis nach der Flucht vor der Gestapo\" (Self-Portrait after Escaping the Gestapo) or sometimes \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Cloth). This confirms the existence of a self-portrait from 1933 fitting the description.\n\n3.  **Examine the painting's content:** A visual analysis of the portrait shows Curt Querner staring intensely at the viewer. His face appears worn and defiant. In his left hand, he is firmly clutching a piece of bright red cloth or a towel.\n\n4.  **Analyze the symbolism of the object in its historical context:**\n    *   **The Year 1933:** This was the year the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany. They immediately began suppressing all political opposition.\n    *   **The Color Red:** In the political landscape of the Weimar Republic and early Nazi Germany, the color red was overwhelmingly associated with left-wing movements, specifically Communism (KPD) and Social Democracy (SPD). Their flags and symbols were predominantly red.\n    *   **Curt Querner's Politics:** Querner was a member of the *Assoziation revolutionärer bildender Künstler* (ASSO), a German association of revolutionary artists with strong ties to the Communist Party. He was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933 for his political affiliations but managed to escape.\n    *   **The Act of Holding:** He isn't just holding the cloth; he is clutching it tightly. This act signifies that he is holding onto his beliefs firmly and defiantly, even after being persecuted for them.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the findings:** By painting himself clutching a red cloth immediately after his escape from the Gestapo in 1933, Curt Querner was making a clear and courageous political statement. The red cloth was not a random item but a potent symbol of the Communist and Socialist cause he believed in. It represented his unbroken spirit and his continued, quiet resistance to the newly established Nazi dictatorship.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The specific title:** Knowing the painting is also called \"Self-Portrait with Red Cloth\" is a major clue.\n*   **The historical context:** Understanding the political symbolism of colors in 1933 Germany is crucial to deciphering the painting's meaning. Without this context, it could just be a red rag.\n*   **The artist's background:** Querner's membership in the communist-affiliated ASSO confirms the political interpretation of the symbol.\n*   **The defiant expression:** Querner's facial expression and the firm grip on the cloth reinforce the theme of resistance rather than defeat.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the object Curt Querner holds as a symbol of his resistance is a red cloth.\n\n<<<a red cloth>>>"
