    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the integral equation to find the values of $\\lambda$ for which it has no solution.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Kernel**\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$\n\nThe kernel of the integral equation is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$. We can simplify this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n$x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$\nSo, the kernel is a polynomial:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means we can write it as a sum of products of functions of x and y.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\nSubstitute the polynomial form of the kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u(y) dy$\nWe can interchange the summation and integration:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left(\\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy\\right)$\n\nLet's define the moments of the function $u(y)$ as a set of constants $c_k$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the expression for $u(x)$ becomes:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$\nThis equation shows that if a solution $u(x)$ exists, it must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\n\nNow, we can create a system of equations for the unknown constants $c_k$. We substitute the polynomial form of $u(y)$ back into the definition of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left(1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\frac{1}{j + n - k}$\n\nThis gives a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. We can write this system in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector $[c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$.\n- $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector $[\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{n}]^T$, so $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\n- $A$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j + n - k}$ (where $j$ is the row index and $k$ is the column index, both from 0 to $n-1$).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Condition for No Solution**\nThe system of linear equations $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has no solution if and only if:\n1. The matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular, which means $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$. This is equivalent to $1/\\lambda$ being an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n2. The vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space (image) of the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$. By the Fredholm alternative theorem, this means that $\\mathbf{b}$ is not orthogonal to the null space (kernel) of the adjoint (or transpose) matrix $(I - \\lambda A)^T$.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$ are called characteristic values. For such a $\\lambda$, there exists a non-trivial solution to the homogeneous equation $u_h(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u_h(y) dy$. For the original non-homogeneous equation to have a solution, the forcing function $f(x)=1$ must be orthogonal to the solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation $v(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y,x) v(y) dy$. The orthogonality condition is $\\int_0^1 f(x)v(x)dx = \\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\n\nLet's find the values of $\\lambda$. An equivalent problem is to find the eigenvalues of the operator matrix. It can be shown that this is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix $C$ with entries $C_{kj} = \\frac{1}{n-k+j}$ for $k,j=0, \\dots, n-1$. Let $\\mu$ be an eigenvalue of $C$. Then the corresponding characteristic values are $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$. It can be shown that the orthogonality condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$ is generally not met for these eigenfunctions. Thus, the equation has no solution for $\\lambda=1/\\mu$.\n\nThe specific values of $\\lambda$ depend on the integer $n$.\n\n- **For n=1:**\n  The equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$.\n  This implies $u(x)$ must be a constant, say $C$.\n  $C = 1 + \\lambda C \\implies C(1-\\lambda)=1$.\n  If $\\lambda = 1$, we get $0=1$, which is a contradiction. Thus, for $n=1$, there is no solution if $\\lambda=1$.\n\n- **For n=2:**\n  The matrix $A$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n  The determinant of $(I-\\lambda A)$ is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda/2 & -\\lambda \\\\ -\\lambda/3 & 1-\\lambda/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda/2)^2 - \\lambda^2/3 = 1-\\lambda-\\lambda^2/12$.\n  Setting the determinant to zero: $\\lambda^2 + 12\\lambda - 12 = 0$.\n  The roots are $\\lambda = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144-4(-12)}}{2} = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n  For these values of $\\lambda$, it can be verified that the condition for the existence of solutions is not met.\n\nThe question as stated does not specify the value of $n$. Therefore, the answer is the set of characteristic values $\\lambda$ which depend on $n$. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $C_n$ where $C_n[k,j] = \\frac{1}{n-k+j}$. Without a specific value for $n$, a single numerical answer cannot be determined.\n\nGiven the prompt's constraints, it's possible that the question was intended for a specific value of $n$ that was not provided. However, based on the analysis, a general answer is a set of $n$ values dependent on $n$. For example, if $n=1$ was intended, the answer would be 1. If $n=2$ was intended, the answers would be $-6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. There is no single numerical value for $\\lambda$ that works for all $n$."
