    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$):** A 2-torus is the surface of a donut. It is a compact, connected, orientable manifold without boundary.\n*   **Smooth Function:** A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative of $f$ vanishes. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Existence of Critical Points**\n\n1.  Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n2.  At a point of maximum or minimum, the derivative of the function must be zero.\n3.  Therefore, any smooth function on the torus must have at least two critical points: a maximum and a minimum.\n4.  This establishes a lower bound of 2.\n\n**Step 3: Using Tools from Topology (Morse Theory)**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of the underlying space.\n\n1.  **Betti Numbers:** The topology of a space can be described by its Betti numbers, $b_k$, which are the ranks of its homology groups. For the 2-torus $T^2$:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it is one connected component).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent \"loops\" that don't bound a disk - one along the longitude and one along the latitude).\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one void).\n\n2.  **Morse Inequalities:** For a special class of functions called **Morse functions** (where critical points are non-degenerate), the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must satisfy the weak Morse inequalities:\n    $c_k \\ge b_k$ for all $k$.\n\n3.  **Applying the Inequalities to the Torus:**\n    *   $c_0$: number of local minima (index 0). We must have $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $c_1$: number of saddle points (index 1). We must have $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $c_2$: number of local maxima (index 2). We must have $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$.\n\n4.  **Lower Bound for Morse Functions:** The total number of critical points for any Morse function on the torus must be at least:\n    $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    This tells us that any *Morse* function on the torus has at least 4 critical points.\n\n**Step 4: Generalizing to All Smooth Functions**\n\nThe result from the Morse inequalities holds for Morse functions. We need to know if it holds for *any* smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points.\n\n1.  A fundamental result in Morse theory (sometimes called the Morse-Pitcher theorem) states that for *any* smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the total number of critical points is greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers over a field (the strongest result is typically for the field $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$).\n2.  For the torus, the Betti numbers over any field are the same as the integer Betti numbers we used.\n3.  Therefore, for *any* smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the number of critical points is at least:\n    $\\sum_{k=0}^{2} b_k(T^2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying if the Lower Bound is Achievable**\n\nWe have established that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points. Now we need to show that there exists a function that has exactly 4.\n\n1.  **Construction of an Example:** Consider a torus standing vertically on a table in 3D space. Let the function $f$ be the height coordinate, $f(x, y, z) = z$.\n2.  **Identifying Critical Points:** The critical points are where the tangent plane to the torus is horizontal.\n    *   **The very bottom point:** This is a local (and global) minimum. (1 point, index 0).\n    *   **The very top point:** This is a local (and global) maximum. (1 point, index 2).\n    *   **The \"inner\" and \"outer\" equators:** At the middle height, there are two points where the tangent is horizontal. One is on the outermost circle of the torus, and one is on the innermost circle (at the waist of the hole). These are both saddle points. (2 points, index 1).\n3.  **Counting:** The height function has a total of $1 + 1 + 2 = 4$ critical points. This is a Morse function where $c_0=1$, $c_1=2$, and $c_2=1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. We have also constructed a function that has exactly 4 critical points. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
