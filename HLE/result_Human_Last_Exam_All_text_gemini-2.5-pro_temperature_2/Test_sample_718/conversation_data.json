    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Terms\n\nThe question asks for the integer $n$ for which any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice. Let's define each component:\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (supremum or join). That is, for any $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their join $j_1 \\vee j_2$ exists in $J$. When viewed as a category, the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\leq y$. The upper semilattice property means that the category $J$ has finite coproducts (the coproduct of two objects $j_1$ and $j_2$ is their join $j_1 \\vee j_2$).\n\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$ over the field $K$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\leq j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ for each relation $j_1 \\leq j_2$, preserving composition and identities. The category of all such functors is denoted $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. This category is equivalent to the category of modules over the category algebra $KJ$.\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" describes the representation type of the entire category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. A category of representations is of tame type if, for any dimension $d$, the indecomposable representations of dimension $d$ can be classified by a finite number of one-parameter families. The alternative is \"finite type\" (finitely many indecomposables) or \"wild type\" (classification is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices, considered hopeless). The phrasing \"a tame functor\" means any functor $f$ in a category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ that is of tame representation type.\n\n*   **$n$-resolvable:** A functor (or module) $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence $P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$ where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe question is asking for the smallest integer $n$ such that $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$ for any functor $f$ from a category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ that is of tame type, where $J$ is an upper semilattice. This value $n$ is the supremum of projective dimensions over all such functors, which is the global dimension of the category.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Key Connections\n\n1.  **Projective Functors:** The projective objects in $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ are direct sums of representable functors. For each $j \\in J$, the representable functor $P_j = K\\text{Hom}_J(j, -)$ is projective. It is defined by $P_j(i) = K$ if $j \\le i$ and $P_j(i)=0$ otherwise.\n\n2.  **Global Dimension:** The question is effectively asking for the global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, under the constraints that $J$ is an upper semilattice and the category is tame. The global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects within it.\n\n3.  **The \"Tame\" Condition:** The fact that the category is tame places a restriction on the structure of the poset $J$. For instance, an upper semilattice constructed from an antichain of four or more elements and a top element (the $m$-subspace problem for $m \\ge 4$) is of wild type. The \"tame\" condition rules out such posets.\n\n4.  **The \"Upper Semilattice\" Condition:** This is a very strong structural condition on the poset $J$. As noted, it means the category $J$ has finite coproducts. This has significant homological consequences.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nOur goal is to determine the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n1.  The global dimension of an abelian category (like our functor category) is the supremum of the projective dimensions of its simple objects. The simple objects in $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ are the functors $S_j$ for each $j \\in J$, where $S_j(j)=K$ and $S_j(i)=0$ for $i \\ne j$.\n\n2.  To find the projective dimension of a simple object $S_j$, we construct its projective resolution. The resolution begins with a projective cover. The projective cover of the simple functor $S_j$ is the representable functor $P_j$. This gives the start of a resolution:\n    $P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$\n    The kernel of this map is the radical of $P_j$, denoted $\\text{rad}(P_j)$. This leads to the short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{rad}(P_j) \\to P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$.\n\n3.  From this sequence, the projective dimension of $S_j$ is $\\text{pd}(S_j) = 1 + \\text{pd}(\\text{rad}(P_j))$, unless $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is zero (which happens only if $j$ is a maximal element, in which case $S_j = P_j$ is projective and has $\\text{pd}(S_j) = 0$).\n\n4.  The crucial step is to determine the projective dimension of $\\text{rad}(P_j)$. We will show that if $J$ is an upper semilattice, then $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is always a projective functor.\n    *   The functor $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ can be described as the subfunctor of $P_j$ generated by all non-identity morphisms starting at $j$. It can be expressed as a colimit of other projective functors. Specifically, let $C_j = \\{k \\in J \\mid k > j\\}$ be the set of elements strictly greater than $j$. Then $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is the filtered colimit of the representable functors $\\{P_k\\}_{k \\in C_j}$.\n        $\\text{rad}(P_j) = \\text{colim}_{k \\in C_j} P_k$.\n    *   The colimit is \"filtered\" because the indexing set $C_j$ is a directed set. For any two elements $k_1, k_2 \\in C_j$, their join $k_1 \\vee k_2$ exists in $J$ (since $J$ is an upper semilattice) and is also an element of $C_j$.\n    *   In the category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, a functor $F$ is projective if and only if $\\text{Ext}^1(F, G) = 0$ for all functors $G$.\n    *   The $\\text{Ext}^1$ functor commutes with filtered colimits in its first argument:\n        $\\text{Ext}^1(\\text{rad}(P_j), G) = \\text{Ext}^1(\\text{colim}_{k \\in C_j} P_k, G) \\cong \\lim_{k \\in C_j} \\text{Ext}^1(P_k, G)$.\n    *   Since each $P_k$ is a representable functor, it is projective. Therefore, $\\text{Ext}^1(P_k, G) = 0$ for all $k \\in C_j$ and all $G$.\n    *   The limit of a diagram of zero objects is zero. So, $\\text{Ext}^1(\\text{rad}(P_j), G) = 0$ for all $G$.\n    *   This proves that $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is a projective functor.\n\n5.  Since $\\text{rad}(P_j)$ is projective, its projective dimension is 0. Returning to the formula from step 3, $\\text{pd}(S_j) = 1 + \\text{pd}(\\text{rad}(P_j)) = 1+0 = 1$ (for non-maximal $j$). If $j$ is maximal, $\\text{pd}(S_j)=0$.\n    Thus, the projective dimension of any simple functor is at most 1.\n\n6.  This implies that the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1. A category with global dimension $\\leq 1$ is called a hereditary category.\n\n7.  Since the global dimension is at most 1, the projective dimension of *any* functor $f$ in this category must be less than or equal to 1. Therefore, any functor $f$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n8.  The value cannot be $n=0$, because in any non-trivial upper semilattice (e.g., a chain of length 2), there exist simple functors that are not projective. For such a functor $f$, $\\text{pd}(f) = 1$, so it is not 0-resolvable.\n\n9.  Notice that this conclusion depends only on $J$ being an upper semilattice. The \"tame functor\" condition is actually redundant information, because the structural property of $J$ being an upper semilattice is so strong that it forces the global dimension of the category to be at most 1, regardless of its representation type (finite, tame, or wild).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nFor any upper semilattice $J$, the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is hereditary, meaning its global dimension is at most 1. Consequently, any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension of at most 1, making it 1-resolvable. The value of $n$ cannot be 0, as non-projective functors generally exist. Thus, the correct value is $n=1$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
