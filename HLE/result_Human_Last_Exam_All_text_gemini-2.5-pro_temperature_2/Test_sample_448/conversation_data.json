    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The candidates are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Constraints of the Question\n*   **\"Rarest\"**: This means the one with the lowest abundance or smallest percentage.\n*   **\"On Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\"**: This means we must consider the total amount of each gas in the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), and lithosphere (crust, mantle, core), not just its concentration in the air.\n*   **\"in 2002\"**: This specific year is a key detail. We must consider the state of scientific knowledge and discovery at that time.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Noble Gas Candidate\n\n**Oganesson (Og):**\n*   **Careful Point:** Oganesson is a purely synthetic element; it does not occur naturally on Earth. Its natural abundance is zero.\n*   **Careful Point (The \"2002\" aspect):** The first accepted synthesis of Oganesson (element 118) was in 2006. An earlier claim of its discovery from 1999 was officially retracted in 2001. Therefore, in 2002, Oganesson was officially an undiscovered element. You cannot be the \"rarest noble gas on Earth\" if you are not yet confirmed to exist. This context likely disqualifies Oganesson from consideration.\n\n**The Stable, Primordial Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe):**\nThese gases were part of the primordial material that formed the Earth and are primarily found in the atmosphere.\n*   **Argon (Ar)** is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.93% of the atmosphere. A significant amount (isotope Ar-40) is also produced in the Earth's crust from the radioactive decay of potassium-40. It is definitely not the rarest.\n*   **Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), and Xenon (Xe)** are next in terms of atmospheric abundance.\n*   **Helium (He)** is constantly produced in the crust by the alpha decay of uranium and thorium and escapes into the atmosphere, from which it can be lost to space due to its low mass.\n*   Comparing their total abundance (mostly atmospheric), Xenon is the rarest among this stable group. Its atmospheric abundance is about 0.09 parts per million (ppm).\n\n**Radon (Rn):**\n*   **Careful Point:** Radon is a naturally occurring noble gas, but it is highly radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Careful Point (Source vs. Quantity):** Radon is continuously generated within the Earth's crust as part of the natural decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts in rocks and soil. Because it decays so quickly, the total amount of radon present on Earth at any single moment is incredibly small, despite its constant production. The total equilibrium quantity is estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms in the entire atmosphere and on the order of a few tonnes at most for the entire planet.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Rarest Candidates\nBased on the analysis, we are left comparing Xenon and Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The total mass of Xenon in the Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be around 2 x 10^12 kg (two trillion kilograms).\n*   **Radon (Rn):** The total mass of Radon on Earth at any instant is minuscule due to its 3.8-day half-life. Estimates are in the range of kilograms to a few tonnes at most (1 tonne = 1,000 kg).\n\nComparing these two, the total amount of Radon on Earth is many orders of magnitude smaller than the total amount of Xenon. Therefore, among the naturally occurring noble gases known in 2002, Radon was the rarest.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nGiven that Oganesson was an undiscovered element in 2002, the pool of candidates is restricted to naturally occurring noble gases. Among these, Radon's extremely short half-life ensures that its total steady-state quantity on Earth is far smaller than that of any other noble gas, including Xenon. The year 2002 in the question reinforces this conclusion by excluding the then-undiscovered Oganesson.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
