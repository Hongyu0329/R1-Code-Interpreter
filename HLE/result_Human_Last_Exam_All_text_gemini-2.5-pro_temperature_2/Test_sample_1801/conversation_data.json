    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n    *   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **Which Company:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** The year 2000.\n    *   **What Tagline:** \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   **Key Adjective:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which implies a notable or notorious context, likely due to Enron's subsequent collapse in a massive scandal.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Context:**\n    *   Enron was an American energy company that went bankrupt in 2001 due to one of the largest accounting fraud scandals in history.\n    *   In the year 2000, before the scandal broke, Enron was trying to rebrand itself from a simple energy pipeline company into a sophisticated, innovative global commodities trader and market-maker.\n    *   To build this image of intellectual credibility and forward-thinking, Enron launched a high-profile advertising campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The campaign featured well-known intellectuals and experts discussing the future of business and markets.\n\n3.  **Identify the Laureates:**\n    *   The \"Ask Why\" campaign included a series of short television spots. Research into this specific ad campaign reveals the identities of the experts featured.\n    *   Two of the most prominent individuals featured in these commercials were economists who have been awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\n4.  **Analyze the First Laureate:**\n    *   **Name:** Paul Krugman.\n    *   **Status at the time (2000):** He was a very prominent and influential professor of economics at MIT.\n    *   **Nobel Prize:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although he was not a Nobel laureate at the exact moment the commercial aired, the question asks which two *Nobel laureates* were featured, a description that is accurate today. This is a common way this historical fact is referenced.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Laureate:**\n    *   **Name:** Myron Scholes.\n    *   **Status at the time (2000):** He was already a Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Nobel Prize:** He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Scholes's appearance is particularly infamous not only because of Enron's collapse but because he was also a founding partner of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which itself collapsed spectacularly in 1998, requiring a massive bailout organized by the Federal Reserve. His Enron commercial, where he discussed risk management, was therefore deeply ironic.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The two individuals who fit the description are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes. They were both featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign and are both recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
