    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Theoretical Framework:**\n    The objective is to find the value of the specific heat scaling exponent, denoted by $\\alpha$, for a physical system in $d=3$ dimensions. The method specified is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a key technique within the Renormalization Group (RG) theory for studying critical phenomena.\n\n2.  **Establish the Upper Critical Dimension and Epsilon ($\\epsilon$):**\n    The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method performed around the *upper critical dimension*, $d_c$. For a broad class of models exhibiting continuous phase transitions (specifically the O(n) or n-vector models, which include the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models as special cases), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n    The expansion parameter, $\\epsilon$, is defined as the deviation from this critical dimension:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - d$\n    For the physical dimension of interest, $d=3$, the value of epsilon is:\n    $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n3.  **Use Hyperscaling Relations:**\n    The critical exponents are not all independent but are linked by scaling and hyperscaling relations. The Josephson hyperscaling relation provides a direct link between the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    $d\\nu = 2 - \\alpha$\n    This relation is fundamental in RG theory and is valid for $d < d_c$. We can rearrange it to solve for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n4.  **Find the Correlation Length Exponent ($\\nu$) via Epsilon Expansion:**\n    The correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is one of the primary quantities calculated in the RG analysis. For the general O(n) model, the one-loop (first-order in $\\epsilon$) result for $\\nu$ is given by:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Here, 'n' represents the number of components of the order parameter (e.g., n=1 for the Ising model, n=2 for the XY model).\n\n5.  **Calculate $\\alpha$ as a Series in $\\epsilon$:**\n    Now, substitute the expressions for $d = 4-\\epsilon$ and the first-order expansion for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\n    Expand this expression and keep only the terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon) - (\\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n    Simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n    $\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2n+4 - n-8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n6.  **Apply to the Specific System ($d=3$):**\n    The question concerns a system in $d=3$, which means we set $\\epsilon=1$. Although the problem is stated generally for \"a system,\" it is conventional in this context (unless specified otherwise) to consider the simplest and most common case, the Ising model. The Ising model corresponds to a one-component order parameter, so we set $n=1$.\n\n7.  **Acquire the Final Answer:**\n    Substitute $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ into the first-order expression for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Choice of Model (n):** The result depends on 'n'. The choice of $n=1$ (Ising model) is a standard assumption for such a generally-phrased question.\n*   **Validity of Epsilon Expansion:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative series. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation, as the series is formally derived for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Therefore, the first-order result provides an approximation. Higher-order calculations are needed for greater accuracy (the current best estimate for $\\alpha$ in the 3D Ising model is $\\approx 0.110$, so the first-order result of $1/6 \\approx 0.167$ is in the right ballpark but not precise).\n*   **Hyperscaling:** The use of the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$ is crucial and is considered exact within the RG framework for dimensions below the upper critical dimension.\n\nBased on the standard, first-order epsilon expansion for the Ising universality class ($n=1$) applied to $d=3$ ($\\epsilon=1$), the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ is calculated to be $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
