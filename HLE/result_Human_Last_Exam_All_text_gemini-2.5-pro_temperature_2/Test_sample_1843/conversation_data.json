    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts and properties\n\n*   **Dirichlet Character Factorization:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime-power factors of $N$. Let the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. Then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be written as $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n*   **Conductor of a Product:** The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its factor characters: $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\text{cond}(\\chi_i)$. A character $\\chi \\pmod N$ is **primitive** if its conductor is $N$. This implies that each factor character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$ (i.e., $\\text{cond}(\\chi_i) = p_i^{a_i}$).\n\n*   **Order of a Product:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its factor characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\n*   **Number of Characters:** The group of characters modulo $m$, $(\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}})$, is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. If $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is a cyclic group of order $n=\\phi(m)$, then the number of characters of order $k$ (where $k|n$) is given by $\\phi(k)$, Euler's totient function.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize N and set up the problem\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of $N=36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 143) = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $N$ and order 6. We can write $\\chi$ as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\n\nThe problem constraints translate to the following conditions on the factor characters:\n1.  **Primitivity:** Each factor $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be primitive modulo its corresponding prime power.\n    *   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_4) = 4$\n    *   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_9) = 9$\n    *   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_7) = 7$\n    *   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_{11}) = 11$\n    *   $\\text{cond}(\\chi_{13}) = 13$\n2.  **Order:** $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n    This implies that the order of each factor character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count the valid characters for each prime-power factor\n\nWe need to count the number of primitive characters for each modulus whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters $(\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}})$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$.\n    *   There is one primitive character. Its order is 2.\n    *   Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice for $\\chi_4$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    *   Characters modulo 9 are non-primitive if they are induced from characters modulo 3. The character group modulo 3 is $C_2$, with characters of order 1 and 2.\n    *   The primitive characters modulo 9 are those whose orders are not 1 or 2. In $C_6$, the available orders are {1, 2, 3, 6}. So, primitive characters have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So, all 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    *   For a prime modulus, any non-principal character is primitive.\n    *   We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The available orders in $C_6$ are {1, 2, 3, 6}. Since we need primitive characters, the order cannot be 1. The orders {2, 3, 6} all divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$.\n    *   Any non-principal character is primitive. Possible orders are {2, 5, 10}.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. Of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$.\n    *   Any non-principal character is primitive. Possible orders are {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. Of {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}, the orders {2, 3, 6} divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the lcm condition and calculate the total number\n\nLet the orders of the chosen factor characters be $o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}$. We have found the possible values for these orders:\n*   $o_4 \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nNow we check if $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$ is always equal to 6.\n1.  All possible orders are divisors of 6, so their lcm must also divide 6.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of 2, because $o_4 = 2$ and $o_{11} = 2$. This condition is always met.\n3.  The lcm must be a multiple of 3. The order $o_9$ is either 3 or 6, so it is always a multiple of 3. This condition is always met.\n\nSince the lcm is always a multiple of 2 and 3, it is always a multiple of 6. Combined with point 1, the lcm for any combination of these allowed characters must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, any combination of the valid choices we counted will result in a character of order 6. The total number is the product of the number of choices for each factor.\n\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
