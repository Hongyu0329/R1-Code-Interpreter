    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the musical terms used in the question:\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord that feels like the point of rest or resolution. It is labeled with the Roman numeral I in a major key or i in a minor key.\n*   **Fifth chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. It's also called the dominant chord. In a major key, the dominant is a major chord (V). In a minor key, the natural dominant is a minor chord (v). The major dominant (V) is also very common in minor keys to create a stronger pull back to the tonic.\n*   **Minor fifth chord (v):** This specifically refers to the minor version of the dominant chord. The presence of a minor fifth chord strongly suggests the song is in a minor key, as this is the naturally occurring dominant chord in the natural minor scale. The progression would be from the tonic minor (i) to the dominant minor (v).\n*   **Chord jump:** This implies a direct and immediate change from the first chord (tonic) to the second chord (minor fifth). This should happen right at the beginning of the song.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song in a minor key that starts with the chord progression **i -> v**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Potential Candidates\n\nLet's think through some well-known Beatles songs, especially those with distinctive intros or those in minor keys.\n\n*   **\"And I Love Her\":** This song has a famous acoustic guitar intro and is in a minor key (F# minor is a common key, though some analyses place it in C# minor or E major with a minor verse). However, its progression does not start with i -> v. It uses a strong V chord (C#7) to lead back to the tonic F#m.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** Starts in A minor. The intro alternates between Am (the i chord) and E7 (the V7 chord, which is major, not minor). So, this is not the answer.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** The verse is in E minor. The iconic string intro goes from Em (the i chord) to a C major chord (the VI chord). This is not i -> v.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This song is largely in F minor. The tonic (i) is F minor. The fifth would be C. The intro progression moves from F minor to an augmented C chord (C+) and then to Ab major, so it's not a simple jump to a minor fifth chord (C minor).\n*   **\"A Day in the Life\":** The acoustic intro in G major (G -> Bm -> Em -> C) is not in a minor key and doesn't fit the pattern.\n*   **\"Because\":** This song from the album *Abbey Road* has a very distinct, haunting arpeggiated intro played on a harpsichord. Let's analyze its harmony.\n    *   **Key:** The song is in C-sharp minor (C#m).\n    *   **Tonic (i):** The tonic chord is therefore C# minor.\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** The fifth note of the C# minor scale is G#. The chord built on this note would be G# minor (v). The major version would be G# major (V).\n    *   **The Intro:** The song starts with a distinct, slow arpeggio. The very first chord played is **C# minor**. The arpeggio immediately moves to the next chord, which is **G# minor**.\n\nThis matches the criteria perfectly. The song \"Because\" begins with a clear chord jump (played as an arpeggio) from the tonic (C# minor) to the minor fifth (G# minor). This specific i -> v progression is what gives the song's intro its famously ambiguous and atmospheric quality.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe song is \"Because\" from the album *Abbey Road*. Its intro is a textbook example of the progression described in the question, moving from the tonic C# minor (i) directly to the minor fifth G# minor (v).\n\n<<<Because>>>"
