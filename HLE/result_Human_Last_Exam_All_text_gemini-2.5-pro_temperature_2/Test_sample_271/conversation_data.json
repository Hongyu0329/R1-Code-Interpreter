    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Factor the polynomial and analyze the factors.**\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo the roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of these two fields, $K = K_g K_h$.\n\n**2. Determine the Galois group of each factor.**\n*   For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension, so its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (which we will denote by $C_2$).\n\n*   For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:\n    *   **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The coefficients are $1, 0, 0, -9, 3$. All coefficients except the leading one are divisible by 3. The constant term $3$ is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois group:** The Galois group of $g(x)$, let's call it $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. Since $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, the order of $G_g$ is divisible by 5, so $G_g$ contains a 5-cycle.\n    *   **Number of real roots:** We examine the derivative: $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the real roots of $g'(x)$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points. Evaluating $g(x)$ at these points:\n        *   At $x = \\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$, $g(x)$ has a local minimum.\n        *   At $x = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 0$, $g(x)$ has a local maximum.\n        As $x \\to \\infty, g(x) \\to \\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty, g(x) \\to -\\infty$. A sketch shows that $g(x)$ must cross the x-axis three times. Thus, $g(x)$ has 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    *   The complex conjugation is an automorphism of $K_g$ that swaps the two complex roots and fixes the three real roots. As a permutation of the roots, it corresponds to a transposition.\n    *   A subgroup of $S_5$ that is generated by a 5-cycle and a transposition is $S_5$ itself. Therefore, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n**3. Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial.**\nThe Galois group of $K = K_gK_h$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. It is a subgroup of $G_g \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product $S_5 \\times C_2$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So we need to check if $\\sqrt{2} \\in K_g$.\nThe Galois group of $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there is exactly one subfield of $K_g$ of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $g(x)$.\nFor a polynomial $x^n+ax+b$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This field is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ since $-14863419$ is negative and not of the form $2k^2$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The order of $G$ is $|S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**4. Find all possible degrees of normal intermediate extensions.**\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ and $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, $L$ corresponds to a subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ of $G$.\n*   The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translates to $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\n*   The condition that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal translates to $H$ being a normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and compute their indices.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not limited to products of normal subgroups of the factors. In this case ($G_1=S_5, G_2=C_2$), there is one additional \"skew\" normal subgroup. The complete list of proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ is:\n1.  $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1| = |A_5| = 60$.\n2.  $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2| = |S_5| = 120$.\n3.  $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_3| = |C_2| = 2$.\n4.  $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_4| = |A_5| \\times |C_2| = 60 \\times 2 = 120$.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid c = \\text{sgn}(g)\\}$, where $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong C_2$ is the sign homomorphism. This is a subgroup of order $|S_5|=120$.\n\nNow we calculate the indices of these subgroups:\n*   $[G:H_1] = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n*   $[G:H_2] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[G:H_3] = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n*   $[G:H_4] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[G:H_5] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of possible degrees for such extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of these indices.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
