    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solution and the memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\n\n*   **Objective**: The program must read a string representing a sum of numbers, for example, \"3+2+1+4\", and output the same numbers sorted in non-decreasing order, joined by \"+\", like \"1+2+3+4\".\n*   **Input**: A string `s` containing single-digit numbers ('1', '2', '3', '4') and '+' symbols. The string length is at most 1000 characters.\n*   **Output**: A string representing the sorted sum.\n*   **Primary Constraint**: The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the amount of memory used for variables.\n*   **Task**: Calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used by the variables in this highly optimized C program.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\n1.  **Memory is Key**: The \"most memory-efficient\" constraint suggests that we should avoid storing the entire input string in a large array (e.g., `char s[1001]`), which would consume over 1 KB. Instead, we should process the input stream character by character.\n2.  **Sorting Method**: Since the numbers are limited to a very small set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the most efficient way to sort them is not a comparison-based sort (like quicksort or bubble sort) but **Counting Sort**. We can simply count the occurrences of each number (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) and then print them in order.\n3.  **Input Processing**: In C, the `getchar()` function is ideal for reading one character at a time from the standard input, thus avoiding a large buffer.\n4.  **Data Types**: To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest standard data type that can safely hold the required values.\n    *   The total number of summands is at most `(1000+1)/2 = 500.5`, so 501. The counts for each number will therefore be less than or equal to 501. A `short int` (typically 2 bytes, range -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient, whereas a `char` (typically 1 byte, range -128 to 127 or 0 to 255) is not.\n    *   `getchar()` returns an `int` to handle the `EOF` (End-of-File) value, so the variable holding its return value must be an `int`.\n    *   Loop counters will not exceed 501, so `short` is also suitable for them.\n5.  **Variable Reuse**: To further minimize memory, we can analyze if variables are used in disjoint phases of the program (e.g., one for reading, another for printing). If so, a `union` can be used to have them share the same memory location.\n6.  **Printing Logic**: The output format is `n1+n2+...+nk`. A naive implementation might use a flag to track whether to print a `+` sign. A more memory-efficient implementation would avoid this extra flag variable by handling the first term as a special case.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\nThis section details the design of the most memory-efficient program and calculates the total memory used by its variables, assuming standard data type sizes (`sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes).\n\n1.  **Input Reading and Counting**:\n    *   We read the input character by character. We only care about the digits '1', '2', '3', '4'.\n    *   We use an array of counters. Since the counts will not exceed 501, a `short` is the smallest appropriate type.\n    *   **Variable**: `short counts[4];`\n    *   **Memory**: `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n    *   We need a variable to store the result of `getchar()`. This must be an `int`.\n    *   **Variable**: `int c;`\n    *   **Memory**: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n2.  **Printing the Sorted Sum**:\n    *   After counting, we need to iterate from 1 to 4 and print each number the required number of times. This requires a loop.\n    *   To avoid an extra flag variable for handling the `+` sign, we can use a two-part strategy:\n        a. Find the very first number in the sorted sequence and print it.\n        b. Loop through all numbers from 1 to 4 again, printing the remaining ones, each preceded by a `+`.\n    *   This logic requires a loop counter, which can be a `short`.\n    *   **Variable**: `short i;`\n    *   **Memory**: `sizeof(short) = 2` bytes.\n\n3.  **Memory Optimization with `union`**:\n    *   The variable `c` (for `getchar`) is used only during the input reading phase. The variable `i` (loop counter) is used only during the printing phase. Since their lifetimes do not overlap, we can use a `union` to make them share memory.\n    *   **Variable**: `union { int c; short i; } utility_var;`\n    *   The size of a union is the size of its largest member. Here, the largest member is `int c`.\n    *   **Memory**: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n4.  **Final Variable List and Memory Calculation**:\n    Based on the most optimized design, we need only two declared variables in our `main` function:\n    1.  `short counts[4];` - To store the counts of numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n        *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n    2.  `union { int c; short i; } u;` - To be used as an `int` (`u.c`) for reading input and as a `short` (`u.i`) for the loop counter during printing.\n        *   Memory = `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n    **Total Memory (m)** = (Memory for `counts` array) + (Memory for `union`)\n    `m = 8 + 4`\n    `m = 12` bytes.\n\nThis approach is extremely memory-efficient, relying only on standard C features and data types to achieve minimal memory footprint while correctly solving the problem.\n\n<<<12>>>"
