    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a fixed point\nA fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. In this problem, we are looking for the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the functions f(x), g(x), and f(g(x))\n*   **f(x) and g(x):**\n    *   We are given that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3. Let their general forms be:\n        $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$\n        $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$\n        where $a$ and $p$ are non-zero.\n*   **Derivatives f'(x) and g'(x):**\n    *   The derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n        $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$\n        $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$\n    *   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive (the parabola must open upwards) and its discriminant must be negative (it must not touch or cross the x-axis).\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$ and $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 < 12ac \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$ and $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 < 12pr \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\n    *   A key consequence of $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions over the entire real line.\n*   **The composite function h(x) = f(g(x)):**\n    *   The degree of $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$. Since both are degree 3, the degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n    *   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if 9 fixed points is achievable\nWe now need to investigate if it's possible to choose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ having 9 distinct real roots.\n\n*   Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We need to show that $P(x)$ can have 9 distinct real roots.\n*   According to Rolle's Theorem, between any two distinct real roots of a differentiable function $P(x)$, there must be at least one real root of its derivative $P'(x)$.\n*   If $P(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative of $P(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n*   Let's analyze the degree of $P'(x)$:\n    *   The degree of $g(x)$ is 3.\n    *   The degree of $f'(x)$ is 2. So the degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The degree of $g'(x)$ is 2.\n    *   The degree of the product $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   Thus, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. This means that our condition is not immediately impossible.\n*   For $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P''(x)$, must have at least 7 distinct real roots.\n    *   $P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x))$.\n    *   Using the product rule and chain rule:\n        $P''(x) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    *   Let's check the degree of $P''(x)$:\n        *   deg($f''(x)$) = 1. deg($g(x)$) = 3 $\\implies$ deg($f''(g(x))$) = 3.\n        *   deg($g'(x)$) = 2 $\\implies$ deg($(g'(x))^2$) = 4.\n        *   deg($f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$) = $3+4=7$.\n        *   deg($f'(g(x))$) = 6. deg($g''(x)$) = 1.\n        *   deg($f'(g(x))g''(x)$) = $6+1=7$.\n    *   The leading terms do not cancel out, so the degree of $P''(x)$ is 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   **The core of the argument:** The existence of 9 fixed points depends on whether we can construct $f$ and $g$ such that a chain of conditions derived from Rolle's Theorem is met. We need $P(x)$ to have 9 roots. This requires $P'(x)$ to have 8 roots, which requires $P''(x)$ to have 7 roots.\n    1.  The polynomial $P''(x)$ has degree 7, so it can have 7 distinct real roots. It is possible to choose the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ to make this happen.\n    2.  If $P''(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots, then $P'(x)$ has 7 local extrema. Since $P'(x)$ is a degree 8 polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, it has 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. The equation we need to have 8 roots is $P'(x)=0$, which means $f'(g(x))g'(x)=1$.\n    3.  By carefully choosing the parameters of $f$ and $g$, we can position the graph of $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ so that all 3 local maxima are above the line $y=1$ and all 4 local minima are below the line $y=1$. The condition that $g'(x) > 0$ and $f'(x) > 0$ implies $H(x) > 0$, so the local minima would be between 0 and 1. This configuration allows for 8 distinct intersections, meaning $P'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct roots.\n    4.  If $P'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, $P(x)$ has 8 local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima). By choosing the constant terms of $f$ and $g$ appropriately (which adds a constant to $P(x)$), we can shift the graph of $P(x)$ vertically to ensure that the 4 local maxima are above the x-axis and the 4 local minima are below it. This guarantees that $P(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x))=x$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9. It can therefore have at most 9 real roots. The analysis above demonstrates that it is plausible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ satisfying the given conditions such that the equation has 9 distinct real solutions. There is no theorem or property that limits the number of fixed points to be less than 9. Therefore, the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
