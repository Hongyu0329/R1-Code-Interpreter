    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the Wittig reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl Compound):** Pivalaldehyde. The \"pival-\" prefix refers to the t-butyl group ((CH3)3C-). \"Aldehyde\" indicates a -CHO functional group. Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde (systematic name: 2,2-dimethylpropanal) is:\n    (CH3)3C-CHO\n*   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ5-phosphane\" indicates a P(Ph)3 group.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the organic part attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" means a two-carbon chain attached at C1. A \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" substituent is on the C2 position.\n    *   The structure of the ylide is: Ph3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl), where C6H4-2-Cl is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a carbonyl group (C=O) into an alkene (C=C).\n\n**2. Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\n\nThe Wittig reaction replaces the C=O double bond of the aldehyde with a C=C double bond, where the new carbon comes from the ylide.\n*   The aldehyde contributes the `(CH3)3C-CH=` part.\n*   The ylide contributes the `=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl)` part.\n*   These two fragments combine to form the alkene product. The oxygen from the aldehyde and the `PPh3` from the ylide combine to form the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh3).\n*   The skeletal structure of the product is: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Alkene Product**\n\nThe stereochemistry (whether the product is the E or Z isomer) of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the phosphorus ylide.\n*   **Ylide Classification:** The ylide in this reaction, Ph3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl), is considered a **non-stabilized ylide**. The ylidic carbon (the one bonded to P) is attached to a hydrogen and an alkyl-like group (-CH2-Ar). There are no electron-withdrawing groups (like C=O, -CN, -COOR) directly attached to and conjugating with the ylidic carbon to stabilize the negative charge of its carbanion form.\n*   **Stereoselectivity Rule:** For reactions involving non-stabilized ylides with aldehydes, the reaction is under kinetic control and typically produces the **(Z)-alkene** (or cis-alkene) as the major product. This is because the transition state leading to the Z-alkene minimizes the steric repulsion between the bulkiest groups of the reactants (the t-butyl group from the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide).\n*   **Applying the Rule:** The product will be the (Z)-isomer. To confirm the \"Z\" designation, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the substituents on the double bond.\n    *   On the carbon from pivalaldehyde: The substituents are -C(CH3)3 (t-butyl) and -H. The t-butyl group has higher priority.\n    *   On the carbon from the ylide: The substituents are -CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl) (2-chlorobenzyl group) and -H. The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority.\n    *   In the (Z)-isomer, the two higher-priority groups are on the same side of the C=C double bond.\n\nThe structure of the (Z)-isomer is:\n```\n  (CH3)3C \\      / CH2-Ar\n           C = C\n          /      \\\n         H        H\n  (where Ar = 2-chlorophenyl)\n```\n\n**4. Name the Final Product**\n\n*   **Find the parent chain:** The longest continuous carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons. So, the parent name is **pentene**.\n*   **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant.\n    *   Numbering from the t-butyl side: The double bond starts at C3.\n    *   Numbering from the phenyl side: The double bond starts at C2.\n    *   Therefore, we number from the phenyl side:\n        `Cl-C6H4-CH2(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH3)3`\n    *   The double bond is at position 2, so the parent name is **pent-2-ene**.\n*   **Identify and name substituents:**\n    *   At C1, there is a 2-chlorophenyl group: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)**.\n    *   At C4, there are two methyl groups: **4,4-dimethyl**.\n*   **Assemble the name:** Putting all parts together, including the stereochemistry, the final name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
