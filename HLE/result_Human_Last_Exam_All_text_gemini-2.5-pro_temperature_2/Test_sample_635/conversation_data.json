    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**Question:** Calculate a left coprime factorization of the following transfer function:\n\\[ H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe factorization should be in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are looking for two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1. $D(s)$ is invertible (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not the zero polynomial).\n2. $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which is equivalent to $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n3. $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means they do not share any common non-unimodular left divisors. A practical test for this is that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n4. For a minimal factorization, the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ should be equal to the McMillan degree of $H(s)$. The McMillan degree is the minimal order of a state-space realization of $H(s)$ and equals the degree of the least common denominator of all minors of $H(s)$.\n   - The minors of $H(s)$ are:\n     - $1 \\times 1$ minors: $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}, 1, \\frac{2}{s^2-1}, 0$.\n     - $2 \\times 2$ minor (the determinant): $\\det(H(s)) = (\\frac{s-1}{s+1})(0) - (1)(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}) = \\frac{-2}{s^2-1}$.\n   - The least common denominator for all these minors is $s^2-1$. Its degree is 2. So, we are looking for a $D(s)$ such that $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$**\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The equation becomes:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nMultiplying the matrices on the left side:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n- From the second column, we must have $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. This means $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n- For the first column entries to be polynomials, we need to eliminate the denominators. The least common denominator is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\nLet's write the first column entries with this common denominator:\n$n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n$n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\nFor these to be polynomials, the numerators must be divisible by $s^2-1$, which means the numerators must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Derive Conditions on the elements of D(s)**\n1.  **For $n_{11}(s)$:** The numerator $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    - At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1)=0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{12}(s)$.\n    - At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1)+2d_{12}(-1)=0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1)+d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n2.  **For $n_{21}(s)$:** The numerator $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    - At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1)=0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{22}(s)$.\n    - At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1)+2d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct a suitable D(s) matrix**\nWe need to find the simplest polynomials that satisfy these conditions and result in $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = 2$.\n\n*   **First row of D(s):** Let's try simple polynomials for $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$.\n    Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$. The condition becomes $2(1)+d_{12}(-1)=0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$.\n    We also have the condition $d_{12}(1)=0$. Let's try the lowest degree polynomial for $d_{12}(s)$, i.e., $d_{12}(s)=as+b$.\n    - $a(1)+b = 0 \\implies a+b=0$\n    - $a(-1)+b = -2 \\implies -a+b=-2$\n    Adding the two equations gives $2b=-2 \\implies b=-1$. Then $a=1$.\n    So, $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    The first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **Second row of D(s):** We have conditions $d_{22}(1)=0$ and $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n    Also, $\\det(D(s)) = d_{11}d_{22}-d_{12}d_{21} = 1 \\cdot d_{22}(s) - (s-1)d_{21}(s)$. We need this determinant to have degree 2.\n    From $d_{22}(1)=0$, we can write $d_{22}(s) = e(s)(s-1)$ for some polynomial $e(s)$.\n    $\\det(D(s)) = e(s)(s-1) - (s-1)d_{21}(s) = (s-1)(e(s)-d_{21}(s))$.\n    To get a degree 2 determinant, the term $(e(s)-d_{21}(s))$ should be a polynomial of degree 1, say $k(s+1)$ for some constant $k \\neq 0$. This would make $\\det(D(s))=k(s-1)(s+1)$.\n    Let's choose a simple form. Let $e(s)$ be a constant, say $e$. Then $d_{22}(s) = e(s-1)$.\n    And let $d_{21}(s)$ be a degree 1 polynomial, say $cs+d$.\n    We must satisfy $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies 2(-c+d)+e(-1-1)=0 \\implies -c+d-e=0 \\implies d=c+e$.\n    So $d_{21}(s) = cs+(c+e)$.\n    Also, $\\det(D(s)) = e(s-1) - (s-1)(cs+c+e) = (s-1)(e - (cs+c+e)) = (s-1)(-cs-c) = -c(s-1)(s+1) = -c(s^2-1)$.\n    To get degree 2, we need $c \\neq 0$. Let's pick the simplest non-zero value, $c=-1$.\n    Then $d=-1+e$. Let's pick a simple value for $e$, say $e=1$. Then $d=0$.\n    This gives:\n    $d_{21}(s) = -s$\n    $d_{22}(s) = 1(s-1) = s-1$.\n    The second row of $D(s)$ is $[-s \\quad s-1]$.\n\nSo, our candidate matrix is:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -s & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nIts determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1(s-1) - (-s)(s-1) = (s-1)(1+s) = s^2-1$. The degree is 2, as required.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate N(s)**\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n$N_{11}(s) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$.\n$N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n$N_{21}(s) = \\frac{-s(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(-s(s-1)+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{-s^2+s+2}{s+1} = \\frac{-(s-2)(s+1)}{s+1} = -(s-2) = 2-s$.\n$N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = -s$.\n\nSo, our candidate numerator matrix is:\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n**Step 6: Verify Left Coprimeness**\nWe need to check that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank (rank 2) for all complex $s$. The rank can drop only if the rows are linearly dependent for some $s_0$.\nLet's check for linear dependence for the matrix $M(s) = [D(s) \\quad N(s)]$:\n\\[ M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -s & s-1 & 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe two rows are linearly dependent if Row 2 = $\\lambda \\times$ Row 1 for some constant $\\lambda$.\nComparing the first elements gives: $-s = \\lambda \\cdot 1 \\implies \\lambda = -s$. Since $\\lambda$ must be a constant independent of $s$, this can't hold for all $s$. But we must check if it holds for specific values of $s$. So we seek $s_0$ and $\\lambda$ such that Row 2 at $s_0$ = $\\lambda \\times$ Row 1 at $s_0$.\nThe condition is $[ -s_0 \\quad s_0-1 \\quad 2-s_0 \\quad -s_0 ] = \\lambda [ 1 \\quad s_0-1 \\quad 1 \\quad 1 ]$.\nFrom the 1st component: $-s_0 = \\lambda$.\nFrom the 2nd component: $s_0-1 = \\lambda(s_0-1)$. This implies either $s_0=1$ or $\\lambda=1$.\n- Case 1: $s_0 = 1$. Then the first component gives $\\lambda = -1$. Let's check the other components.\n  - 3rd component: $2-1 = \\lambda(1) \\implies 1 = \\lambda$. So we need $\\lambda = 1$. This contradicts $\\lambda = -1$. Thus, no linear dependence at $s_0=1$.\n- Case 2: $\\lambda = 1$. The first component gives $-s_0 = 1 \\implies s_0 = -1$. Let's check the other components.\n  - 3rd component: $2-s_0 = \\lambda(1) \\implies 2-(-1) = 1(1) \\implies 3=1$. This is a contradiction. Thus, no linear dependence at $s_0=-1$.\n\nSince there is no complex number $s$ for which the rows are linearly dependent, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s$. Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe calculated matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ form a valid left coprime factorization of $H(s)$.\n\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -s & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2-s & -s \\end{bmatrix}$"
