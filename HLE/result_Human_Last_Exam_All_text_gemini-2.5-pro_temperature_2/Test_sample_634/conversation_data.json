    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept**\n\nA polynomial matrix `D(s)` is a **right divisor** of another polynomial matrix `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)D(s)`.\n\nA **common right divisor (CRD)** of two matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` is a right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n\nThe **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)**, `D(s)`, is a CRD that is right-divisible by any other CRD, `C(s)`. This means there exists a polynomial matrix `K(s)` such that `D(s) = K(s)C(s)`. The GCRD is not unique; if `D(s)` is a GCRD, then so is `U(s)D(s)` where `U(s)` is any unimodular matrix (a square polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). We usually seek a GCRD in a simplified or canonical form, such as row-reduced echelon form.\n\n**2. Method: Matrix Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nThe most common method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm for matrices. This involves the following steps:\n1.  Form a stacked matrix `M(s)` by combining the two matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` vertically:\n    `M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n2.  Use elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to a form where there are `n` non-zero rows (where `n` is the number of columns) and the rest are zero rows. The elementary row operations allowed are:\n    i. Swapping two rows.\n    ii. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    iii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n3.  The non-zero rows obtained at the end of the reduction process form the rows of the GCRD.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet the given matrices be:\n`P1(s) = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]`\n`P2(s) = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]`\n\n**Step 3.1: Form the stacked matrix M(s)**\n\n`M(s) = [s^2 + s, -s;     -> R1`\n        `-s^2 - 1, s^2;    -> R2`\n        `s, 0;             -> R3`\n        `-s - 1, 1]`     `-> R4`\n\n**Step 3.2: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M(s)**\n\nThe goal is to introduce zero rows. We will use `R3` and `R4` to simplify `R1` and `R2`. Let's use `R3 = [s, 0]` as a pivot row to eliminate the first elements of other rows.\n\n*   To eliminate `s^2 + s` in `R1`, we perform the operation: `R1_new = R1 - (s+1) * R3`\n    `R1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s - 0] = [0, -s]`\n\n*   To eliminate `-s^2 - 1` in `R2`, we perform: `R2_new = R2 + s * R3`\n    `R2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]`\n\n*   To eliminate `-s - 1` in `R4`, we perform: `R4_new = R4 + 1 * R3`\n    `R4_new = [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`\n\nAfter these operations, the matrix of row vectors that span the same module is:\n`M'(s) = [0, -s;         -> R1_new`\n         `[-1, s^2];        -> R2_new`\n         `[s, 0];         -> R3`\n         `[-1, 1]]`       `-> R4_new`\n\n**Step 3.3: Continue the reduction**\n\nLet's use `R4_new = [-1, 1]` as the new pivot row, as it's the simplest. We'll use it to eliminate elements in other rows.\n\n*   To eliminate the `-1` in `R2_new`: `R2_new' = R2_new - R4_new`\n    `R2_new' = [-1, s^2] - [-1, 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]`\n\n*   To eliminate the `s` in `R3`: `R3_new = R3 + s * R4_new`\n    `R3_new = [s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]`\n\nNow the spanning set of rows is `{ [0, -s], [0, s^2 - 1], [0, s], [-1, 1] }`.\nLet's list them cleanly:\n`R_a = [-1, 1]`\n`R_b = [0, s]` (from the new R3)\n`R_c = [0, -s]` (from the new R1)\n`R_d = [0, s^2 - 1]` (from the new R2)\n\nNow we reduce the rows that have a leading zero, using `R_b = [0, s]` as a pivot.\n\n*   Reduce `R_c`: `R_c_new = R_c + R_b`\n    `R_c_new = [0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   Reduce `R_d`: `R_d_new = R_d - s * R_b`\n    `R_d_new = [0, s^2 - 1] - s[0, s] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2] = [0, -1]`\n\nThe set of non-zero spanning rows is now `{ [-1, 1], [0, s], [0, -1] }`.\nLet's perform a final reduction step using `[0, -1]` as the pivot.\n\n*   Reduce `[-1, 1]`: `[-1, 1] + 1 * [0, -1] = [-1, 0]`\n\n*   Reduce `[0, s]`: `[0, s] + s * [0, -1] = [0, 0]`\n\nAfter all reductions, the only non-zero rows left are `[-1, 0]` and `[0, -1]`.\n\n**Step 4. Construct the GCRD**\n\nThe final non-zero rows `[-1, 0]` and `[0, -1]` form the rows of the GCRD.\n`D(s) = [-1, 0; 0, -1]`\n\n**Step 5. Normalize the GCRD**\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. We can choose a simpler or more standard form. Multiplying `D(s)` by the unimodular matrix `U(s) = [-1, 0; 0, -1]` (note `det(U)=1`) gives:\n`GCRD = U(s)D(s) = [-1, 0; 0, -1] * [-1, 0; 0, -1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I`\n\nThis matrix is the identity matrix, `I`. It is in row-reduced echelon form, which is a standard canonical form.\n\nThe fact that the GCRD is the identity matrix means that the matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are **right coprime**.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n```\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\n```\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
