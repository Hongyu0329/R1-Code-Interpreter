    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in two parts.**\n\nThe curve is defined differently for two intervals of the parameter `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: For `t` in `[0, π]`**\n    *   In this interval, `b = 1`.\n    *   The parametric equations are: $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   We can recognize this as the parameterization of a circle. The equation relating x and y is $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    *   As `t` varies from 0 to $\\pi$, `y = sin(t)` is always non-negative ($y \\ge 0$).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of a unit circle centered at the origin, starting from $(1, 0)$ (at $t=0$) and ending at $(-1, 0)$ (at $t=\\pi$).\n    *   For this part:\n        *   The x-values range from -1 to 1.\n        *   The y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n*   **Part 2: For `t` in `(π, 2π)`**\n    *   In this interval, `b = 5`.\n    *   The parametric equations are: $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    *   This is the parameterization of an ellipse. The equation is $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which simplifies to $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is a vertical ellipse with a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis and a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis.\n    *   As `t` varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, `y = 5sin(t)` is always non-positive ($y \\le 0$).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the lower semi-ellipse, starting from $(-1, 0)$ (as $t \\to \\pi^{+}$) and ending at $(1, 0)$ (as $t \\to 2\\pi^{-}$).\n    *   For this part:\n        *   The x-values range from -1 to 1.\n        *   The y-values range from -5 (at $t=3\\pi/2$) to 0.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure.**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates of the entire figure. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** Both parts of the curve have $x = \\cos t$. Over the full interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:** We combine the ranges from both parts.\n    *   From Part 1, the y-values are in $[0, 1]$.\n    *   From Part 2, the y-values are in $[-5, 0]$.\n    *   The total range for y is the union of these two intervals, which is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the side length of the smallest outcircling square.**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. To enclose this rectangle within a square, the side length of the square must be at least as large as the larger of the rectangle's dimensions (its width and height).\n\n*   Side length of the smallest square, `s` = max(Width, Height).\n*   `s` = max(2, 6) = 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of this square.**\n\nThe area of a square is the square of its side length.\n\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n1.  The figure consists of an upper unit semi-circle and a lower semi-ellipse with semi-axes 1 and 5.\n2.  The maximum horizontal extent (width) is from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, so the width is 2.\n3.  The maximum vertical extent (height) is from the bottom of the semi-ellipse ($y=-5$) to the top of the semi-circle ($y=1$), so the height is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n4.  The smallest square enclosing a shape with width 2 and height 6 must have a side length equal to the maximum of these two dimensions, which is 6.\n5.  The area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
