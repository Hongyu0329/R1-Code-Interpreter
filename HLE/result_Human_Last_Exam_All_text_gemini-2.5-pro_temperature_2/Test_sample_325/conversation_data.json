    "Answering this question requires understanding the sharp $l^2$ decoupling theory for curves, a result established by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. The sharp decoupling exponent depends on the geometry of the curve and the Lebesgue exponent $p$. The question asks for a single number, which is typically interpreted as the maximum value of the decoupling exponent over the relevant range of $p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is given by $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. This is a segment of a helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. To apply the decoupling theorems, we need to check its non-degeneracy properties by computing its derivatives:\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nWe compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors to check for linear independence:\n$$ \\det(\\gamma', \\gamma'', \\gamma''') = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ \\cos t & -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\end{pmatrix} = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1 $$\nSince the determinant is non-zero (it's 1 for all $t$), the vectors $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. This means the curve has non-vanishing curvature and non-vanishing torsion. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for which the first $n$ derivatives are linearly independent is called a \"moment-like\" curve. Our helix is a moment-like curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is the highest level of non-degeneracy for a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 2: State the decoupling inequality and define the exponent.**\nLet $f$ be a function whose Fourier transform is supported in the $R^{-1}$-neighborhood of the curve $\\gamma([0,1])$. We partition this neighborhood into \"caps\" $\\theta$, where each cap corresponds to a subinterval of $[0,1]$ of length approximately $R^{-1/2}$. Let $f_\\theta$ be the frequency projection of $f$ onto the cap $\\theta$. The $l^2$ decoupling inequality is of the form:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^3)} \\leq C_\\epsilon R^{\\delta(p)+\\epsilon} \\left( \\sum_{\\theta} \\|f_\\theta\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^3)}^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe function $\\delta(p)$ is the decoupling exponent for the $L^p$ norm. The sharp exponent is the smallest possible non-negative function $\\delta(p)$ for which this inequality holds.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth (BDG) theorem.**\nFor moment-like curves in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the BDG theorem provides the sharp range of $p$ and the corresponding exponents.\n*   **Critical exponent ($p_c$):** For a moment-like curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the decoupling exponent $\\delta(p)$ is zero for $p \\geq p_c = n(n+1)$. For our case, $n=3$, so $p_c = 3(3+1) = 12$. Thus, for $p \\geq 12$, $\\delta(p)=0$.\n*   **Decoupling exponent for $2 \\leq p \\leq p_c$:** For $p$ in this range, the exponent is positive. The sharp exponent function $\\delta(p)$ is a convex function of $1/p$. It is known to be composed of two linear segments in $1/p$. This shape is sometimes called a \"tent\".\n\n**Step 4: Determine the formula for the decoupling exponent.**\nThe shape of the exponent function $\\delta(p)$ is determined by interpolating different estimates:\n1.  **Bilinear (or local) estimate:** This arises from localizing the problem to two caps and provides an upper bound. This corresponds to a simple interpolation between the trivial $L^2$ estimate ($\\delta(2)=0$) and the trivial $L^\\infty$ estimate ($\\delta(\\infty)=1/4$, where the number of caps is $\\sim R^{1/2}$). This gives the linear function $\\delta_{\\text{bilin}}(p) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2p}$.\n2.  **Multilinear estimate:** This is the deep input from the BDG theory, which comes from Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem.\n\nIt is known that the bilinear estimate is sharp for the upper range of $p$, i.e., for $p_0 \\leq p \\leq 12$. So, for this range, $\\delta(p) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2p}$. For $2 \\leq p \\leq p_0$, the exponent follows a different line, dictated by the multilinear theory. The point $p_0$ is the transition point where the bilinear and multilinear estimates match.\n\nFor moment-like curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the transition point is conjectured and widely believed to be $p_0 = 6$. This is the point where the multilinear estimate based on trilinear interactions becomes dominant.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate \"the\" sharp exponent.**\nThe question asks for a single value. This is conventionally interpreted as the maximum value of the decoupling exponent, $\\max_p \\delta(p)$. This maximum value occurs at the transition point $p_0$. Assuming $p_0=6$, the maximum exponent is:\n$$ \\delta_{\\max} = \\delta(p_0) = \\delta(6) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{3-1}{12} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThe value $1/6$ represents the pinnacle of the \"tent\" describing the decoupling exponent as a function of $p$. It signifies the maximum \"gain\" provided by the decoupling inequality over the range of available Lebesgue spaces.\n\nFinal calculation:\n- Curve: Helix $\\gamma(t)=(\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$, a moment-like curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n- Critical Lebesgue exponent from BDG theory: $p_c=12$.\n- Decoupling exponent $\\delta(p)$ is 0 for $p \\ge 12$.\n- For $p_0 \\le p \\le 12$, the exponent is given by the bilinear estimate: $\\delta(p) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2p}$.\n- The transition point is $p_0=6$.\n- The sharp exponent is the maximum value, achieved at $p=p_0=6$.\n- $\\delta_{\\max} = \\delta(6) = 1/4 - 1/12 = 1/6$."
