    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the number of objects of a specific type that fail to have a specific property. Let's break down the components:\n1.  **The ambient space:** \"the standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". This is a specific 2-dimensional simplicial complex, let's call it `K`.\n2.  **The object:** A \"higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$\". This is a pair where `F` is a subcomplex of `K` and `R` is a subset of the vertices of `K`, called the root set. The term \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" implies a specific defining property that the pair `(F,R)` must satisfy.\n3.  **The property to be checked:** The forest `F` must \"simplicially collapse onto the root R\".\n4.  **The final count:** We need to count the number of pairs `(F,R)` that are higher dimensional rooted forests BUT for which `F` *fails* to simplicially collapse onto `R`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Key Concepts\nTo answer the question, we must have precise definitions for the terms used. These definitions come from the field of combinatorial algebraic topology.\n\n*   **Simplicial Complex and Subcomplex:** A simplicial complex `K` is a set of simplices (vertices, edges, triangles, etc.) that is closed under taking faces (e.g., if a triangle is in `K`, its edges and vertices must also be in `K`). A subcomplex `F` is a subset of the simplices of `K` which is also a simplicial complex.\n\n*   **Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest:** Let `K` be a simplicial complex and `R ⊆ V(K)` be a set of vertices (the roots). A pair `(F,R)`, where `F` is a subcomplex of `K`, is called a higher dimensional rooted forest (or simply an `R`-forest) if it satisfies a particular condition. The standard definition found in the literature (for example, in the works of A. Duval, C. Klivans, and J. Martin) is:\n    *   For every simplex `σ` in the forest `F`, the set of its vertices that are also in the root set `R` (i.e., `V(σ) ∩ R`) must themselves form the vertex set of a simplex that belongs to `F`.\n\n*   **Simplicial Collapse onto the Root:** This means that the complex `F` can be reduced to the subcomplex induced by the root set `R` through a sequence of elementary simplicial collapses. Let `F[R]` denote the subcomplex of `F` consisting of all simplices whose vertices are entirely contained within `R`. The statement \"F simplicially collapses onto the root R\" is formally interpreted as \"F simplicially collapses to F[R]\".\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Apply the Relevant Mathematical Theorem\nThe core of this problem lies in a fundamental theorem that connects the two main concepts defined above.\n\n**Theorem:** (Duval, Klivans, Martin, 2012) A subcomplex `F` of a simplicial complex `K` is an `R`-forest (for a given root set `R`) if and only if `F` simplicially collapses to `F[R]`.\n\nThis theorem states that the property of being a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" is perfectly equivalent to the property of being \"simplicially collapsible onto its root\".\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis and Find the Answer\nLet's re-examine the question in light of this theorem.\n\n1.  Let `P` be the property that `(F,R)` is a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\".\n2.  Let `Q` be the property that \"F simplicially collapses onto the root R\".\n3.  The theorem states `P` is true if and only if `Q` is true (`P ⇔ Q`).\n4.  The question asks to count the number of pairs `(F,R)` for which `P` is true and `Q` is false.\n5.  This is equivalent to finding the size of the set of pairs `(F,R)` that satisfy the logical proposition `P AND (NOT Q)`.\n6.  Because `P ⇔ Q`, the proposition `P AND (NOT Q)` is a logical contradiction (it is equivalent to `P AND (NOT P)`).\n7.  There can be no mathematical object that satisfies a contradictory statement. The set of such objects is the empty set.\n8.  The number of elements in the empty set is 0.\n\nThe specific details of the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" are irrelevant to this question, as the theorem holds for any simplicial complex `K`. The information is extraneous and intended to distract from the core logical and definitional nature of the problem.\n\nThus, there are no higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root, by definition (or, more precisely, by a fundamental theorem that elevates the property to an equivalent definition).\n\nFinal Answer with step by step analysis:\n1.  Let's denote the property of `(F,R)` being a higher dimensional rooted forest by `PROP_forest`.\n2.  Let's denote the property of the forest `F` simplicially collapsing onto the root `R` by `PROP_collapse`.\n3.  The question asks for the number of pairs `(F,R)` for which `PROP_forest` is true and `PROP_collapse` is false.\n4.  A key theorem in combinatorial algebraic topology by Duval, Klivans, and Martin states that for any simplicial complex `K` and any root set `R`, `PROP_forest` is true if and only if `PROP_collapse` is true.\n5.  Therefore, the set of pairs `(F,R)` for which `PROP_forest` is true is identical to the set of pairs for which `PROP_collapse` is true.\n6.  Consequently, there are no pairs `(F,R)` for which `PROP_forest` is true while `PROP_collapse` is false. The set of such pairs is empty.\n7.  The number of elements in the empty set is 0. The specific structure of the triangulation of the Möbius band is irrelevant."
