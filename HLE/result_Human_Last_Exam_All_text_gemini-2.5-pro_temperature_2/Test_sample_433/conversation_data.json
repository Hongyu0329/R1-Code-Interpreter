    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What is the BUD?**: BUD stands for Beyond-Use Date. This is the date and time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or an opened sterile container must not be used. It is determined based on the risk of microbial contamination and the chemical stability of the drug.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container Ampule**: This specifies the type of container. An ampule is a hermetically sealed glass container. Once broken open, it cannot be resealed. It is a \"single-dose\" container, meaning it is intended for a single patient for a single procedure and typically lacks antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **From the time of puncture**: \"Puncture\" for an ampule means breaking its neck to open it.\n    *   **In a sterile environment**: This specifies the conditions under which the ampule is opened. This typically refers to an ISO Class 5 primary engineering control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC).\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Standards:**\n    *   The primary authority for sterile compounding standards in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. The rules for BUDs are detailed in this chapter.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics of an Ampule:**\n    *   The most critical characteristic of an ampule is that once it is opened, it is an **open system**. Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper that can be re-punctured, an ampule remains open to the surrounding environment after its neck is snapped.\n    *   This open system poses a high risk of microbial and particulate contamination, even within a sterile ISO Class 5 environment.\n\n4.  **Consult USP <797> Guidelines:**\n    *   USP <797> makes a clear distinction between different types of single-dose containers.\n    *   **For single-dose vials** (with a rubber stopper): When opened or punctured inside an ISO Class 5 environment, they may be used for up to **12 hours**.\n    *   **For ampules**: The guideline is much stricter. Because they cannot be resealed, USP <797> states that opened ampules **must not be stored for any period**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information to Determine the BUD:**\n    *   The fact that the ampule is opened in a sterile environment does not change the fundamental issue: it's an open, unsealable container.\n    *   Therefore, the contents must be withdrawn and used immediately after the ampule is opened.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved, stored, or used later.\n    *   The term \"immediate use\" is the official designation. This means the intended dose should be prepared and administered without delay. No storage time is permitted.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rule for an ampule with the rule for a single-dose *vial*. A vial's rubber stopper provides a barrier that allows for a 12-hour BUD in an ISO Class 5 environment, a provision that does not apply to open ampules.\n*   **Definition of \"Immediate Use\":** In this context, \"immediate use\" means there is no storage allowed. The entire process from opening the ampule to administering the dose should be one continuous action without interruption.\n*   **Rationale:** The rule is based on the high risk of contamination. Once an ampule is broken, it's open to the air, and microscopic glass particulates may have been introduced into the solution. These factors make any storage unsafe.\n*   **Environment Irrelevance for Storage:** While the ampule must be opened in a sterile environment for aseptic technique, this environment does not grant a storage period for the opened ampule itself. The sterile environment is for preparing the dose, not for storing the source container.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the official guidelines from USP <797> and the physical nature of an ampule, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is immediate. No storage period is allowed once the container is opened.\n\n<<<Immediate use only. Once opened, an ampule cannot be stored and any unused contents must be discarded immediately."
