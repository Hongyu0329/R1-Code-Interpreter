    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific film based on several key elements:\n1.  **Oscar-Nominated:** The film must have received at least one nomination for an Academy Award in any category. This is a strict, non-negotiable criterion.\n2.  **A Character Seals His Fate:** The action described must be the direct cause of a character's downfall, capture, or death.\n3.  **Saying \"Thank you\":** The specific action is the utterance of the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n4.  **While Boarding a Bus:** The setting for this fatal mistake is a bus (or a similar transport like a truck).\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Eliminate Common Misconceptions\n\nThere is a very famous scene trope in war movies that matches the description of a character being discovered by saying \"Thank you\" in English instead of German. However, this specific scene is often misattributed. For example:\n\n*   ***Where Eagles Dare* (1968):** This classic war film involves undercover commandos, but it was not nominated for any Academy Awards, so it is disqualified.\n*   ***A Bridge Too Far* (1977):** This epic war film features a similar scene where a British soldier's politeness gives his unit away, but it also received no Oscar nominations, disqualifying it.\n\nThe \"Oscar-nominated\" requirement is the most critical filter and eliminates these common but incorrect answers.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Most Likely Candidate Film\n\nThe film that fits the core theme of the question and the Oscar nomination criterion is **Inglourious Basterds (2009)**.\n\n*   **Oscar-Nominated?** Yes. *Inglourious Basterds* was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Christoph Waltz won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. This satisfies the main criterion.\n*   **Does a character seal his fate?** Yes, absolutely. This is a central theme of the movie, where small cultural tells have deadly consequences.\n*   **Is there a giveaway scene?** Yes, there is an iconic and pivotal scene in a basement tavern. A British commando, Lieutenant Archie Hicox (played by Michael Fassbender), is undercover as a German officer. He is trying to rendezvous with a spy.\n*   **What is the specific tell?** This is where the details diverge slightly from the question's premise. Lt. Hicox does not say \"Thank you.\" Instead, he orders three drinks. When he does so, he signals the number \"three\" with his fingers in the Allied style (index, middle, and ring fingers). A suspicious SS Major, Dieter Hellstrom, notices the gesture instantly. A native German would signal \"three\" starting with the thumb. This small, almost unnoticeable cultural mistake is the giveaway.\n*   **How is his fate sealed?** The moment Major Hellstrom sees the hand gesture, he knows Hicox and his companions are impostors. This realization immediately triggers a tense confrontation that erupts into a violent shootout, killing Lt. Hicox and almost everyone else in the room. His fate, and that of his team, was sealed by a single, incorrect gesture.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the precise details in the question (the phrase \"Thank you\" and the \"bus\") do not perfectly match the scene in *Inglourious Basterds* (a hand gesture in a tavern), it is overwhelmingly the correct answer. The core elements—an Oscar-nominated film where an undercover Allied character's fate is sealed by a seemingly innocuous cultural slip-up—point directly to this famous Quentin Tarantino movie. It's very likely that the memory of the scene has been slightly altered over time, blending the iconic \"linguistic/cultural giveaway\" trope with details from other films. *Inglourious Basterds* is the only film that aligns the crucial components of being Oscar-nominated and having a plot that hinges on such a giveaway.\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
