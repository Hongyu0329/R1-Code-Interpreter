    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\n*   **Definition:** Trisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. It caused a long vowel or diphthong in a stressed syllable to become a short (lax) vowel if it was followed by two or more syllables. In simpler terms, a vowel often shortens when it's in the third syllable from the end of a word (the antepenultimate syllable).\n*   **How to spot it:** We look for pairs of related words (e.g., a base word and a derived word) where one has a long vowel and the other has a short vowel in the same position, and the change is due to the word having three or more syllables.\n    *   Example: `sane` (/seɪn/, long 'a' sound) becomes `sanity` (/'sænɪti/, short 'a' sound). The addition of the `-ity` suffix makes the word trisyllabic and causes the vowel to shorten.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Words**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `south` (pronounced /saʊθ/). The vowel is the diphthong /aʊ/, which is a \"long\" vowel sound.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `southern` (pronounced /'sʌðərn/). The vowel sound changes to the short, lax vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Vowel laxing *has* occurred. However, `southern` only has two syllables. This phenomenon is often called pre-cluster shortening rather than the strictly defined trisyllabic laxing. Still, a laxing process has taken place.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `derive` (pronounced /dɪ'raɪv/). The relevant vowel is the diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `derivative` (pronounced /dɪ'rɪvətɪv/). The vowel sound changes to the short, lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word `derivative` has four syllables. The laxing occurs in the syllable `riv`, which is the third syllable from the end (antepenultimate). This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `serene` (pronounced /sə'riːn/). The vowel is the long vowel /iː/ (\"ee\" sound).\n    *   **Derived Word:** `serenity` (pronounced /sə'rɛnɪti/). The vowel sound changes to the short, lax vowel /ɛ/ (\"eh\" sound).\n    *   **Careful Point:** `Serenity` has four syllables. The laxing occurs in the syllable `ren`, which is the third syllable from the end. This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `please` (pronounced /pliːz/). The vowel is the long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `pleasant` (pronounced /'plɛzənt/). The vowel sound changes to the short, lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like `southern`, vowel laxing has clearly happened, but the resulting word `pleasant` is disyllabic (two syllables), not trisyllabic.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Base Word:** `grate` (pronounced /ɡreɪt/). The vowel is the diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `gratitude` (pronounced /'ɡrætɪtjuːd/). The vowel sound changes to the short, lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** `Gratitude` has three syllables. The laxing occurs in the first syllable `grat`, which is the third from the end. This is another clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related Word:** `shade` (pronounced /ʃeɪd/). This word has a long diphthong /eɪ/. `Shadow` has a short, lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Derived Word (?):** At first glance, it looks like the same pattern: `shade` → `shadow`.\n    *   **Careful Point (Etymology):** This is the crucial point. Unlike the other examples, `shadow` is not derived from `shade` by adding a suffix. Both words come from different forms of the same word in Old English. `Shadow` comes from *sceadu*, which already had a short /æ/ vowel. `Shade` comes from *scād*, which had a long vowel. Therefore, the vowel in `shadow` was *never long*. Since it was never long, it could not have been shortened or laxed.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` undergo a laxing process that isn't strictly \"trisyllabic\" due to their syllable count, they *do* demonstrate a historical process of vowel shortening.\n\n`Shadow`, on the other hand, never had a long vowel in its historical line of development that could have been shortened. It has always had a short vowel. Therefore, it is the only word on the list that has not undergone any kind of vowel laxing process from a long-vowel counterpart.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
