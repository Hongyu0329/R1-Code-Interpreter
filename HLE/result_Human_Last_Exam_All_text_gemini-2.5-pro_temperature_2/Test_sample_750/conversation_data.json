    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Equation**\nThe equation to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is a simple complex multiplication.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is a multi-valued function. The definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\n\n**2. Express the RHS using the Definition**\nFor $i^z$, we have $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log(i)$, is also multi-valued.\n$\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define the constant $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for simplicity.\nNow, the RHS is $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i C_k}$.\nThe problem is to find all $z$ such that $z \\cdot i = e^{z i C_k}$ holds for at least one integer $k$.\n\n**3. Set up a System of Equations**\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstitute this into the equation.\nLHS: $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\nRHS: $e^{ziC_k} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{xiC_k + y i^2 C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula ($e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$), the RHS becomes:\n$e^{-yC_k} (\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nNow we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k) + i \\cdot e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$.\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$ for each integer $k$:\n(1) Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n(2) Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**4. Analyze Special Cases**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n(2) $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\nFrom (1), for $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, the argument $xC_k$ must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstitute this into (2):\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe sine value here is either $1$ (for even $n$) or $-1$ (for odd $n$).\nThis gives two possibilities for $x$:\n- If $x=1$: The equations become $\\cos(C_k)=0$ and $1=\\sin(C_k)$. This requires $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$ for some integer $j$. Since $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, this is satisfied if we choose $k=j$. So, $z=1$ is a potential solution. We check it against the original equation. If $z=1$, LHS is $1 \\cdot i = i$. RHS is $i^1 = e^{iC_k}$. For $k=0$, $i^1 = e^{i\\pi/2}=i$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n- If $x=-1$: The equations become $\\cos(-C_k)=0 \\implies \\cos(C_k)=0$ and $-1=\\sin(-C_k) \\implies -1=-\\sin(C_k) \\implies \\sin(C_k)=1$. This is the same condition on $C_k$ as for $x=1$. So, $z=-1$ is a potential solution. Check: If $z=-1$, LHS is $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. RHS is $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. The equation holds for any branch $k$ since $i^{-1}=e^{-i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)}=e^{-i\\pi/2}e^{-2k\\pi i}=-i \\cdot 1=-i$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$.\n(2) $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) = 0$.\nThe second equation is always true, so we only need to solve the first equation for $y$: $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n- If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. The function $f(y)$ has a minimum value of $\\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. For $k\\ge 0$, $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$, so $\\ln(C_k)>-1$, and the minimum value is positive. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n- If $k < 0$, let $k = -m$ for $m \\ge 1$. Then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2m\\pi < 0$. Let $D_m = -C_k = 2m\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{yD_m}$, or $e^{yD_m}+y=0$.\nLet $g(y) = e^{yD_m}+y$. The derivative is $g'(y) = D_m e^{yD_m} + 1 > 0$, so the function is strictly increasing.\nAs $y \\to \\infty$, $g(y) \\to \\infty$. As $y \\to -\\infty$, $g(y) \\to -\\infty$.\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one real root for $y$ for each $m \\ge 1$. Since $g(0)=1$, this root must be negative. Let's call this root $y_{-m}$.\nThus, for each negative integer $k$ (or positive integer $m=-k$), there is one purely imaginary solution $z = iy_k$. For instance, for $k=-1$ ($m=1$), we have the solution $z=iy_{-1}$ where $y_{-1}$ is the unique real root of $-y=e^{y(3\\pi/2)}$.\n\n**Case C: General solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$)**\nThe system of equations (1) and (2) needs to be solved. An equivalent system (for $x \\neq 0$) is:\n(A) $x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$ (from squaring and adding (1) and (2))\n(B) $\\frac{-y}{x} = \\cot(xC_k)$ (from dividing (1) by (2))\nIt can be shown by further analysis (which is quite involved and beyond standard textbook methods) that for each integer $k$, this system yields an infinite set of solutions $(x,y)$. These solutions generally cannot be expressed in a simple closed form and require numerical methods or representation using special functions like the Lambert W function. For instance, for $k=0$, besides $z=\\pm 1$, there are infinitely many other solutions where $x$ and $y$ are non-zero.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ fall into three categories:\n\n1.  **Real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:** An infinite set of solutions of the form $z=iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real root of the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions:** For each integer $k$, there exists an infinite set of complex solutions $z=x+iy$ with $x, y \\neq 0$. These correspond to the non-trivial solutions of the transcendental system of equations derived above.\n\nListing all solutions requires this descriptive format as most cannot be written as simple numbers. The most clearly stated solutions are the real and purely imaginary ones.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions: For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution $z_k=iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the single real root of the equation $-y=e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. All these roots $y_k$ are negative.\n3. An infinite set of other complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts: For each integer $k$, there is an infinite number of solutions which can be found by solving the system of equations $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$ and $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$.\n>>>"
