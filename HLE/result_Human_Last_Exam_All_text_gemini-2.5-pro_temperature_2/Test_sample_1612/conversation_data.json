    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball. This requires a careful analysis because there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers. The question doesn't specify which one, so to be thorough, we must consider both. The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., unique players), not the number of times a Triple Crown has been won.\n\n---\n**Part 1: The Batting Triple Crown**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Batting Triple Crown.**\nA player wins the Batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify all Batting Triple Crown winners and list them.**\nWe will list each player who has achieved this feat, noting the year and their league.\n\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878, NL) - *Careful Point: RBIs were not an official statistic in 1878, but historical research credits him with leading the league, so he is often included.*\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association) - *Careful Point: The American Association is considered a major league for this era, so he is included in the official count.*\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, NL)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, NL) - *Careful Point: Hornsby is a repeat winner.*\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, AL)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947, AL) - *Careful Point: Williams is also a repeat winner.*\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL)\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of unique Batting Triple Crown winners.**\nBy counting the unique names from the list above, we find there have been **15** different players who have won the Batting Triple Crown.\n\n---\n**Part 2: The Pitching Triple Crown**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pitching Triple Crown.**\nA pitcher wins the Pitching Triple Crown by leading their respective league in three specific pitching categories in the same season:\n1.  **Wins (W)**\n2.  **Strikeouts (K)**\n3.  **Earned Run Average (ERA)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify all Pitching Triple Crown winners and list them.**\nWe will list each player who has achieved this feat. There are numerous repeat winners here.\n\n*   **Tommy Bond** (1877, NL)\n*   **Old Hoss Radbourn** (1884, NL)\n*   **Tim Keefe** (1888, NL)\n*   **John Clarkson** (1889, NL)\n*   **Amos Rusie** (1894, NL)\n*   **Cy Young** (1901, AL)\n*   **Christy Mathewson** (1905, NL & 1908, NL)\n*   **Rube Waddell** (1905, AL)\n*   **Walter Johnson** (1913, AL; 1918, AL; 1924, AL)\n*   **Pete Alexander** (1915, NL; 1916, NL; 1920, NL)\n*   **Dazzy Vance** (1924, NL)\n*   **Lefty Grove** (1930, AL & 1931, AL)\n*   **Bucky Walters** (1939, NL)\n*   **Lefty Gomez** (1940, AL)\n*   **Hal Newhouser** (1945, AL)\n*   **Sandy Koufax** (1963, NL; 1965, NL; 1966, NL)\n*   **Steve Carlton** (1972, NL)\n*   **Roger Clemens** (1997, AL & 1998, AL)\n*   **Pedro Mart√≠nez** (1999, AL)\n*   **Randy Johnson** (2002, NL)\n*   **Johan Santana** (2006, AL)\n*   **Justin Verlander** (2011, AL)\n*   **Clayton Kershaw** (2011, NL)\n*   **Shane Bieber** (2020, AL) - *Careful Point: This was achieved in the pandemic-shortened 60-game season, but it is officially recognized.*\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of unique Pitching Triple Crown winners.**\nBy counting the unique names from the list above, we find there have been **24** different players who have won the Pitching Triple Crown.\n\n---\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n\n*   Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners: 15\n*   Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners: 24\n\nThere are no players who have won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. Therefore, the total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown is the sum of the two counts.\n\nTotal Winners = 15 (Batters) + 24 (Pitchers) = 39\n\n<<<39>>>"
