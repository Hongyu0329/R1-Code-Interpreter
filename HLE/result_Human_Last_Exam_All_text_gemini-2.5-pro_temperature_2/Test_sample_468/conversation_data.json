    "This request requires a multi-step analysis to determine the correct common name and its origin.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Scientific Name:** The genus in question is *Perdita*. The \"Smith, 1853\" part indicates that Frederick Smith was the scientist who first described and named this genus in the year 1853.\n2.  **Determine the Native Range:** The question specifies the common name used \"in their native range.\" Bees of the genus *Perdita* are native to North and Central America, with the highest diversity found in the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n3.  **Find the \"Currently Used Common Name\":** This involves researching what name is most frequently used in current field guides, scientific outreach, and community science platforms for this genus.\n4.  **Find \"When was it coined?\":** This is the most challenging part. Common names, unlike scientific names, don't have a formal registration process. \"Coined\" can refer to the first time it was proposed, used in conversation, or, more reliably, the first time it appeared in a significant publication. We must trace the name's history through literature.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Common Name vs. Scientific Name:** *Perdita* is the scientific name, which is universal in the scientific community. A common name is a vernacular name that can vary by region and language and is often more descriptive or accessible.\n*   **Specificity:** Many general names exist for bees (e.g., \"sweat bee,\" \"sand bee\"). We need to find the name most specifically associated with the genus *Perdita*. The term \"sand bee\" is used for *Perdita* due to their nesting habits but is also used for many other unrelated bees that nest in sand, making it too general.\n*   **\"Official\" vs. \"Used\":** An organization like the Entomological Society of America (ESA) maintains a list of \"official\" common names. A name can be widely used without being on this list. The question asks for the \"currently used common name,\" which implies de facto usage, not necessarily official status.\n*   **Pinpointing a \"Coining\" Date:** For a common name, the \"coining\" date is often the year of the first major, widely distributed publication that used it, solidifying its place in the public lexicon. This is more verifiable than trying to find the first person who ever uttered the phrase.\n\n**Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer:**\n\n1.  **Researching the Common Name:** A search of modern entomological resources reveals that *Perdita* bees are extremely small, with many species measuring only 2-3 millimeters long, making them some of the tiniest bees in North America. Their diminutive size and often iridescent coloration have led to a fitting common name. Prominent recent guides, such as \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016), exclusively use the name **\"Fairy Bees\"** for the genus *Perdita*. This name has been broadly adopted by bee researchers and enthusiasts.\n2.  **Tracing the Coining Year:** To find the year \"Fairy Bee\" was coined for this genus, we must look at literature chronologically.\n    *   Major 20th-century and early 21st-century taxonomic works, such as Charles Michener's \"The Bees of the World\" (2007 edition), do not use this common name. This indicates the name is of recent origin.\n    *   The push for user-friendly common names for pollinators grew significantly in the 2010s.\n    *   A search for early uses points to the landmark publication **\"California Bees and Blooms: A Guide for Gardeners and Naturalists\"** by Frankie, Thorp, Coville, and Ertter. This book, published in **2014**, lists \"Fairy bee\" as the common name for the genus *Perdita*. The late Dr. Robbin Thorp, a co-author, was a preeminent bee expert, and this publication was highly influential in popularizing the name.\n    *   While the name may have been suggested or used informally in online databases or presentations a year or two prior, its appearance in this major 2014 guide represents its first significant, citable introduction and coining for a broad audience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy Bee,\" and the most definitive year it can be considered \"coined\" in a major publication is 2014.\n\n<<<Fairy Bee, 2014>>>"
