    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the largest possible order of a *non-cyclic* torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Elliptic Curve:** A curve defined by a non-singular cubic equation, typically in Weierstrass form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. The points on the curve form an abelian group.\n    *   **Torsion Subgroup:** For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ consists of all points in $E(K)$ that have finite order.\n    *   **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:** For any elliptic curve over any number field, the torsion subgroup is a finite abelian group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integers $M, N \\geq 1$ where $M$ divides $N$.\n    *   **Non-Cyclic Group:** A group that cannot be generated by a single element. For a torsion subgroup of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$, it is non-cyclic if and only if $M > 1$.\n    *   **Number Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** This is a specific quadratic number field. It is the field of Eisenstein integers.\n\n3.  **Recall the Classification of Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields:** The possible structures of torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified by the work of several mathematicians (Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, etc.). We need to find the non-cyclic group with the largest order from this classification.\n\n4.  **List the Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroups over any Quadratic Field:** The possibilities for non-cyclic torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ where $K$ is a quadratic field are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orders of These Groups to Find the Maximum:**\n    *   The largest group in the first family is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, with order $2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n    *   The largest group in the second family is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, with order $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n    *   The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n    *   The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ is $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n    *   The order of $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n    Comparing all possible orders, the largest is 36. This comes from the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Verify if this Maximum Order can be Achieved on the Specific Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    For the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ to exist as a torsion subgroup over a field $K$, it is necessary that the field $K$ contains all the coordinates of the 6-torsion points. A key necessary condition for an elliptic curve over $K$ to have a full $m$-torsion subgroup (i.e., $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$) is that the $m$-th cyclotomic field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m)$, must be a subfield of $K$.\n    *   Let's check this condition for $m=6$ and $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   The primitive 6th root of unity is $\\zeta_6 = e^{2\\pi i/6} = \\cos(\\pi/3) + i\\sin(\\pi/3) = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n    *   The field generated by this root is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6) = \\mathbb{Q}(1+i\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6) = K$, the condition is met. It is therefore possible for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ to have $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ as its torsion subgroup.\n    *   In fact, the established classification results state that this specific torsion group, $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, *only* occurs over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over any quadratic field is 36. This order is achieved by the group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is known to occur as a torsion subgroup for elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Therefore, the largest possible order for the given field is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
