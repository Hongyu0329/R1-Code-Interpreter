**1. Residues in the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) binding pocket. Mutating them severely impairs or abolishes the physical binding. The numbering corresponds to human CACNB1 (UniProt: P54283).
*   **Tyr218 (Y218)**
*   **Val227 (V227)**
*   **Met228 (M228)**
*   **Tyr345 (Y345)**
*   **Leu350 (L350)**
*   **Ile352 (I352)**

**2. Residues in the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are critical for the allosteric mechanism of gating modulation. They are located within the Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain and mediate an intramolecular conformational switch upon AID binding. Mutating them disrupts gating modulation without affecting the primary binding interaction.
