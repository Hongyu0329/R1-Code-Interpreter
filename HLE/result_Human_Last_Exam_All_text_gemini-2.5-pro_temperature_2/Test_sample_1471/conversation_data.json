    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Translate the Roman Numerals into Modern Numbers**\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Roman numeral in the equation to its corresponding modern (Arabic) number.\n*   `VIII` = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\n*   `XXI` = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21\n*   `XIII` = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13\n*   `XXIII` = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the Roman numerals. A misinterpretation would lead to a completely different and incorrect result.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\n\nNow, substitute the modern numbers back into the equation. The `/` symbol represents division.\nThe original equation `VIII / XXI - XIII / XXIII = ?` becomes:\n`8 / 21 - 13 / 23 = ?`\n\nThis is a subtraction problem involving two fractions.\n\n**Step 3: Find a Common Denominator**\n\nTo subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 21 and 23. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 23 is their product, as they do not share any common prime factors (they are relatively prime).\n*   Common Denominator = 21 * 23 = 483\n\n**Careful Point:** Finding the correct common denominator is a critical step. A calculation error here will invalidate the subsequent steps.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Fractions**\n\nNext, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 483.\n*   For the first fraction `8 / 21`: Multiply the numerator and the denominator by 23.\n    *   (8 * 23) / (21 * 23) = 184 / 483\n*   For the second fraction `13 / 23`: Multiply the numerator and the denominator by 21.\n    *   (13 * 21) / (23 * 21) = 273 / 483\n\n**Careful Point:** Ensure the multiplication for both the numerator and the denominator is done correctly for each fraction to maintain their original values.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Subtraction**\n\nNow that both fractions have the same denominator, we can subtract the numerators.\n*   `184 / 483 - 273 / 483 = (184 - 273) / 483`\n*   `184 - 273 = -89`\n\nSo the result is:\n`-89 / 483`\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the Result (if possible)**\n\nThe final step is to check if the fraction can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator (89) and the denominator (483).\n*   The number 89 is a prime number.\n*   We check if 483 is divisible by 89. `483 ÷ 89 ≈ 5.42...`, which is not an integer.\n*   Since 89 is prime and is not a factor of 483, the fraction `-89 / 483` is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is `-89 / 483`. This can also be expressed as a decimal, which is approximately -0.184265. The fractional form is the exact answer.\n\n<<< -89/483 >>>"
