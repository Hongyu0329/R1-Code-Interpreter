    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\". In the context of a fuzzy inference system (specifically the implication step), this refers to the membership value in the *output* fuzzy set after it has been modified by the firing strength of the rule's *antecedent*. This process combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's original membership function.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength (`Φ_k(x')`):** This is the degree to which the rule's condition (the \"IF\" part) is met. The value is given as **0.7**.\n*   **Original Consequent Membership (`μ_G_k_j(y_j)`)**: This is the membership degree of a specific point `y_j` in the original, unmodified output fuzzy set (the \"THEN\" part). The value is given as **0.9**.\n*   **Operation**: The method to combine these two values is a **t-norm**.\n\n**3. Analyze the \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" Context**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Nature of IT3 FS.** An Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS) is a very advanced concept where membership values are Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets, capturing a high degree of uncertainty. In a true IT3 FS system, the inputs (`Φ_k(x')` and `μ_G_k_j(y_j)`) would not be single, crisp numbers but rather complex fuzzy sets themselves.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Simplification.** The problem simplifies this complex scenario by providing crisp numerical values (0.7 and 0.9). This strongly suggests that we should treat these as representative or type-reduced values. Therefore, the calculation methodology will be identical to that used in a standard Type-1 fuzzy system, using the numbers provided.\n\n**4. Select and Define the T-Norm Operation**\n\n*   A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy sets.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Choice of T-Norm.** The problem states to use a \"t-norm\" but does not specify which one. The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy implication are:\n    1.  **Minimum t-norm (Mamdani Implication):** `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    2.  **Product t-norm (Larsen Implication):** `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`\n*   In academic and practical contexts, when a t-norm is not specified, the **minimum** operator is the most standard and widely assumed choice. It represents \"clipping\" the consequent fuzzy set at the level of the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation**\n\nThe rule activation level for the specific output `y_j` is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership.\n\n*   **Formula:** `Rule Activation Level = t-norm(Φ_k(x'), μ_G_k_j(y_j))`\n*   **Substitute values:** `Rule Activation Level = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Apply the minimum t-norm:** `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\nThe firing strength of the antecedent (0.7) \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set. Since the original membership at that point was 0.9, which is higher than the clipping level, the new, activated membership becomes 0.7.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe rule activation level is the result of applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership value. Using the standard minimum t-norm:\nActivation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
