    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colors required.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   We are given a graph $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   The question asks for the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points and Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Proper Vertex Coloring:** Assigning colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n    *   **Chromatic Number $\\chi(G)$:** The minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of $G$.\n    *   **Complete Graph $K_n$:** A graph on $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   **Fundamental Property of Chromatic Number:** For any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   **Condition for Maximum Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is exactly $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) = n$, if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. If $\\chi(G)=n$, every vertex must receive a unique color. For this to be a valid coloring, every vertex must be adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of $K_n$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number:**\n    *   Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices.\n    *   From the key concepts, we know that $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is *not* the complete graph, i.e., $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n    *   Since $G \\neq K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $12345$.\n    *   Therefore, for any such graph $G$, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   This means the maximum number of colors cannot exceed $12344$.\n\n4.  **Verify if the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To show that $12344$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one graph $G$ (satisfying the given conditions) for which $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n    *   Let's construct such a graph. Consider the graph $G$ formed by taking a complete graph on $12344$ vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex). This graph is the disjoint union $G = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$.\n    *   Let's check if this constructed graph $G$ meets the requirements:\n        *   **Number of vertices:** $|V(G)| = |V(K_{12344})| + |V(K_1)| = 12344 + 1 = 12345$. The condition on the number of vertices is met.\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** The graph $K_{12345}$ is a connected graph. Our constructed graph $G$ is not connected (it has two components). Therefore, $G \\neq K_{12345}$. The condition that $G$ is not a complete graph is met.\n    *   Now, let's find the chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$:\n        *   The chromatic number of a graph that is a disjoint union of components is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n        *   $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1))$.\n        *   The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_m$ is $m$. So, $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex $K_1$ is $1$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established that any graph with $12345$ vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most $12344$ colors.\n    *   We have also constructed a specific graph that satisfies the conditions and requires exactly $12344$ colors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $12344$."
