μ̄_V(u; x) = exp( - (u - μ̄_A(x))² / (2 * σ_u²(x)) ), where μ̄_A(x) is the Gaussian-based upper bound of the primary membership function, and σ_u(x) is the standard deviation controlling the secondary uncertainty, often defined as a function of the primary uncertainty bounds (e.g., σ_u(x) = K * (μ̄_A(x) - μ̲_A(x))).
