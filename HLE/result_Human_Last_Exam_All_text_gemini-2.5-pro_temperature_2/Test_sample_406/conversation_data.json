    "This problem requires understanding the concept of a \"tripled fixed point\" and the conditions for its existence and uniqueness, which are typically established by a theorem analogous to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem in the context of product spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Clarifying Notation\n\nThe user is asking for the conditions under which three functions have a \"tripled fixed point\". The provided function signatures are:\n*   `F: X*Y*Z → X`\n*   `G: Y*X*Y → Y`\n*   `G: Z*Y*X → Z`\n\nThere appear to be some notational inconsistencies or typos here, which are common when transcribing complex mathematical definitions. In the established mathematical literature on this topic (e.g., the work by Berinde and Borcut), a tripled fixed point involves three distinct functions `F`, `G`, and `H`, with their domains structured in a cyclic manner.\n\n**Clarification:** We will analyze the problem based on the standard definition, which is likely what the user intended. We assume the third function is `H`, not a second `G`, and the domains/codomains are structured as follows:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n*   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that:\n*   `x = F(x, y, z)`\n*   `y = G(y, z, x)`\n*   `z = H(z, x, y)`\n\nThe conditions for the existence of such a point relate to the properties of the spaces `X, Y, Z` and the behavior of the functions `F, G, H`.\n\n#### Step 2: The Condition on the Spaces (The Setting)\n\nThe theorem requires the underlying spaces to have a notion of distance and completeness.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Metric Spaces.** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be metric spaces. Let their respective distance functions (metrics) be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n*   **Condition 2: Completeness.** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete** metric spaces. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space has a limit that is also in the space. Informally, this means there are no \"holes\" in the space where a sequence of points should converge.\n\nThese conditions on the spaces ensure that if we can construct a sequence that gets progressively closer, it will converge to a definite point within the space.\n\n#### Step 3: The Condition on the Functions (The Contraction)\n\nThis is the core condition. The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be \"contractive\" in a specific way across the product space. This guarantees that when applied iteratively, they will shrink distances between points, ultimately forcing a sequence to converge to a single fixed point.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Tripled Contractive Mappings.** There must exist three non-negative constants `k, l, m` such that their sum is strictly less than 1 (i.e., `k + l + m < 1`), and the following three inequalities hold for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`:\n\n    1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k * d_X(x1, x2) + l * d_Y(y1, y2) + m * d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y1, z1, x1), G(y2, z2, x2)) ≤ k * d_Y(y1, y2) + l * d_Z(z1, z2) + m * d_X(x1, x2)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ k * d_Z(z1, z2) + l * d_X(x1, x2) + m * d_Y(y1, y2)`\n\n**Interpretation of the inequalities:**\nThe distance between the outputs of a function (e.g., `F`) is bounded by a weighted sum of the distances between the inputs. The factor `k + l + m < 1` acts as a \"contraction factor\" for the entire system on the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Definitions:** It is crucial to use the standard, cyclically symmetric definitions for the functions `F, G, H` and the tripled fixed point itself, as the original query contained likely typos.\n2.  **Completeness is Necessary:** The requirement that `X, Y, Z` be *complete* metric spaces is fundamental. Without completeness, the iterative sequence generated by the functions might be a Cauchy sequence but fail to converge to a point *within* the spaces.\n3.  **Strict Inequality:** The sum of the contraction constants `k, l, m` must be *strictly* less than 1. If `k + l + m = 1`, the mapping is merely non-expansive, and a fixed point is not guaranteed to exist.\n4.  **Existence and Uniqueness:** The conditions, when satisfied, are powerful enough to guarantee not only the **existence** of an FGH-tripled fixed point but also its **uniqueness**.\n\n### Final Answer: The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem\n\nThe conditions can be summarized as a single theorem.\n\n**Theorem (Tripled Fixed Point in Metric Spaces):**\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces.\nLet `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × Z × X → Y`, and `H: Z × X × Y → Z` be three mappings.\nSuppose there exist non-negative constants `k, l, m` with `k + l + m < 1` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k⋅d_X(x1, x2) + l⋅d_Y(y1, y2) + m⋅d_Z(z1, z2)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y1, z1, x1), G(y2, z2, x2)) ≤ k⋅d_Y(y1, y2) + l⋅d_Z(z1, z2) + m⋅d_X(x1, x2)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ k⋅d_Z(z1, z2) + l⋅d_X(x1, x2) + m⋅d_Y(y1, y2)`\n\nThen, there exists a unique triplet `(x*, y*, z*) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `x* = F(x*, y*, z*)`, `y* = G(y*, z*, x*)`, and `z* = H(z*, x*, y*)`.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `x = F(x, y, z)`, `y = G(y, z, x)`, and `z = H(z, x, y)` are:\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces, with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n2.  **Contractive Mapping Condition:** There must exist three non-negative constants `k, l, m` such that `k + l + m < 1`, and the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×Z×X→Y`, `H: Z×X×Y→Z` satisfy the following inequalities for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k⋅d_X(x1, x2) + l⋅d_Y(y1, y2) + m⋅d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, z1, x1), G(y2, z2, x2)) ≤ k⋅d_Y(y1, y2) + l⋅d_Z(z1, z2) + m⋅d_X(x1, x2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ k⋅d_Z(z1, z2) + l⋅d_X(x1, x2) + m⋅d_Y(y1, y2)`\nIf these conditions are met, there exists one and only one FGH-tripled fixed point.>>>"
