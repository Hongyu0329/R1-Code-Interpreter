    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system and find equilibrium points.**\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    $u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n\n    Equilibrium points are found by setting $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n    *   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n    *   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + (5-3)d - 1(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points in the phase plane are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points.**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$:\n    $F(u,d) = u^3-u^2$\n    $G(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3$\n    $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 0 + 4-3 & 0+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n    *   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -4+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n    *   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive. However, for $u>0$ and near $u=0$, $u' \\approx -u^2 < 0$, so trajectories approach the d-axis ($u=0$).\n\n3.  **Find the separatrix.**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. We have a saddle point at $(1,-1)$.\n\n    *   **Stable manifold of (1,-1):** The eigenvector for $\\lambda_2=-2$ is found by solving $(J - (-2)I)v = 0$.\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $3v_u=0 \\implies v_u=0$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        This corresponds to a vertical tangent. The line $u=1$ is an invariant set since $u'=0$ if $u=1$. Therefore, the stable manifold of the saddle is the line $u=1$. This line separates the plane into a region where $u(t)\\to 0$ (for $u<1$) and a region where $u(t)\\to\\infty$ (for $u>1$). So, $u=1$ is a separatrix.\n\n    *   **Unstable manifold of (1,-1):** The eigenvector for $\\lambda_1=1$ is found by solving $(J - I)v = 0$.\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $-6v_u-3v_d=0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The unstable manifold leaves the saddle point $(1,-1)$ with a slope of $-2/1 = -2$.\n\n4.  **Search for an invariant algebraic curve.**\n    Let's test for a simple algebraic curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that could be an invariant manifold (and thus a trajectory). A good guess that is simple and passes through the origin is a parabola, let's try $d = c u^2$.\n    If $d=cu^2$, then using the chain rule, $d' = \\frac{d}{du}(cu^2) \\cdot u' = (2cu) \\cdot (u^3-u^2) = 2cu^4 - 2cu^3$.\n    Now substitute $d=cu^2$ into the first DE:\n    $d' = 2(cu^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(cu^2) - u^3+u^4$\n    $d' = 2c^2u^4 + 5cu^4 - 3cu^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n    $d' = (2c^2+5c+1)u^4 + (-3c-1)u^3$\n    Equating the two expressions for $d'$ must hold for all $u$. We compare coefficients of powers of $u$:\n    Coeff of $u^3$: $-2c = -3c-1 \\implies c = -1$.\n    Coeff of $u^4$: $2c = 2c^2+5c+1 \\implies 2c^2+3c+1=0$.\n    Let's check if $c=-1$ satisfies the second equation: $2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2-3+1 = 0$. It does.\n    So, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold (a trajectory).\n\n5.  **Analyze the invariant curve $d = -u^2$.**\n    *   This curve passes through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$, since $0=-(0)^2$.\n    *   It also passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$, since $-1=-(1)^2$.\n    *   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du}=-2u$. At the saddle point $(u=1)$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the slope of the unstable manifold we calculated earlier.\n    *   Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. A trajectory connecting two equilibrium points is a heteroclinic connection and acts as a separatrix.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    The system has (at least) two separatrices: the line $u=1$ (the stable manifold of the saddle) and the parabola $d=-u^2$ (the unstable manifold of the saddle). Typically, when a problem asks for \"the\" separatrix, it refers to the most significant or non-obvious one that governs the system's dynamics. The discovery of the invariant algebraic curve $d=-u^2$ is a key step in understanding the structure of the phase portrait. This curve acts as an attractor for the region $0<u<1$ and as a dividing line for fates of trajectories in the region $u>1$. It is a heteroclinic orbit connecting a saddle to another equilibrium point. For these reasons, it is the most significant separatrix of the system.\n\nThe equation of this separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
