    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material:** The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   The base structure is a benzene ring.\n    *   The \"benzamide\" part indicates a -C(=O)NR₂ group is attached to the ring. This is considered position 1.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl-\" means the R groups on the amide nitrogen are both ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). So, the group at position 1 is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n    *   \"-3-dimethylamino\" means there is a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first set of reagents and reaction conditions:** The starting material is treated with `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) in `THF` (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base. It is capable of deprotonating C-H bonds, especially acidic C-H bonds on an aromatic ring.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a bidentate chelating ligand for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It increases the reactivity of the organolithium reagent by breaking up its aggregates and directs the lithiation.\n    *   `THF` is a common polar aprotic solvent for organometallic reactions.\n    *   This combination of reagents is classic for a **Directed Ortho Metallation (DoM)** reaction. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring directs the strong base to deprotonate (and thus metallate/lithiate) a proton at the position *ortho* (adjacent) to it. The functional group that directs this is called a Directed Metallation Group (DMG).\n\n3.  **Identify the Directed Metallation Groups (DMGs) and determine the site of lithiation:**\n    *   Our starting material has two potential DMGs: the N,N-diethylamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] at position 1 and the dimethylamino group [-N(Me)₂] at position 3.\n    *   Both groups can direct lithiation to their respective ortho positions.\n        *   The amide group at C1 directs to C2 and C6.\n        *   The amine group at C3 directs to C2 and C4.\n    *   To predict the outcome, we must compare the directing strength of these two groups. The amide group, `-CONR₂`, is one of the most powerful DMGs, significantly stronger than the amino group, `-NR₂`.\n    *   Therefore, the lithiation will be primarily directed by the N,N-diethylamide group to either the C2 or C6 position.\n    *   Now we compare the C2 and C6 positions. The C2 position is *ortho* to both the amide (C1) and the amine (C3) groups. This means both groups cooperatively direct the lithiation to C2. Furthermore, the resulting lithiated intermediate at C2 is stabilized by chelation, where the lithium ion is coordinated by both the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen atom of the amino group, forming a stable five-membered ring.\n    *   Because of this strong cooperative and chelating effect, deprotonation occurs selectively at the C2 position. The proton at C6 is much less likely to be removed.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second reaction step:** The lithiated intermediate is then treated with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   The C-Li bond at position 2 is highly polarized, and the carbon atom acts as a potent nucleophile (a carbanion).\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electrophilic.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Iodide (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n5.  **Determine the final product:**\n    *   The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, we add a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   The final compound is named by listing the substituents in alphabetical order (ignoring di-, tri- prefixes for alphabetization of the root name) or simply by adding the new substituent to the name. The standard IUPAC name would list substituents alphabetically, but the description is clear. The resulting structure has the N,N-diethylamide at C1, a methyl group at C2, and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   Correctly identifying the structure of the starting material.\n*   Recognizing the reaction as a Directed Ortho Metallation (DoM).\n*   Knowing the relative directing power of DMGs (amide > amine).\n*   Understanding the concept of cooperative directing effects and chelation stabilization, which makes the C2 position highly favored for lithiation.\n*   Identifying the subsequent reaction as a nucleophilic attack of the lithiated species on an electrophile (methyl iodide).\n*   Correctly assembling the structure and name of the final product.\n\nThe final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
