    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\n\nThe term \"Second Great War\" is not an official in-game designation like the \"Great War\" or the \"Brood War\". It is a term used by the community and lore enthusiasts to refer to the series of interconnected conflicts that take place during the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This war's central conflict is the fight against the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his various forces.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War**\n\nThe conflict begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n\n*   The campaign starts in the year **2504**. This is four years after the conclusion of the Brood War (which ended in 2500).\n*   The inciting incident is the renewed large-scale Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, starting with attacks on planets like Mar Sara, which draws Jim Raynor and his Raiders back into a major conflict.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War**\n\nThe war concludes with the final defeat of its primary antagonist, Amon.\n\n*   The main campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* ends with the reclamation of the Protoss homeworld, Aiur, in the year **2506**.\n*   However, Amon is not permanently defeated. The final confrontation happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*.\n*   The lore explicitly states that the events of the epilogue, where a united Terran, Zerg, and Protoss force enters the Void to destroy Amon for good, take place in the year **2508**. This marks the true end of the war.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Duration**\n\nNow we calculate the time elapsed between the start and end dates.\n\n*   **Start Year:** 2504\n*   **End Year:** 2508\n\nThe war spans the entirety of the years 2504, 2505, 2506, and 2507, and concludes partway through 2508. This means the total duration is more than 4 full years but less than 5 full years (e.g., from early 2504 to mid-2508 would be roughly 4.5 years).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rounding Rule**\n\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded *up* to the nearest year.\n\n*   The calculated duration is a value greater than 4 years (e.g., 4.x years).\n*   Rounding any value greater than 4 up to the nearest whole year results in 5.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining the Conflict:** The key is to correctly identify the \"Second Great War\" as the full narrative arc of StarCraft II, from Amon's initial moves to his final defeat.\n2.  **Identifying the True Ending:** The war doesn't end with the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign in 2506. The threat of Amon persists until his destruction in the Void, which the lore places in 2508. This two-year gap is a crucial part of the timeline.\n3.  **Correctly Interpreting \"Rounded Up\":** Unlike standard rounding, \"rounding up\" (also known as taking the ceiling) means any fractional part requires moving to the next higher integer. A duration of 4.1 years, for example, rounds up to 5.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   War Start: 2504\n*   War End: 2508\n*   Elapsed Time: Greater than 4 years.\n*   Rounded Up Duration: 5 years.\n\n<<<5>>>"
