    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints of the polytope**\n\nLet $P$ be the 4-polytope in question. We are given the following properties:\n*   It is a 4-polytope, so its dimension is $d=4$.\n*   It has 6 vertices, so $f_0 = 6$.\n*   It is non-simplicial, meaning at least one of its facets (3-faces) is not a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex).\n*   It has the maximal number of 2-faces ($f_2$) possible for a polytope satisfying the other conditions.\n\nWe need to find its f-vector, which is the sequence $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the facets of the polytope**\n\nLet $F$ be a facet of the 4-polytope $P$. A facet is a 3-polytope whose vertices are a subset of the vertices of $P$.\n*   The number of vertices of any facet, $v(F)$, must be less than the total number of vertices of $P$. If $v(F) = f_0(P) = 6$, all vertices of $P$ would lie in the 3D hyperplane defined by $F$, which would make $P$ a 3-polytope, not a 4-polytope. Thus, $v(F) < 6$.\n*   Since $P$ is non-simplicial, it must have at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron. Let's call this non-simplicial facet $F_{ns}$.\n*   A 3-polytope must have at least 4 vertices. A 3-polytope with 4 vertices is always a tetrahedron, which is simplicial. Therefore, any non-simplicial facet must have more than 4 vertices. So, $v(F_{ns}) > 4$.\n*   Combining these two conditions, any non-simplicial facet $F_{ns}$ must have $v(F_{ns})=5$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the 3-polytopes with 5 vertices**\n\nBy Steinitz's theorem, the combinatorial types of 3-polytopes are in one-to-one correspondence with the planar, 3-vertex-connected graphs. For 5 vertices, there are exactly two such graphs:\n1.  The graph of the **triangular bipyramid**: This polytope has 5 vertices, 9 edges, and 6 triangular faces. Since all its faces are triangles (2-simplices), it is a simplicial polytope.\n2.  The graph of the **square pyramid**: This polytope has 5 vertices, 8 edges, and 5 faces (one square and four triangles). Since it has a square face, it is a non-simplicial polytope.\n\nSince our polytope $P$ must contain a non-simplicial facet $F_{ns}$ with 5 vertices, $F_{ns}$ must be a **square pyramid**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the combinatorial structure of the polytope P**\n\nSo, the polytope $P$ has a facet $F$ that is a square pyramid.\n*   This facet $F$ has 5 vertices.\n*   The polytope $P$ has 6 vertices in total.\nThis means there is exactly one vertex of $P$, let's call it $v_a$ (for apex), that is not part of the facet $F$.\n\nA d-polytope that consists of a facet $F$ and a single vertex $v_a$ not in the affine hull of $F$ is a **pyramid** over $F$, denoted $P = \\text{Pyr}(F)$. The combinatorial structure is uniquely determined by this fact.\n\nThus, the polytope $P$ must be a pyramid over a square pyramid. Since this logic leads to a single combinatorial type, this type must be the one with the \"maximal\" number of 2-faces (as there are no other candidates to compare against).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the f-vector of the pyramid over a square pyramid**\n\nFirst, let's find the f-vector of the base, the square pyramid ($F_{sq}$):\n*   Vertices: $f_0(F_{sq}) = 5$ (4 for the base, 1 for the apex).\n*   Edges: $f_1(F_{sq}) = 8$ (4 for the base, 4 connecting the base to the apex).\n*   Faces: $f_2(F_{sq}) = 5$ (1 square base, 4 triangular sides).\n*   (3-faces: $f_3(F_{sq}) = 1$, the polytope itself).\nThe f-vector of the base is $(5, 8, 5)$.\n\nNow, we use the general formula for the f-vector of a pyramid $P = \\text{Pyr}(Q)$, where $Q$ is a d-polytope:\n$f_k(P) = f_k(Q) + f_{k-1}(Q)$ (for $k=0, ..., d$), where $f_{-1}(Q)=1$.\n\nLet $Q$ be the square pyramid (a 3-polytope) and $P$ be our 4-polytope.\n*   $f_0(P) = f_0(Q) + f_{-1}(Q) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   $f_1(P) = f_1(Q) + f_0(Q) = 8 + 5 = 13$.\n*   $f_2(P) = f_2(Q) + f_1(Q) = 5 + 8 = 13$.\n*   $f_3(P) = f_3(Q) + f_2(Q) = 1 + 5 = 6$.\n\nThe resulting f-vector for the 4-polytope $P$ is $(6, 13, 13, 6)$.\n\n**Step 6: Final check**\n\nWe can verify the result with Euler's formula for 4-polytopes: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n$6 - 13 + 13 - 6 = 0$.\nThe formula holds true. The polytope is non-simplicial as it contains square pyramid facets. It has 6 vertices. Our logical deduction showed that this is the only possible combinatorial type for such a polytope.\n\nThe final f-vector is $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3) = (6, 13, 13, 6)$.\n\n>>><(6, 13, 13, 6)>>>"
