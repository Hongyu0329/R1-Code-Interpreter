    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where C is a Riemann surface of genus 3.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the problem:**\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$. This is equivalent to a smooth complex projective curve of genus 3.\n*   **X = C<sup>(15)</sup>:** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15, whose points are effective divisors of degree 15 on C.\n*   **Néron-Severi group NS(X):** The group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** Also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, it's the rank of the Néron-Severi group as a free abelian group (ignoring torsion). The question asks for the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. Relate the geometry of C<sup>(n)</sup> to its Jacobian J(C):**\n*   The Abel-Jacobi map is a fundamental tool. For a chosen point $P_0 \\in C$, the map $u_n: C^{(n)} \\to J(C)$ is defined by sending an effective divisor $D = P_1 + \\dots + P_n$ to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - nP_0)$ in the Jacobian of C.\n*   A crucial result states that if the degree $n$ is sufficiently large, specifically $n \\ge 2g-1$, then this map gives $C^{(n)}$ the structure of a projective bundle over $J(C)$. The fibers of this map are the linear systems $|D'|$ where $D'$ runs over effective divisors in a given linear equivalence class. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for $n > 2g-2$, the dimension of this linear system is constant and equals $n-g$.\n*   In our case, $g=3$ and $n=15$. We check the condition: $15 > 2(3)-2 = 4$. The condition holds.\n*   Therefore, $X=C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$ with fiber $\\mathbb{P}^{n-g} = \\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Rank of the Néron-Severi Group of the Fibration:**\n*   For a projective bundle $P(E)$ over a smooth base B, the Néron-Severi group is related by the exact sequence $0 \\to \\text{Pic}(B) \\to \\text{Pic}(P(E)) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\n*   Taking the rank, this implies that the Picard number of the total space is one more than the Picard number of the base.\n*   So, we have the relation: $\\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + \\rho(\\mathbb{P}^{12})$.\n*   Since $\\rho(\\mathbb{P}^{k}) = 1$ (the generator is the class of a hyperplane), we get:\n    $\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**4. Reformulate the Problem:**\nThe original question now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve C.\n\n**5. Find the Smallest Possible Rank of NS(J(C)):**\n*   The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the specific complex structure of the curve C.\n*   For a *generic* curve C of genus g, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal number of endomorphisms, namely $End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (multiplication by integers).\n*   For such abelian varieties with only trivial endomorphisms, the Néron-Severi group is as small as possible. The only algebraic divisor classes are integer multiples of the principal polarization (the class of the theta divisor, $[\\Theta]$).\n*   Therefore, for a generic curve C of genus 3, $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n*   **Smallest Rank for X:** The smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**6. Find the Largest Possible Rank of NS(J(C)):**\n*   The rank $\\rho(A)$ for an abelian variety A of dimension $g$ is bounded above by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{1,1}(A)$.\n*   For the Jacobian of a genus g curve, $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = g^2$.\n*   In our case, with $g=3$, the absolute upper bound is $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n*   The question now is whether this maximum is achievable. A large Picard number is associated with special curves whose Jacobians have a large ring of endomorphisms, a situation known as Complex Multiplication (CM).\n*   The maximum $\\rho(J(C))=g^2$ is achieved if $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of a single elliptic curve with Complex Multiplication ($J(C) \\sim E^g$).\n*   We need to know if there exists a genus 3 curve C for which this is true.\n*   The **Fermat curve** of degree 4, given by the equation $x^4+y^4=1$, is a well-known example. It has genus $g = (4-1)(4-1)/2 = 3$. Its Jacobian, $J(F_4)$, is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve E has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n*   For this curve, $C=F_4$, we have $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$. This shows the theoretical maximum is achievable.\n*   **Largest Rank for X:** The largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$ is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank occurs for a generic curve C, giving $\\rho(X)=2$.\n*   The largest possible rank occurs for a special curve like the Fermat curve $F_4$, whose Jacobian has maximal complex multiplication, giving $\\rho(X)=10$.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist**\n*   **Condition for Fibration:** Verified that $n=15 \\ge 2g-1=5$.\n*   **Relation for Picard Number:** Confirmed $\\rho(C^{(n)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n*   **Variation of $\\rho(J(C))$:** Correctly identified that $\\rho(J(C))$ is not fixed but depends on C, ranging from a minimum (generic case) to a maximum (CM case).\n*   **Values for min/max $\\rho(J(C))$:** Used standard results that $\\rho_{gen}(J(C))=1$ and the theoretical maximum $\\rho_{max}(J(C))=g^2$.\n*   **Achievability:** Provided a concrete example (the Fermat curve) to show that the maximum $\\rho(J(C))=9$ is indeed possible for a genus 3 curve.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
