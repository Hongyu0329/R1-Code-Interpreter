    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Threat Model\nThe question asks about the security of a symmetric key against an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This implies we must consider the most effective known quantum attacks against symmetric key cryptography.\n\n*   **Symmetric Key Cryptography:** This refers to algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n*   **Classical Attack:** The primary attack against a symmetric cipher is a brute-force attack, which involves trying every possible key. For a key of `n` bits, there are `2^n` possible keys. A classical computer would need, on average, `2^(n-1)` operations to find the key. The strength of the key, or its \"bits of security,\" is `n`.\n*   **Quantum Attack:** For symmetric ciphers, the most relevant quantum algorithm is **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific item in an unsorted list of `N` items in approximately `sqrt(N)` steps.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Impact of Grover's Algorithm\nWe can think of a brute-force attack as searching for the correct key in the list of all possible keys.\n\n*   For a symmetric key of `n` bits, the size of the key space (the number of possible keys) is `N = 2^n`.\n*   A classical computer needs `~N/2` or `~2^n` operations to find the key. The security level is `n` bits.\n*   A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm needs `~sqrt(N)` or `~sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2)` operations.\n*   **Crucial Point:** Grover's algorithm effectively halves the bits of security. An `n`-bit symmetric key only provides `n/2` bits of security against a quantum computer.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Required Security Level\nThe term \"cannot crack\" is not absolute. In cryptography, it means that the computational effort required to break the encryption is infeasible with current or projected technology.\n\n*   **Current Security Standard:** A security level of 128 bits (requiring `2^128` operations to break) is widely considered to be secure against classical computers for the foreseeable future. `2^128` is a massive number, far beyond the capabilities of any existing or imaginable computer.\n*   **Post-Quantum Security Goal:** To be considered secure against a quantum computer, a cryptographic system should provide a security level equivalent to what we consider secure today. Therefore, the goal is to achieve at least **128 bits of security** *after* accounting for the impact of quantum algorithms.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Minimum Key Length\nWe need to find the smallest key length, `n`, such that the post-quantum security level is at least 128 bits.\n\n*   Post-Quantum Security = (Original Key Length) / 2\n*   We want: Post-Quantum Security ≥ 128 bits\n*   So, `n / 2 ≥ 128`\n*   Solving for `n`, we get `n ≥ 256`\n\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be **at least 256 bits long** to provide a 128-bit security level against an attack by a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n*   **A. 256:** A 256-bit key provides `256 / 2 = 128` bits of post-quantum security. This meets the minimum requirement.\n*   **B. 128:** A 128-bit key provides `128 / 2 = 64` bits of post-quantum security. A security level of 64 bits (`2^64` operations) is considered breakable and therefore not secure.\n*   **C. 512:** A 512-bit key provides `512 / 2 = 256` bits of post-quantum security. This is very secure, but the question asks for the *minimum* required length.\n*   **D. 1024:** Provides `1024 / 2 = 512` bits of post-quantum security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n*   **E. 2048:** Provides `2048 / 2 = 1024` bits of post-quantum security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n\nBased on the analysis, 256 bits is the minimum key length from the given options that provides a sufficient security level against a quantum attack.\n\n<<<A>>>"
