    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the space X\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. Let's break down this definition.\n*   A **lattice** $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ which spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It can be written as $\\Lambda = \\{ n_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + n_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ for some linearly independent vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2$, which form a basis of the lattice.\n*   **Nondegenerate** means the basis vectors are linearly independent, which is already part of the definition of a lattice.\n*   The **area** of a lattice (more formally, the volume of the quotient $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\Lambda$) is given by the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by its basis vectors. If a basis is given by the columns of a matrix $A = [\\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{v}_2]$, the area is $|\\det(A)|$. We are given that this area is 1.\n*   A **moduli space** means that we are considering equivalence classes of lattices. For lattices, the \"shape\" is what matters. Two lattices are considered to have the same shape if they are equivalent up to scaling and rotation (orientation-preserving isometries). The problem fixes the area, which removes the freedom to scale. The standard interpretation of the \"moduli space\" in this context is then the space of lattices up to rotation. So, two lattices $\\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_2$ are equivalent if $\\Lambda_2 = R \\Lambda_1$ for some rotation $R \\in SO(2)$.\n\nTherefore, $X = \\{\\text{Lattices } \\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 \\text{ with Area}(\\Lambda)=1\\} / SO(2)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate X to a more familiar space\n\nWe want to find a well-known space that is homeomorphic to $X$. The standard space for studying the shapes of lattices is the **modular orbifold** $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the moduli space of complex tori or elliptic curves. Let's establish a connection.\n\n1.  **The space of shapes:** The shape of a lattice is what remains when we ignore its position, scale, and orientation. Any lattice $\\Lambda$ can be scaled and rotated to be of the form $\\Lambda_\\tau = \\mathbb{Z} + \\tau\\mathbb{Z}$ for some $\\tau$ in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}^2 = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$. Two such lattices $\\Lambda_\\tau$ and $\\Lambda_{\\tau'}$ have the same shape if and only if $\\tau'$ is related to $\\tau$ by a modular transformation: $\\tau' = \\frac{a\\tau+b}{c\\tau+d}$ for some matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix} \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The group of these transformations is $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$. Thus, the moduli space of lattice shapes is $Y = \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Imposing the unit area condition:** For a given shape (i.e., a point $[ \\tau ] \\in Y$), let's find all the lattices with this shape that have unit area. Let $\\tau$ be a representative of the class $[\\tau]$. A lattice with this shape is of the form $\\Lambda = c(\\mathbb{Z} + \\tau\\mathbb{Z})$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$. The area of this lattice is Area$(\\Lambda) = |c|^2 \\text{Im}(\\tau)$. We require this to be 1, so $|c|^2 = 1/\\text{Im}(\\tau)$, which implies $|c| = 1/\\sqrt{\\text{Im}(\\tau)}$.\n    So, for a fixed shape represented by $\\tau$, the set of unit-area lattices with this shape is\n    $$ L_\\tau = \\left\\{ \\frac{e^{i\\theta}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Im}(\\tau)}} (\\mathbb{Z} + \\tau\\mathbb{Z}) \\;\\middle|\\; \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\right\\}. $$\n    This is a family of lattices parameterized by the angle $\\theta$.\n\n3.  **Quotienting by rotation:** The space $X$ is formed by identifying lattices that are rotations of each other. The lattices in the set $L_\\tau$ are all rotations of one another. For example, multiplying a lattice in $L_\\tau$ by $e^{i\\phi}$ (a rotation by $\\phi$) produces another lattice in the same set. The action of $SO(2)$ is transitive on $L_\\tau$. Therefore, quotienting by $SO(2)$ collapses the entire set $L_\\tau$ to a single point in $X$.\n\n4.  **Establishing the homeomorphism:** This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in our space $X$ and points in the moduli space of shapes $Y$. We can define a map $\\Phi: X \\to Y$. Let $[\\Lambda]_X \\in X$ be an equivalence class of unit-area lattices under rotation. Let $\\Lambda$ be a representative. The homothety class of $\\Lambda$, $[\\Lambda]_Y$, is a point in $Y$. This map is well-defined.\n    *   **Injective:** If $\\Phi([\\Lambda_1]_X) = \\Phi([\\Lambda_2]_X)$, then $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are homothetic, i.e., $\\Lambda_1 = c R \\Lambda_2$ for some scaling $c>0$ and rotation $R$. Since both lattices have unit area, Area$(\\Lambda_1) = c^2 \\text{Area}(\\Lambda_2) \\implies 1 = c^2 \\cdot 1 \\implies c=1$. So $\\Lambda_1=R\\Lambda_2$, which means $[\\Lambda_1]_X = [\\Lambda_2]_X$.\n    *   **Surjective:** For any $[\\Lambda']_Y \\in Y$, we can take a representative lattice $\\Lambda'$, scale it to $\\Lambda$ so it has unit area. Then $[\\Lambda]_X \\in X$ maps to $[\\Lambda']_Y$.\n    This bijection is a homeomorphism. So, $X \\cong Y = \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the homology group\n\nWe need to compute $H_1(\\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n1.  **Hurewicz Theorem:** For a connected space (or orbifold) $M$, the first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\pi_1(M))^{ab}$.\n2.  **Fundamental Group:** The fundamental group of the modular orbifold $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H}^2 / PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is the modular group itself: $\\pi_1(\\mathcal{M}) \\cong PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  **Presentation of the group:** $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ has a well-known presentation as the free product of two cyclic groups:\n    $$ PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} * \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} $$\n    A presentation is given by $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = 1, b^3 = 1 \\rangle$.\n4.  **Abelianization:** The abelianization of a free product of groups is the direct product of their abelianizations:\n    $$ (G_1 * G_2)^{ab} \\cong G_1^{ab} \\times G_2^{ab} $$\n    In our case, $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. These groups are already abelian. So,\n    $$ (PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} $$\n5.  **Final Result:** By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal careful points check:\n*   The interpretation of \"moduli space\" is crucial. The connection to elliptic curves suggests that equivalence under orientation-preserving maps (homothety) is standard, which corresponds to the group $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The step showing that fixing the area of homothetic lattices leads to a space homeomorphic to the original moduli of shapes is correct.\n*   The computation of the abelianization of $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a standard result.\n\nThe argument holds together."
