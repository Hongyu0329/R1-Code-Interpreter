    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Input and Its Size:**\n    The algorithm takes two integer inputs, `n` and `c`. The time complexity will primarily depend on the magnitude of `n`, as `c` is a constant base (`c ≥ 2`). Therefore, we analyze the complexity as a function of `n`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The algorithm consists of three parts:\n    a.  An initialization step (Line 1).\n    b.  A `while` loop (Line 2).\n    c.  A return statement (Line 3).\n    The dominant part of the computation is the `while` loop. The complexity of the algorithm will be determined by the number of times this loop executes and the amount of work done in each iteration.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Initialization Step (Line 1):**\n    `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    This line involves a few basic arithmetic operations: assignment, division, multiplication, and subtraction. In a standard computational model (like the Random Access Machine or RAM model), these operations on standard-sized integers are assumed to take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n4.  **Analyze the `while` loop (Line 2):**\n    The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true. We need to determine how many times the loop will iterate before `q` becomes 0.\n\n    *   **Tracking the value of `q`:**\n        *   Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`. Let's call this `q_0`.\n        *   In the first iteration of the loop, `x` is set to `q_0`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊q_0/c⌋`. This is approximately `n/c^2`. Let's call this `q_1`.\n        *   In the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊q_1/c⌋`, which is approximately `n/c^3`.\n        *   In general, after `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be approximately `n / c^(k+1)`.\n\n    *   **Termination Condition:** The loop stops when `q` is no longer greater than 0 (i.e., `q ≤ 0`). Since `q` is always non-negative, this happens when `q = 0`. This occurs when the value `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n        `n / c^(k+1) < 1  =>  n < c^(k+1)`\n        Taking the logarithm with base `c` on both sides:\n        `log_c(n) < k + 1  =>  k > log_c(n) - 1`\n        The number of iterations, which is the final value of `i`, is the smallest integer `k` that satisfies this. This means the number of iterations is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Number of Iterations:** The number of times the loop executes is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. Asymptotically, this is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Work Done Inside the Loop (Line 2.1):**\n    `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n    Similar to the initialization step, the body of the loop consists of a constant number of elementary arithmetic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). The cost of a single iteration is therefore constant, O(1).\n\n6.  **Calculate Total Time Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the product of the number of loop iterations and the time complexity of each iteration, plus the time for initialization.\n    `T(n) = Time(init) + Time(loop)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + (Number of iterations) * Time(per iteration)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) * O(1)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n))`\n    `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Cost Model:** The analysis relies on the **uniform cost model**, where basic arithmetic operations on numbers that fit into a machine word are assumed to take O(1) time. This is the standard assumption for such algorithm analysis unless bit complexity (logarithmic cost model) is explicitly required.\n*   **Base of the Logarithm:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic complexity class, as long as the base is a constant greater than 1. This is because of the change of base formula for logarithms: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log_b(n))` for any base `b`. It is conventional to write this as `O(log n)`, where the base is usually assumed to be 2.\n*   **Interpretation:** The complexity `O(log n)` means that the time taken by the algorithm grows proportionally to the number of digits in the input number `n`. This makes sense, as the algorithm processes `n` one digit (in base `c`) at a time.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop.\n2.  The loop iterates once for each digit of `n` in base `c` (except for the last digit, `a_0`, which is computed before the loop).\n3.  The number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n4.  The number of loop iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n5.  Each iteration performs a constant amount of work, O(1).\n6.  The total time complexity is `O(⌊log_c(n)⌋) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n7.  By convention, this is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
