    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms, $f: C \\to D$ and $g: D \\to C$, along with 2-morphisms (unit and counit) satisfying certain properties. In the specific context of the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, this simplifies significantly.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category**\n\n*   **Objects**: The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$, viewed as posets with the standard order.\n*   **1-Morphisms**: A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms**: For any two parallel morphisms $f, h: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $h$ if and only if $f \\le h$ pointwise. That is, $f(i) \\le h(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since this is a poset relation, there is at most one 2-morphism between any two parallel 1-morphisms, hence it is a \"locally posetal\" 2-category.\n\n**Step 2: Understand an internal adjunction in this context**\n\nAn adjunction \"from $[m]$ to $[n]$\" consists of a left adjoint functor (morphism) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and a right adjoint functor (morphism) $g: [n] \\to [m]$. The unit and counit of the adjunction, $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, translate into the following pointwise inequalities:\n1.  Unit $\\eta$: $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$, which simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n2.  Counit $\\epsilon$: $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nA pair of order-preserving maps $(f,g)$ satisfying these two conditions is known as a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. It is a standard result that these two inequalities are equivalent to the single condition:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\n\nFor a pair of maps $(f,g)$ to form a Galois connection as described, they must satisfy certain properties. A key result is that an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves the bottom element, and an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves the top element.\n\n*   $f: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint $g$ if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n*   $g: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint $f$ if and only if $g(n)=m$.\n\nIf $f$ with $f(0)=0$ is given, its right adjoint $g$ is uniquely determined by the formula $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$. Conversely, if $g$ with $g(n)=m$ is given, its left adjoint $f$ is uniquely determined by $f(i) = \\min\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$.\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ and the set of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ with $f(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps**\n\nThe problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. We have $m=23$ and $n=37$. Based on the analysis above, this is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$, where each $f(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe additional constraint is $f(0)=0$. So, we need to find the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we only need to determine the values of $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$. These form a non-decreasing sequence of 23 integers, where each integer is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a combinatorial problem of choosing $k=23$ items from a set of $N = 37-0+1 = 38$ possible values, with replacement, where the order of selection is irrelevant (as it's fixed by the non-decreasing condition). This is a stars-and-bars or multiset coefficient problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with replacement is given by the formula:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $N=38$ (the number of possible values for each $f(i)$, i.e., $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$) and $k=23$ (the number of values we need to choose, i.e., $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\text{Number of maps} = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis is the number of possible left adjoints $f$, and by the one-to-one correspondence, it is also the number of adjunctions.\n\nNote: If \"from $[23]$ to $[37]$\" meant that the left adjoint was $h: [37] \\to [23]$, we would count order-preserving maps $h: [37] \\to [23]$ with $h(0)=0$. The number of choices would be $k=37$, from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$ of size $N=24$. The result would be $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, so the answer is the same regardless of interpretation."
