Your intuition is correct; for a physically accurate calculation, magnetic helicity should be determined using components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, as Alfv√©n Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves propagate along it.

However, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is **not** typically radial. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral, which at 1 AU is angled at approximately 45 degrees to the radial direction.

The justification for using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Y and Z in a GSE-like system) is a **computational simplification**. It relies on the Taylor "frozen-in" flow hypothesis, where the fast, radial solar wind is assumed to sweep waves past the spacecraft such that the measured wave vector appears radial. This forces the simplifying, though often incorrect, assumption that the local magnetic field is also radial to satisfy the AIC wave propagation condition ($\vec{k} \parallel \vec{B}_0$). This method is an approximation that works best for quasi-radial IMF conditions and is less accurate otherwise. The most rigorous method involves transforming the data into a local field-aligned coordinate system.
