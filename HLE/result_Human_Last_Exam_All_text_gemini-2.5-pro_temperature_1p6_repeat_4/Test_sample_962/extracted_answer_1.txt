The final design is a threshold signature scheme based on the Schnorr signature algorithm, utilizing Shamir's Secret Sharing for the key and a Pedersen DKG for setup. The signing protocol, inspired by FROST, achieves a two-round structure by having each of the `t` participants commit to a pair of nonces in the first round. In the second round, these nonces are combined in a context-dependent way to form a group nonce `R`, and a final challenge `e` is computed. For tight security, this challenge `e` must be a hash of the group public key `Y`, the message `m`, and the group nonce `R` (i.e., `e = H(Y, m, R)`). Each participant then uses this challenge to compute and broadcast their signature share. An aggregator combines these shares to form the final signature `(R, s)`.
