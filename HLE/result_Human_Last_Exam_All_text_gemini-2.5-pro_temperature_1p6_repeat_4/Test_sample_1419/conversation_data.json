    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting up the Theory and Renormalization Group**\n\nThe theory in question is the single-component scalar field theory ($\\phi^4$ theory) described by the Euclidean Lagrangian density in $d$ spacetime dimensions:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi_0)^2 + \\frac{m_0^2}{2}\\phi_0^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!}\\phi_0^4 $$\nHere, $\\phi_0$, $m_0$, and $u_0$ are the bare field, mass, and coupling constant, respectively. We are interested in the massless theory ($m_0=0$) as the mass term is less relevant than the coupling term for the high-energy behavior that dictates the fixed points.\n\nThe core idea of the Renormalization Group (RG) is to understand how the coupling constants of a theory change with the energy scale. This change is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$, where $u$ is the renormalized coupling constant and $\\mu$ is the renormalization energy scale. A fixed point, $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where it ceases to change with the energy scale, meaning $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n\n### **Step 2: Dimensional Regularization and Dimensionless Coupling**\n\nIn $d=4$ dimensions, the $\\phi^4$ interaction is marginal, but logarithmic divergences appear in loop calculations. To regulate these divergences, we use dimensional regularization, setting the spacetime dimension to $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\n\nIn $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, the coupling constant $u_0$ has a mass dimension of $[\\text{Mass}]^\\epsilon$. To work with a dimensionless renormalized coupling, $u$, we introduce the renormalization scale $\\mu$:\n$$ u_0 = Z_u \\mu^\\epsilon u $$\nwhere $Z_u$ is the coupling renormalization constant. The bare coupling $u_0$ must be independent of the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. This fundamental requirement allows us to derive the beta function for $u$.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Beta Function from the 4-Point Vertex**\n\nThe beta function for the coupling $u$ is determined by the renormalization of the four-point vertex function, $\\Gamma^{(4)}$. At the one-loop level, we need to compute the Feynman diagrams that correct the four-point vertex.\n\n1.  **Feynman Diagrams:** There are three one-loop diagrams contributing to $\\Gamma^{(4)}$: the s-channel, t-channel, and u-channel diagrams. They are topologically identical.\n\n2.  **Loop Calculation:** The value of one of these diagrams involves a loop integral. For a massless theory, the vertex correction is given by:\n    $$ \\delta\\Gamma^{(4)} = -3 \\times \\frac{u^2}{2} \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{k^2(k+p)^2} + \\dots $$\n    The factor of 3 comes from the three channels, and the $1/2$ is a symmetry factor for the loop. Here, we calculate the correction using the renormalized coupling $u$. In the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme, we are only concerned with the divergent part of this integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n\n    The integral's divergent part is independent of the external momentum $p$. Evaluating the integral gives:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{(k^2)^2} \\rightarrow \\frac{\\mu^{-\\epsilon}}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon} \\quad (\\text{in MS scheme}) $$\n    The factor $\\mu^{-\\epsilon}$ appears due to the mass dimension of the integral in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions.\n\n3.  **Counterterm and Renormalization Constant:** The total divergent part of the one-loop vertex correction, which must be cancelled by a counterterm, is:\n    $$ \\Delta\\Gamma^{(4)}_{\\text{div}} = -3 \\times \\frac{(u\\mu^\\epsilon)^2}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mu^{-\\epsilon}}{8\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) = -\\frac{3u^2\\mu^\\epsilon}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} $$\n    The vertex from the counterterm Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{CT} = (Z_u-1)\\frac{u\\mu^\\epsilon}{4!}\\phi^4$ is $(Z_u-1)u\\mu^\\epsilon$. To cancel the divergence, we set this equal to the positive of the calculated divergence:\n    $$ (Z_u-1)u\\mu^\\epsilon = +\\frac{3u^2\\mu^\\epsilon}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} \\implies Z_u = 1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon} + O(u^2) $$\n\n4.  **Deriving the Beta Function:** The bare coupling $u_0 = Z_u \\mu^\\epsilon u$ is independent of $\\mu$, so $\\mu \\frac{d u_0}{d\\mu} = 0$.\n    $$ \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left( \\left(1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) \\mu^\\epsilon u \\right) = 0 $$\n    To leading order in $u$, this gives:\n    $$ \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} (\\mu^\\epsilon u) + \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left(\\frac{3u^2 \\mu^\\epsilon}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) = 0 $$\n    $$ (\\epsilon \\mu^\\epsilon u + \\mu^\\epsilon \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}) + O(u^2) = 0 $$\n    To obtain the $u^2$ term correctly, we use the formula derived from the condition $\\mu \\frac{d u_0}{d\\mu} = 0$:\n    $$ \\beta(u) \\approx -\\epsilon u (1 + \\frac{u}{Z_u}\\frac{dZ_u}{du})^{-1} $$\n    Using $Z_u \\approx 1$ and $\\frac{dZ_u}{du} \\approx \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}$:\n    $$ \\beta(u) \\approx -\\epsilon u \\left(1 + \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right)^{-1} \\approx -\\epsilon u \\left(1 - \\frac{3u}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point $u^*$ is a value where the beta function is zero, $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a non-interacting theory.\n2.  $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$: This gives the non-trivial **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point $u^*$:\n$$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$. Since $u^*$ is proportional to $\\epsilon$, it is small for dimensions close to 4, which justifies the use of one-loop perturbation theory to find it.\n\n---\nThe final answer is $\\bf \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}$.\n\n<<<16*pi^2*epsilon/3>>>"
