    "This problem requires finding the steady-state solution to a system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which describe a continuous-time Markov process. The goal is to calculate the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1, i.e., $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks for the long-term behavior of the system, which corresponds to the stationary or steady-state probabilities. We denote $P_i = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P_i(t)$.\n\n2.  **Formulate steady-state equations:** In the steady state, the probabilities do not change over time, so all time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. This converts the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n    $$\n    0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}\n    $$\n    Additionally, the probabilities must sum to one:\n    $$\n    P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1\n    $$\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:** The four equations derived from the derivatives are linearly dependent. We can use any three of them along with the normalization condition ($P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3=1$) to find the unique solution. A common strategy is to express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Steady-State Assumption:** The existence of a unique steady-state distribution is guaranteed because the underlying Markov chain is irreducible (every state is reachable from every other state) and has a finite number of states.\n*   **Linear Dependence:** Recognizing that the system of derivative equations is linearly dependent is crucial. One equation must be discarded and replaced with the normalization constraint.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** To avoid rounding errors, it is advisable to work with fractions or the given decimal values as precisely as possible. In this problem, some coefficients have convenient relationships which simplify the calculations significantly.\n*   **Target Quantity:** Remember that the final goal is to compute the sum $P_0 + P_1$, not the individual probabilities.\n\n### Step-by-step acquisition of the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Substitute the given values into the steady-state equations.**\nThe given transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nThe equations become:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 \\implies 0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 \\implies 0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2$\n3.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 \\implies 0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3$\n4.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Find the relationships between the probabilities.**\nFrom equation (2):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$.\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n$P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1), express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization condition to solve for $P_1$.**\nSubstitute the relationships into the normalization equation (4):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1$\nThis gives the value of $P_1$:\n$P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final required quantity, $P_0 + P_1$.**\nWe are asked to find $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\nUsing the expression for $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} P_1\\right) + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1\\right) P_1$\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\left(\\frac{650 + 19}{19}\\right) P_1 = \\frac{669}{19} P_1$.\n\nNow substitute the value of $P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the fraction to a decimal.**\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
