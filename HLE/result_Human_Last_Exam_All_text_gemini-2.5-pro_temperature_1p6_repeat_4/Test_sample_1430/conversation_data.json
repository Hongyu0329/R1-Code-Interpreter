    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object and the question\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus $g=3$.\nLet X be the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as $X = C^{(15)}$. This is the variety of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension $d=15$.\nWe want to find the smallest and largest possible values of the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, as C varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces. The rank of the Neron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the curve C\nThe key is to relate the geometry of the symmetric power $X = C^{(d)}$ to the geometry of the curve C, particularly its Jacobian variety $J(C)$.\n\nThe Jacobian variety $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$ that parameterizes divisor classes of degree 0 on C.\n\nThere is a natural map, the Abel-Jacobi map, $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ defined by sending a divisor $D \\in C^{(d)}$ to the divisor class $[D - dP_0] \\in J(C)$, where $P_0$ is a fixed base point on C. This map is a fibration.\n\nFor $d \\ge 2g-1$, the fibers of this map are all isomorphic to a projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g}$. In our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$, so $15 \\ge 2(3)-1 = 5$. The condition holds.\n\nThis fibration structure leads to a fundamental relationship between the Picard groups (and thus the Neron-Severi groups) of $C^{(d)}$ and $J(C)$. There is an isomorphism of groups:\n$Pic(C^{(d)}) \\cong Pic(J(C)) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ for $d \\ge g$.\n\nThe Neron-Severi group, $NS(V)$, is the Picard group $Pic(V)$ modulo its connected component of the identity, $Pic^0(V)$. We have $Pic^0(C^{(d)}) \\cong Pic^0(J(C))$.\nTaking the quotient, we get an isomorphism for the Neron-Severi groups:\n$NS(C^{(d)}) \\cong NS(J(C)) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nTaking the ranks of these finitely generated abelian groups, we obtain a formula for the Picard number of X:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))\nNow the problem is reduced to finding the range of possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\nThe smallest possible value of the Picard number for a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g$ is 1. This occurs when the variety has the minimal number of endomorphisms.\nFor a *generic* curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety with endomorphism ring just the integers, i.e., $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nIn this case, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is generated by the single class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, its rank is 1.\n$\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, the smallest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety is maximized when it has a large endomorphism ring, a condition known as complex multiplication (CM).\n\nThe largest possible Picard number for a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g$ is $g^2$. This maximum is achieved when the abelian variety is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication.\n\nFor our case with $g=3$, the maximum value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is $3^2=9$. This maximum is attained for specific curves C whose Jacobian $J(C)$ is isogenous to $E \\times E \\times E$, where E is an elliptic curve with CM. Examples of such genus 3 curves include:\n1.  The Fermat quartic curve: $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. Its Jacobian is isogenous to $E^3$ where E is the curve $y^2 = x^3-x$, which has CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n2.  The Klein quartic curve: $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$. Its Jacobian is isogenous to $E^3$ where E has CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-7}}{2}]$.\n\nFor these curves, the Picard number of the Jacobian is maximal:\n$\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, the largest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is given by $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C))$, can range from a minimum of 1 (for a generic curve) to a maximum of 9 (for a curve with maximal complex multiplication).\nTherefore, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X ranges from $1+1=2$ to $9+1=10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
