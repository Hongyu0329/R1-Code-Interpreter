    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the System and the Problem\nWe are given a discrete-time LTI system:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]` (4x4, so n=4 states)\n`B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]` (4x1, so p=1 input)\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]` (2x4, so q=2 outputs)\n\nThe goal is to design a Luenberger observer:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\n\nWe need to find the observer gain matrix `L` such that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a **deadbeat observer**.\n\n### Step 2: Error Dynamics and the Deadbeat Condition\nThe error dynamics are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`.\nFor the error to be identically zero after a finite number of steps `v`, for any initial error `e(0)`, we must have `(A - LC)^v = 0`. This means the closed-loop observer matrix `A_cl = A - LC` must be nilpotent. A matrix is nilpotent if and only if all its eigenvalues are zero.\nTherefore, the problem is to find a gain `L` that places all the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` at the origin (0, 0, 0, 0).\n\n### Step 3: Check for Observability\nThe possibility of arbitrarily placing the observer poles (eigenvalues of `A-LC`) depends on the observability of the pair `(A, C)`. The system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank, i.e., `rank(O) = n = 4`.\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`.\nLet's compute the components:\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n`CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe system is observable if `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(n-1)]) = n`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Shortest Number of Steps (Observability Index)\nThe shortest possible number of steps `v` is the observability index `v_o` of the system. This is the smallest integer `v` such that the matrix `O_v = [C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]` has rank `n`.\n\n*   For `v=1`, `rank(C) = rank([[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1]]) = 2`.\n*   For `v=2`, we check `rank(O_2) = rank([C; CA])`.\n    `O_2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`.\n    Let the rows be `r1, r2, r3, r4`.\n    `r3 = -2*r1 + r2`, so `r3` is dependent on `r1, r2`.\n    The set `{r1, r2, r4}` is linearly independent. Thus, `rank(O_2) = 3`.\n*   For `v=3`, we check `rank(O_3) = rank([C; CA; CA^2])`.\n    `CA^2 = CA * A = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]`. Let the rows be `r5, r6`.\n    The set `{r1, r2, r4, r6}` can be shown to be linearly independent (since `r6` has a non-zero second element while `r1, r2, r4` have zeros).\n    Therefore, `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n\nThe observability index is `v_o = 3`. This is the shortest number of steps in which the error can be driven to zero.\n\n### Step 5: Design the Observer Gain `L` using Pole Placement (Duality)\nDesigning `L` for `(A, C)` is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`. The desired poles are all at zero. The relationship is `L = K^T`.\nThe dual system state-feedback law is `u = -Kz`, leading to a closed-loop matrix `A^T - C^T K`.\n`A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n`C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\nSince the dual system is multi-input (`C^T` has 2 columns), we can use Ackermann's formula by first converting it to a single-input problem. We choose a vector `g` such that `(A^T, C^T g)` is controllable. Let's choose `g = [1; 0]`.\nThe new input matrix is `b = C^T g = [[1,1],[0,0],[0,0],[0,1]] * [1;0] = [1;0;0;0]`.\n\n### Step 6: Apply Ackermann's Formula\nWe design a gain vector `k_tilde` for the single-input system `(A^T, b)`.\nThe controllability matrix for `(A^T, b)` is `C_mat = [b, A^T b, (A^T)^2 b, (A^T)^3 b]`.\n`b = [1; 0; 0; 0]`\n`A^T b = [-1; 0; 0; 1]`\n`(A^T)^2 b = [0; 0; 1; -2]`\n`(A^T)^3 b = [-2; 1; -2; 1]`\n`C_mat = [[1, -1, 0, -2], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, -2, 1]]`\nThis matrix has `rank = 4`, so `(A^T, b)` is controllable.\n\nAckermann's formula for placing all poles at zero (desired characteristic polynomial `alpha(s) = s^4`) is:\n`k_tilde = [0, 0, 0, 1] * (C_mat)^(-1) * (A^T)^4`\n1.  Calculate `(C_mat)^(-1)`:\n    `(C_mat)^(-1) = [[1, 5, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1, 1], [0, 4, 2, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0]]`\n2.  `k_tilde` requires the last row of `(C_mat)^(-1)` multiplied by `(A^T)^4`:\n    `[0,0,0,1] * (C_mat)^(-1) = [0, 1, 0, 0]`\n    So, `k_tilde = [0, 1, 0, 0] * (A^T)^4 =` (Second row of `(A^T)^4`).\n3.  Calculate `(A^T)^4`:\n    `(A^T)^2 = A^T * A^T = [[1, -1, -1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1], [-1, -1, 3, -1]]`\n    `(A^T)^4 = (A^T)^2 * (A^T)^2`. We only need the second row of the result.\n    Row 2 of `(A^T)^4` = (Row 2 of `(A^T)^2`) * `(A^T)^2`\n    `= [0, 0, 0, 1] * [[1, -1, -1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1], [-1, -1, 3, -1]]`\n    `= [-1, -1, 3, -1]`\n4.  So, `k_tilde = [-1, -1, 3, -1]`.\n\n### Step 7: Reconstruct the MIMO Gain and Find `L`\nThe state-feedback gain `K` for the dual MIMO system is given by `K = g * k_tilde`.\n`K = [1; 0] * [-1, -1, 3, -1] = [[-1, -1, 3, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`.\n`L = K^T = [[-1, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThis is the gain matrix for the deadbeat observer.\n\n<<<[[-1, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
