    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils are protein structural motifs where alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat Positions:** The key to a coiled-coil's structure and oligomeric state lies in the residues at the `a` and `d` positions. These positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). The `e` and `g` positions are often charged or polar and form electrostatic interactions between adjacent helices.\n\n3.  **Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence:** The given sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. We need to find the repeating `(abcdefg)` pattern that places hydrophobic residues consistently at the `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   Let's look for a repeating hydrophobic pattern. The sequence contains many A, I, and L residues.\n    *   A very regular pattern is `A-x-x-L`. This corresponds to the `a-b-c-d` spacing of the heptad repeat. Let's test this assignment.\n    *   If we assign `A` to position `a` and `L` to position `d`, the heptad looks like `A-b-c-L-e-f-g`.\n    *   Let's map this onto the sequence, starting with the first potential `a` position at Alanine-4 (`A4`).\n    *   Sequence:   `G E I` **`A Q S L K E I`** `A K S L K E I` **`A W S L K E I`** `A Q S L K G`\n    *   Positions:           `a b c d e f g`  `a b c d e f g`   `a b c d e f g`   `a b c d` (partial)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Residues at Core Positions:** Based on this alignment, let's list the amino acids found at each core (`a`, `d`) and flanking (`e`, `g`) position across the four heptads.\n    *   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n    *   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n    *   **`e` positions:** K, K, K, K (Lysine)\n    *   **`g` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n\n5.  **Determine Oligomeric State from Core Residue Packing (Knobs-into-Holes):** The size and type of amino acids at the `a` and `d` core positions are the primary determinants of the number of helices (oligomeric state).\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices):** Typically have bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` (e.g., L, I).\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices):** Also typically have bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` (e.g., I at `a`, L at `d`).\n    *   **Tetramers (4 helices):** Are strongly favored when there is a *stratification* in the size of the core residues. Specifically, a pattern of a small hydrophobic residue (like Alanine) at one core position (`a` or `d`) and a bulky hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) at the other is a classic signature for a tetramer. This allows the helices to pack together more tightly into a 4-helix bundle without steric clashes. The small 'knobs' (Alanine) from the four helices pack against each other, and the large 'knobs' (Leucine) pack into the 'holes' created by the surrounding helices.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Our sequence has Alanine (small) exclusively at the `a` position and Leucine (bulky) exclusively at the `d` position.\n    *   This `a=Ala, d=Leu` pattern is the canonical signature for a **tetrameric** coiled-coil. The unusual presence of hydrophobic Isoleucine at the `g` position further supports a structure where the core is extensively hydrophobic, which is characteristic of a tetramer compared to a dimer or trimer where `g` is more solvent-exposed.\n    *   Therefore, the protein would form a 4-helix bundle.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
