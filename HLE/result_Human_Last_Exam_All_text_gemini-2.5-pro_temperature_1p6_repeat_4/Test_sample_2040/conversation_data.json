    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical phenomenon. In SPDC, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). The key takeaway is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical process**.\n*   **Nonlinear Optical Processes:** These effects occur when a material's polarization response is not linear with the strength of the incident light's electric field. A second-order process is one where the induced polarization is proportional to the square of the electric field ($P \\propto \\chi^{(2)}E^2$). The coefficient of proportionality, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility.\n*   **Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** These are two-dimensional (2D), single-atom-thick sheets of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable structure (the honeycomb lattice), borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic arrangements or phases (e.g., β₁₂, χ₃, striped phase).\n*   **Free-standing:** This specifies that the nanosheet is isolated and not supported by a substrate. This is a crucial detail, as a substrate can influence the material's properties, particularly its symmetry.\n\n**2. Identify the Primary Requirement for SPDC**\n\nThe fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear optical effect, including SPDC, is that its second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, must be non-zero.\n\n**3. Link the Material Property to the Physical Requirement**\n\nThere is a strict symmetry rule that governs whether $\\chi^{(2)}$ can be non-zero:\n*   A material's crystal structure must **lack inversion symmetry** (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n*   If a material possesses a center of inversion (is centrosymmetric), its $\\chi^{(2)}$ is identically zero. An inversion operation transforms a point $(x, y, z)$ to $(-x, -y, -z)$. If the crystal looks the same after this operation, it has inversion symmetry.\n\n**4. Analyze the Symmetry of Free-standing Boron Nanosheets**\n\nThe question now becomes: **Do the stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry?**\n\n*   We need to examine the crystal structures of the most common and stable phases of borophene.\n*   **β₁₂ Borophene:** This structure is based on a triangular lattice with a specific pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its space group is *Pmmn* (No. 59), which belongs to the D₂ₕ point group. This group contains a center of inversion. Therefore, β₁₂ borophene is **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **χ₃ Borophene:** This is another well-studied phase. It also has the space group *Pmmn* and is therefore **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Striped Phases:** The common puckered and flat striped phases of borophene are also described by the centrosymmetric space group *Pmmn*.\n\nSince the common, stable phases of free-standing borophene are all centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n\n**5. Synthesize the Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n2.  Second-order processes require the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n3.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack inversion symmetry (are non-centrosymmetric).\n4.  The common, stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are all centrosymmetric.\n5.  Therefore, their intrinsic $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n6.  Consequently, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Symmetry is the Deciding Factor:** The entire answer hinges on the crystal symmetry of borophene. This is the single most important point.\n2.  **Polymorphism:** It is important to know that borophene has multiple structures, but the conclusion holds because the primary, stable phases are all centrosymmetric.\n3.  **\"Free-standing\" vs. \"On a Substrate\":** The \"free-standing\" qualifier is critical. If borophene were on a substrate, the interaction could break the overall symmetry of the system (borophene + substrate), potentially allowing for a second-order response. The question specifically excludes this scenario.\n4.  **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:** This behavior is analogous to graphene, which is also centrosymmetric and does not exhibit SPDC. It is in contrast to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (like MoS₂), which are non-centrosymmetric and are known to be excellent platforms for SPDC at the nanoscale.\n5.  **Edge and Defect Effects:** While the bulk of the nanosheet is centrosymmetric, symmetry is inherently broken at edges or point defects. These locations could, in principle, generate a very weak and localized SPDC signal, but this is not an intrinsic property of the material itself and is not what is typically meant by \"exhibiting\" the effect.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, since the common stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. As SPDC is a process dependent on χ⁽²⁾, they would not be expected to exhibit it.\n\n<<<No>>>"
