    "This problem requires us to trace the phonological development of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb through Proto-Germanic (PGmc) and into its daughter languages: Old Norse (ON), Old English (OE), and Old High German (OHG).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:**\n    *   The form given is `*seh₂gieti` '(s)he’s giving a sign'.\n    *   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. The laryngeal `*h₂` is \"a-coloring,\" so it changes an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a`. Before a consonant, the laryngeal lengthens the preceding vowel and then disappears. Thus, the PIE root `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāg-` in its pre-Germanic form. The cognates (Lat. `sāgīre`, Hitt. `sākizzi`) confirm this long `*ā` vowel.\n    *   **Suffix:** `*-ie/o-`. This is a present tense suffix which, in Germanic, forms Class 1 weak verbs.\n    *   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the 3rd person singular present active indicative ending.\n\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):**\n    *   We apply Grimm's Law to the consonants of the root `*sāg-`.\n        *   `*s` remains `*s`.\n        *   Voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   The root becomes PGmc `*sāk-`.\n    *   The PIE verb type `*-ie/o-` becomes the PGmc Class 1 weak verb, with the infinitive suffix `*-ijaną`.\n    *   The root syllable `*sāk-` is long (it contains a long vowel). In Class 1 weak verbs, this has consequences for the suffix `*-ij-`.\n    *   **Result (infinitive form):** **`*sākijaną`**\n\n3.  **PGmc to Old Norse (ON):**\n    *   The starting point is the PGmc infinitive `*sākijaną`.\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The `*i` or `*j` in the suffix `*-ijaną` causes fronting of the root vowel. PGmc `*ā` is umlauted to ON `*æ` (a long front vowel).\n    *   **Consonants:** The PGmc `*k` remains `k` in Old Norse.\n    *   **Suffix:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a` in Old Norse. The `*i/j*` that caused the umlaut is lost after a long root syllable.\n    *   **Result:** The root `sāk-` becomes `sæk-`. The verb becomes **`sæka`**.\n\n4.  **PGmc to Old English (OE):**\n    *   The starting point is PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` in the suffix causes i-umlaut of the root vowel. PGmc `*ā` becomes OE `ǣ` (long \"ash\").\n    *   **Palatalization:** The `*j` also palatalizes a preceding velar consonant. PGmc `*k` becomes OE `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, like \"ch\" in \"church\").\n    *   **Suffix:** The glide `*j` is lost after the long syllable (after causing its effects). The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n    *   **Result:** The root `sāk-` becomes `sǣċ-`. The verb becomes **`sǣcan`**.\n\n5.  **PGmc to Old High German (OHG):**\n    *   The starting point is PGmc `*sākijaną`.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift:** PGmc `*k` in the middle of a word after a vowel is shifted. This is a complex area, particularly for verbs ending in `*-kijaną`. Based on the direct parallel of PGmc `*sōkijaną` > OHG `suohhen` ('to seek'), we can infer that the medial `*k` shifts to `hh`.\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` in the suffix causes i-umlaut of the root vowel. PGmc `*ā` becomes OHG `*ā`, and its i-umlaut product is `ē`. While umlaut is sometimes not represented in OHG writing or is suppressed by analogy (as in `suohhen`), the regular phonological development includes it.\n    *   **Suffix:** The infinitive ending becomes `-en`. The `*j*` is lost.\n    *   **Result:** The root `sāk-` is affected by the consonant shift (`sāhh-`) and then by i-umlaut (`sēhh-`). The resulting verb is **`sēhhen`**. (An un-umlauted form, `sāhhen`, would also be plausible by analogy with words like `suohhen`).\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sākijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sæka`\n*   **Old English:** `sǣcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `sēhhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sākijaną*\nOld Norse: *sæka*\nOld English: *sǣcan*\nOld High German: *sēhhen*>>>"
