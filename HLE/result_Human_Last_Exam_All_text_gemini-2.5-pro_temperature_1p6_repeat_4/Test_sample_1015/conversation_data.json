    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, considering the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré derrière is a fundamental ballet movement meaning \"arched or bent backward.\" The dancer bends their upper body backward from the waist, aiming for a graceful and controlled curve of the spine.\n\n**2. Understand the Vaganova Method**\nThe Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its precision, logic, and emphasis on building strength and stability. Key principles include:\n*   **Core Stability:** The torso and hips are the stable base from which the limbs move.\n*   **Epaulement:** The articulated use of the head and shoulders is crucial.\n*   **Upper Back Flexibility:** For a cambré derrière, the bend originates high in the spine, from the thoracic region (upper/middle back). The chest lifts towards the ceiling.\n*   **Hip Placement:** The hips must remain absolutely square to the front and directly over the supporting legs. Pushing the hips forward is considered a major technical fault as it compromises stability, places strain on the lower back (lumbar spine), and breaks the intended classical line.\n\n**3. Understand the Balanchine Method/Style**\nThe Balanchine style, developed by choreographer George Balanchine, is not a full training system from the ground up like Vaganova, but rather a distinct style built upon classical foundations. It is known for:\n*   **Speed and Musicality:** Movements are often performed at high speed with intricate musical phrasing.\n*   **Extreme Lines:** Balanchine pushed the boundaries of classical ballet, favoring elongated limbs, deep pliés, and extreme ranges of motion.\n*   **Off-Balance Positions:** The style often features dynamic, off-balance poses that create visual excitement.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is a key area of difference. In many Balanchine movements, including the cambré derrière, the hips are intentionally released or pushed forward. This is a stylistic choice that deviates from the strict classical placement of Vaganova.\n\n**4. Compare Vaganova and Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\n\nLet's evaluate the answer choices based on this understanding:\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) between the two methods, with Balanchine's often being more expansive, the fundamental difference in the execution of the cambré lies elsewhere. This is a secondary characteristic.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and defining difference.\n    *   **Vaganova:** Hips are stable, square, and do not move forward. The bend is purely in the upper spine.\n    *   **Balanchine:** Hips are often allowed to release and push forward. This action is a signature element of the style.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is generally faster, a cambré can be performed slowly in his style or quickly in a Vaganova combination. Speed is a general characteristic of the style, not a defining technical difference of this specific step.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. By releasing the hips forward, a dancer in the Balanchine style can often achieve a visually deeper or more extreme backbend. Therefore, the hip placement (B) is the *cause*, while the degree of the backbend (D) is the *effect*. The technical difference lies in *how* the bend is achieved.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** As with the arms, there are nuances in head placement and *epaulement*. However, the foundational difference in the mechanics of the entire torso and pelvis is far more significant. In both styles, the head generally follows the line of the spine.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most fundamental technical and stylistic difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova method and the Balanchine style is the placement of the hips. Vaganova insists on a stable pelvis to isolate the bend in the upper back, whereas Balanchine allows the hips to push forward to create a different aesthetic line and achieve a greater range of motion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
