    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key terms in the question.**\nThe key terms are \"Sir Launfal,\" \"book of manners,\" and \"preserved alongside.\"\n\n**Step 2: Clarify the subject, \"Sir Launfal.\"**\nThere are two famous works titled \"Sir Launfal.\"\n*   One is \"The Vision of Sir Launfal,\" a poem written by the American poet James Russell Lowell in 1848.\n*   The other is a much older, 14th-century Middle English romance, likely authored by Thomas Chestre.\n\n**Step 3: Determine which \"Sir Launfal\" is being referenced.**\nThe word \"preserved\" strongly suggests an old manuscript context, rather than a modern publication. Lowell's poem was *published*, whereas the medieval romance was *preserved* in a hand-written manuscript. Therefore, the question is about the 14th-century romance.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the manuscript containing the medieval \"Sir Launfal.\"**\nThe romance of \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre survives in a single, famous manuscript. This manuscript is **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, housed in the British Library. This is a miscellaneous codex, meaning it contains a collection of different texts bound together.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"book of manners\" in that same manuscript.**\nBy examining the contents of the Cotton MS Caligula A.ii manuscript, we can find the other texts that were preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal.\" Among the various romances and poems, there is a well-known medieval courtesy book, or \"book of manners.\" This text provides instruction on etiquette and behavior for young people serving in a noble household.\n\n**Step 6: Name the specific book of manners.**\nThe book of manners found in the Cotton MS Caligula A.ii manuscript is **\"The Babees' Book\"** (or *The Babees Boke*).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Sir Launfal\":** It is crucial to distinguish between the 19th-century poem and the 14th-century romance. The context provided by \"preserved\" is the deciding factor.\n2.  **Manuscript vs. Publication:** \"Preserved\" points to a unique, historical object (a manuscript), not a mass-produced printed edition.\n3.  **Nature of the Manuscript:** The Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is a miscellany, not a single work. This is why \"Sir Launfal\" could be found \"alongside\" a completely different type of text like a book of manners.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe medieval romance of \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the Cotton MS Caligula A.ii manuscript. This same manuscript also contains a medieval book of manners instructing children on etiquette. That book is called \"The Babees' Book.\"\n\n<<<The Babees' Book>>>"
