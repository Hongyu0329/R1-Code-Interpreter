    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle to determine the transformation rule and find the value of MISSING.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Input/Output Pairs**\n\nFirst, let's represent the comma-separated string inputs as 2D grids of characters to better visualize the transformation.\n\n*   **Pair A:**\n    *   Input_A Grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1  (row 0)\n        1 2 1 1 1 1  (row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n        ```\n    *   Output_A Grid:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   The character '2' at position (row=1, col=1) has moved.\n        *   Its original position (1,1) has become '0'.\n        *   The character '0' at position (0,0) has become '2'.\n        *   The move was from (1,1) to (0,0). This is a diagonal move, up and to the left.\n\n*   **Pair B:**\n    *   Input_B Grid (showing relevant section):\n        ```\n        ...\n        1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ... (row 2)\n        1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 ... (row 3)\n        ...\n        ```\n    *   Output_B Grid (showing relevant section):\n        ```\n        ...\n        1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 ... (row 2)\n        1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 ... (row 3)\n        ...\n        ```\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   The character '2' at position (row=3, col=6) has moved.\n        *   Its original position (3,6) has become '0'.\n        *   The character '0' at position (2,7) has become '2'.\n        *   The move was from (3,6) to (2,7). This is a diagonal move, up and to the right.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\nFrom the analysis, we can establish a few key points:\n1.  The puzzle revolves around the movement of the character '2'.\n2.  The '2' always moves to a neighboring cell that contains a '0'.\n3.  The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n4.  The direction of movement is always diagonal and upwards (the row index decreases).\n\nThe main question is what determines the direction of the horizontal movement (left vs. right). Let's examine the coordinates of the '2' in each case (using 0-based indexing):\n\n*   In Pair A, the '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 1)`. The sum is `r + c = 1 + 1 = 2` (an even number). The move was up-left `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   In Pair B, the '2' is at `(r, c) = (3, 6)`. The sum is `r + c = 3 + 6 = 9` (an odd number). The move was up-right `(r-1, c+1)`.\n\nThis leads to a strong hypothesis:\n*   **If the sum of the coordinates (r+c) of the '2' is EVEN, it moves diagonally up-left to (r-1, c-1).**\n*   **If the sum of the coordinates (r+c) of the '2' is ODD, it moves diagonally up-right to (r-1, c+1).**\n\nThis hypothesis perfectly explains the transformations in both provided examples.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Rule to Input C**\n\nNow we apply this rule to find the missing output for `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `000000,011120,111111`\n*   First, create the grid for Input_C:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0  (row 0)\n    0 1 1 1 2 0  (row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (row 2)\n    ```\n*   **Locate the '2':** The '2' is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n*   **Determine the move direction:** Calculate the sum of the coordinates: `r + c = 1 + 4 = 5`. Since 5 is an ODD number, the rule dictates a move up-right.\n*   **Identify the target cell:** The target position is `(r-1, c+1) = (1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`.\n*   **Verify the move:** Check the value at the target cell (0,5) in the input grid. It contains a '0'. The move is valid.\n*   **Perform the transformation:**\n    1.  Create a new grid by copying the input grid.\n    2.  Change the value at the original position (1,4) from '2' to '0'.\n    3.  Change the value at the target position (0,5) from '0' to '2'.\n\n*   The resulting grid is:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 2\n    0 1 1 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Acquire the Final Answer**\n\nConvert the resulting grid back into the comma-separated string format.\n\n*   Row 0: `000002`\n*   Row 1: `011100`\n*   Row 2: `111111`\n\nCombining these gives the final answer.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
