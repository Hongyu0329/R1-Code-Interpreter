    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concept - The Chern Number\nThe Chern number (C) is a topological invariant, an integer that characterizes the topology of the electronic band structure of a two-dimensional gapped material (an insulator or semiconductor). Its most direct physical consequence is the quantization of the Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) in the Quantum Hall Effect:\n$\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the System Components\nWe have two distinct systems that are being combined:\n*   **System 1:** A Chern insulator with Chern number $C_1 = 1$.\n*   **System 2:** A Chern insulator with Chern number $C_2 = 1$.\n\nThis means that if we were to measure the Hall conductivity of each system separately, we would find $\\sigma_{xy,1} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$ and $\\sigma_{xy,2} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Connection\nThe two Chern insulators are connected \"laterally\" and have a \"negligible tunneling barrier\".\n*   **\"Laterally connected\"**: This means they are placed side-by-side to form a larger, wider system.\n*   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\"**: This is a crucial point. It means that electrons can move freely between the two regions. The two insulators are strongly coupled and effectively merge into a single, larger quantum mechanical system. We can no longer treat them as two independent entities. The entire junction must be described by a single, new band structure and therefore a single, new Chern number.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Additivity Property of the Chern Number\nA fundamental property of topological invariants like the Chern number is that they are **additive**. When two gapped systems are combined into a single larger system (provided the overall system remains gapped), the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the constituent parts.\n\nMathematically, the total Chern number, $C_{total}$, is given by:\n$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\nUsing the values given in the question and the additivity principle from Step 4:\n*   $C_1 = 1$\n*   $C_2 = 1$\n*   $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **The Role of the Gap:** The additivity rule holds as long as the combined system remains a bulk insulator (i.e., it has an energy gap). Joining two insulators will generally result in a new system that is also an insulator.\n2.  **Physical Interpretation via Edge States:** The bulk-boundary correspondence states that a Chern insulator with Chern number C will host |C| chiral (one-way) edge states on its boundary.\n    *   Each C=1 insulator initially has one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n    *   When the two insulators are joined, the edge states at the interface between them (one from the right edge of the first insulator and one from the left edge of the second) are now in the bulk of the new system. These two states, which are typically counter-propagating, will interact (hybridize) and gap each other out, disappearing from the low-energy spectrum.\n    *   The edge states on the outer boundaries of the combined system, however, remain. Since there was one from each original insulator, the new, larger system will now have **two** co-propagating chiral edge states on its outer boundary.\n    *   A system with two chiral edge states corresponds to a Chern number of $C = 2$. This provides a physical check that confirms our result from the additivity rule.\n3.  **The \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\" condition is essential.** If the barrier were infinite, we would just have two separate systems sitting next to each other, and it would be meaningless to ask for the Chern number \"of the junction\". The negligible barrier ensures they form a single, coherent system.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy applying the principle of additivity for Chern numbers to the two coupled C=1 insulators, the total Chern number of the resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
