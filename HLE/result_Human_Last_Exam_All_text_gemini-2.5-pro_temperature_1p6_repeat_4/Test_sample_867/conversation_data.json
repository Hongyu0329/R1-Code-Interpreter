    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Correct Performance and Choreography**\nThe question specifies a very particular performance:\n*   **Ballet:** *Swan Lake*\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year:** 2014\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's solo variation\n\nThis performance was officially recorded and released, making it a reliable source for analysis. Yuri Grigorovich's choreography is known for its technical demands and specific structure, which can differ from other versions.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\nBefore counting, it's essential to understand the step in question.\n*   **Sissone:** A ballet jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** Meaning \"closed.\" In this context, the dancer jumps and lands on one foot, then quickly \"closes\" the other foot into the fifth position.\n*   In Odette's variation, these are *sissone fermées en avant*, meaning they travel forward. They are sharp, quick, and cover space across the stage.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nBy watching the recording of Zakharova's 2014 performance, we can break down the solo variation into sections and count the specific steps. The variation is comprised of three main phrases that contain *sissone fermées*.\n\n*   **First Phrase (First Diagonal):** After the initial introductory steps, Odette begins a diagonal sequence traveling from upstage left towards downstage right. This phrase consists of a series of *sissone fermées en avant*, culminating in an arabesque pose.\n    *   **Count:** There are **7** *sissone fermées* in this sequence.\n\n*   **Second Phrase (Second Diagonal):** She immediately repeats the sequence on the other diagonal, traveling from upstage right towards downstage left, again finishing in an arabesque.\n    *   **Count:** There are another **7** *sissone fermées* in this second sequence.\n\n*   **Third Phrase (Across the Front):** After a central section containing different steps (*entrechat quatres* and small turns), Odette performs a final traveling phrase of jumps moving horizontally across the front of the stage from right to left.\n    *   **Count:** This sequence contains **6** *sissone fermées* before she transitions into a *chassé* and a concluding turn.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total**\nTo find the total number of *sissone fermées*, we sum the counts from each phrase.\n\n*   First Phrase: 7\n*   Second Phrase: 7\n*   Third Phrase: 6\n\n**Total = 7 + 7 + 6 = 20**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Steps:** It is crucial not to confuse the *sissone fermées* with other steps in the variation, such as the *pas de bourrée*, *entrechat quatres*, or *chassés*. The analysis focuses strictly on the jumps from two feet that close into the fifth position.\n2.  **Choreographic Consistency:** This count is specific to Grigorovich's choreography as performed by Zakharova in 2014. Other choreographers or even other dancers performing the same choreography might make slight alterations, but for this specific recorded performance, the count is consistent.\n3.  **Accuracy in Counting:** The steps are performed quickly to the music. Counting requires careful observation, sometimes viewing the sequence multiple times to ensure no jump is missed or double-counted.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the specific performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a total of 20 *sissone fermées*.\n\n<<<20>>>"
