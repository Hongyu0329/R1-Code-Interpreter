    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who:** A specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n2.  **What did they do:** \"first developed specialized terminology.\"\n3.  **What does the terminology describe:** \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n4.  **What are the applications:** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct scenarios:\n    *   The \"virgin birth of Jesus\" (a singular, positive miracle).\n    *   \"Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\" (a fundamental, negative shift in the state of the natural world).\n\nThis requires identifying a theologian whose intellectual system was robust enough to explain both miracles and the cosmic consequences of sin using a consistent, specific vocabulary, and who was the first to do so.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nBased on the history of Christian theology and its intersection with philosophy of nature, a few key figures come to mind:\n\n*   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130 – c. 202 AD):** An early church father who wrote about creation and redemption but is not primarily known for a detailed philosophical system about the laws of nature.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD):** A foundational figure in Western theology who wrote extensively on creation, miracles, sin, and providence. He engaged deeply with philosophy and developed complex theological concepts. This makes him a very strong candidate.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274 AD):** A towering medieval theologian who systematized Christian doctrine using Aristotelian philosophy. He had a highly developed view of natural law and miracles, distinguishing between God's action as a Primary Cause and the natural world's operation through secondary causes.\n*   **John Calvin (1509 – 1564 AD):** A key Protestant Reformer who wrote about God's absolute sovereignty and providence, but his focus was less on creating a philosophical terminology for natural laws and more on God's direct, ongoing governance of the world.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates Against the Criteria**\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas explained miracles as God acting directly as the Primary Cause, bypassing the normal chain of secondary causes (which we call the laws of nature). This works well for the virgin birth. However, for the Fall, Aquinas's view is that humanity lost certain *preternatural gifts* (like immortality), which then allowed the *existing* laws of nature (like decay) to take effect on humanity. This is less about the laws of nature *changing* and more about humanity's condition changing relative to those laws.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo:** Augustine is the most promising candidate. He developed a specific concept to address this type of problem.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** His key terminology is ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons.\"\n    *   **Concept:** Augustine, influenced by Stoic philosophy, proposed that at the initial creation, God embedded these \"seeds\" or \"potentialities\" into matter. The regular, everyday functioning of the world—what we consider the \"laws of nature\"—is the normal unfolding of these potentialities.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** A miracle, for Augustine, is not God breaking his own laws or creating something entirely new out of nothing *ex nihilo* after the initial creation. Instead, it is the activation, by God's will, of one of these pre-programmed *rationes seminales* that lie dormant and outside the *usual* course of nature. The virgin birth was a potentiality placed in Mary's lineage from the beginning, activated at the chosen time. It is not \"contrary to nature,\" but \"contrary to *our knowledge* of nature.\"\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** This same framework can explain the changes at the Fall. Augustine could argue that in his foreknowledge of human sin, God also embedded latent negative potentialities in creation (e.g., for mortality, decay, the growth of \"thorns and thistles\"). The sin of Adam and Eve acted as the trigger that activated these specific *rationes seminales*, causing a fundamental shift in the operation of the natural world as humanity experiences it.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Synthesize**\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed a specialized conceptual tool—the doctrine of *rationes seminales*—that provides a unified explanation for seemingly disparate events. This single framework can account for a unique positive miracle (the virgin birth) and a fundamental negative shift in the created order (the consequences of the Fall) by understanding them as different activations of potentialities God embedded in creation from the beginning. He was the first major theologian to propose such a systematic and specific vocabulary for these theological problems.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
