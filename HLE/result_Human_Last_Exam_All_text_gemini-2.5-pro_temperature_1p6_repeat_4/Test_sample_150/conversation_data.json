    "Answering this question requires a multi-faceted analysis. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem and the Provided Code\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The core task is to process `n` statements that modify a single variable `x`, initially 0. There are two operations: `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement). The crucial point is that the operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable (`X`) can appear in any order. This results in four possible statement strings: `\"++X\"`, `\"X++\"`, `\"--X\"`, and `\"X--\"`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Submitted Java Program:**\n    *   The program initializes a counter `tresult` to 0.\n    *   It loops `n` times (using `t` as the counter).\n    *   Inside the loop, it reads a statement `test`.\n    *   It checks `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`. If true, it increments `tresult`.\n    *   It then checks `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`. If true, it decrements `tresult`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Flaw:** The program is **incorrect**. It only handles two of the four possible cases. It correctly processes `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`, but it completely ignores `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`. For an input of `\"X++\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` would be false, and `tresult` would not be incremented. Similarly, for an input of `\"X--\"`, it would not be decremented. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.\n\n### Designing the Most Efficient C Solution\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect, we need to design an efficient C program and analyze its performance. The prompt defines efficiency by two metrics: speed (smallest number of character comparisons) and memory footprint (smallest memory size in Bytes).\n\n1.  **Careful Points for Efficiency:**\n    *   **Speed:** To make the program as fast as possible, we should minimize the work done inside the loop that processes the `n` statements. Instead of comparing the entire string (e.g., using `strcmp`), we should find the quickest way to determine if the operation is an increment or a decrement.\n    *   **Memory:** To minimize memory usage, we should only declare the essential variables and use the smallest data types and buffer sizes necessary.\n\n2.  **Optimal Logic for the C Program:**\n    Let's look at the four possible input strings again:\n    *   `++X`\n    *   `X++`\n    *   `--X`\n    *   `X--`\n\n    A key observation is that the character at index 1 (the middle character) is always `+` for an increment operation and `-` for a decrement operation. This is true for all four cases. Therefore, we only need to read the statement and inspect the character at index 1 to decide whether to increment or decrement the counter. This requires only one character comparison per statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation of Performance Metrics\n\nThe request asks for the answer in the format `Nx+y` where `x` is the character comparisons for 100 instructions and `y` is the minimum memory usage.\n\n1.  **Calculating `x` (Smallest number of character comparisons):**\n    *   Our optimal C solution's logic involves one character comparison per statement (e.g., `if (statement[1] == '+')`).\n    *   For an input of `n = 100` instructions, the program will perform this check 100 times.\n    *   Total character comparisons = 1 * 100 = 100.\n    *   This is the minimum possible because at least one character of each statement must be examined to determine the operation.\n    *   Therefore, **x = 100**.\n\n2.  **Calculating `y` (Smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   To write the C program with the absolute minimum memory footprint, we need to declare only the essential variables. We will assume a standard architecture where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   An integer to store the number of statements, `n`, which can be reused as the loop counter (`while (n--)`): `int n;` (4 bytes).\n    *   An integer to store the final result: `int result = 0;` (4 bytes).\n    *   A buffer to read the input statement. A 3-character string requires a buffer of size 4 to include the null terminator (`\\0`): `char statement[4];` (4 bytes).\n    *   Total memory: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 bytes.\n    *   Can we do better? Yes. Instead of reading the whole string into a 4-byte buffer, we can use `scanf` tricks to read just the character we need, thus avoiding the buffer entirely. For example, `scanf(\" %*c%c\", ...)` can skip the first character of the statement and read the second (the operator) into a single `char` variable.\n    *   The most memory-frugal implementation would declare:\n        *   `int n;` (4 bytes)\n        *   `int result;` (4 bytes)\n        *   `char operator_char;` (1 byte)\n    *   Smallest memory size = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 bytes.\n    *   Therefore, **y = 9**.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   The Java program is incorrect, so the answer starts with **N**.\n*   The smallest number of character comparisons `x` is **100**.\n*   The smallest memory size `y` is **9** Bytes.\n*   The final answer string is `Nx+y`.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
