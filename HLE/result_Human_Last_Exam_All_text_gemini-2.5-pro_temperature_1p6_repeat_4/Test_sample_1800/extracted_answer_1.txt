The ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 to maximize active Ni sites. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a lower ratio in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 is ideal, where Ni acts as a promoter for the ceria support.
