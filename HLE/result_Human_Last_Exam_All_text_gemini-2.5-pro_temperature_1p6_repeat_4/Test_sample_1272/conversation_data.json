    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and context.**\n*   **The General:** Mu Sheng (沐晟), a prominent general of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n*   **The Conflict:** Mu Sheng was heavily involved in the Ming occupation of Vietnam (Đại Việt) and the subsequent Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427) led by Lê Lợi. His major defeats occurred during this uprising.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate between Mu Sheng's campaigns and find his *first* major defeat.**\n*   Mu Sheng participated in the final, decisive campaign of 1427, but his role was to lead a relief army from Yunnan. He retreated after hearing of the main army's annihilation under Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng. While a strategic failure, this wasn't a direct battlefield defeat where his army was routed as the primary combatant.\n*   The famously decisive Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động in 1426 was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming, but the primary commander defeated there was Wang Tong (王通), not Mu Sheng.\n*   We must look earlier in the Lam Sơn Uprising. In 1425, Mu Sheng, alongside co-commander Cheng Shan (Thành Sơn), led a large Ming army to attack the Lam Sơn rebels' base, which at the time was in Nghệ An.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific battle of his first major defeat.**\n*   This campaign in 1425 led to the **Battle of Khả Lưu**.\n*   The Vietnamese commander, Lê Lợi, used a strategy of feigned retreat to lure the Ming army into a pre-arranged ambush.\n*   Generals Lý Triện and Đinh Lễ executed the plan, ambushing the forces of Mu Sheng and Cheng Shan at Khả Lưu Pass (ải Khả Lưu).\n*   The Ming army was caught by surprise, suffering a major defeat with thousands killed and a significant amount of supplies and prisoners captured. Mu Sheng and Cheng Shan were forced to retreat. This marks his first clear, major defeat as a commander in the conflict against Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the historical battlefield on a modern map.**\n*   The Battle of Khả Lưu took place at Khả Lưu Pass.\n*   Historical and geographical records place Khả Lưu Pass in what is today Anh Sơn District.\n*   Anh Sơn District is a rural district within a specific modern Vietnamese province.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the current province.**\n*   Anh Sơn District is located in the western part of **Nghệ An Province**.\n\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
