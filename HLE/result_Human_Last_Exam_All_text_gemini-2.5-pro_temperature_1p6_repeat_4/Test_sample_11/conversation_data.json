    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The first statute.\n    *   **Where:** In the modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948).\n    *   **Concept:** Explicitly introduces the concept of \"good faith\". The Hebrew term is \"תום לב\" (Tom Lev).\n    *   **Formatting:** The final answer should not include \"the\" at the beginning or the statute's year at the end.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous law concerning \"good faith\" in Israel is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law established \"good faith\" as a foundational, \"super-principle\" governing negotiations and the performance of all contracts.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute to introduce the concept, not the one that made it most famous or gave it its broadest application. Therefore, we must look for statutes enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation (Working Backwards):**\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law deals with conflicting transactions for the same real estate. It gives priority to the first transaction, but the second can prevail if the buyer acted in \"good faith\" (בְּתֹם-לֵב), paid consideration, and the transaction was registered. This law uses the term, but it is from 1969.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34 of this law contains the \"market overt\" rule (תקנת השוק), which states that a buyer can acquire good title to goods from a seller who did not have title, provided the buyer acted in \"good faith\" (בתום לב). This predates the Land Law.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law uses the term \"faithfulness\" (נאמנות - ne'emanut), which is a related fiduciary duty but is not the specific, broader legal concept of \"good faith\" (tom lev) that applies between arm's-length parties.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This is a crucial candidate. It is a \"[New Version]\" which means it was a consolidation and re-enactment by the Israeli Knesset of a law from the pre-state British Mandate period. As a law passed by the Knesset, it is a statute of the modern State of Israel. Section 28 of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as one who takes a bill of exchange, among other conditions, \"in good faith\" (בתום לב).\n\n4.  **Comparing the Candidates and Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have identified several statutes that use the term \"good faith\" before the famous Contracts Law of 1973.\n    *   Comparing the dates:\n        *   Sale Law: 1968\n        *   Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]: **1957**\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] from 1957 is the earliest statute enacted by the State of Israel that explicitly uses the Hebrew term \"תום לב\" for \"good faith\". While the concept was inherited from the Mandate-era law, its formal inclusion in a \"[New Version]\" makes it the first appearance in a statute of the modern State of Israel.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **First vs. Most Important:** It is critical to distinguish between the statute that *first introduced* the term and the statute that *revolutionized its use*. The Contracts Law (1973) is the latter, but the question asks for the former.\n*   **\"Statute in the Modern State of Israel\":** A \"[New Version]\" of a Mandate-era ordinance, once passed by the Knesset, is considered a full-fledged statute of the State of Israel, making the 1957 law eligible.\n*   **\"Explicitly Introduce\":** The statute must use the specific legal term \"good faith\" (\"tom lev\"), not just a related concept like \"faithfulness\" in agency law. The 1957 Ordinance does this explicitly.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the earliest statute is the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version].\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
