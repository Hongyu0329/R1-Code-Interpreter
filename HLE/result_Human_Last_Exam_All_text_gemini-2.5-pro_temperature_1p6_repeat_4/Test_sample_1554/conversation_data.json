    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular school of thought (Lviv-Warsaw School) and is known for a specific philosophical concept (the decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\").\n\n2.  **Identify the School of Thought:** The Lviv-Warsaw School was a prominent Polish school of logic and philosophy active in the early 20th century. Key members included its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This narrows down our search to this group of thinkers.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Hallmark:** The general term for a sign or an indicator. In Polish, the term used is *oznaka*. It refers to an object, state, or event (X) that indicates the existence of another object, state, or event (Y).\n    *   **Decomposition:** The question implies that this general notion of \"hallmark\" was broken down into more specific categories.\n    *   **Symptoms and Signals:** These are the two specific categories into which \"hallmark\" was decomposed.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Distinction (Symptoms vs. Signals):**\n    *   A **symptom** is a *natural* sign. The relationship between the sign (the symptom) and what it signifies is based on a natural, often causal, law. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. We discover this connection through empirical observation.\n    *   A **signal** is a *conventional* sign. The relationship between the sign (the signal) and what it signifies is based on a rule, agreement, or convention established by a community. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for the furry, four-legged animal. The meaning is learned, not discovered in nature.\n\n5.  **Connect the Concepts to the Philosophers:** Now, we must find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific distinction. Reviewing the works of the major figures:\n    *   While many Lviv-Warsaw school members were interested in clarity of language and analysis, this particular semiotic distinction is a well-known contribution of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz developed a detailed theory of meaning and language. In his work on semiotics and the philosophy of language, he precisely introduced this distinction as a way to clarify different types of inference and meaning. The distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) was fundamental to his analysis of how we derive knowledge from signs.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a hallmark (*oznaka*) into the sub-categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs).\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
