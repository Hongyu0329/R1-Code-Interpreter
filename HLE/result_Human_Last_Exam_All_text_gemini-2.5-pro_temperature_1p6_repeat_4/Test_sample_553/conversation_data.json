    "This is an excellent question that delves into the music theory behind The Beatles' songwriting. Let's break it down step by step to find the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the musical terms in the question\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song or a section of a song. It's the first chord in the scale, often referred to with the Roman numeral \"I\" in a major key or \"i\" in a minor key. It provides a sense of rest and resolution.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is naturally major (V). For example, in the key of C Major, the fifth note is G, and the V chord is G Major. In a minor key, this chord is naturally minor (v). For example, in the key of A minor, the fifth note is E, and the v chord is E minor.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This specifies that the fifth chord must be a minor chord (v). This is a crucial detail. In a major key, using a minor v chord is a non-diatonic (\"borrowed\") choice that creates a specific mood. In a minor key, a minor v chord is the natural chord, but songwriters often change it to a major V chord to create a stronger pull back to the tonic.\n*   **\"Starts with a chord jump\":** This means the progression from the tonic (I or i) to the minor fifth (v) happens at the very beginning of the song, likely in the intro or the first line of the verse.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that begins with the progression **I -> v** (in a major key) or **i -> v** (in a minor key).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate potential Beatles songs\n\nLet's think through some famous Beatles intros and see if they fit this pattern.\n\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Starts C - G - Am - F. In the key of C Major, this is I - V - vi - IV. The fifth chord (G) is major, not minor. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts with an F Major chord. The progression is F -> Em7 -> A7... The key is F Major. This progression is I -> vii -> III7... It does not go to the fifth chord immediately. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\":** Starts with F - C - C7 - F. In the key of F Major, this is I - V - V7 - I. The fifth chord (C) is major, not minor. So, this is incorrect.\n\nNow let's consider a song known for its sophisticated harmony.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the song \"Michelle\"\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is famous for its intricate, jazz-influenced chords.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The verse of \"Michelle\" is in the key of **F minor**.\n2.  **Identify the Tonic Chord:** In the key of F minor, the tonic chord (i) is **F minor (Fm)**.\n3.  **Identify the Minor Fifth Chord:**\n    *   The fifth note of the F minor scale is **C**.\n    *   The diatonic chord built on the fifth degree of the natural minor scale is a minor chord.\n    *   Therefore, the minor fifth chord (v) in the key of F minor is **C minor (Cm)**.\n4.  **Check the Opening Progression:** The song begins with a descending guitar line. The first line of the lyrics, \"Michelle, ma belle,\" is sung over a chord progression. The very first two chords underneath this line are:\n    *   **Fm** on the word \"Michelle\"\n    *   **Cm** on the word \"ma belle\"\n\nThis progression is **Fm -> Cm**, which is a direct jump from the tonic chord (i) to the minor fifth chord (v). This perfectly matches the criteria of the question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" by The Beatles starts in the key of F minor. The opening vocal line features a chord change directly from the tonic F minor chord (i) to the minor fifth C minor chord (v).\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
