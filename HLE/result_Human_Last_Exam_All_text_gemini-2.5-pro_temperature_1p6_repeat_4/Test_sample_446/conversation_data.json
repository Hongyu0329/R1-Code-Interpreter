    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core recognition motif:** The question asks about peptides binding to integrin receptors. The primary and most famous recognition motif for a large class of integrins is the tripeptide sequence RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). All five answer choices contain this core RGD motif at their N-terminus.\n\n2.  **Understand the role of flanking residues:** The binding of an RGD-containing peptide to an integrin is not solely determined by the RGD triad. The amino acids flanking the RGD sequence play a critical role. They contribute to the overall conformation of the peptide, which influences its affinity and specificity for the binding pocket of a particular integrin receptor. Therefore, we must analyze the residues C-terminal to the RGD sequence in each option.\n\n3.  **Analyze each option based on known biological examples:** We need to compare the given peptide sequences to known integrin-binding sequences from extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or well-characterized synthetic peptides.\n\n    *   **Fibronectin:** A major ECM protein and one of the first in which the RGD-mediated cell adhesion mechanism was discovered. The primary cell-binding site in fibronectin contains the sequence GRGDSP (Glycine-Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine-Proline). Short peptides containing the RGDSP sequence are widely known and used in research to competitively inhibit fibronectin binding to integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3.\n\n    *   **Vitronectin:** Another ECM protein that binds integrins via an RGD sequence. Its sequence is RGDV (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Valine).\n\n    *   **Fibrinogen:** This blood-clotting protein also interacts with platelet integrins (αIIbβ3) through RGD sequences, specifically RGDF and RGDS.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the answer choices against this knowledge:**\n\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The flanking sequence MAA (Methionine-Alanine-Alanine) is composed of non-polar, hydrophobic residues. While some RGD peptides have hydrophobic flanking residues, this is not a sequence from a major, well-known integrin ligand.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**. This sequence is directly derived from the canonical cell-binding domain of fibronectin. Peptides like RGDSP are standard positive controls in cell adhesion assays because they are known to bind effectively to integrins. The addition of two serines (SS) at the C-terminus is unlikely to abolish this well-established binding activity. Therefore, this peptide is highly likely to bind integrins.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The flanking sequence LTTP (Leucine-Threonine-Threonine-Proline) is not characteristic of a commonly cited native integrin-binding site.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The flanking sequence QVSK (Glutamine-Valine-Serine-Lysine) does not match the key sequences from fibronectin, vitronectin, or the most cited fibrinogen sites. While any RGD peptide has the potential to bind, this one is not a classic example.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The flanking sequence ARGG (Alanine-Arginine-Glycine-Glycine) is not a well-known high-affinity motif.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The peptide RGDSPSS (Choice B) contains the RGDSP motif, which is the core part of the well-studied cell-binding site of fibronectin. Because of its origin from this classic and potent integrin ligand, it is the most probable candidate among the choices to have been found to bind, or to be highly likely to bind, to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
