    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Setting up the Coordinate System\nFirst, let's place one of the cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we'll align its edges with the axes.\nLet the first cube, Cube A, be the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, centered at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Its volume is 1³ = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Shift\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The problem states the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of a cube connects opposite vertices. For our Cube A, the main diagonal connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Shift \"by 1/2\":** This part of the statement is slightly ambiguous. There are two common interpretations:\n    1.  The magnitude (distance) of the shift vector is 1/2.\n    2.  The shift component along each axis is 1/2.\n\nLet's analyze both, but we will see that one is much more likely to be the intended meaning for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Interpretation A (Shift distance is 1/2):** The shift vector **s** would be parallel to **d**=(1,1,1) with a length of 1/2. The length of **d** is ||**d**|| = √(1²+1²+1²) = √3. The unit vector in this direction is (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3). So, the shift vector would be **s** = (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)). This leads to an intersection volume with irrational numbers, which is an unlikely intended answer for such a cleanly stated problem.\n\n*   **Interpretation B (Shift component is 1/2):** The shift vector **s** is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is a very common transformation in geometry problems. It corresponds to placing the vertex of Cube B (that was at the origin) at the center of Cube A (which is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)). This interpretation leads to a simple, rational number, which is typical for such problems. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nSo, the shift vector is **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n### Step 3: Defining the Position of the Second Cube\nCube B is simply Cube A translated by the vector **s**. To find the region occupied by Cube B, we add the shift vector's components to the coordinates of Cube A.\nA point (x', y', z') is in Cube B if it satisfies:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Intersection Volume\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find this by taking the intersection of their coordinate ranges.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:** We need x-values that are in both [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-axis:** Similarly, the y-values must be in [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-axis:** The z-values must be in [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n\nThe resulting intersection is a shape defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Volume\nThe intersection is itself a cube. We can find its side length from the ranges calculated in the previous step.\n*   Side length in x-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in y-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in z-direction = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of this cube is:\nVolume = (Side Length)³ = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8."
