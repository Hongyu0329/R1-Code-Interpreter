    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $M$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the conditions\n\nLet the sequence of real numbers be $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N$ where $N=100000$, with each $a_i \\in [0,1]$.\nWe need to find a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ such that:\n1.  $x_k \\in [-B, B]$ for all $k=0, \\dots, N$, where $B = 1-10^{-M}$.\n2.  $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe second condition implies that $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$. We can write this as $x_i = x_{i-1} + \\delta_i a_i$ for some choice of signs $\\delta_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nBy repeatedly applying this recurrence, we can express any $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\delta_i a_i$.\nLet $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\delta_i a_i$ be the partial sum, with the convention that $S_0 = 0$.\nThe condition on the sequence $(x_k)$ is that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, we must have $x_k \\in [-B, B]$.\nThis means:\n$-B \\le x_0 + S_k \\le B$ for all $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Rephrasing the problem\n\nThe problem states that for *any* sequence $(a_i)$, there *exist* such a sequence $(x_i)$. This existence means we can choose the starting point $x_0$ and the sequence of signs $(\\delta_i)$ to satisfy the condition.\n\nFor a fixed sequence of signs $(\\delta_i)$, the condition on $x_0$ becomes:\n$-B - S_k \\le x_0 \\le B - S_k$ for all $k=0, \\dots, N$.\nThis can be combined into a single condition for $x_0$:\n$\\max_{k} (-B - S_k) \\le x_0 \\le \\min_{k} (B - S_k)$.\nLet $m = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ and $M_{max} = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$. The condition on $x_0$ is:\n$-B - m \\le x_0 \\le B - M_{max}$.\n\nFor such an $x_0$ to exist, the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$-B - m \\le B - M_{max}$\n$M_{max} - m \\le 2B$.\n\nThis inequality gives the range of the partial sums. Let $R = M_{max} - m$. We need $R \\le 2B$.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that $x_0$ itself must be in the interval $[-B, B]$. So, the interval for $x_0$, which is $[-B-m, B-M_{max}]$, must overlap with $[-B, B]$.\nThe intersection must be non-empty. The interval is $[\\max(-B, -B-m), \\min(B, B-M_{max})]$.\nThis leads to the condition $\\max(-B, -B-m) \\le \\min(B, B-M_{max})$.\nThis inequality is equivalent to the set of conditions:\n1.  $-B \\le B$ (always true)\n2.  $-B-m \\le B \\implies -m \\le 2B$\n3.  $-B \\le B - M_{max} \\implies M_{max} \\le 2B$\n4.  $-B-m \\le B - M_{max} \\implies M_{max}-m \\le 2B$\n\nSince $S_0=0$, we have $m \\le 0 \\le M_{max}$.\nIf $M_{max} - m \\le 2B$, then $M_{max} \\le m + 2B \\le 0 + 2B = 2B$.\nAnd $m \\ge M_{max} - 2B \\ge 0 - 2B = -2B$.\nSo, conditions 2 and 3 are implied by condition 4. The single necessary and sufficient condition is:\n$M_{max} - m \\le 2B = 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that for *any* sequence $(a_i)$, we can find a sequence of signs $(\\delta_i)$ that satisfies this range condition.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the worst-case range\n\nLet $W$ be the maximum possible range that can occur, regardless of how cleverly we choose the signs.\n$W = \\sup_{(a_i)} \\left( \\min_{(\\delta_i)} \\left( \\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k \\right) \\right)$.\nThe condition becomes $W \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in discrepancy theory. We need to find the worst-case sequence $(a_i)$ that forces the largest possible range for the partial sums $S_k$, even when the signs $\\delta_i$ are chosen optimally to minimize this range.\n\nThe optimal strategy for choosing the signs is a greedy one: at each step $k$, having computed the path of sums $S_0, S_1, \\dots, S_{k-1}$, we observe the current range $[\\min_{j<k} S_j, \\max_{j<k} S_j]$. We choose $\\delta_k$ to keep the new sum $S_k = S_{k-1} + \\delta_k a_k$ as close as possible to the center of this range.\n\nLet's test this strategy on a few sequences to find the worst-case one.\n-   If $a_i=1$ for all $i$: The strategy yields the sequence of sums $0, 1, 0, 1, \\dots$. The set of values for $S_k$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The range is $1-0=1$.\n-   If $a_i=c \\in [0,1]$ for all $i$: The range is $c$. The maximum is 1.\n\nConsider the alternating sequence $a_i = (1, 1/2, 1, 1/2, \\dots)$. Let's trace the partial sums with the optimal sign choices:\n-   $S_0=0$.\n-   $a_1=1$: Choose $\\delta_1=1$. $S_1=1$. Sums: $\\{0,1\\}$. Range=1. $m_1=0, M_1=1$. Center $c_1=0.5$.\n-   $a_2=1/2$: Current sum $S_1=1 > c_1$. Choose $\\delta_2=-1$. $S_2=1-1/2=0.5$. Sums: $\\{0,1,0.5\\}$. Range=1. $m_2=0, M_2=1$. Center $c_2=0.5$.\n-   $a_3=1$: Current sum $S_2=0.5 = c_2$. We can choose $\\delta_3$. Let's analyze both choices.\n    -   $\\delta_3=1$: $S_3 = 0.5+1=1.5$. Sums: $\\{0,1,0.5,1.5\\}$. Range becomes $1.5-0=1.5$.\n    -   $\\delta_3=-1$: $S_3 = 0.5-1=-0.5$. Sums: $\\{0,1,0.5,-0.5\\}$. Range becomes $1-(-0.5)=1.5$.\n    In either case, the range is forced to become 1.5. Let's say we chose $\\delta_3=1$, so $S_3=1.5$.\n-   The current range is $[0, 1.5]$. The sums are $\\{0, 0.5, 1, 1.5\\}$. Let's see if it grows more.\n-   $a_4=1/2$: $m_3=0, M_3=1.5$, center $c_3=0.75$. Current sum $S_3=1.5 > c_3$. Choose $\\delta_4=-1$. $S_4=1.5-1/2=1$. The new sum 1 is within $[0, 1.5]$, so the range doesn't increase.\nIt can be shown that for this sequence, the set of sum values generated this way is $\\{0, 0.5, 1, 1.5\\}$, and the range does not exceed 1.5.\n\nA similar analysis for the sequence $a_i=(1/2, 1, 1/2, 1, \\dots)$ also yields a maximum range of 1.5, with sum values being $\\{-0.5, 0, 0.5, 1\\}$.\n\nThe maximum possible forced range is $W=1.5$. This value is exact and doesn't depend on the length of the sequence, as long as it's large enough (e.g., $N \\ge 4$).\n\n### Step 4: Solving for M\n\nNow we use the derived condition with the value of $W$.\n$W \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\n$1.5 \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\n$0.75 \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$\n$10^{-M} \\le 1 - 0.75$\n$10^{-M} \\le 0.25$\n$10^{-M} \\le \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nTo solve for $M$, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides.\n$\\log_{10}(10^{-M}) \\le \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$\n$-M \\le -\\log_{10}(4)$\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(4)$\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ satisfying this. Let's estimate $\\log_{10}(4)$:\n$\\log_{10}(4) = 2 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 2 \\times 0.30103 = 0.60206$.\nSo the condition is $M \\ge 0.60206$.\n\nSince $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value satisfying this condition is $M=1$.\n\nFinal check:\nIf $M=1$, $B = 1-10^{-1} = 0.9$. The range must be $\\le 2B=1.8$. Our worst-case range is $W=1.5$, and $1.5 \\le 1.8$ is true. So $M=1$ works.\nIf we tried a smaller positive integer, none exists. The problem requires $M$ to be a positive integer. If we considered $M-1=0$, it is not positive. And for $M<1$ (not an integer), for example $M=0.5$, the condition $M \\ge 0.60206$ is not satisfied. Thus, no value of $M$ in $(0, 1)$ would work for all sequences $a_i$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer is $M=1$."
