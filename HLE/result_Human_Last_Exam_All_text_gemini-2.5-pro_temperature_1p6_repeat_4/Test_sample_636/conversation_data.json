    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A_cl = A + BF` are located at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system is defined by its eigenvalues. For the desired eigenvalues `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix**\nThe control law is `u = -Fx`, where `F` is the feedback gain matrix. The state dimension is `n=2` and the input dimension is `m=2`, so `F` is a 2x2 matrix. Let:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. First, we calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we compute `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Handle the Non-Uniqueness of the Solution**\nFor multi-input systems (where `m > 1`), the feedback gain matrix `F` that achieves the desired pole placement is generally not unique. There are more unknowns (the elements of `F`) than equations (the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial). This allows us to simplify the problem by setting some elements of `F` to zero. A common approach is to set one row of `F` to zeros, which corresponds to only using one of the system's inputs for the feedback control.\n\nLet's simplify by assuming `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This means we are only using the first input. Our gain matrix becomes:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`\n\nWith this simplification, the closed-loop matrix `A_cl` becomes:\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial of our simplified closed-loop system, `p_cl(λ)`, is given by `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ, 0], [0, λ]] - [[-1 + f1, 1 + f2], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 + f1), -(1 + f2)], [-(1 + f1), λ - f2]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 - f1, -1 - f2], [-1 - f1, λ - f2]]`\n\nNow, we calculate the determinant:\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1)(λ - f2) - (-1 - f2)(-1 - f1)`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ^2 - f2*λ + λ - f2 - f1*λ + f1*f2) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2)`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-f2 + f1*f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2)`\n`p_cl(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2)`\n\n**6. Match Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe now equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\nComparing the coefficient of the `λ` term:\n`1 - f1 - f2 = 2`\n`f1 + f2 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\nComparing the constant term:\n`-1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2`\n`-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n`f1 + 2*f2 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nNow we solve this system of two linear equations:\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nWe found the values `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`. Recalling our simplification where `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`"
