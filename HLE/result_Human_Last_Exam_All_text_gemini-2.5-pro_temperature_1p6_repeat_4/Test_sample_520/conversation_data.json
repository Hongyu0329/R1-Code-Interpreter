    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault\n*   **Nationality:** Belgian refugee\n*   **Time Period:** World War II\n*   **Location:** United Kingdom\n*   **Situation:** He was falsely suspected of being a German spy by UK counterintelligence.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from interrogators.\n*   **Core Question:** What was his true profession?\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context and Careful Points**\n*   The situation highlights the high-stakes environment of wartime counterintelligence. Authorities were extremely vigilant about potential enemy agents, especially among refugees arriving from occupied territories.\n*   The central point of confusion was Vernault's secrecy. A trained spy would be taught to be secretive and have a cover story. Vernault, by being secretive for a completely different reason, inadvertently fit the profile of a spy.\n*   His interrogators, from MI5, observed that his hands were smooth and well-cared-for, which contradicted his claim of being a mechanic. This discrepancy heightened their suspicion.\n*   The motive for his concealment is crucial. He wasn't hiding espionage activities; he was hiding a criminal past. He feared that if the British authorities knew he was a professional criminal, he would be imprisoned or deported back to German-occupied Belgium, rather than being granted refuge.\n\n**Step 3: Research and Identify the True Profession**\n*   Historical records, particularly declassified MI5 files and books on WWII espionage (such as Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross\"), document the case of Andre Vernault.\n*   These sources confirm that after extensive interrogation and investigation, MI5 concluded that Vernault was not a spy.\n*   They discovered that the secret he was so desperate to protect was his real career in Belgium. His true profession was that of a professional safe-breaker and burglar.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n*   Combining the information, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he hid from British authorities, was that of a safe-breaker (or professional burglar). This is the reason he was suspected of being a spy, as his evasiveness to hide his criminal past mimicked the behavior of an enemy agent.\n\n<<<safe-breaker (or professional burglar)>>>"
