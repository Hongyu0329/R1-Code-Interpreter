    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode\nFirst, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode.\n*   According to the Terraria source code (in the `NPC.SetDefaults` method for the Eye of Cthulhu), its base health in Normal Mode is 2,800.\n*   When Expert Mode is active, there is a specific modifier applied to this base health. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is multiplied by 1.3.\n*   Calculation: `2800 (Normal Health) * 1.3 = 3640`.\n*   So, the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player is **3,640**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula\nNext, we must find the formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players in Expert Mode.\n*   The game increases boss health for each player in the world.\n*   In Expert Mode, boss health is increased by **35%** of its base Expert Mode health for each additional player after the first.\n*   The formula can be expressed as:\n    `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35)`\n*   Let `P` be the number of players. The formula becomes:\n    `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + (P - 1) * 0.35)`\n*   This formula can be simplified:\n    `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)`\n    `Total Health = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an infinite number of players.\n*   Mathematically, as the number of players (`P`) approaches infinity (`P -> âˆž`), the value of `3640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)` also approaches infinity.\n*   However, the question specifies this is \"according to the source code of the video game Terraria\". This implies we must consider the technical limitations of the game's code.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Technical Limitation in the Source Code\nVideo games are built on programming languages that use specific data types to store numbers. These data types have maximum values.\n*   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), an NPC's health (`NPC.lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n*   A 32-bit signed integer can store a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`.\n*   Calculation: `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`.\n*   If the game attempts to calculate and assign a health value greater than this maximum, it will cause an \"integer overflow\". In C#, casting a very large floating-point number to an `int` often results in it wrapping around to a negative value (specifically `Int32.MinValue`), which would likely cause the boss to die instantly upon spawning.\n*   Therefore, the highest stable health the Eye of Cthulhu can possibly have before the game's code breaks is the maximum value of the data type used to store its health.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe theoretical maximum health is not determined by the mathematical formula alone, but by the upper limit of the variable that stores the health value in the game's code. This limit is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Base Health:** It is crucial to start with the correct single-player Expert Mode health (3640), not the Normal Mode health.\n2.  **Scaling Formula:** The health scaling is an additive multiplier (`+35%` per extra player), not a compounded one. The formula `Base * (1 + (P-1) * 0.35)` is the correct interpretation.\n3.  **\"Infinite Players\" Interpretation:** This phrase should be interpreted as pushing the system to its limit, not as a purely mathematical concept.\n4.  **\"Source Code\" Constraint:** This is the key to the question. It shifts the problem from abstract math to the concrete limitations of the game's implementation.\n5.  **Data Type Limit:** The answer lies in identifying the data type used for `NPC.lifeMax` (`int`) and knowing its maximum value (`Int32.MaxValue`).\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
