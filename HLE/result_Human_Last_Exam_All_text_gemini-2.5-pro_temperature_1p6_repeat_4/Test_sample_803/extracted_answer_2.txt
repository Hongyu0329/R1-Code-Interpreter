The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the non-trivial semidirect products $G = Q \rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is a $q$-group of order $q^m$ and $P \cong C_2$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup, that satisfy the condition that the dimension of the fixed-point subspace of the action of $P$ on $Q/\Phi(Q)$ is less than or equal to 1. This is equivalent to these groups being supersolvable.
These groups fall into two main categories:
1. $Q$ is an abelian group, and the subgroup of elements in $Q$ fixed by the action of $C_2$, denoted $C_Q(C_2)$, is a cyclic group or the trivial group. This class includes the dihedral groups $D_{2q^m}$.
2. $Q$ is a nonabelian group, and the action of $C_2$ on $Q/\Phi(Q)$ has a fixed-point subspace of dimension at most 1. This holds, for instance, for the two nonabelian groups $Q$ of order $q^3$ with a specific action of $C_2$ that induces inversion on $Q/\Phi(Q)$. Direct products $Q \times C_2$ with $Q$ nonabelian are excluded.
