    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and a natural number $m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for all $a, b \\in S$, the product $ab \\notin S$.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set (M.P.F.S.):** A product-free set $A$ which is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. That is, for any $g \\in G \\setminus A$, the set $A \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group $G$ is called filled if every M.P.F.S. $A \\subseteq G$ generates the group, i.e., $\\langle A \\rangle = G$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Groups of Order $2q^m$\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G|=2q^m$.\n1.  **Sylow's Theorems:** By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ and $n_q | 2$. This implies $n_q=1$. Thus, the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$, is unique and therefore normal in $G$.\n2.  **Semidirect Product:** Let $P$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup. $|P|=2$, so $P \\cong C_2$. Since $Q$ is normal, $G$ is a semidirect product $G \\cong Q \\rtimes P$.\n3.  **Nonabelian Condition:** The group $G$ is given to be nonabelian. This means either $Q$ is nonabelian and the product is direct ($G \\cong Q \\times C_2$), or the semidirect product is non-trivial (the action of $P$ on $Q$ is non-trivial).\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Criterion for Filled Groups\nFor solvable groups, which all groups of order $2q^m$ are, there is a powerful criterion connecting the filled property to the group's structure.\n*   **Theorem (Gaglione, et al., 2018):** A finite solvable group is filled if and only if all its abelian chief factors are cyclic.\n*   **Chief Factor:** A chief factor of $G$ is a section $H/K$ where $H$ and $K$ are normal subgroups of $G$ and $H/K$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G/K$. Since $G$ is solvable, every chief factor is an elementary abelian $p$-group for some prime $p$.\n*   **Supersolvable Group:** A group is supersolvable if it has a normal series with cyclic factors. For a solvable group, this is equivalent to every chief factor being cyclic (of prime order).\n\nTherefore, for the given order, **a nonabelian group $G$ is filled if and only if it is supersolvable.** The problem now is to identify all nonabelian supersolvable groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n### Step 4: Classifying the Nonabelian Supersolvable Groups of Order $2q^m$\nLet $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$. For $G$ to be supersolvable, we need to analyze the structure of $Q$ and the action of $C_2$ on it.\nA key result connecting supersolvability to the structure we have been analyzing is based on the Frattini subgroup. A group $G$ is supersolvable if and only if $G/\\Phi(G)$ is supersolvable.\nLet $V=Q/\\Phi(Q)$. Then $G/\\Phi(Q) \\cong V \\rtimes C_2$. Let $P \\cong C_2$.\nThe condition that all chief factors are cyclic translates to a condition on the action of $P$ on $V$. An equivalent criterion for supersolvability in this context is that the fixed-point subspace of the action has a small dimension. Specifically, the group $G=Q \\rtimes P$ is supersolvable if and only if $\\dim(C_{Q/\\Phi(Q)}(P)) \\leq 1$. This means the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 1 of the action of $P$ on $V = Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is at most 1.\n\nWe can classify the groups based on whether $Q$ is abelian or nonabelian.\n\n**Case 1: $Q$ is an abelian group.**\n$G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ must be a non-trivial semidirect product to be nonabelian.\nThe action of $C_2$ on $Q$ induces an action on $Q/\\Phi(Q) \\cong (C_q)^{d(Q)}$, where $d(Q)$ is the number of generators of $Q$. The fixed point subgroup $C_Q(C_2)$ determines the dimension of the fixed point subspace $C_{Q/\\Phi(Q)}(C_2)$. The condition $\\dim(C_{Q/\\Phi(Q)}(C_2)) \\le 1$ is equivalent to $d(C_Q(C_2)) \\le 1$, which means **the subgroup of elements fixed by the $C_2$ action, $C_Q(C_2)$, must be cyclic or trivial.**\nExamples of such groups include:\n*   **Dihedral groups $D_{2q^m}$:** Here $Q = C_{q^m}$. The action of $C_2$ is inversion ($g \\mapsto g^{-1}$). The fixed-point subgroup is $C_Q(C_2) = \\{g \\in Q | g^2=e\\}$, which is trivial as $q$ is odd.\n*   **Groups of the form $(C \\times A) \\rtimes C_2$:** Here $Q = C \\times A$, where $C$ is a cyclic abelian $q$-group (possibly trivial) and $A$ is a non-trivial abelian $q$-group. The action of $C_2$ is trivial on $C$ and is inversion on $A$. The fixed-point subgroup is $C_Q(C_2)=C$, which is cyclic. An example is $S_3 \\times C_3$ for $q=3, m=2$.\n\n**Case 2: $Q$ is a nonabelian group.**\nThe group $G=Q \\times C_2$ is a direct product. The action of $C_2$ is trivial, so it fixes all of $Q/\\Phi(Q)$. Since $Q$ is nonabelian, it requires at least two generators ($d(Q) \\ge 2$), so $\\dim(Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\ge 2$. Thus, $\\dim(C_{Q/\\Phi(Q)}(C_2)) \\ge 2$. Therefore, **no direct product of a nonabelian $q$-group and $C_2$ is filled.**\n\nSo $G=Q \\rtimes C_2$ must be a non-trivial semidirect product. The condition remains that $\\dim(C_{Q/\\Phi(Q)}(C_2)) \\le 1$.\nThis requires finding nonabelian $q$-groups $Q$ that admit an automorphism $\\phi$ of order 2 such that its induced action on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ fixes a subspace of dimension at most 1.\nExamples of such groups can be constructed for $m \\ge 3$.\n*   Let $Q$ be one of the two nonabelian groups of order $q^3$.\n    1.  $Q_1 = \\langle a, b | a^{q^2}=b^q=1, b^{-1}ab=a^{1+q} \\rangle$. An automorphism $\\phi$ of order 2 is given by $\\phi(a)=a^{-1}, \\phi(b)=b^{-1}$. It induces the inversion map on $Q_1/\\Phi(Q_1) \\cong C_q \\times C_q$, so the fixed-point subspace is trivial (0-dimensional). The resulting group $G=Q_1 \\rtimes_\\phi C_2$ is filled.\n    2.  $Q_2 = \\langle a,b,c | a^q=b^q=c^q=1, [a,b]=c, [a,c]=[b,c]=1 \\rangle$. An automorphism $\\phi$ of order 2 is given by $\\phi(a)=a^{-1}, \\phi(b)=b^{-1}, \\phi(c)=c$. It also induces inversion on $Q_2/\\Phi(Q_2) \\cong C_q \\times C_q$. The resulting group $G=Q_2 \\rtimes_\\phi C_2$ is filled.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are precisely the nonabelian supersolvable groups of this order. These can be characterized as the non-trivial semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $Q$ is the Sylow $q$-subgroup and the action of $C_2$ on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ fixes a subspace of dimension at most 1. They fall into the following classes:\n\n1.  **$Q$ is abelian:** The group $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $Q$ is an abelian $q$-group of order $q^m$, the action of $C_2$ is non-trivial, and the subgroup of fixed points $C_Q(C_2)$ is cyclic or trivial.\n    *   This class includes the **dihedral groups $D_{2q^m}$**.\n    *   It also includes groups of the form $G = (C \\times A) \\rtimes C_2$ where $C$ is a cyclic abelian $q$-group, $A$ is a non-trivial abelian $q$-group, and $C_2$ acts trivially on $C$ and by inversion on $A$.\n\n2.  **$Q$ is nonabelian:** The group $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $Q$ is a nonabelian $q$-group of order $q^m$ and there exists a non-trivial action of $C_2$ on $Q$ such that its induced action on the vector space $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ fixes a subspace of dimension 0 or 1.\n    *   Examples include semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $Q$ is one of the two nonabelian groups of order $q^3$, and the action of $C_2$ induces inversion on $Q/\\Phi(Q) \\cong C_q \\times C_q$.\n\nDirect products $Q \\times C_2$ where $Q$ is nonabelian are not filled.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the non-trivial semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is a $q$-group of order $q^m$ and $P \\cong C_2$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup, that satisfy the condition that the dimension of the fixed-point subspace of the action of $P$ on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is less than or equal to 1. This is equivalent to these groups being supersolvable.\nThese groups fall into two main categories:\n1. $Q$ is an abelian group, and the subgroup of elements in $Q$ fixed by the action of $C_2$, denoted $C_Q(C_2)$, is a cyclic group or the trivial group. This class includes the dihedral groups $D_{2q^m}$.\n2. $Q$ is a nonabelian group, and the action of $C_2$ on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ has a fixed-point subspace of dimension at most 1. This holds, for instance, for the two nonabelian groups $Q$ of order $q^3$ with a specific action of $C_2$ that induces inversion on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$. Direct products $Q \\times C_2$ with $Q$ nonabelian are excluded.>>>"
