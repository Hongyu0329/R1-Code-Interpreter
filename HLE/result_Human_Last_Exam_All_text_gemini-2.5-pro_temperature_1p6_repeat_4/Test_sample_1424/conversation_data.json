    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes the propagation of a **non-interacting** particle. In the Feynman path integral formalism, it is defined as a two-point correlation function calculated using the free action ($S_0$).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Free Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe path integral for any quantum field theory is weighted by the exponential of the action, $e^{iS/\\hbar}$. For a non-interacting system, we use the free action, $S_0$. For a single-particle system described by a field $\\psi(x, t)$, the free action is generally written as:\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x, t)$\nHere, $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator. This Hamiltonian's properties are central to our question.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The analysis hinges on using the *free* action $S_0$, not the full interacting action $S = S_0 + S_{int}$. The bare Green's function is a property of the non-interacting system defined by $H_0$.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the Single-Particle Energy Eigenstates**\n\nThe operator $H_0$ has a set of eigenstates $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ and corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$H_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\nIn the position representation, $\\langle x | \\phi_k \\rangle = \\phi_k(x)$. These eigenfunctions form a complete and orthonormal basis. The index '$k$' represents the set of quantum numbers that uniquely identify the eigenstate (e.g., momentum for a free particle, or principal quantum numbers for an electron in an atom).\n\n**Step 4: Change Basis to Diagonalize the Action**\n\nThe path integral is much easier to solve if the action is diagonal. We can achieve this by expanding the field $\\psi(x, t)$ in the basis of the energy eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$:\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\nHere, $c_k(t)$ are time-dependent coefficients (which are Grassmann numbers for fermions). Substituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the $\\phi_k(x)$, the action simplifies significantly:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, \\bar{c}_k(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This change of basis is the crucial mathematical step. It decouples the problem into a set of independent problems, one for each mode 'k'. The physics of each mode now depends only on its corresponding single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**Step 5: Fourier Transform to the Frequency Domain**\n\nThe action is now diagonal in the state index 'k', but still involves a time derivative. We can make it completely algebraic by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$):\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k(\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t}$\nUnder this transform, the time derivative becomes $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$. The action now takes its simplest form:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\bar{c}_k(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Green's Function from the Action**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function is the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action. In the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, the \"operator\" is simply the algebraic term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nTherefore, the bare Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is proportional to the inverse of this term. To handle the pole at $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ correctly and ensure causality, a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\rightarrow 0^+$), is added.\n\nFor the time-ordered Green's function, the result is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n(Note: An overall factor of $\\hbar$ can appear depending on the precise definition, but the functional dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is unaffected).\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The simplicity of this form is only apparent in the frequency-energy eigenbasis $(k, \\omega)$. In the time domain, this relationship corresponds to an oscillatory behavior $G_0(k, t) \\propto e^{-i\\epsilon_k t / \\hbar}$. The functional dependence is a direct inverse in frequency space and an exponential phase factor in time space.\n\n### Summary of the Functional Dependence\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of the single-particle Hamiltonian's eigenstates (indexed by $k$) and in the frequency domain (with frequency $\\omega$), has a direct and simple dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The functional form is that of an inverse, with the denominator being the difference between the frequency-energy ($\\hbar\\omega$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\nThis means that $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane located at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k/\\hbar - i\\eta/\\hbar$. Physically, this pole signifies the energy required to create a particle in the eigenstate $k$.\n\n***\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, when expressed in the energy-frequency domain $(k, \\omega)$, is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis indicates that the Green's function has a simple pole at the energy of the single-particle state.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on a single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. In the frequency domain, the Green's function for the corresponding mode $k$ is proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, indicating it has a simple pole at the energy $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
