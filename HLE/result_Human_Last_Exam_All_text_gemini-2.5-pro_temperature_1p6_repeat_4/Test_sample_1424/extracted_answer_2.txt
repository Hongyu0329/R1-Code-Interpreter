The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on a single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. In the frequency domain, the Green's function for the corresponding mode $k$ is proportional to $(\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$, indicating it has a simple pole at the energy $\epsilon_k$.
