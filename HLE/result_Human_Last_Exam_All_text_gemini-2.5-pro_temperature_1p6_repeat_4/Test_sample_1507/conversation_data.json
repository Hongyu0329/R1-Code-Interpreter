    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is characterized by its 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. The faces of the great icosahedron pass through its interior, creating a complex, self-intersecting structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks about the \"outer-hull\". In geometric terms, the outer-hull of a shape is its **convex hull**. The convex hull is the smallest convex set that contains the shape. For a polyhedron, the convex hull is the shape you would get if you were to \"gift wrap\" it, stretching a surface taut over its outermost points. The vertices of the great icosahedron are its outermost points.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Shape of the Outer-Hull**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron have the same arrangement in space as the 12 vertices of a regular **icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The question simplifies to analyzing the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Triangulation of the Outer-Hull**\nThe question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" this outer-hull. A triangulation of a surface is a way of dividing it into a set of triangles.\nThe outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its surface is naturally composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the \"Minimal\" and \"Visible\" Conditions**\n*   **Minimal Number:** Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already made up of triangles, this existing arrangement of 20 faces is itself a valid triangulation. It is also the *minimal* triangulation because you cannot represent the distinct faces and overall shape of an icosahedron with fewer than its 20 constituent triangles. Any subdivision of the existing faces would only increase the number of triangles.\n*   **Visible from the outside:** The clause \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\" reinforces the idea that we are concerned with the surface of the convex hull. If you look at a great icosahedron from a distance, the shape you perceive is its convex hull, the regular icosahedron. The \"visible triangles\" are the 20 faces of this icosahedron.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem is equivalent to asking for the number of faces on a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron is its convex hull.\n2.  The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  The task is to find the minimal number of triangles on the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n4.  The surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of 20 triangles. This is the minimal possible number.\n\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
