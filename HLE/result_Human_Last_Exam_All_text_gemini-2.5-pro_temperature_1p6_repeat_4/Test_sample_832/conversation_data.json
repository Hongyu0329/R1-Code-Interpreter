    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" debut variation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Specific Performance:** The question asks for the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene from the ballet *La Bayadère*, performed by Natalia Osipova in her debut with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. It is crucial to analyze a video recording of this specific performance, as choreography can vary between dancers, companies, and productions.\n\n2.  **Isolate the Variation:** Nikiya's final dance in Act II, after she is given a basket of flowers containing a venomous snake, is known as the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation. The count must be limited to the steps performed within this specific solo dance, which begins after she is bitten and expresses her shock, pain, and despair.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\":** An *entrelacé* (often called a *tour jeté* in common parlance) is a type of jump. The dancer throws one leg up and forward, jumps, makes a half-turn in the air, and lands on the first leg, with the second leg raised behind them in an arabesque. It creates a distinctive \"interlaced\" or \"scissoring\" look in the air as the dancer turns and travels across the stage.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** Upon viewing the footage of Osipova's 2009 debut performance, we can break down her solo.\n    *   The variation starts after Nikiya reels back from the snake bite.\n    *   She begins a dynamic diagonal sequence of traveling jumps moving away from the basket.\n    *   The first jump in this sequence is a clear entrelacé. She throws her right leg, turns, and lands on it with her left leg in arabesque.\n    *   She immediately follows with a second entrelacé, this time initiated with the left leg.\n    *   A third entrelacé follows, again with the right leg.\n    *   A fourth and final entrelacé completes the sequence, initiated with the left leg.\n    *   This series of four consecutive entrelacés forms the main traveling section of the solo.\n    *   After this sequence, the choreography transitions to other steps, including turns (chaînés) and dramatic poses leading to her final collapse. There are no further entrelacés performed in the remainder of the solo.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of the Performance:** The count of four is specific to this 2009 Bolshoi performance by Natalia Osipova. Other ballerinas may perform a different number of these jumps.\n*   **Correct Identification of the Step:** The steps are unambiguously identifiable as entrelacés, distinct from other jumps like a *grand jeté* (which typically has no turn).\n*   **Scope of the Variation:** The count is confined only to the steps within this particular solo variation and does not include other dances in the ballet.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy carefully watching and counting the specific ballet step within the defined performance and variation, we find a clear sequence of four entrelacés.\n\n<<<4>>>"
