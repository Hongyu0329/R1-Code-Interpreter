    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after having escaped from the Gestapo (or more accurately, after being arrested and tortured by Nazi forces).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork and its historical context.**\n*   The painting in question is Curt Querner's famous \"Self-Portrait with Spatula\" (Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel) from 1933.\n*   In March 1933, shortly after the Nazi seizure of power, Querner, a communist, was arrested by the SA (Sturmabteilung), the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing. He was imprisoned and tortured for several weeks before being released.\n*   He painted this self-portrait immediately after this experience. His face shows the physical and psychological toll of his imprisonment, but his gaze is direct and defiant.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object being held.**\n*   By examining the painting, we can clearly see that Querner is holding a painter's spatula, also known as a palette knife.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Way it is Held:** Querner is not holding the spatula as if he is about to mix paint. He grips it tightly, holding it upright like a weapon, specifically like a dagger. This aggressive posture is a deliberate choice.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Object as a Symbol:** The spatula is a tool of his trade; it represents his identity as an artist. By presenting this tool as a weapon, Querner makes a powerful statement.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Symbolism of Resistance:** In the face of a brutal regime that sought to crush dissent and control all forms of cultural expression (later labeling art like his as \"degenerate\"), the spatula symbolizes his unbroken will. It represents his art itself as an act of defiance. He asserts that he will continue to create and express himself, using his artistic tools as his means of resistance against oppression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the visual evidence from the painting with its historical context, we can conclude that the object held by Curt Querner is a painter's spatula, and it is symbolically transformed into a weapon to represent artistic and spiritual resistance against the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<A painter's spatula (or palette knife)>>>"
