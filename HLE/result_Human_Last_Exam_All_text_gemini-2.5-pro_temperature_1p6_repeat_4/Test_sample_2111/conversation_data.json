    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity\" based on a quote used by historian Fernand Braudel. Let's break down the key elements:\n*   **Historian:** Fernand Braudel, known for the Annales School and his emphasis on long-term history (*longue dur√©e*) and a \"global historical perspective.\"\n*   **Source of the quote:** Paul Morand, a French author. Braudel is citing him.\n*   **The assertion:** This \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" This is a metaphorical phrase suggesting a holistic, self-contained, yet comprehensive scope.\n*   **The example:** The entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This is a crucial clue. The answer is not \"nation\" itself, but a larger category for which a nation is an example or an analogy.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\nWhen approaching this question, several points require careful consideration to avoid errors:\n1.  **The entity is not \"nation\":** The question explicitly states that a nation is an *example* or a *symbol* used to describe the entity. The answer must be the broader concept.\n2.  **Braudel is the filter:** We are looking for the concept as used by Braudel, even though the original words are Morand's. Braudel selected this quote because it fit his own historical framework. His work focuses on large-scale structures that transcend national boundaries, such as world-economies and civilizations. This context heavily points towards the answer.\n3.  **Understanding the metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" implies a totality, a world unto itself. It needs to be understood as a complete system. This aligns with Braudel's approach of studying historical structures in their entirety.\n4.  **Finding the specific source:** The most accurate way to solve this is to locate the exact quotation in Braudel's writings. This will eliminate ambiguity and directly reveal the term Morand used and Braudel endorsed.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n1.  The question directs us to a specific quote. The task is to find that quote within Fernand Braudel's work.\n2.  Braudel's major works, particularly those dealing with his methodology and large-scale concepts, are the most likely places to find this quote. His book *A History of Civilizations* (or *Grammar of Civilizations*) is a primary candidate.\n3.  Searching within the preface or introduction of *A History of Civilizations* reveals the exact passage. Braudel uses the quote to frame his subject matter.\n4.  The quotation, as cited by Braudel, is: **\"A civilization,\" wrote Paul Morand... 'is a collective entity which, like the symbol of a nation, should be inscribed within a sphere.'\"**\n5.  This sentence directly identifies the conceptual entity at the very beginning. Morand is defining the term **\"civilization\"**.\n6.  He describes it as a \"collective entity\" and uses the \"symbol of a nation\" as a comparative example to help the reader understand its nature, before applying the metaphor \"inscribed within a sphere\" to it.\n7.  Braudel's use of this quote confirms that \"civilization\" is the entity he wants to analyze from a global historical perspective, fitting his entire scholarly project.\n\nTherefore, the conceptual entity described in the question is \"civilization.\"\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
