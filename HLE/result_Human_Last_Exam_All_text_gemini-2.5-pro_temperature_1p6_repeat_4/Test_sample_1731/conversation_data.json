    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a photon gas using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the System\n\nThe question asks for the equilibrium entropy (S) and mean energy (U) for a gas of light quanta (photons). The system is a photon gas, which has the following properties:\n*   **Particles**: Photons are bosons.\n*   **Indistinguishability**: Photons are indistinguishable from each other.\n*   **Occupation**: Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Number Conservation**: The total number of photons (N) is not conserved, as they can be created and annihilated at the walls of the container. This implies the chemical potential is zero (μ=0).\n\nThe theoretical framework specified is Large Deviation Theory (LDT), specifically referencing the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, particularly the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle & Entropy**: The entropy of a macrostate is given by S = k_B * ln(W), where W is the number of microstates corresponding to that macrostate. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes W (and thus S), subject to physical constraints.\n*   **LDT Connection**: The probability of observing a particular macrostate is proportional to its multiplicity, P ~ W = exp(S/k_B). In LDT, the probability of a rare event (a deviation from the mean) is given by P ≈ exp[-N * I], where I is the rate function. Comparing these, we can see that maximizing entropy is equivalent to minimizing a rate function. The theorems of Cramer and Sanov formalize this idea for sample means and empirical distributions, respectively. Applying these principles to a physical system under an energy constraint leads to the canonical ensemble framework.\n\nOur goal is to find the equilibrium distribution of photons over energy levels and then use this distribution to calculate the total mean energy U and the total entropy S.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution (The Most Probable Macrostate)\n\n1.  **Multiplicity (W)**: We consider a set of energy levels {ε_j}, each with a degeneracy of g_j (meaning there are g_j states at that energy). For bosons, the number of ways to distribute n_j indistinguishable photons among g_j states is given by the combination with repetition formula:\n    W_j = (n_j + g_j - 1)! / (n_j! * (g_j - 1)!)\n    The total multiplicity for a configuration {n_j} is the product over all energy levels: W = Π_j W_j.\n\n2.  **Entropy (S)**: The entropy is S = k_B * ln(W) = k_B * Σ_j ln(W_j). Using Stirling's approximation (ln(x!) ≈ x*ln(x) - x) for large n_j and g_j, this simplifies to:\n    S = k_B * Σ_j [ g_j * ( (1 + f_j)ln(1 + f_j) - f_j*ln(f_j) ) ], where f_j = n_j/g_j is the average occupation per state at energy ε_j.\n\n3.  **Maximizing Entropy (Minimizing the Rate Function)**: The equilibrium state is the most probable one, which is the one that maximizes S subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy, U = Σ_j n_j*ε_j = Σ_j g_j*f_j*ε_j. Since the number of photons is not conserved, there is no constraint on the total number of particles.\n\n    We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize S. We seek to maximize the function:\n    L = S/k_B - β * (Σ_j g_j*f_j*ε_j - U)\n    where β is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint. Setting the derivative with respect to f_j to zero (∂L/∂f_j = 0):\n    ∂/∂f_j [ g_j * ((1 + f_j)ln(1 + f_j) - f_j*ln(f_j)) ] - β * g_j*ε_j = 0\n    g_j * [ ln(1 + f_j) - ln(f_j) ] - β * g_j*ε_j = 0\n    ln( (1 + f_j) / f_j ) = β*ε_j\n    1 + 1/f_j = exp(β*ε_j)\n    f_j = 1 / (exp(β*ε_j) - 1)\n\n4.  **Identifying β**: The Lagrange multiplier β is identified with the inverse temperature from thermodynamics, β = 1/(k_B*T). This gives the equilibrium occupation number, known as the Planck distribution (which is the Bose-Einstein distribution with μ=0):\n    <f_j> = <n_j>/g_j = 1 / (exp(ε_j / (k_B*T)) - 1)\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)\n\nThe total energy U is the sum of the energies of all states, weighted by their equilibrium occupation number. We move from a discrete sum to a continuous integral by introducing the density of states g(ε). For photons in a 3D box of volume V (including two polarization states), the density of states is:\ng(ε)dε = (8πV / (h³c³)) * ε² dε\n\nU = ∫₀^∞ ε * (<n(ε)>/g(ε)) * g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * f(ε) * g(ε) dε\nU = ∫₀^∞ ε * (1 / (exp(ε / (k_B*T)) - 1)) * ( (8πV / (h³c³)) * ε² ) dε\nU = (8πV / (h³c³)) * ∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (exp(ε / (k_B*T)) - 1)) dε\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution x = ε / (k_B*T):\nU = (8πV / (h³c³)) * (k_B*T)⁴ ∫₀^∞ (x³ / (e^x - 1)) dx\nThe definite integral has a standard value: ∫₀^∞ (x³ / (e^x - 1)) dx = π⁴ / 15.\n\nSubstituting this back gives the equilibrium mean energy:\nU = (8πV * (k_B*T)⁴ / (h³c³)) * (π⁴ / 15)\n**U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴**\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)\n\nThe entropy can be calculated by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula and integrating. However, a much simpler method is to use the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas. Since the chemical potential μ=0, the Gibbs free energy G = U - TS + PV = Nμ = 0.\nThis gives U - TS + PV = 0, or S = (U + PV) / T.\n\nFor a relativistic gas like a photon gas, the pressure P is related to the energy density u = U/V by P = u/3 = U/(3V).\nTherefore, PV = U/3.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for entropy:\nS = (U + U/3) / T = (4/3) * (U / T)\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for U we just found:\nS = (4/3T) * [ (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴ ]\n**S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy (U) and entropy (S) of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nU = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nS = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³\n\n<<<**Mean Energy (U):** U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴\n**Entropy (S):** S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³>>>"
