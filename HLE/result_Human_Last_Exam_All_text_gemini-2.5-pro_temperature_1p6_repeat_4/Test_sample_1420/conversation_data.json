    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Specific Heat Exponent (α):** This exponent describes how the specific heat `C` diverges as a system approaches its critical temperature `T_c`. The relationship is given by `C ~ |T - T_c|^(-α)`.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) and Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** The RG is a theoretical framework used to understand critical phenomena. The epsilon expansion is a key computational technique within RG. It involves performing calculations in a dimension `d` slightly below the upper critical dimension `d_c`, treating `ϵ = d_c - d` as a small parameter.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For the universality class that includes the Ising model (described by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson φ⁴ theory), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. At or above `d_c`, fluctuations are negligible, and mean-field theory exponents are exact (for the specific heat, `α_MF = 0`).\n*   **Target System:** The question asks for the exponent in a spatial dimension `d=3`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Problem Using the Epsilon Expansion**\n*   We set `d_c = 4` and `d = 3`.\n*   The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n*   Our goal is to find an expression for `α` as a power series in `ϵ` and then evaluate it for `ϵ=1`.\n\n**3. Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\nA fundamental result from RG theory is the hyperscaling relation, which connects several critical exponents. The one relating `α` to the correlation length exponent `ν` and the dimension `d` is:\n`dν = 2 - α`\nThis can be rearranged to solve for `α`:\n`α = 2 - dν`\n\n**4. Find the Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent ν**\nThe next step is to find the expression for `ν` to first order in `ϵ`. The standard RG calculation for the n-vector model (where `n` is the number of components of the order parameter) yields:\n`ν = 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)`\nHere, `O(ϵ^2)` denotes terms of second order or higher in `ϵ`, which we will neglect in our first-order calculation.\n\n**5. Calculate α in Terms of ϵ and n**\nNow, we substitute `d = 4 - ϵ` and the expression for `ν` into the hyperscaling relation `α = 2 - dν`:\n`α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ^2)]`\n\nWe expand the product, keeping terms only up to the first order in `ϵ`:\n`α = 2 - [ (4 * 1/2) + (4 * (n+2)/(4(n+8)) * ϵ) - (ϵ * 1/2) + O(ϵ^2) ]`\n`α = 2 - [ 2 + (n+2)/(n+8) * ϵ - ϵ/2 + O(ϵ^2) ]`\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n`α = 2 - 2 - (n+2)/(n+8) * ϵ + ϵ/2 + O(ϵ^2)`\n`α = [ 1/2 - (n+2)/(n+8) ] * ϵ`\n\nCombine the terms inside the bracket by finding a common denominator `2(n+8)`:\n`α = [ (n+8) - 2(n+2) ] / [ 2(n+8) ] * ϵ`\n`α = [ n + 8 - 2n - 4 ] / [ 2(n+8) ] * ϵ`\n`α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ`\n\n**6. Specify the Model and Final Calculation**\nThe question doesn't specify the model, which is defined by `n`. In such problems, it's standard to assume the simplest and most common case: the **Ising model**, which has a scalar order parameter, so **n=1**.\nSubstitute `n=1` into the formula for `α`:\n`α = (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) * ϵ = 3 / (2*9) * ϵ = 3/18 * ϵ`\n`α = ϵ / 6`\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of `ϵ` for `d=3`, which is `ϵ = 1`:\n`α ≈ 1/6`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Approximation Quality:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbation series around `d=4`. Using it at `ϵ=1` (`d=3`) gives a first approximation. The result `α ≈ 1/6 ≈ 0.167` is qualitatively correct but differs from the more precise numerical value for the 3D Ising model (`α ≈ 0.110`). Higher-order terms in `ϵ` are needed for better accuracy.\n2.  **Choice of Model:** The result depends on `n`. The assumption of the Ising model (`n=1`) is crucial. For other models like the XY model (`n=2`), the result would be different (`α = ϵ/10`).\n3.  **Correct Formulas:** The calculation relies on the correct forms of the hyperscaling relation (`dν = 2 - α`) and the first-order expansion for `ν`. An error in either of these foundational formulas would lead to an incorrect result.\n4.  **Algebraic Precision:** Care must be taken during the algebraic expansion to correctly identify and keep all terms up to `O(ϵ)` and correctly discard `O(ϵ^2)` terms.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
