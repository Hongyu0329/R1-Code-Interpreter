    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N=36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001$\n$36 = 6^2 = (2 \\times 3)^2 = 2^2 \\times 3^2$\n$1001 = 7 \\times 143 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\cdot \\chi_{3^2} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is **primitive** of conductor $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character of conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_{2^2}, \\chi_{3^2}, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Primitive Characters for each Prime Power Factor\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, and their possible orders. Let $C_k(p^a)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ of order $k$.\n\n*   **For $p^a = 2^2 = 4$:**\n    The group of characters mod 4, $\\hat{G}_4$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. One is the principal character (conductor 1, order 1). The other is primitive (conductor 4) and has order 2.\n    *   $C_2(4) = 1$.\n    *   There are no other primitive characters for conductor 4.\n\n*   **For $p^a = 3^2 = 9$:**\n    The group of characters mod 9, $\\hat{G}_9$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. It has $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The characters that are not primitive mod 9 are induced from characters mod 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters (one of order 1, one of order 2). The remaining $6-2=4$ characters are primitive mod 9.\n    The orders of elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. Since the non-primitive characters have orders 1 and 2, the 4 primitive characters must have orders 3 and 6.\n    In $C_6$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ elements of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ elements of order 6.\n    *   $C_3(9) = 2$.\n    *   $C_6(9) = 2$.\n\n*   **For $p^a = 7^1 = 7$:**\n    The group of characters mod 7, $\\hat{G}_7$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. It has $\\phi(7)=6$ characters. The only non-primitive character is the principal character (conductor 1). The other $6-1=5$ characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6 other than 1, i.e., 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   $C_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $C_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $C_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For $p^a = 11^1 = 11$:**\n    The group of characters mod 11, $\\hat{G}_{11}$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. All $\\phi(11)-1=9$ non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders of elements in $C_{10}$ are 1, 2, 5, 10. The only non-1 order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   $C_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   There are no primitive characters mod 11 with order 3 or 6.\n\n*   **For $p^a = 13^1 = 13$:**\n    The group of characters mod 13, $\\hat{G}_{13}$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. All $\\phi(13)-1=11$ non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   $C_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $C_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $C_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Combinations\n\nWe need to choose one primitive character for each factor $p^a$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the tuple of orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. For the lcm to be 6, we must satisfy three conditions:\n1.  Every order $o_{p^a}$ must divide 6.\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n3.  At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions with our available character choices:\n*   Any choice for the primitive character $\\chi_4$ has order $o_4 = 2$. This guarantees that condition 2 is always met.\n*   Any choice for the primitive character $\\chi_9$ has order $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. This guarantees that its order is divisible by 3, so condition 3 is always met.\n\nSince any valid combination of primitive characters will result in an lcm divisible by 2 and 3, the lcm will be divisible by 6.\nCondition 1 requires that all component orders must divide 6. Let's verify this for all possible choices:\n*   $\\chi_4$: Order is 2 (divides 6).\n*   $\\chi_9$: Orders are 3, 6 (both divide 6).\n*   $\\chi_7$: Orders are 2, 3, 6 (all divide 6).\n*   $\\chi_{11}$: The only choice has order 2 (divides 6). If we chose a character of order 5 or 10, condition 1 would fail, but we are only considering characters whose orders can contribute to an lcm of 6.\n*   $\\chi_{13}$: Orders are 2, 3, 6 (all divide 6).\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to counting the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_{p^a})$ where the order of each character $\\chi_{p^a}$ divides 6.\n\nLet's count the number of choices for each component:\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_4$ (order must divide 6):** There is 1 primitive character, and its order is 2, which divides 6. (1 choice)\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_9$ (order must divide 6):** There are 2 of order 3 and 2 of order 6. Total: $2+2=4$ choices.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_7$ (order must divide 6):** There is 1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, and 2 of order 6. Total: $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_{11}$ (order must divide 6):** The only primitive character whose order divides 6 is the one of order 2. (1 choice)\n*   **Choices for $\\chi_{13}$ (order must divide 6):** There is 1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, and 2 of order 6. Total: $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$\n\nWe can verify this with the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters with order dividing $k$.\nNumber of order 6 = $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$.\n*   $N(6)$: This is the number we calculated, which is 100.\n*   $N(3)$: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 3. For the $\\chi_4$ component, there are no primitive characters with order dividing 3. Thus, $N(3)=0$.\n*   $N(2)$: Number of primitive characters with order dividing 2. For the $\\chi_9$ component, there are no primitive characters with order dividing 2. Thus, $N(2)=0$.\n*   $N(1)$: A primitive character cannot have order 1. Thus, $N(1)=0$.\n\nSo, the number of characters of order 6 is $100 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 100$."
