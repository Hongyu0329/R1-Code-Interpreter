    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\nLet $S = \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ be the special unitary group. The group $G$ is the quotient of $S$ by its center, $G = S / Z(S)$. An element $\\bar{x} = xZ(S)$ is an involution in $G$ if it is not the identity element and $\\bar{x}^2$ is the identity. This means $x \\notin Z(S)$ and $x^2 \\in Z(S)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the center of SU(4, 997)**\nLet $n=4$ and $q=997$. The center of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is given by $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nHere, $n=4$ and $q=997$, so $q+1=998$.\n$d = \\gcd(4, 998) = \\gcd(2^2, 2 \\cdot 499) = 2$.\nThe center $Z(S)$ has order 2. The elements are solutions to $\\lambda^2=1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}$, which are $1$ and $-1$. So, $Z(S) = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the preimages of involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\nThe condition $x^2 \\in Z(S)$ means $x^2 = I$ or $x^2 = -I$.\nThe condition $x \\notin Z(S)$ means $x \\neq I$ and $x \\neq -I$.\nThe number of involutions in $G$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{|\\{x \\in S \\mid x^2 \\in Z(S) \\text{ and } x \\notin Z(S)\\}|}{|Z(S)|} $$\nLet $S_1 = \\{x \\in S \\mid x^2 = I\\}$ and $S_2 = \\{x \\in S \\mid x^2 = -I\\}$.\nThe set of preimages is $(S_1 \\setminus Z(S)) \\cup (S_2 \\setminus Z(S))$.\nSince the elements of $Z(S)$ square to $I$, $Z(S) \\subseteq S_1$. This means $S_2 \\cap Z(S) = \\emptyset$.\nSo the set of preimages is $(S_1 \\setminus Z(S)) \\cup S_2$.\nThe number of such elements is $|S_1| - |Z(S)| + |S_2|$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the elements in $S_1 = \\{x \\in S \\mid x^2 = I\\}$**\nThe set $S_1$ consists of the identity element and all involutions in $S$. An element of $\\text{U}(n,q)$ is an involution if and only if it is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. For it to be in $\\text{SU}(n,q)$, its determinant must be 1. This requires the number of $-1$ eigenvalues (let's call this dimension $k$) to be even.\nFor $n=4$, possible values for $k$ are $k=2$ and $k=4$.\n*   If $k=4$, the involution is $-I$. This is a single element. It is in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$ since $\\det(-I)=(-1)^4=1$.\n*   If $k=2$, the involutions are determined by their 2-dimensional $(-1)$-eigenspace, which must be a non-degenerate subspace. According to the results by Zaha≈ôov on the number of non-degenerate planes in a unitary space, the number of such involutions in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ is $q^4(q^2+1)$. Since these involutions have determinant $(-1)^2=1$, they are all in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\n\nSo, the total number of involutions in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$ is $I(\\text{SU}(4,q)) = q^4(q^2+1) + 1$.\nThe set $S_1$ includes the identity, so $|S_1| = I(\\text{SU}(4,q)) + 1 = q^4(q^2+1) + 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the elements in $S_2 = \\{x \\in S \\mid x^2 = -I\\}$**\nThe number of elements $x \\in \\text{U}(n,q)$ with $x^2 = -I$ can be determined from the structure of their conjugacy classes and centralizers. For $n=2m$, these classes are in correspondence with conjugacy classes of involutions in $\\text{GL}(m, q^2)$. For $n=4$, $m=2$.\nInvolutions in $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$ are of two types: those similar to $\\text{diag}(1, -1)$ and the central involution $-I$. This gives two conjugacy classes of elements with $x^2=-I$ in $\\text{U}(4,q)$.\nThe determinants of all such elements are 1, so they are all in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$.\n1.  The class corresponding to the non-central involution in $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$. Its size in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ is $q^4(q^3+1)$.\n2.  The class corresponding to the central involution $-I_2$ in $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$. Its size in $\\text{U}(4,q)$ is $q^2(q+1)(q^3+1)$.\n\nThe total number of elements with $x^2=-I$ in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$ is the sum of these sizes:\n$|S_2| = q^4(q^3+1) + q^2(q+1)(q^3+1) = (q^4 + q^3 + q^2)(q^3+1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final number**\nNumber of preimages = $|S_1| - |Z(S)| + |S_2|$\n$= (q^4(q^2+1) + 2) - 2 + (q^4+q^3+q^2)(q^3+1)$\n$= q^4(q^2+1) + q^2(q^2+q+1)(q^3+1)$\n$= (q^6+q^4) + q^2(q^5+q^4+q^3+q^2+q+1)$\n$= q^6+q^4 + q^7+q^6+q^5+q^4+q^3+q^2$\n$= q^7 + 2q^6 + q^5 + 2q^4 + q^3 + q^2$\nThe number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is this quantity divided by $|Z(S)|=2$:\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{q^7 + 2q^6 + q^5 + 2q^4 + q^3 + q^2}{2}$\nWe set $q = 997$:\nNumber = $\\frac{997^7 + 2 \\cdot 997^6 + 997^5 + 2 \\cdot 997^4 + 997^3 + 997^2}{2}$\n$= \\frac{997^2(997^5 + 2 \\cdot 997^4 + 997^3 + 2 \\cdot 997^2 + 997 + 1)}{2}$"
