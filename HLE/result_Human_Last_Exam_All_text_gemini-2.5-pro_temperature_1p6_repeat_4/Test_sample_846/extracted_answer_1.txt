The table must change from a long, extended shape to a shorter, bent shape when the sun rises. When the sun sets, it must relax back to its original long, extended shape. This mimics the photoisomerization of azobenzene, which converts from its stable *trans* form to its *cis* form under UV light (daytime) and thermally relaxes back to the *trans* form in the dark (nighttime).
