    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we list the elements known as noble gases, which are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context of the Question**\n*   **\"On Earth\" / \"all terrestrial matter\":** This directs us to consider the natural abundance of these elements on our planet. This includes the atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core.\n*   **\"in 2002\":** The natural abundances of elements on Earth do not change on such short timescales. Geological and atmospheric processes operate over thousands to millions of years. Therefore, the data from 2002 is effectively the same as current data. This detail does not change the outcome.\n*   **\"rarest\":** We need to compare the abundance of each noble gas to find the one with the lowest concentration.\n\n**Step 3: Filter for Naturally Occurring Gases**\nOganesson (Og) is a synthetic element, created only in particle accelerators. It does not occur naturally on Earth. Therefore, its natural abundance is zero. While technically this makes it the rarest, questions about the \"rarest element\" typically refer to naturally occurring elements. We will proceed by comparing the natural abundances of the other six noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Abundances of Naturally Occurring Noble Gases**\nThe primary reservoir of free noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere. Let's compare their atmospheric concentrations, which reflect their overall relative rarity.\n*   **Argon (Ar):** It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% (9,340 parts per million, ppm) of the atmosphere. Most of it is Argon-40, produced by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Present at about 5.2 ppm. While constantly produced by radioactive decay in the crust, it is light enough to escape Earth's gravity over geological time.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer, at about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Even rarer than Krypton, with a concentration of about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion, ppb). It is the rarest *stable* noble gas.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Case of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is different from the others because all of its isotopes are radioactive. It is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation.\n*   It is constantly being formed through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   However, Radon itself decays very quickly. Its longest-lived isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   Because it decays almost as fast as it is produced, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any given moment is minuscule. Its average atmospheric concentration is on the order of 10⁻¹⁹%, which is many millions of times lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Final Answer**\nComparing all the naturally occurring noble gases, Radon's extremely short half-life means its steady-state concentration is far lower than any other noble gas. While Xenon is the rarest stable noble gas, Radon is, by a very large margin, the rarest of all naturally occurring noble gases as a percentage of terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
