    "This problem asks for the next letter in the sequence `ZXXCVYBN_`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the letters in the sequence.**\nThe letters are Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N. Many of these letters (Z, X, C, V, B, N) are found together on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The bottom row reads: `Z X C V B N M`. This strong correlation suggests the pattern is based on the keyboard layout.\n\n**Step 2: Look for interleaved sequences.**\nComplex sequences are often composed of two or more simpler sequences interleaved together. Let's split the original sequence into two subsequences: one formed by the letters at odd positions and one by the letters at even positions.\n\n*   **Odd-position sequence (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th...):** Z, X, V, B, _\n*   **Even-position sequence (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th...):** X, C, Y, N\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the odd-position sequence.**\nThe sequence is `Z, X, V, B, _`. All of these letters are on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard. Let's assign a number to each key on that row, starting from the left:\n`Z=1`, `X=2`, `C=3`, `V=4`, `B=5`, `N=6`, `M=7`\n\nNow, let's look at the positions of the letters in our odd sequence:\n*   Z is at position 1.\n*   X is at position 2.\n*   V is at position 4.\n*   B is at position 5.\n\nThe sequence of positions is `1, 2, 4, 5`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pattern in the positions.**\nLet's find the difference between consecutive positions to see how the sequence progresses:\n*   From position 1 (Z) to position 2 (X) is a step of **+1**.\n*   From position 2 (X) to position 4 (V) is a step of **+2**.\n*   From position 4 (V) to position 5 (B) is a step of **+1**.\n\nThe pattern of steps is `+1, +2, +1, ...`.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next term.**\nThe logical continuation of the pattern `+1, +2, +1` is `+2`.\nWe apply this next step to the last position in our sequence, which is 5 (for letter B).\n`5 + 2 = 7`.\n\nThe letter at position 7 on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard is **M**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\nThe blank is in the 9th position of the original sequence, which corresponds to the 5th position of the odd-numbered subsequence. Based on the discovered pattern (`+1, +2, +1, +2, ...`) in keyboard positions, the next letter must be `M`. The even-numbered sequence (`X, C, Y, N`) does not have a simple, discernible pattern, which is common in such puzzles where it acts as a distractor. The clear and logical pattern in the odd sequence is sufficient to determine the answer.\n\nThe next letter in the sequence is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
