    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The specific stereochemistry (1S,2R) is a crucial piece of information.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$ or KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is a polar protic solvent that is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction**. The bulky nature of the base further favors elimination over substitution (SN2).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism is a concerted, one-step reaction. It has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (in this case, Br) and the β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the one bearing the leaving group) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane ring, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. The Br must be in an axial position, and the β-hydrogen being removed must also be in an axial position, on an adjacent carbon, and pointing in the opposite direction (one axial-up, one axial-down).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**\n1.  **Determine the relative stereochemistry:** The designation (1S, 2R) for adjacent carbons means the substituents (Br and CH3) are **trans** to each other.\n2.  **Draw the chair conformers:** A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist as two chair conformers in equilibrium: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   **Diequatorial Conformer:** This conformer has both the bromine and the methyl group in equatorial positions. Since both groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position, this is the **more stable** and predominant conformer at equilibrium.\n    *   **Diaxial Conformer:** This conformer has both the bromine and the methyl group in axial positions. This is the **less stable** conformer due to steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions).\n3.  **Identify the reactive conformer:** The E2 reaction requires the bromine to be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction **must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformer**. Although its concentration is low, the equilibrium between the two conformers (the ring flip) is rapid, allowing the reaction to occur.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Elimination from the Diaxial Conformer**\nLet's visualize the reactive diaxial conformer of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The Br and CH3 groups are trans and axial. This means one is axial-up and the other is axial-down.\n*   Let's place the Br atom on C1 in an **axial-up** position.\n*   Because the CH3 group on C2 is trans, it must be in the **axial-down** position.\n*   The leaving group is the axial-up Br on C1. For E2 to occur, the base must remove a β-hydrogen that is **axial-down**.\n*   There are two β-carbons: C2 and C6.\n\n*   **β-hydrogen on C2:** The methyl group is in the axial-down position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial-up** position. This hydrogen is *not* in a trans-diaxial orientation relative to the bromine. Therefore, **elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is impossible.** (This would have formed 1-methylcyclohexene, the more substituted Zaitsev product).\n\n*   **β-hydrogen on C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is **axial-down** and the other is equatorial-up. The **axial-down hydrogen on C6 is perfectly anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) to the axial-up bromine on C1.**\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Product**\nSince the stereochemical requirement for the E2 reaction can only be met by removing the axial hydrogen from C6, the reaction is regiospecific. The bulky base (KOtBu) will abstract the axial proton on C6, and the double bond will form exclusively between C1 and C6.\n\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group on the carbon that was originally C2.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2), and then give the substituent the lowest possible number. The double bond is between original C1 and C6. If we number C6 as C1' and C1 as C2', the methyl group is on C3'.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
