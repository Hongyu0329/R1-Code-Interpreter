    "An analysis of the question to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n\n**Given Polynomial Matrices:**\n$P1 = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$P2 = \\begin{bmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix $G(s)$ is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** of two polynomial matrices $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ if:\n1.  $G(s)$ is a **common right divisor** of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$. This means there exist polynomial matrices $Q_1(s)$ and $Q_2(s)$ such that:\n    $P_1(s) = Q_1(s)G(s)$\n    $P_2(s) = Q_2(s)G(s)$\n2.  For any other common right divisor $D(s)$, $D(s)$ is also a right divisor of $G(s)$. This means there exists a polynomial matrix $L(s)$ such that $G(s) = L(s)D(s)$.\n\nA GCRD is unique up to a left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nThe most common method for finding the GCRD is using the **Euclidean algorithm** for polynomial matrices. This algorithm involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by the two given matrices.\nThe procedure is:\n1.  Form the stacked matrix $M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n2.  Use elementary row operations to reduce $M(s)$ to an upper triangular form (or more specifically, a row-reduced form), $\\begin{bmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n3.  The non-zero block, $G(s)$, is a GCRD of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Form the stacked matrix M(s):**\n    $M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    Let's denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations to simplify the matrix.** The goal is to introduce zeros by using rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials. The entry at R4, column 2 is 1, which makes it an excellent pivot.\n\n    *   **Use R4 to eliminate entries in the second column:**\n        *   `R1_new = R1 + s*R4`\n            `[s^2+s, -s] + s*[-s-1, 1] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, -s+s] = [0, 0]`\n        *   `R2_new = R2 - s^2*R4`\n            `[-s^2-1, s^2] - s^2*[-s-1, 1] = [-s^2-1 - (-s^3-s^2), s^2-s^2] = [s^3-1, 0]`\n\n    *   **The matrix now becomes:**\n        $M'(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ s^3-1 & 0 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n        The new rows are R1', R2', R3, R4.\n\n3.  **Simplify further using the rows with only one non-zero column.** We have R2' = `[s^3-1, 0]` and R3 = `[s, 0]`. We can use the Euclidean algorithm on the polynomials `s^3-1` and `s`.\n    *   `gcd(s^3-1, s) = gcd(s^3-1 - s^2*(s), s) = gcd(-1, s) = 1`.\n    *   This corresponds to the row operation: `R2'_new = R2' - s^2*R3`\n        `[s^3-1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [s^3-1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n\n    *   **The matrix becomes:**\n        $M''(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Normalize the row `[-1, 0]` and use it to eliminate other entries.**\n    *   Let's create a new row `R_pivot = -1 * [-1, 0] = [1, 0]`.\n    *   The set of non-zero rows we are working with is now `{[1, 0], [s, 0], [-s-1, 1]}`.\n    *   Use `R_pivot` to eliminate the other entries in the first column:\n        *   `R3_new = R3 - s*R_pivot = [s, 0] - s*[1, 0] = [0, 0]`\n        *   `R4_new = R4 - (-s-1)*R_pivot = R4 + (s+1)*R_pivot`\n            `[-s-1, 1] + (s+1)*[1, 0] = [-s-1+s+1, 1+0] = [0, 1]`\n\n5.  **Final set of non-zero rows.**\n    After all the operations, the independent non-zero rows we have generated are `[1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. All other rows have become `[0, 0]`.\n\n6.  **Form the GCRD matrix.**\n    Arranging the resulting non-zero rows gives the GCRD:\n    $G(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = I$\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n\n*   The GCRD is the identity matrix, $I$. A GCRD that is a unimodular matrix (like $I$, since $det(I)=1$) signifies that the original matrices $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ are **right coprime**.\n*   **Verification**: We can verify this result using another criterion. Two matrices are right coprime if and only if the rank of the stacked matrix $M(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{bmatrix}$ is equal to the number of columns (which is 2) for all complex values of $s$.\n    *   The determinants of the 2x2 submatrices of $M(s)$ are: $s^2$, $-s^3$, $s$, $s(s^3-1)$, $s^3-1$, and 0.\n    *   There is no complex number $s$ for which all these determinants are simultaneously zero. For instance, if $s=0$, the determinant $s^3-1$ becomes -1. If $s$ is a root of $s^3-1=0$, then $s \\neq 0$, and determinants like $s^2$ and $s$ are non-zero.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of $M(s)$ is always 2. This confirms that $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ are right coprime and their GCRD is a unimodular matrix. The identity matrix $I$ is the simplest and most standard representation of this GCRD.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
