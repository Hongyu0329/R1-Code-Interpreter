    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: The term \"Second Great War\" is not an official designation from Blizzard Entertainment but is a widely used fan term. It typically refers to the continuous, galaxy-spanning conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). This distinguishes it from the first \"Great War\" (the original *StarCraft* campaign) and the subsequent \"Brood War\" (the *StarCraft: Brood War* expansion).\n\n2.  **Establish the Starting Point**: The conflict that comprises the Second Great War begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. The war kicks off with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector and the escalation of Raynor's Raiders' rebellion against the Terran Dominion. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, these events begin in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Establish the Ending Point**: The war concludes with the final defeat of its primary architect and ultimate antagonist, the dark god Amon. This climactic event, which unites all three races, occurs during the epilogue of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\". This final battle takes place in late **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Duration**: The war's events span from a point in the year 2504 to a point late in the year 2506.\n    *   The timespan covers the entirety of the year 2505.\n    *   It also covers significant portions of the years 2504 and 2506.\n    *   This means the total elapsed time is more than two full years but less than three full years (mathematically, a duration of 2.xx years).\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question explicitly asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the calculated duration is a value greater than 2, rounding it up to the nearest whole year results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of the Term**: The main challenge is the unofficial nature of the term \"Second Great War\". Some might argue it starts with the Brood War in 2500. However, the four-year \"cold war\" period from late 2500 to 2504 makes this a less cohesive definition of a single \"war\". The interpretation focusing on the *StarCraft II* trilogy storyline is more common and represents a more continuous period of open, large-scale conflict.\n*   **Exact Dates vs. Years**: Pinpointing exact in-universe dates (e.g., month and day) is difficult and often unnecessary. The lore primarily provides years for major events. By calculating the duration across the given years (2504, 2505, 2506) and using the \"round up\" instruction, we can arrive at a definitive answer without needing precise dates.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" Instruction**: This is a key instruction. A duration of, for example, 2 years and 3 months, when rounded *up*, becomes 3 years. This method correctly accounts for the conflict spanning across three calendar years.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is calculated.\n\n<<<3>>>"
