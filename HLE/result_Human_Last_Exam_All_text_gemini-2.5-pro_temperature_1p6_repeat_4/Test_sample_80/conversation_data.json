    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe objective is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard under the condition that no bishop can attack another. We then need to find out how many edge squares are left empty.\n\n**Careful Point:** A bishop attacks any other piece on the same diagonal. This means no two bishops can be placed on the same diagonal line.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nThe edge squares are all the squares in the first and last rows, and the first and last columns.\n*   An 8x8 board has 8 squares per side.\n*   A naive count would be 8 (top row) + 8 (bottom row) + 8 (left column) + 8 (right column) = 32.\n*   However, this double-counts the 4 corner squares.\n*   The correct count is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 edge squares.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to count the total number of available squares correctly.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Bishop's Color-Bound Nature**\nA crucial property of bishops is that they always stay on squares of the same color they start on. A bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other pieces on black squares.\n*   This allows us to solve the problem in two independent parts: one for white squares and one for black squares.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the White Edge Squares**\n*   **Count:** First, we count the number of white squares on the edge. The edges consist of 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n*   **Identify Diagonals:** The key is to realize that if two edge squares lie on the same diagonal, we can only place one bishop between them. We need to group the 14 white edge squares by the diagonals they occupy.\n    *   The diagonal from a8 to h1 contains two white edge squares: **a8** and **h1**.\n    *   The diagonal from c8 to h3 contains two white edge squares: **c8** and **h3**.\n    *   The diagonal from e8 to h5 contains two white edge squares: **e8** and **h5**.\n    *   The diagonal from g8 to h7 contains two white edge squares: **g8** and **h7**.\n    *   The diagonal from a6 to f1 contains two white edge squares: **a6** and **f1**.\n    *   The diagonal from a4 to d1 contains two white edge squares: **a4** and **d1**.\n    *   The diagonal from a2 to b1 contains two white edge squares: **a2** and **b1**.\n*   **Maximize Bishops:** We have identified 7 distinct diagonals that contain all 14 white edge squares. Since we can only place one bishop per diagonal, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on white edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Every white edge square is part of exactly one of these pairs. There are no lone white edge squares on a unique diagonal.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Black Edge Squares**\n*   **Count:** There are also 14 black squares on the edge.\n*   **Identify Diagonals:** We perform the same grouping for the 14 black edge squares.\n    *   The diagonal from a1 to h8 contains two black edge squares: **a1** and **h8**.\n    *   The diagonal from a3 to c1 contains two black edge squares: **a3** and **c1**.\n    *   The diagonal from a5 to e1 contains two black edge squares: **a5** and **e1**.\n    *   The diagonal from a7 to g1 contains two black edge squares: **a7** and **g1**.\n    *   The diagonal from b8 to h2 contains two black edge squares: **b8** and **h2**.\n    *   The diagonal from d8 to h4 contains two black edge squares: **d8** and **h4**.\n    *   The diagonal from f8 to h6 contains two black edge squares: **f8** and **h6**.\n*   **Maximize Bishops:** Similar to the white squares, we have 7 distinct diagonals covering all 14 black edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on black edge squares is also **7**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops**\nSince bishops on white squares cannot attack bishops on black squares, we can simply add the maximums from each color set.\n*   Total Maximum Bishops = (Max on White Squares) + (Max on Black Squares)\n*   Total Maximum Bishops = 7 + 7 = **14**\n\n**Step 7: Determine the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops when the maximum number have been placed.\n*   Total Edge Squares = 28\n*   Maximum Bishops Placed = 14\n*   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = Total Edge Squares - Maximum Bishops Placed\n*   Edge Squares Lacking Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14\n\n<<<14>>>"
