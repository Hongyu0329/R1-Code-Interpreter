    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral**\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is of the form `f'(x) / f(x)`. This is a standard form whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`.\nIn this case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1`\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the function F₃(x) to handle the absolute value**\n\nWe need to determine if `F₃(x)` is positive or negative on the interval `[0, 1]`. Let's trace the values:\n*   For `x` in `[0, 1]`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x` is in `[0, 1]`.\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`. Since `x` is in radians, the interval is `[0, 1]` radians (approx. `[0, 57.3°]`). In this interval, `sin(x)` is non-negative, so `F₁(x)` is in `[sin(0), sin(1)] = [0, sin(1)]`.\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`. Since `F₁(x)` is in `[0, sin(1)]`, `F₂(x)` is in `[e⁰, e^(sin(1))] = [1, e^(sin(1))]`.\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`. Since `F₂(x)` is always greater than or equal to 1, `1 + F₂(x)` is always greater than or equal to 2. The natural logarithm `ln(y)` is positive for `y > 1`.\nTherefore, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`. We can safely remove the absolute value bars.\nThe integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\n\nWe calculate the value of the function at the lower limit `x = 0`:\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\n\nWe calculate the value of the function at the upper limit `x = 1`:\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)` (Note: `1` is in radians)\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the values to find V**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the formula for `V`:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 7: Perform the numerical calculation**\n\nNow we find the numerical value of V.\n*   `sin(1)` (in radians) ≈ `0.84147`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31977`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31977 = 3.31977`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.20097` (This is the value of `F₃(1)`)\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315` (This is the value of `F₃(0)`)\n\nNow we calculate V:\n*   `V = ln( [F₃(1)] / [F₃(0)] )`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.20097 / 0.69315)`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.73264)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.54965`\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54965 = 5496.5`\nRounding `5496.5` to the nearest integer gives `5497`.\n\n<<<5497>>>"
