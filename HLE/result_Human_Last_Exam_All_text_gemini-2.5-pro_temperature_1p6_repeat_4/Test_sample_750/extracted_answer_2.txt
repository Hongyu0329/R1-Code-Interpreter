The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and the purely imaginary solutions $z=iy$ where $y$ are the solutions to $|y|e^{y(\pi/2+2k\pi)}=(-1)^{k+1}$ for integers $k$ such that a real solution for $y$ exists. Explicitly, using the Lambert W function, the imaginary solutions are $z = i \frac{W_0(\pi(4m - 3/2))}{\pi(4m - 3/2)}$ for integers $m \ge 1$ and $z = -i \frac{W_0(\pi(4j - 1/2))}{\pi(4j - 1/2)}$ for integers $j \ge 1$.
