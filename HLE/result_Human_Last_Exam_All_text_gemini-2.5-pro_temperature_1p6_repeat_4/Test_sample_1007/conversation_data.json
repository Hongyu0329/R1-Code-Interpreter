    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it began.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks to identify the ballet step where the ending leg position is identical to the starting leg position. This means if a dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front, they must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n1.  **Analyze A: Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump where the legs beat six times (three openings and three closings). For an even-numbered *entrechat* starting from fifth position (like *quatre*, *six*, *huit*), an odd number of beats changes the feet, while an even number of beats returns them to the original position. *Entrechat six* has three beats.\n        1. Open from fifth.\n        2. Beat back leg in front of front leg.\n        3. Open.\n        4. Beat original front leg behind original back leg.\n        5. Open.\n        6. Land in fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because of the odd number of beats (three), the feet are swapped. If you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n2.  **Analyze B: Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   *Échappé*: A jump \"escaping\" from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and back to closed.\n        *   *Battu*: \"Beaten,\" meaning the legs beat together as they close.\n        *   *Changé*: \"Changed,\" which is the key term here. It explicitly states that the feet must change position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot in front, you will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position, as specified by the name of the step.\n\n3.  **Analyze C: Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** The name means \"to assemble.\" One foot brushes out (to the side, front, or back), the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) which do change the feet. However, a basic *assemblé côté* (to the side) does not. For example, if you start with the right foot in front, you can brush the right foot to the side, jump, and land with the right foot back in front. This is a fundamental and common execution of the step.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its basic form, the step finishes in the exact same fifth position it started from.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step *can* end in the same position it started in. Compared to the other options, which *must* change position by definition, this is the most likely correct answer.\n\n4.  **Analyze D: Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" It's a linking step. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" For a *glissade derrière*, the back foot (the left foot in our example) glides out to the side, the weight is transferred, and the original front foot (the right foot) closes *behind* it in fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The feet have switched places. The right foot, which was in front, is now in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n5.  **Analyze E: Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a *pas de chat*, but with a double *rond de jambe* from the leading leg in the air. The fundamental movement involves jumping from one foot to the other, which almost always results in a change of feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer starts with the right foot front, jumps, and lands with the right foot finishing in the back.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the *Assemblé* is the only step that, in its common and basic form (*assemblé côté*), ends with the feet in the identical position from which they started. The other steps listed have a change of feet built into their definition (*changé*, *six*, *derrière*) or core mechanics (*gargouillade*).\n\n<<<C>>>"
