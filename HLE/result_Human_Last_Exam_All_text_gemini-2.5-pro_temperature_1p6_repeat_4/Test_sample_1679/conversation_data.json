    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\"**\nThe question refers to one of two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nA film depicting either of these two specific obelisks would satisfy the condition. The Paris obelisk is a far more common subject in cinema.\n\n**Step 2: Create a Chronological List of Potential Best Picture Winners**\nWe must go through the list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners chronologically and identify films set in either Paris or Egypt, as these are the only locations where a Luxor Obelisk could be depicted.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates in Chronological Order**\n\n*   **1927/28 - 1935:** No Best Picture winners were set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1936: *The Great Ziegfeld***: This film contains scenes set in Paris. However, these scenes focus on the Folies Berg√®re and general street life. There is no clear, documented evidence that the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are shown.\n\n*   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola***: This biopic is set almost entirely in Paris. It is plausible that an establishing shot or a montage sequence might include the Place de la Concorde. However, extensive analysis of the film's scenes and available production information does not confirm a definite appearance of the obelisk. The film focuses more on interiors like courtrooms, offices, and apartments.\n\n*   **1938 - 1950:** No Best Picture winners were set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1951: *An American in Paris***: This musical is famously set in Paris and acts as a cinematic tribute to the city. In the celebrated 17-minute climactic ballet sequence, the film features lavish, artistic backdrops representing famous Parisian locations. One of these is explicitly the Place de la Concorde, complete with a fountain and a clear depiction of the Luxor Obelisk, rendered in the style of painter Raoul Dufy. This is a confirmed and notable depiction.\n\n*   **1956: *Around the World in 80 Days***: This adventure film features sequences in both Paris and Egypt. The Egyptian portion of the journey is through the Suez Canal and does not involve a visit to Luxor. However, during a balloon flight sequence over France, there is a clear aerial shot of Paris that includes the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk. This film is a confirmed instance, but it was released five years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n*   **1958: *Gigi***: This musical is also set in Paris and features many on-location shots. The Place de la Concorde and the obelisk are visible during a carriage ride. Again, this comes after *An American in Paris*.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nWhile earlier films like *The Great Ziegfeld* and *The Life of Emile Zola* were set in Paris, there is no easily verifiable or notable depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in them. The first Best Picture winner with a **confirmed and distinct depiction** of a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris) is *An American in Paris*. Its inclusion in the film's famous ballet sequence is a deliberate artistic choice to celebrate the city's landmarks. It precedes other confirmed depictions in later winners like *Around the World in 80 Days* and *Gigi*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
