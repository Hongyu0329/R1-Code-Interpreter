    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifiable clues.**\nThe question asks for a specific physicist and provides several distinct pieces of information to identify them:\n*   **Field of Work:** The physicist is primarily known for contributions to microscopy.\n*   **Discovery:** They discovered an optical effect.\n*   **Image Type:** The effect was observed in real imagery.\n*   **Origin Story:** The discovery was sparked by an accidental observation.\n*   **The Observer:** The observation was made by a non-scientist, specifically a custodial worker.\n*   **The Object:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors at the time of the observation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the clues to narrow down the possibilities.**\n*   The clue \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" points to a limited number of prominent figures, such as Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), Frits Zernike (phase contrast microscopy), or Georges Nomarski (differential interference contrast microscopy).\n*   The most specific and unusual clue is the anecdote about the custodial worker and the concave mirrors. This kind of detailed story is often associated with only one specific discovery.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the anecdote to a specific physicist and their discovery.**\n*   We can search for discovery stories related to major microscopy techniques. The anecdote perfectly matches the story behind the invention of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.\n*   The physicist associated with this discovery is the Polish-French physicist **Georges Nomarski**.\n*   The story goes that a cleaning lady was dusting a large, high-quality concave mirror for a telescope. As she wiped the surface, she noticed that the dust particles and streaks from her cloth stood out in sharp, three-dimensional-looking relief. This observation was relayed to Nomarski.\n\n**Step 4: Verify how all clues fit the identified physicist.**\n*   **Physicist known for microscopy:** Georges Nomarski is famous for developing the Nomarski prism, which is the key component in Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, a technique often called \"Nomarski microscopy.\" This fits perfectly.\n*   **Discovered an optical effect:** DIC is an optical technique that translates gradients in the optical path length of a specimen into intensity differences, creating a pseudo-3D relief image. This is the optical effect.\n*   **Observed in real imagery with concave mirrors:** The initial observation was on a concave mirror, which can form a real image. The effect made tiny surface imperfections (dust, smudges) that cause slight variations in light path length visible.\n*   **Accidental observation by a custodial worker:** This matches the anecdote exactly. The observation was not the result of a planned experiment but an accident noted by a non-scientist performing a routine task.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBy synthesizing all the given points, it is clear that the question is referring to Georges Nomarski and the inspiration for his invention of Differential Interference Contrast microscopy.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
