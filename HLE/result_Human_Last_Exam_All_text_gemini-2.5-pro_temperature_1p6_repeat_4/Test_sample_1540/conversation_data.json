    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the described problem and calculate its memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem requires a lexicographical comparison of two input strings of the same length. The key constraint is that the comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning an uppercase letter and its corresponding lowercase letter are considered equal. The program must output -1, 1, or 0 based on whether the first string is less than, greater than, or equal to the second string, respectively. The primary goal is to minimize the memory used by variables in the C program.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: The central requirement is to minimize memory usage. This guides all choices, from data structures to variable types.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: To compare characters regardless of case, they must be converted to a common form (either all uppercase or all lowercase) before comparison. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n3.  **Input Processing**: The two strings are on separate lines. A naive solution might be to store both strings in two separate character arrays. For example, `char s1[101], s2[101];` would consume 202 bytes just for the buffers. To be more memory-efficient, we must find a way to avoid storing the second string entirely.\n4.  **Optimal Storage Strategy**: A more efficient approach is to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time. As each character of the second string is read, it can be immediately compared with the corresponding character from the already-stored first string. This eliminates the need for a second buffer.\n5.  **Choosing Variable Types**: To further save memory, variables should be declared with the smallest possible data type that can accommodate their range of values. For example, a loop counter that goes from 0 to 100 can be a `char` (1 byte) instead of an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**1. Algorithm Design**\n\nBased on the careful points, the most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Declare a character array (buffer) `s1` of size 101 to store the first string (max 100 characters + 1 null terminator `\\0`).\n2.  Read the first input string into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1)`.\n3.  Declare a loop counter variable, `i`, to iterate through `s1`. A `char` type is sufficient.\n4.  Loop from `i = 0` while `s1[i]` is not the null terminator.\n5.  Inside the loop:\n    a. Read a single character, `c2`, from the standard input. To correctly read from the second line, we use `scanf(\" %c\", &c2)`. The space in the format string ` \" %c\"` is crucial as it consumes any leading whitespace, including the newline character left behind by the first `scanf`.\n    b. Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)` directly, without storing the results in intermediate variables.\n    c. If they differ, print \"-1\" or \"1\" accordingly and terminate the program.\n    d. Increment the loop counter `i`.\n6.  If the loop finishes without any character difference, it means the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n**2. C Program Variable Declaration**\n\nThis algorithm requires the following variables in the `main` function:\n1.  `char s1[101];`: A buffer to store the first string.\n2.  `char i;`: A loop counter. A `char` can hold values up to 127 (signed) or 255 (unsigned), which is sufficient for the maximum string length of 100.\n3.  `char c2;`: A variable to hold a single character read from the second string.\n\n**3. Memory Calculation**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory consumed by these variables. In C, memory sizes are determined by the `sizeof` operator.\n\n1.  **Memory for `s1`**: `s1` is an array of 101 characters. The size of a `char` is guaranteed by the C standard to be 1 byte.\n    *   `sizeof(s1)` = 101 elements * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Memory for `i`**: `i` is declared as a `char`.\n    *   `sizeof(i)` = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Memory for `c2`**: `c2` is declared as a `char`.\n    *   `sizeof(c2)` = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1\nm = 103 bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated on the stack for the variables required to solve the problem in the most memory-efficient way.\n\n<<<103>>>"
