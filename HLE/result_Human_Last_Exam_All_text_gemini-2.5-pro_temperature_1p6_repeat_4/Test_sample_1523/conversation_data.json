    "This problem requires an understanding of the path integral formalism of quantum field theory, specifically in the context of thermal equilibrium (finite temperature). We will analyze the components of the question to construct the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Context: Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\nIn finite-temperature field theory, the system is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$. The canonical partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$ is calculated using a functional integral (or path integral). This is achieved through the imaginary time (or Matsubara) formalism, where real time $t$ is analytically continued to imaginary time $\\tau = it$. The domain of $\\tau$ is compactified to a circle, $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$, where $\\beta = 1/T$ (in natural units where $k_B = 1$). For a bosonic field, such as a neutral scalar field $\\phi$, this implies periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0) = \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta)$.\n\nThe partition function is then expressed as:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\nwhere $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action.\n\n**Step 2: The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field**\n\nThe standard Lagrangian density for a neutral scalar field is $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 - V(\\phi)$. After a Wick rotation to Euclidean spacetime ($t \\to -i\\tau$, $x^0 \\to x_4 = \\tau$), the Euclidean action becomes:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\nwith the Euclidean Lagrangian density:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$\nwhere $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. The action is usually separated into a free part (quadratic in $\\phi$) and an interaction part $V(\\phi)$. The question concerns the quadratic part, which defines the operator $D$.\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Inner Product and the Operator $D$**\n\nIn this context, the notation $(\\phi, \\psi)$ refers to an inner product on the space of field configurations, defined by an integral over the Euclidean spacetime:\n$(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi_1(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\phi_2(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\nThe free part of the action, which is quadratic in the fields, can be written in a compact form as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. The object $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, or more standardly written as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, is this quadratic form. To find the explicit form of the operator $D$, we must manipulate the free action.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Operator $D$**\n\nLet's focus on the free Euclidean action, $S_{E, \\text{free}}$:\n$S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nWe use integration by parts on the derivative terms.\n1.  For the time derivative:\n    $\\int_0^\\beta (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 d\\tau = [\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) d\\tau$.\n    The boundary term $[\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)]_0^\\beta$ vanishes because the field $\\phi$ (and its derivative) is periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$.\n2.  For the spatial derivatives:\n    $\\int (\\nabla\\phi)^2 d^d x = - \\int \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi) d^d x$.\n    Here, we assume that the fields vanish sufficiently fast at spatial infinity, so the surface term from integration by parts is zero.\n\nSubstituting these back into the action gives:\n$S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ -\\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) - \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi) + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\nWe can factor out the field $\\phi$ to write this as:\n$S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\left[-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right] \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the Inner Product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$**\n\nBy comparing the expression above with the general form $S_{E, \\text{free}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, we can make the following identifications:\n*   The operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n*   The inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ is the quantity being integrated:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\left[-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right] \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\nThis expression is precisely twice the free part of the Euclidean action, i.e., $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Imaginary Time:** The use of imaginary time $\\tau$ and the integration range $[0, \\beta]$ is the hallmark of the Matsubara formalism for finite temperature.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The periodic boundary conditions for the bosonic field $\\phi$ in the $\\tau$ direction are essential for the integration by parts to work without leaving boundary terms.\n3.  **Operator:** The operator $D = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$ (where $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$) is the inverse of the free Euclidean propagator.\n4.  **Meaning:** The inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ is the quadratic term in the exponent of the functional integral. It governs the Gaussian fluctuations of the free field and forms the basis for perturbation theory.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the integral of the field $\\phi$ against the field acted upon by the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$. This corresponds to twice the free Euclidean action. The full mathematical expression is the most direct answer to the question.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:\n$$ (\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x,\\tau) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(x,\\tau) $$\nwhere $\\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $x$ represents the spatial coordinates, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and the operator $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This term is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$.>>>"
