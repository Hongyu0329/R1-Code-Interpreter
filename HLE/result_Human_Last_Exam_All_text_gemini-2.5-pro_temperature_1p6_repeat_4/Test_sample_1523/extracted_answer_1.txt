The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:
$$ (\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \phi(x,\tau) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(x,\tau) $$
where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, $x$ represents the spatial coordinates, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and the operator $D = -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This term is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \text{free}}[\phi]$.
