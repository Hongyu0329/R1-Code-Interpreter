    "An analysis of the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n**1. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand the definitions.**\n    *   **Graph $K_{n,m}$**: The complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$ has a vertex set $V$ that can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, $A$ and $B$, each of size 1000. An edge exists between every vertex in $A$ and every vertex in $B$. There are no edges within $A$ or within $B$. The total number of vertices is 2000.\n    *   **Degree of vertices**: Every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ is connected to all 1000 vertices in the other partition set. Thus, every vertex has a degree of 1000. This means $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph. The maximum degree is $\\Delta(G)=1000$ and the minimum degree is $\\delta(G)=1000$.\n    *   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that:\n        1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ in this orientation, denoted $d_D^+(v)$, satisfies $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n        2.  The coefficient of the monomial $\\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{d_D^+(v)}$ in the graph polynomial $P_D(\\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E(D)} (x_u - x_v)$ is non-zero.\n\n*   **Step 2: Establish an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$.**\n    *   We need to find an orientation $D$ that satisfies the non-zero coefficient condition and then use its maximum out-degree to find an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number.\n    *   Let's choose a simple orientation for $K_{1000,1000}$. Let the partitions be $A = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{1000}\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, \\dots, b_{1000}\\}$. We define an orientation $D_{AB}$ where every edge is directed from a vertex in $A$ to a vertex in $B$.\n    *   Let's analyze the out-degrees for this orientation $D_{AB}$:\n        *   For any vertex $a \\in A$, all 1000 of its incident edges are directed away from it. So, $d_{D_{AB}}^+(a) = 1000$.\n        *   For any vertex $b \\in B$, all 1000 of its incident edges are directed towards it. So, $d_{D_{AB}}^+(b) = 0$.\n    *   The maximum out-degree in this orientation is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D_{AB}}^+(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Now, we check the coefficient condition. The graph polynomial is $P_{D_{AB}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{1000} \\prod_{j=1}^{1000} (x_{a_i} - x_{b_j})$. The monomial is $M = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{1000} x_{a_i}^{1000}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^{1000} x_{b_j}^{0}\\right)$.\n    *   To find the coefficient of $M$, we can expand the polynomial.\n        $P_{D_{AB}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{1000} \\left( \\prod_{j=1}^{1000} (x_{a_i} - x_{b_j}) \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{1000} \\left( x_{a_i}^{1000} - e_1(\\mathbf{x}_B)x_{a_i}^{999} + \\dots \\right)$\n        where $e_k(\\mathbf{x}_B)$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials in variables $\\{x_{b_1}, \\dots, x_{b_{1000}}\\}$.\n        To get the term $\\prod x_{a_i}^{1000}$, we must pick the $x_{a_i}^{1000}$ term from each factor in the outer product over $i$. The coefficient of $x_{a_i}^{1000}$ inside the parentheses is 1. Thus, the coefficient of $\\prod x_{a_i}^{1000}$ in the full expansion is $1 \\times 1 \\times \\dots \\times 1 = 1$. Since this term does not involve any $x_{b_j}$ variables, it is the coefficient of $M = \\prod x_{a_i}^{1000} \\prod x_{b_j}^{0}$.\n    *   The coefficient is 1, which is non-zero.\n    *   So, we have an orientation $D_{AB}$ where $\\max d^+(v) = 1000$ and the coefficient condition is met. By the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number $k$, we must have $d^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v$. This implies $\\max d^+(v) \\le k-1$, so $1000 \\le k-1$, which means $k \\ge 1001$. Since such a $k$ exists, $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$. This establishes the upper bound.\n\n*   **Step 3: Establish a lower bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$.**\n    *   We use a known theorem regarding the Alon-Tarsi number of bipartite graphs. A result by H. Kaul (2007) states that for any non-empty bipartite graph $G$, the Alon-Tarsi number is bounded below by its minimum degree: $AT(G) \\ge \\delta(G) + 1$.\n    *   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a bipartite graph. It is also non-empty.\n    *   As established in Step 1, $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, so its minimum degree is $\\delta(G) = 1000$.\n    *   Applying Kaul's theorem, we get:\n        $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge \\delta(K_{1000,1000}) + 1 = 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n    *   This establishes the lower bound.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\n    *   From Step 2, we have the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$.\n    *   From Step 3, we have the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1001$.\n    *   Combining these two inequalities, we must have an equality.\n    *   Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is exactly 1001.\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n1.  **Correct Definition**: Ensure the correct definition of the Alon-Tarsi number is used, particularly the strict inequality $d_D^+(v) < k$ which implies $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n2.  **Graph Properties**: Correctly identify that $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, meaning both its minimum and maximum degrees are 1000.\n3.  **Upper Bound Construction**: The choice of orientation is crucial. The simple unidirectional orientation (all edges from one partition to the other) is a good candidate to test.\n4.  **Coefficient Calculation**: Verifying that the relevant coefficient in the graph polynomial is non-zero is a critical step for the upper bound. A simple expansion argument suffices here.\n5.  **Lower Bound Theorem**: The lower bound relies on a non-trivial theorem from the literature ($AT(G) \\ge \\delta(G) + 1$ for bipartite $G$). It's important to ensure the theorem is stated correctly and its conditions apply to our graph ($K_{1000,1000}$ is indeed a non-empty bipartite graph).\n6.  **Combining Bounds**: Once both a lower and an upper bound are found and they match, the final result is determined.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition: The step-by-step analysis logically derives that the Alon-Tarsi number is squeezed between 1001 and 1001.\n\nFinal Answer is 1001.\n\n<<<1001>>>"
