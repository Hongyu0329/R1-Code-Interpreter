    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Premise:** The problem presents a riddle in the form of a haiku with a title. We are explicitly told that the title itself is the question we need to answer.\n2.  **Analyzing the Title/Question:** The title is \"The Bays\". Interpreted as a question, this is likely a play on words, a homophone for \"The B's?\". The question is, therefore, \"What are the B's?\". This suggests the answer will be a set of words that start with the letter 'B'. Since a haiku has three lines, it's reasonable to assume we are looking for three \"B\" words, one derived from each line.\n3.  **Analyzing the First Line:** \"An August tempest\".\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   The word \"August\" can mean the eighth month, but it also means respected, majestic, and imposing. An \"august tempest\" is therefore a great or imposing storm.\n    *   Such a destructive and distressing event can be described by a \"B\" word: **BANE**. A bane is a cause of great distress or annoyance.\n4.  **Analyzing the Second Line:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\".\n    *   The math is straightforward: Twice fifteen is 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   We need to find a \"B\" word associated with the number 30 that \"brings winds of change\".\n    *   The most famous historical or religious reference to the number 30 causing a massive change is the \"30 pieces of silver\" paid to Judas Iscariot to betray Jesus. This payment was a **BRIBE**.\n5.  **Analyzing the Third Line:** \"A divine one yields\".\n    *   This line describes something being given or produced (\"yields\") by a divine being (\"a divine one\").\n    *   A gift, favor, or blessing from a divine source is perfectly described by the \"B\" word: **BOON**. A boon is a thing that is helpful or beneficial.\n6.  **Synthesizing the Answer:** We have found three \"B\" words, one for each line of the haiku: BANE, BRIBE, and BOON.\n7.  **Final Instruction:** The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n    *   We take our three words: BANE, BRIBE, BOON.\n    *   We sort them alphabetically: BANE, BOON, BRIBE.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Title is a Homophone:** The key to the entire riddle is recognizing that \"The Bays\" is not meant literally but is a pun on \"The B's\".\n*   **Multiple Meanings:** The word \"August\" is used for its adjectival meaning (\"majestic\") rather than as the month.\n*   **Cultural/Historical References:** The clue in the second line relies on knowledge of the biblical story of Judas's betrayal for 30 pieces of silver.\n*   **One Clue Per Line:** The structure of the haiku (three distinct lines) strongly hints at a three-part answer.\n*   **Follow All Instructions:** The final step of alphabetizing the resulting words is crucial to getting the correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis yields three words that answer the question \"The B's?\":\n*   From \"An August tempest\" we get **BANE**.\n*   From \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" we get **BRIBE**.\n*   From \"A divine one yields\" we get **BOON**.\n\nArranging these in alphabetical order gives us BANE, BOON, BRIBE.\n\n<<<BANE, BOON, BRIBE>>>"
