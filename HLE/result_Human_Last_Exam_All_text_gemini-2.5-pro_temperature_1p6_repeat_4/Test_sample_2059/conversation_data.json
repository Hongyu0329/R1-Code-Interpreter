    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the polynomial.**\n    Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\n    $$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$$\n    We want to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n2.  **Recognize the relationship between $\\sum_k a_k^2$ and the polynomial.**\n    The sum $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n    Let $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. Then $P(x^{-1}) = \\sum_j a_j x^{-j}$.\n    The product is $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = (\\sum_k a_k x^k)(\\sum_j a_j x^{-j}) = \\sum_{k,j} a_k a_j x^{k-j}$.\n    The constant term is the sum of terms where the exponent is zero, which happens when $k=j$. So the constant term is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the factors of the polynomial.**\n    Each factor in the product $P(x)$ can be simplified. Let $y = x^{3^i}$. The factor is $1+y+y^2+y^3$.\n    This is a simple sum which can be factored:\n    $1+y+y^2+y^3 = (1+y) + y^2(1+y) = (1+y)(1+y^2)$.\n    Substituting $y = x^{3^i}$ back, the factor is $(1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$.\n\n4.  **Rewrite the polynomial P(x) using the simplified factors.**\n    $$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$$\n    We can split this into two products:\n    $$P(x) = \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$$\n\n5.  **Analyze the structure of the two product terms.**\n    Let's define $A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$.\n    When we expand $A(x)$, each term is of the form $x^k$, where the exponent $k$ is a sum of distinct powers of 3 (of the form $c_{i_1} 3^{i_1} + c_{i_2} 3^{i_2} + \\dots$). This is equivalent to saying that $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} \\epsilon_i 3^i$ where each $\\epsilon_i$ is either 0 or 1.\n    This is the standard base-3 representation of the integer $k$. For any given $k$, its base-3 representation is unique. Therefore, if the base-3 representation of $k$ consists only of digits 0 and 1, the coefficient of $x^k$ in $A(x)$ is 1. Otherwise, it is 0. Let's call the set of these exponents $S_b$.\n\n    Now consider the second product term: $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2 \\cdot 3^i})$.\n    This is exactly $A(x^2)$. Let $A(x^2) = \\sum_{j \\in S_b} (x^2)^j = \\sum_{j \\in S_b} x^{2j}$.\n    So, $P(x) = A(x)A(x^2)$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the coefficients $a_k$ of $P(x)$.**\n    Since $P(x) = (\\sum_{k \\in S_b} x^k)(\\sum_{j \\in S_b} x^{2j}) = \\sum_{k \\in S_b, j \\in S_b} x^{k+2j}$.\n    The coefficient $a_n$ is the number of ways to express $n$ as a sum $k+2j$, where both $k$ and $j$ are integers whose base-3 representation contains only digits 0 and 1 (i.e., $k, j \\in S_b$).\n\n7.  **Prove the uniqueness of the representation.**\n    We need to check if an integer $n$ can be represented as $k+2j$ in more than one way.\n    Suppose $k_1+2j_1 = k_2+2j_2$ for $k_1, k_2, j_1, j_2 \\in S_b$.\n    This implies $k_1-k_2 = 2(j_2-j_1)$.\n    Let $k_1=\\sum \\epsilon_i 3^i$ and $k_2=\\sum \\epsilon'_i 3^i$ with $\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon'_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    Then $k_1-k_2 = \\sum (\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon'_i)3^i$. The \"digits\" $\\alpha_i = \\epsilon_i-\\epsilon'_i$ are in the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    Similarly, let $j_1=\\sum \\delta_i 3^i$ and $j_2=\\sum \\delta'_i 3^i$ with $\\delta_i, \\delta'_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n    Then $2(j_2-j_1) = \\sum 2(\\delta'_i-\\delta_i)3^i$. The \"digits\" $\\beta_i = 2(\\delta'_i-\\delta_i)$ are in the set $\\{-2, 0, 2\\}$.\n    Let $m = k_1-k_2 = 2(j_2-j_1)$. The number $m$ must have a base-3 representation with digits from $\\{-1,0,1\\}$ (the unique balanced ternary representation) and simultaneously a base-3 representation with digits from $\\{-2,0,2\\}$.\n    Let's check if a non-zero number can satisfy this. Let $m = \\sum \\alpha_i 3^i = \\sum \\beta_i 3^i$. Suppose $m \\neq 0$. Let $l$ be the smallest index where the digits are non-zero. Then $\\alpha_l + 3(\\dots) = \\beta_l + 3(\\dots)$. This implies $\\alpha_l \\equiv \\beta_l \\pmod 3$.\n    Given $\\alpha_l \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ and $\\beta_l \\in \\{-2,2\\}$, this congruence is impossible.\n    Thus, we must have $\\alpha_l = \\beta_l = 0$. By induction, all digits must be 0.\n    So, $m=0$.\n    $k_1-k_2=0 \\implies k_1=k_2$.\n    $j_2-j_1=0 \\implies j_1=j_2$.\n    This proves that the representation of $n$ in the form $k+2j$ is unique.\n\n8.  **Calculate the final sum.**\n    Since the representation is unique, the coefficient $a_n$ is 1 if $n$ can be written in the form $k+2j$ for some $k,j \\in S_b$, and $a_n=0$ otherwise.\n    So, all coefficients $a_k$ are either 0 or 1.\n    This means $a_k^2 = a_k$ for all $k$.\n    Therefore, the sum we want to find is:\n    $$\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\sum_k a_k$$\n    The sum of all coefficients of a polynomial is obtained by evaluating the polynomial at $x=1$.\n    $$\\sum_k a_k = P(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+1^{3^i}+1^{2\\cdot 3^i}+1^{3\\cdot 3^i})$$\n    $$\\sum_k a_k = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+1+1+1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$$\n    Since $4=2^2$, this is $(2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\nThe value of the sum is $2^{40}$.\n\nFinal Answer is $4^{20}$ or $2^{40}$. Since the question does not specify a format, we compute the number. $2^{10}=1024$. $2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = 1024^4 = (1024^2)^2 = (1048576)^2 = 1099511627776$. However, $4^{20}$ or $2^{40}$ is a more standard form for such large numbers in contests. I'll provide $2^{40}$.\n\nFinal check of the steps. The logic is sound, and relies on a key insight about the structure of the polynomial's exponents, which simplifies the problem immensely. The most critical step is the uniqueness proof. If the uniqueness holds, the rest follows directly. The proof based on different digit sets for base-3 representation is convincing.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\sum_k a_k^2 = P(1) = 4^{20}$.\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20}=2^{40}$.\n\n<<<2^{40}>>>"
