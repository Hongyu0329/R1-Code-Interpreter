    "An analysis of the question of finding the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   $X$: A finite set with an ultrametric distance function $d(x,y)$. An ultrametric satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$.\n    *   $B$: A complete normed vector space (over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$) with cardinality $|B|=K$.\n    *   Isometric Embedding: A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in X$.\n    *   Objective: Find the value of $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$, where $N(X,B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$, and the minimum is taken over all finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all Banach spaces $B$ of a given cardinality $K$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cardinality $K$ of a Banach Space:**\n    *   If $B$ is the trivial space $\\{0\\}$, its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    *   If $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, it contains a copy of its base field, so its cardinality must be at least $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   If $B$ is finite-dimensional (with dimension $d \\ge 1$), its cardinality is $c$.\n    *   If $B$ is infinite-dimensional (with dimension $\\alpha \\ge \\aleph_0$), its cardinality is $c^\\alpha$, which can be $c$ (if $\\alpha = \\aleph_0$) or greater than $c$.\n    *   So, the possible values for $K$ are $1$, $c$, and $K > c$. We analyze the problem based on these cases.\n\n3.  **Case 1: $K=1$**\n    *   In this case, $B$ must be the trivial Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$.\n    *   To find the smallest possible number of embeddings, we can choose the space $X$. Let's choose a simple space with at least one non-zero distance. For example, let $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\n    *   An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ would require $f(x_1)=0$ and $f(x_2)=0$.\n    *   Then the condition $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1,x_2)$ becomes $\\|0-0\\| = 1$, which is $0=1$, a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, no such embedding exists. The number of embeddings is 0.\n    *   Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n4.  **Case 2: $K=c$**\n    *   The set of Banach spaces $B$ with $|B|=c$ includes all finite-dimensional real/complex vector spaces (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^d$) and some infinite-dimensional ones (e.g., separable spaces like $\\ell_p$ or $C[0,1]$).\n    *   To find the minimum number of embeddings, we are free to choose both $X$ and a suitable $B$ from this collection.\n    *   Let's choose a finite-dimensional space for $B$, for instance $B=\\mathbb{R}$ (the real line with the usual norm). $|B|=|\\mathbb{R}|=c$.\n    *   Now, we need to choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ that cannot be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}$. Consider the 3-point space $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ with distances $d(a,b)=2$, $d(b,c)=1$, and $d(a,c)=2$. This is a valid ultrametric space.\n    *   An embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ requires finding three points $f(a), f(b), f(c) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $|f(a)-f(b)|=2$, $|f(b)-f(c)|=1$, and $|f(a)-f(c)|=2$.\n    *   From the first two equations, let $f(b)=y$. Then $f(a) = y \\pm 2$ and $f(c) = y \\pm 1$. We check the four possibilities for $|f(a)-f(c)|$:\n        *   $f(a)=y+2, f(c)=y+1 \\implies |f(a)-f(c)| = 1 \\ne 2$.\n        *   $f(a)=y+2, f(c)=y-1 \\implies |f(a)-f(c)| = 3 \\ne 2$.\n        *   $f(a)=y-2, f(c)=y+1 \\implies |f(a)-f(c)| = 3 \\ne 2$.\n        *   $f(a)=y-2, f(c)=y-1 \\implies |f(a)-f(c)| = 1 \\ne 2$.\n    *   None of the possibilities work. Therefore, no isometric embedding exists for this choice of $X$ and $B$. The number of embeddings is 0.\n    *   The smallest possible number is again 0.\n\n5.  **Case 3: $K > c$**\n    *   If a Banach space $B$ has cardinality $K>c$, it must be infinite-dimensional.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in functional analysis states that any finite metric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. In particular, this holds for any finite ultrametric space $X$.\n    *   Therefore, for any choice of $X$ and $B$ in this case, at least one embedding exists. The number of embeddings is greater than or equal to 1.\n    *   Let $f: X \\to B$ be one such embedding. We can generate more embeddings. For any vector $b \\in B$, the map $f_b(x) = f(x) + b$ is also an isometric embedding, because $\\|f_b(x) - f_b(y)\\| = \\|(f(x)+b) - (f(y)+b)\\| = \\|f(x)-f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n    *   Since there are $|B|=K$ distinct choices for the vector $b$, there are at least $K$ distinct isometric embeddings.\n    *   Now, we must check if this lower bound $K$ can be achieved. We select a simple $X$ and any $B$ with $|B|=K$.\n    *   Let $X=\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2)=1$. An embedding is determined by a pair of points $(p_1, p_2) \\in B \\times B$ such that $\\|p_1 - p_2\\| = 1$.\n    *   The number of such pairs is given by $|B| \\times |\\text{Sphere}(p_1, 1)|$. We choose $p_1$ in $K$ ways. Then we must choose $p_2$ from the sphere of radius 1 centered at $p_1$.\n    *   In any infinite-dimensional Banach space, the cardinality of any sphere is equal to the cardinality of the space itself. So, there are $K$ choices for $p_2$.\n    *   The total number of such pairs $(p_1, p_2)$ is $K \\times K = K$ (since $K$ is an infinite cardinal). Each pair defines a unique embedding.\n    *   Thus, for this choice of $X$, the number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n    *   Since the number of embeddings is always at least $K$, and we found a case where it is exactly $K$, the smallest possible number is $K$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings depends on the cardinality $K$ of the Banach space $B$.\n\n*   If $K=1$ or $K=c$, it is possible to choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (which can be chosen to be finite-dimensional) such that their geometries are incompatible, resulting in zero embeddings.\n*   If $K > c$, any such Banach space $B$ must be infinite-dimensional, which guarantees the existence of embeddings for any finite $X$. In this case, the number of embeddings is at least $K$, and this minimum is achievable.\n\nThe answer is:\n-   0, if $K=1$ or $K=c$.\n-   $K$, if $K > c$."
