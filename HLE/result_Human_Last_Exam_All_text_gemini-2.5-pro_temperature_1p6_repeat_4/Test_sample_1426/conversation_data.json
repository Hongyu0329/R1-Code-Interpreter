    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific piece of music:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\".\n2.  **Identify the specific instrument:** We need to look at the part written for the \"first violin\" (often notated as *Violino I* in the score).\n3.  **Locate the exact moment in the piece:** The question specifies the very end of the symphony. This means we must look at the final measure of the fourth and final movement (*Finale. Allegro con fuoco*).\n4.  **Examine the score:** Upon consulting the full orchestral score for the end of the symphony, we can see what the first violins are instructed to play.\n5.  **Interpret the phrase \"ends on three notes\":** In the final measure, the first violins, along with most of the orchestra, play a final, powerful chord. For the first violins, this is written as a *triple-stop*, meaning they play three notes at the same time on different strings. These are the \"three notes\" the question refers to.\n6.  **Identify the pitches of the three notes:** The three notes written for the first violin in this final chord are:\n    *   D\n    *   F-sharp (F♯)\n    *   B\n7.  **Determine the lowest note:** By comparing the pitches of these three notes (D, F♯, B), we can identify the one with the lowest frequency. In the musical scale, D is lower than F♯, and F♯ is lower than B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Symphony:** It is essential to analyze Symphony No. 2, not any of Dvořák's other eight symphonies, as the endings will be different.\n*   **Correct Part:** The first violin part is distinct from the second violin, viola, cello, or bass parts. We must look only at the top line of the string section, labeled \"Violino I\".\n*   **Final Chord vs. Final Melody:** The phrasing \"ends on three notes\" could be ambiguous, but a look at the score clarifies that it's a three-note chord (a triple-stop), not a sequence of three individual notes.\n*   **Key Signature and Accidentals:** The final movement is in B Major. The notes of the final chord for the first violin (D, F♯, B) are part of the overall B Major chord that concludes the work. The F♯ is indicated by the key signature or an accidental. The lowest of the three notes in the first violin's chord is D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFollowing the analysis of the musical score, the three notes played by the first violin at the very end of the symphony are D, F♯, and B. The lowest of these three is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
