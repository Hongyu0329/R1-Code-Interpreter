    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks to identify which colors defined in the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if it is \"out of gamut\", meaning its coordinates, after conversion, fall outside the range that sRGB can display.\n\n**2. Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Color Space:** A specific organization of colors. Different color spaces can represent different ranges of color.\n*   **Gamut:** The complete range of colors that can be represented by a color space.\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** A very large gamut color space, capable of representing colors that are even outside the range of human vision. It uses a D50 white point and a gamma of 1.8.\n*   **sRGB:** A smaller gamut color space that is the standard for web browsers, most monitors, and digital images. It uses a D65 white point.\n*   **Out of Gamut:** When converting a color from a larger gamut (like ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (like sRGB), some colors may not have a valid representation. For sRGB, this means one or more of its R, G, or B components would be less than 0 or greater than 1 (on a 0-1 scale) or less than 0 / greater than 255 (on a 0-255 scale). Such colors cannot be directly represented by an sRGB hex code without being \"clipped\" or otherwise altered.\n\n**3. The Conversion Process**\n\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it. The standard procedure is:\n1.  **Linearize ROMM RGB:** The input values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). We must convert them to linear light values by applying the inverse gamma. For ROMM RGB, this means raising the coordinate values (from 0 to 1) to the power of 1.8.\n    `R_linear = R_romm ^ 1.8`\n2.  **Convert to XYZ:** Use a standard matrix to transform the linear ROMM RGB values to the standard CIE XYZ color space.\n3.  **Chromatic Adaptation:** Because ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point and sRGB uses a D65 white point, a chromatic adaptation transform (e.g., Bradford) must be applied to the XYZ values to shift the white point from D50 to D65.\n4.  **Convert to Linear sRGB:** Use a standard matrix to transform the adapted XYZ values to linear sRGB values.\n5.  **Check Gamut:** Check if the resulting linear sRGB `R`, `G`, and `B` values are all within the range [0, 1]. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the original color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\n*Note: Steps 2, 3, and 4 can be combined into a single matrix multiplication that converts linear ROMM RGB (D50) directly to linear sRGB (D65).*\n\n**4. Analyzing Each Color**\n\nWe will apply this conversion process to each of the given colors.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This is pure blue in the ROMM RGB space. The blue primary of ROMM RGB is known to be outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Linearize ROMM:** `[0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8] = [0, 0, 1]`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** Applying the conversion matrix to `[0, 0, 1]` results in linear sRGB coordinates of approximately `[-0.007, 0.059, 1.043]`.\n*   **Gamut Check:** The red component is negative (`-0.007 < 0`) and the blue component is greater than one (`1.043 > 1`). Therefore, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This is pure green in the ROMM RGB space. This is a very saturated green, famously far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Linearize ROMM:** `[0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8] = [0, 1, 0]`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** Applying the conversion matrix to `[0, 1, 0]` results in linear sRGB coordinates of approximately `[-0.969, 1.217, -0.090]`.\n*   **Gamut Check:** The red and blue components are negative, and the green component is greater than one. Therefore, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a cyan-like color. Highly saturated cyans from wide-gamut spaces often fall outside sRGB.\n*   **Linearize ROMM:** `[0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8] = [0, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** Converting `[0, 0.287, 0.395]` results in linear sRGB coordinates of approximately `[-0.281, 0.373, 0.386]`.\n*   **Gamut Check:** The red component is negative (`-0.281 < 0`). Therefore, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a muted, grayish-blue color. Such desaturated colors near the center of the color space are generally shared between different gamuts.\n*   **Linearize ROMM:** `[0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8] = [0.186, 0.287, 0.395]`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** Converting `[0.186, 0.287, 0.395]` results in linear sRGB coordinates of approximately `[0.097, 0.326, 0.389]`.\n*   **Gamut Check:** All components are between 0 and 1. Therefore, this color **can be represented** by sRGB.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB color space, which is D50. The sRGB color space uses a different, \"cooler\" (bluer) white point, D65. When you try to represent the D50 white color within the D65-native sRGB system, a conversion is needed.\n*   **Linearize ROMM:** `[1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8] = [1, 1, 1]`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** Converting `[1, 1, 1]` (D50 white) to the sRGB space (D65 white) results in linear sRGB coordinates of approximately `[1.060, 1.024, 0.969]`.\n*   **Gamut Check:** The red and green components are greater than one. Therefore, the D50 white point of ROMM RGB is **out of gamut** for sRGB and cannot be perfectly represented.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe ROMM RGB colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are options 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3, 5>>>"
