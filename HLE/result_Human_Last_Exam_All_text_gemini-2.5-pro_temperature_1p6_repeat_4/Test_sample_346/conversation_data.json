    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basic SKI combinators**\nThe reduction rules for the S, K, and I combinators are:\n*   `S x y z` → `x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y` → `x`\n*   `I x` → `x`\nFunction application is left-associative, meaning `f x y` is evaluated as `(f x) y`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Church numerals in SKI logic**\nA Church numeral `c_n` is a higher-order function that represents the integer `n`. It's defined as `c_n = λf.λx. f^n x`, meaning it takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\nImportant properties for this problem:\n*   **`c_1`**: The identity combinator `I` is equivalent to `c_1`, since `I f x = f x`, which is applying `f` once.\n*   **Exponentiation**: Applying one Church numeral to another, `c_m(c_n)`, results in exponentiation: `c_n` to the power of `c_m`. `c_m c_n` → `c_{n^m}`.\n*   **Successor function (`succ`)**: There are combinator expressions that, when applied to a Church numeral `c_n`, yield `c_{n+1}`. We will identify two such forms in the given expression.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the components of the expression**\nLet's break down the given expression:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis expression has the form `(F)(G)`, where `F` and `G` are complex expressions themselves.\n`F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))`\n`G = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nLet's analyze the common patterns:\n1.  **`S(I)`**: Let's see how `S(I)` acts on a Church numeral `c_n`.\n    `S(I) c_n f x = (S(I) c_n) f x`. We first evaluate `S(I) c_n`.\n    `S(I) c_n` is `λy. y (c_n y)`.\n    Applied to `f`, this becomes `f(c_n f)`.\n    `c_n f` is the function `λx. f^n x`.\n    `f(c_n f)` is the composition of `f` and `λx. f^n x`. Applying this to a value `z` gives `f((c_n f) z) = f(f^n z) = f^{n+1}(z)`.\n    This means that `S(I) c_n` is a function that, when applied to `f`, yields the function `c_{n+1}f`. Therefore, `S(I)` acts as the successor function `succ`. Let's call it `succ_1`.\n\n2.  **`S(S(K(S))(K))`**: Let `B = S(KS)K`. This is the standard composition combinator, `B f g x = f(g x)`. The expression is `S(B)`.\n    Let's apply `S(B)` to `c_n`, `f`, and `x`.\n    `S B c_n f x` → `B f (c_n f) x` → `f ((c_n f) x)` → `f (f^n x)` → `f^{n+1}(x)`.\n    This is the definition of `c_{n+1} f x`. So `S(S(K(S))(K))` is also a successor function. Let's call it `succ_2`.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate G**\n`G = succ_2(S(I)(I)) = succ_2(succ_1(I))`\nSince `I = c_1`:\n`succ_1(c_1) = c_2`\n`G = succ_2(c_2) = c_3`\nSo, the argument `G` is the Church numeral for 3.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate F**\n`F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(succ_2(I)))))`\nLet's analyze this from the inside out, following left-associativity.\nIt has the structure `succ_1( succ_1( succ_1( K(succ_2(c_1)) ) ) )`.\nLet `f = succ_1 = S(I)`.\n`F = f( f( f( K(c_2) ) ) )`\n\nLet's evaluate the functions being created:\n*   `h_0 = K(c_2)`\n*   `h_1 = f(h_0) = S(I)(K(c_2))`. This is a function of one argument. `S(I) P = λz. z (P z)`.\n    `h_1 = λz. z(K(c_2) z)`. Since `K(c_2) z` reduces to `c_2`, we have `h_1 = λz. z(c_2)`.\n    When `h_1` is applied to a church numeral `c_m`, it yields `c_m(c_2) = c_{2^m}`.\n\n*   `h_2 = f(h_1) = S(I)(h_1) = λy. y(h_1 y)`.\n    When `h_2` is applied to `c_m`, it yields `c_m(h_1 c_m) = c_m(c_{2^m}) = c_{(2^m)^m} = c_{2^{m^2}}`.\n\n*   `h_3 = f(h_2) = S(I)(h_2) = λx. x(h_2 x)`.\n    When `h_3` is applied to `c_m`, it yields `c_m(h_2 c_m) = c_m(c_{2^{m^2}}) = c_{(2^{m^2})^m} = c_{2^{m^3}}`.\n\nSo, the function `F` is `h_3`.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the final expression E**\nThe full expression is `E = F(G) = h_3(c_3)`.\nWe use the formula for `h_3` with `m=3`:\n`h_3(c_3) = c_{2^{3^3}} = c_{2^{27}}`.\nSo the Church numeral `n` is `2^{27}`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final answer**\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 2^{27}`\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^{27}) = 27`."
