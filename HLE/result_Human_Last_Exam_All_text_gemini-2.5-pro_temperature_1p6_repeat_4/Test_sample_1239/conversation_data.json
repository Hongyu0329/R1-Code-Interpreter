    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We are looking for the symmetries of this system of partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider the case with no external forces, as we are interested in the inherent symmetries of the equations themselves. The independent variables are $t, x_1, x_2, x_3$, and the dependent variables are $u_1, u_2, u_3, p$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the symmetries from physical principles**\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that leaves the set of solutions of the equations invariant. We can find the dimension of this group by finding the dimension of its Lie algebra, which consists of the infinitesimal generators of these transformations.\n\nLet's list the expected symmetries based on the physical structure of the equations:\n\n*   **Time translation (1 dimension):** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. This means if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t+s, \\mathbf{x}), p(t+s, \\mathbf{x}))$ for any constant $s$. This gives one generator: $\\partial_t$.\n*   **Space translations (3 dimensions):** The equations do not explicitly depend on the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$. Thus, a translation $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is a symmetry. This gives three generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n*   **Spatial rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are isotropic; they do not have a preferred direction in space. All terms in the equations transform covariantly under rotations. The group of rotations in 3D space is $SO(3)$, which is 3-dimensional. The generators are of the form $J_k = \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_i\\partial_{x_j} + u_i\\partial_{u_j})$.\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under a change to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. The transformation is $t' = t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}_0 t, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}_0$. One can verify that the pressure $p$ remains invariant. This gives three generators, one for each direction of $\\mathbf{v}_0$: $K_i = t\\partial_{x_i} - \\partial_{u_i}$.\n\nSo far, we have found $1+3+3+3 = 10$ dimensions.\n\n**Step 3: Look for scaling symmetries**\n\nWe search for a one-parameter group of scaling transformations of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^d p$.\n\nFor these transformations to leave the form of the equations invariant, the scaling exponents must satisfy a set of linear equations. Applying the transformation to the momentum equation and requiring that each term scales by the same factor yields the following relations among the exponents:\n$a-c = b-2c = b-d = 2b-c$.\n\nSolving this system gives the relations:\n$c = -b$\n$a = 2b$\n$d = -2b$\n\nThis is a one-parameter family of scalings, where $b$ is the free parameter. Setting $b=1$, we get $a=2, c=-1, d=-2$. The transformation is:\n$t' = \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$.\nThis symmetry adds **1 more dimension** to the group. The corresponding infinitesimal generator is $D = 2t\\partial_t + x_k\\partial_{x_k} - u_k\\partial_{u_k} - 2p\\partial_p$.\n\nAt this point, we have $10 + 1 = 11$ dimensions. This 11-dimensional algebra is known as the Schr√∂dinger algebra (without central extension).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze symmetries related to the pressure**\n\nThe pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This implies that the equations are invariant under the transformation $p \\to p + \\phi(t, \\mathbf{x})$ as long as $\\nabla \\phi = 0$. This condition means $\\phi$ must be a function of time only, i.e., $\\phi(t)$.\n\n*   The transformation $p \\to p + g(t)$ for an arbitrary function $g(t)$ is a symmetry. This corresponds to an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries, with generators $g(t)\\partial_p$.\n\nThe question asks for the \"dimension of the Lie group\", which usually refers to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra. The infinite-dimensional set of generators $\\{g(t)\\partial_p\\}$ is an abelian ideal in the full symmetry algebra. Within this infinite-dimensional space, there is a special case when $g(t)$ is a constant, say $g(t) = c_0$.\n\n*   **Constant pressure shift (1 dimension):** The transformation $p \\to p+c_0$ where $c_0$ is a constant, is a symmetry. The generator for this is $\\partial_p$. This generator is distinct from the 11 generators found previously. It is a standard practice in symmetry analysis of PDEs to include such constant shift generators in the finite-dimensional part of the algebra.\n\nThis adds **1 final dimension** to our count.\n\n**Step 5: Final count**\n\nLet's summarize the generators of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry Lie algebra:\n1.  Time translation ($\\partial_t$): 1 dimension.\n2.  Space translations ($\\partial_{x_i}$): 3 dimensions.\n3.  Spatial rotations ($J_k$): 3 dimensions.\n4.  Galilean boosts ($K_i$): 3 dimensions.\n5.  Scaling ($D$): 1 dimension.\n6.  Constant pressure shift ($\\partial_p$): 1 dimension.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of these:\n$1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nWhile some authors quote 11 dimensions by convention (grouping all pressure-related symmetries into the infinite-dimensional part), the established result for the maximal finite-dimensional point symmetry algebra of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is 12."
