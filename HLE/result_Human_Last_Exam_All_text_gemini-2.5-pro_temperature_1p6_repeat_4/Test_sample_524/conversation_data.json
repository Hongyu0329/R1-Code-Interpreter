    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct \"homeomorphism classes\" of \"homogeneous planar continua\". Let's break down these terms:\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. In this context, since we're talking about planar objects, these are compact and connected subsets of the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if, for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are classifying these objects up to homeomorphism. Two spaces, $X$ and $Y$, are in the same homeomorphism class if there exists a continuous bijection $h: X \\to Y$ with a continuous inverse. We need to find how many such distinct classes exist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a deep and celebrated result in point-set topology, achieved through the cumulative work of several mathematicians over many decades, including R. H. Bing, R. D. Anderson, J. T. Rogers, L. G. Oversteegen, and Jan Prajs. The classification can be approached by considering a few key topological properties.\n\nLet $X$ be a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n**Step 1: Consider the degenerate case.**\nA continuum can be degenerate (consisting of a single point) or non-degenerate (containing more than one point).\n*   If $X$ is a single point, it is compact, connected, planar, and trivially homogeneous. All single-point spaces are homeomorphic. This gives us our first class.\n    *   **Class 1: The Point.**\n\n**Step 2: Consider non-degenerate cases and local connectedness.**\nNow, assume $X$ is non-degenerate. A crucial dividing property for continua is local connectedness.\n*   **Case 2a: $X$ is locally connected.** A theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (and refined by others) states that any non-degenerate, homogeneous, locally connected planar continuum is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve. A simple closed curve is, by definition, homeomorphic to the circle, $S^1$. The circle is indeed homogeneous (any point can be mapped to any other via a rotation).\n    *   **Class 2: The Circle ($S^1$).**\n\n*   **Case 2b: $X$ is not locally connected.** A key theorem by L. G. Oversteegen and E. D. Tymchatyn states that every homogeneous planar continuum that is not a simple closed curve must be indecomposable. (An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua). So we are now looking for non-locally connected, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continua.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the property of separating the plane.**\nFor these remaining indecomposable continua, we can use whether or not they separate the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as a distinguishing topological property.\n*   **Case 2b(i): $X$ does not separate the plane.** A famous theorem by R. H. Bing (1960) states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a snake-like, indecomposable continuum that is known to be homogeneous.\n    *   **Class 3: The Pseudo-arc.**\n\n*   **Case 2b(ii): $X$ separates the plane.** The final piece of the classification puzzle was solved by Jan Prajs, who proved that any homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a specific object known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This continuum is constructed by \"arranging\" pseudo-arcs in a circular fashion. It is homogeneous and separates the plane into two components.\n    *   **Class 4: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs.**\n\n**Step 4: Verify the classes are distinct.**\nWe must ensure these four classes are indeed distinct and that the list is exhaustive.\n\n1.  **The Point** is the only degenerate continuum. The other three are non-degenerate.\n2.  **The Circle** is the only locally connected one among the non-degenerate classes. The pseudo-arc and circle of pseudo-arcs are famously not locally connected.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** and **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** are distinguished by their separation property. The pseudo-arc does not separate the plane, while the circle of pseudo-arcs does. Since separating the plane is a topological invariant, they cannot be homeomorphic.\n\nThis case analysis is exhaustive and is the conclusion of a long line of research in topology. There are no other possibilities. For instance, other well-known homogeneous continua like non-trivial solenoids and the Menger curve are not planar. Other planar continua like the Sierpinski carpet are not homogeneous.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are:\n1.  The point\n2.  The circle\n3.  The pseudo-arc\n4.  The circle of pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, the total number of such classes is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
