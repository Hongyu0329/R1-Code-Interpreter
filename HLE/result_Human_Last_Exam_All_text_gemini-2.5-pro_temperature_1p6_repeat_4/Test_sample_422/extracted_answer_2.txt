The two problems for the JTB definition, under the constraint that only "Knowledge" and "Belief" are possible epistemic states, are:

1.  **Conflation of Justified and Unjustified Falsehoods:** The model cannot distinguish between a rational, well-justified belief that happens to be false (e.g., an outdated scientific theory) and an irrational, unjustified belief that is false (e.g., a baseless superstition). Both are relegated to the single category of "Belief," erasing the crucial epistemic difference in the agent's rationality.

2.  **Conflation of Justified Falsehoods and Unjustified Truths:** The model cannot distinguish between a justified false belief (a rational but incorrect conclusion) and an unjustified true belief (a lucky guess that happens to be correct). Both are classified simply as "Belief," which fails to differentiate between an agent who is epistemically responsible but mistaken, and one who is epistemically irresponsible but accidentally correct.
