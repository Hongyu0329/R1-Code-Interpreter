    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is defined by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   In this problem, the size is 128, so $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\n    *   The group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subset of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$, provided that this set forms a subgroup.\n*   **Careful Point:** For an arbitrary group $G$, the set $G^k$ is not always a subgroup. However, for finite nilpotent groups, $G^k$ is guaranteed to be a subgroup. Since $|Q_{128}| = 128 = 2^7$, it is a finite p-group (where p=2), and all finite p-groups are nilpotent. Thus, $Q_{128}^k$ is a subgroup for any integer $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Power Subgroups to the Group Exponent\nA key theorem in group theory states that for a finite nilpotent group $G$, the set of its power subgroups is given by $\\{G^d \\mid d \\text{ is a divisor of } \\exp(G)\\}$, where $\\exp(G)$ is the exponent of the group. This is because for any integer $k$, $G^k = G^{\\gcd(k, \\exp(G))}$. This simplifies our problem to:\n1.  Find the exponent of $Q_{128}$.\n2.  Find the number of divisors of the exponent.\n3.  Verify that each divisor gives a distinct subgroup.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Exponent of $Q_{128}$\nThe exponent of a group is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of all its elements.\n*   The elements of $Q_{128}$ are of the form $x^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 64$) or $x^i y$ (for $0 \\le i < 64$).\n*   **Order of elements $x^i$**: The order of $x$ is 64. The orders of the elements $x^i$ are the various divisors of 64 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).\n*   **Order of elements $x^i y$**: Let's compute the powers of a generic element $x^i y$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i(y x^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    *   Since $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of any element of the form $x^i y$ is 4.\n*   The set of all possible element orders in $Q_{128}$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. The LCM of these orders is 64.\n*   Therefore, the exponent of $Q_{128}$ is $\\exp(Q_{128}) = 64$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Potential Power Subgroups\nThe distinct power subgroups are of the form $Q_{128}^d$, where $d$ is a positive divisor of the exponent, 64.\n*   The number $64 = 2^6$.\n*   The divisors of 64 are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$.\n*   These are the divisors: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   There are 7 divisors. This means there are at most 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Subgroups are Distinct\nTo confirm there are exactly 7 power subgroups, we can show that each divisor $d$ yields a subgroup of a unique order. Let $G = Q_{128}$.\n*   **$G^1$:** This is the entire group $G$, with order 128.\n*   **$G^2$:** This subgroup consists of all squares. The elements are $(x^i)^2 = x^{2i}$ and $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$. This forms the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$, which is cyclic of order 32.\n*   **$G^4$:** The elements are $(x^i)^4 = x^{4i}$ and $(x^i y)^4 = 1$. This forms the subgroup $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$, which is cyclic of order 16.\n*   **$G^8$:** The elements are $(x^i)^8 = x^{8i}$ and $(x^i y)^8 = 1$. This forms the subgroup $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$, which is cyclic of order 8.\n*   **$G^{16}$:** This forms the subgroup $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, which is cyclic of order 4.\n*   **$G^{32}$:** This forms the subgroup $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, which is cyclic of order 2.\n*   **$G^{64}$:** Since the exponent of the group is 64, every element raised to the power of 64 is the identity. So $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\nThe resulting power subgroups have orders 128, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. Since all these orders are different, the 7 subgroups are all distinct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere is one power subgroup for each divisor of the exponent of the group, which is 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. This gives a total of 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
