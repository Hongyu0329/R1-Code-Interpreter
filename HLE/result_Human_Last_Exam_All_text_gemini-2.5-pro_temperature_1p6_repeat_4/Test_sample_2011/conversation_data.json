    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms in the problem statement.\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** We are considering a graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices is `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique size:** The size of a clique is the number of vertices it contains.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum value of `m`, where `m` is the number of different clique sizes that a single graph `G` on 128 vertices can contain. This means we are looking for a graph `G` and a set of `m` distinct integers `{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` such that for each `k_i`, there exists a set of vertices `S_i ⊂ V` with `|S_i| = k_i` and `G[S_i]` is a complete graph (`K_{k_i}`).\n\nA key point is the relationship between a clique and an induced subgraph. A subset of vertices `S` is a clique in `G` if and only if the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph (`K_{|S|}`). So, the problem is equivalent to asking for the maximum number of distinct clique sizes a graph on 128 vertices can have.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nLet `m` be the number of different clique sizes that appear in a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices.\nLet these distinct sizes be `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. These are `m` distinct positive integers.\nLet's order them: `1 ≤ k_1 < k_2 < ... < k_m`.\n\n1.  Since there are `m` distinct positive integers, the largest one, `k_m`, must be at least `m`. For example, if we have 3 distinct sizes, the smallest they could be are 1, 2, and 3, so the largest is at least 3. In general, `k_m ≥ m`.\n2.  For the graph `G` to have a clique of size `k_m`, it must have at least `k_m` vertices. Therefore, the total number of vertices `n` must be greater than or equal to `k_m`. So, `n ≥ k_m`.\n3.  Combining these two inequalities, we get `n ≥ k_m ≥ m`.\n\nFor our specific problem, `n = 128`. This means `128 ≥ m`.\nThis establishes an upper bound: the maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n\n### Step 3: Construct a Graph to Achieve the Upper Bound\n\nNow we need to show that this upper bound of 128 is achievable. We must construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of 128 different sizes.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nLet's check the clique sizes present in `K_{128}`.\n*   **Does it have a clique of size 1?** Yes. Any single vertex forms a `K_1`.\n*   **Does it have a clique of size 2?** Yes. Any pair of vertices are connected, so they form a `K_2`.\n*   **Does it have a clique of size k (for 1 ≤ k ≤ 128)?** Yes. To find a clique of size `k`, we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from the 128 available vertices. Since all vertices in `K_{128}` are connected to each other, any subset of `k` vertices will have all pairs of its vertices connected by an edge. Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset is a complete graph of size `k`, i.e., `K_k`.\n\nThis means that for every integer `k` from 1 to 128, the complete graph `K_{128}` contains an induced clique of size `k`.\nThe set of clique sizes present in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\nThe number of different sizes in this set is `m = 128`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n1.  We proved that for any graph on `n=128` vertices, the number of different clique sizes, `m`, must be less than or equal to 128 (`m ≤ 128`).\n2.  We demonstrated a specific graph, the complete graph `K_{128}`, which has exactly 128 different clique sizes (`m = 128`).\n\nSince we have shown that `m ≤ 128` and have found a graph that achieves `m = 128`, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nIt is important not to confuse \"clique\" with \"maximal clique\" (a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex). If the question were about maximal cliques, the answer would be 15, derived from partitioning the vertices into disjoint cliques of sizes `1, 2, ..., 15`, which sums to 120 vertices. However, the question simply states \"clique\", for which the above analysis holds.\n\n<<<128>>>"
