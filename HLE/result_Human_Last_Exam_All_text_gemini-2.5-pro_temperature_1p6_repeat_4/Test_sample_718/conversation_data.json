    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the interplay between the algebraic structure of an upper semilattice, the representation-theoretic property of tameness, and the homological concept of resolvability.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question and Definitions\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements $i, j \\in J$ have a least upper bound (or supremum, or join), denoted $i \\vee j$. When viewed as a category, there are objects for each element of $J$ and a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\le j$.\n\n2.  **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f_{ij}: f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, in a way that respects composition (i.e., if $i \\le j \\le k$, then $f_{ik} = f_{jk} \\circ f_{ij}$). These functors are equivalent to modules over the *category algebra* $KJ$.\n\n3.  **Tame Functor**: Tameness is a property of a representation category, not usually of a single functor. The phrase \"a tame functor\" is standard shorthand for \"an indecomposable functor $f$ where the category of all functors $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ is of tame representation type\". A category is of tame type if, for any dimension $d$, its indecomposable objects of dimension $d$ can be classified by a finite number of one-parameter families (parametrized by the field $K$). This stands in contrast to \"wild type,\" which is considered unclassifiable.\n\n4.  **$n$-resolvable**: A functor (or module) $f$ is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\n### Step 2: Key Properties and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattices and Algebra Structure**: A crucial property of a finite upper semilattice $J$ is that its category algebra $KJ$ is a **quasi-hereditary algebra**. A major consequence for quasi-hereditary algebras is that they have **finite global dimension**. This means there is a universal upper bound for the projective dimension of any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$. Let this bound be $d = \\text{gl.dim}(KJ)$. Then every functor is $d$-resolvable. However, the question asks about *tame* functors, suggesting a stronger, universal bound that doesn't depend on the specific structure of $J$.\n\n2.  **Homological Characterization of Tameness**: A deep theorem in representation theory states that a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ (like $KJ$) is of tame representation type if and only if for every indecomposable $A$-module $M$, its projective dimension or its injective dimension is at most 1 (i.e., $\\text{pd}(M) \\le 1$ or $\\text{id}(M) \\le 1$).\n\n3.  **Implication of Finite Global Dimension**: The fact that $\\text{gl.dim}(KJ) < \\infty$ for an upper semilattice $J$ is critical. In general tame representation theory (e.g., for tame hereditary algebras), there exist \"regular\" modules that are periodic under the Heller (syzygy) operator $\\Omega$. These modules have infinite projective and infinite injective dimension. However, if the global dimension of the algebra is finite, no module can have infinite projective dimension. This implies that for a tame upper semilattice, there are no such periodic regular modules. Every indecomposable module must lie in what corresponds to the \"preprojective\" or \"preinjective\" components of the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find $n$\n\nLet $J$ be a finite upper semilattice such that its representation category $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ is of tame type. Let $f$ be an indecomposable functor in this category. Our goal is to find a universal integer $n$ such that $f$ is $n$-resolvable (i.e., $\\text{pd}(f) \\le n$).\n\n1.  From the homological characterization of tameness, we know that for our functor $f$, we have two possibilities:\n    *   **Case 1:** $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.\n    *   **Case 2:** $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$.\n\n2.  In Case 1, $f$ is 1-resolvable. Since we are looking for an $n$ that covers all cases, we must have $n \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  Now, consider Case 2, where $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$. From the property of $J$ being an upper semilattice, we know $\\text{gl.dim}(KJ) < \\infty$, which guarantees that $\\text{pd}(f)$ is finite. We need to find a specific upper bound for $\\text{pd}(f)$.\n\n4.  This requires a theorem that connects the injective dimension of a module to its projective dimension for this specific class of algebras. For a quasi-hereditary algebra $A=KJ$ of tame type, it is a known (though non-trivial) result that if an indecomposable module $M$ has $\\text{id}(M) \\le 1$, then its projective dimension is bounded by 2, i.e., $\\text{pd}(M) \\le 2$.\n\n5.  Let's combine the cases.\n    *   If $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$, then it is also true that $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 2$.\n    *   If $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$, the specific result for these algebras implies that $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 2$.\n\n6.  Therefore, in all possible cases for a tame indecomposable functor on an upper semilattice, its projective dimension is at most 2. Any functor is a direct sum of indecomposable functors, and if each summand has a projective dimension at most 2, so does the direct sum.\n\n7.  This means that any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is **2-resolvable**.\n\nThe key steps in the logic are the combination of three powerful theorems: the characterization of upper semilattices as leading to quasi-hereditary algebras (and thus finite global dimension), the homological characterization of tameness ($\\text{pd} \\le 1$ or $\\text{id} \\le 1$), and a more specialized result bounding the projective dimension in the `id â‰¤ 1` case for this class of algebras."
