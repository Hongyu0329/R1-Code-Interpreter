    "This problem requires transforming a given discrete-time system into its observer canonical form using the principle of duality.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe core idea is that the observability of a system `(A, C)` is mathematically equivalent (dual) to the controllability of the system `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)`. We can leverage this by:\n1.  Creating a \"dual\" system with `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\n2.  Finding the transformation that puts this dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into controllable canonical form.\n3.  Using the inverse transpose of this transformation matrix to transform the original system `(A, C)` into observer canonical form.\n\n**Step 2: Define the System and its Dual**\n\nThe original system is:\n`A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`, `C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is:\n`A_d = Aᵀ = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n`B_d = Cᵀ = [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0]`\n\n**Step 3: Adapt for a Multi-Output System**\n\nThe standard procedure for finding a canonical form is for Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) systems. Our system is Multi-Output (C has two rows), which means the dual system is Multi-Input (B_d has two columns). To proceed, we must select one of the outputs to define the canonical transformation. This choice should result in an observable system pair.\n\nLet's select the first row of C, `c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`. We must first verify that the pair `(A, c₁)` is observable.\nThe observability matrix is `O₁ = [c₁; c₁A; c₁A²]`.\n*   `c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`\n*   `c₁A = [0, 1, 0] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [2, 1, 1]`\n*   `c₁A² = (c₁A)A = [2, 1, 1] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [4, 5, 1]`\n`O₁ = [0, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 4, 5, 1]`.\n`det(O₁) = -1 * det([2, 1; 4, 1]) = -1 * (2 - 4) = 2 ≠ 0`.\nThe pair `(A, c₁)` is observable, so we can proceed.\n\nOur simplified dual system for finding the transformation is `(A_d, b_d)` where `b_d = c₁ᵀ = [0; 1; 0]`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Controllable Canonical Form Transformation (T_c)**\n\nWe need to find the transformation `T_c` that puts `(A_d, b_d)` into controllable canonical form.\n1.  **Calculate the Controllability Matrix `W_c`**: `W_c = [b_d, A_d*b_d, A_d²*b_d]`\n    *   `b_d = [0; 1; 0]`\n    *   `A_d*b_d = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n    *   `A_d²*b_d = A_d * [2; 1; 1] = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [2; 1; 1] = [4; 5; 1]`\n    So, `W_c = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Find the Characteristic Polynomial of A**: `det(λI - A) = p(λ) = λ³ + a₁λ² + a₂λ + a₃`\n    `det(λI - A) = det([λ-1, -1, 0; -2, λ-1, -1; 0, -2, λ])`\n    `= (λ-1)((λ-1)λ - 2) - (-1)((-2)λ - 0) = (λ-1)(λ²-λ-2) - 2λ`\n    `= λ³ - λ² - 2λ - λ² + λ + 2 - 2λ = λ³ - 2λ² - 3λ + 2`\n    The coefficients are: `a₁ = -2`, `a₂ = -3`, `a₃ = 2`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Transformation Matrix `T_c`**:\n    Using the standard formula `T_c = W_c * M`, where `M = [a₂, a₁, 1; a₁, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0]`.\n    `T_c = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1] * [-3, -2, 1; -2, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0]`\n    `T_c = [0-4+4, 0+2+0, 0; -3-2+5, -2+1+0, 1; 0-2+1, 0+1+0, 0]`\n    `T_c = [0, 2, 0; 0, -1, 1; -1, 1, 0]`\n\n**Step 5: Find the Observer Transformation Matrix (T_o)**\n\nThe transformation matrix for the observer form `T_o` is the inverse transpose of `T_c`.\n`T_o = (T_c⁻¹)ᵀ`\n1.  **Calculate `T_c⁻¹`**:\n    *   `det(T_c) = 0 - 2(0 - (-1)) + 0 = -2`.\n    *   `adj(T_c) = [-1, 0, 2; -1, 0, 0; -1, -2, 0]`\n    *   `T_c⁻¹ = (1/det(T_c)) * adj(T_c) = (-1/2) * [-1, 0, 2; -1, 0, 0; -1, -2, 0] = [1/2, 0, -1; 1/2, 0, 0; 1/2, 1, 0]`\n\n2.  **Calculate `T_o = (T_c⁻¹)ᵀ`**:\n    `T_o = [1/2, 1/2, 1/2; 0, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the New Matrix C_o**\n\nThe new output matrix `C_o` is found by applying the transformation `T_o` to the original full matrix `C`.\n`C_o = C * T_o`\n`C_o = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] * [1/2, 1/2, 1/2; 0, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]`\n`C_o = [0*0.5+1*0+0*(-1), 0*0.5+1*0+0*0, 0*0.5+1*1+0*0; 1*0.5+1*0+0*(-1), 1*0.5+1*0+0*0, 1*0.5+1*1+0*0]`\n`C_o = [0, 0, 1; 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]`\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Duality:** The method relies on the duality between controllability and observability.\n2.  **System Observability:** The procedure is only possible if the system is observable. We confirmed this for the pair `(A, c₁)`.\n3.  **Multi-Output Systems:** For a MIMO system, a single canonical form is not uniquely defined. A specific output must be chosen to construct the transformation matrix. The choice of `c₁` leads to the first output of the transformed system having the canonical form `[0 0 1]`.\n4.  **Transformation Matrix:** Remember that `T_o = (T_c⁻¹)ᵀ`. A common mistake is to forget the transpose or the inverse.\n5.  **Applying the Transformation:** The final transformation `C_o = C T_o` must use the original, full `C` matrix to find the output matrix for the complete transformed system.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe new matrix `C` in the observer canonical form is:\n`C_o = [0, 0, 1; 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]`\n\n<<<[0, 0, 1; 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]>>>"
