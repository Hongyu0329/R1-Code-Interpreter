The proposed filtering strategy is a multi-step process to be integrated into a standard command-line RNA-seq pipeline:

1.  **Initial Differential Expression (DE) Analysis:** Perform a DE analysis using a tool like DESeq2 with a design formula that accounts for the paired donors (e.g., `~ donor + condition`). Set the `CAR_only` group as the reference level.

2.  **Identify Contaminant Genes:** From the results of the initial DE analysis, filter for genes that show strong evidence of being contaminants. This is achieved by selecting genes with a very large negative log fold change and a high statistical significance. A specific command-line-implementable filter would be: **`log2FoldChange < -5` AND `padj < 0.01`**. The negative log2FC indicates the gene is at least 32-fold more abundant in the contaminated `CAR_only` samples compared to the clean `CAR_IL15` samples.

3.  **Generate a Contaminant Gene List:** Extract the list of gene IDs that meet the criteria from Step 2 and save it to a text file (e.g., `contaminant_genes.txt`). This can be done using command-line tools like `awk`.

4.  **Filter the Raw Data:** Use the generated `contaminant_genes.txt` file to remove the corresponding rows from the original raw gene count matrix. A command like `grep -v -f contaminant_genes.txt raw_counts.tsv > filtered_counts.tsv` can accomplish this.

5.  **Final DE Analysis:** Re-run the complete differential expression analysis (from Step 1) using the newly created `filtered_counts.tsv` as input. The results from this second run will be free of the contamination artifact and will reflect the true biological differences between the two CAR T cell types.
