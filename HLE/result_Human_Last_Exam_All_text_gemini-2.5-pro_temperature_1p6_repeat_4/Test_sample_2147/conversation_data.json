    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core components of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, leader of the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party.\n*   **Action:** He \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\". This places his critique in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n*   **Specifics:** He denounced \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp\". This is a very strong and specific metaphor suggesting decay, lack of progress, and corruption.\n*   **The unknown:** The term \"X-Y\" needs to be identified. The format suggests a compound name or a two-word phrase.\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points and context.**\n*   **Milyukov's Ideology:** As a historian, Milyukov was a positivist who valued facts and rational analysis. As a politician, he was a liberal who believed in progress, reason, and constitutional government. He was a \"Westernizer,\" but this did not mean he uncritically accepted all aspects of Western culture. He would be naturally critical of movements that he perceived as irrational, mystical, or socially unproductive.\n*   **The Cultural Era (Fin de Siècle):** The late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe saw the rise of Modernism. Key artistic and literary movements included Symbolism and Decadence. These movements often rejected realism and positivism, exploring instead themes of mysticism, individualism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), morbidity, and subjectivity.\n*   **The Metaphor \"Stagnant Swamp\":** This imagery strongly aligns with a critique of decadence. A swamp is characterized by still, putrid water, decay, and a lack of healthy, flowing life. This is precisely how a rationalist progressive like Milyukov would view an artistic movement focused on what he considered to be morbid introspection and aesthetic self-indulgence rather than social betterment.\n*   **Russian Context:** These Western European movements had a profound influence on Russia's own \"Silver Age\" of arts and literature. Milyukov's critique was aimed not only at the Western source but also at its Russian adherents.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the points to identify \"X-Y\".**\n1.  We are looking for a cultural movement or group from the late 19th/early 20th century that Milyukov, a rationalist liberal, would have despised.\n2.  The movements of Symbolism and Decadence fit this description perfectly, as their core tenets were antithetical to Milyukov's worldview.\n3.  The term \"Symbolists-Decadents\" was a common label used at the time, often pejoratively, to group these related artistic trends together.\n4.  Milyukov used precisely this formulation to attack the modern art he opposed, seeing it as a sign of cultural decay and a distraction from the serious political tasks facing Russia. For him, this art was not just bad; it was socially and spiritually harmful—a 'stagnant swamp'.\n\nTherefore, \"X-Y\" represents the artistic and literary groups that Milyukov saw as the epitome of this cultural decay.\n\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
