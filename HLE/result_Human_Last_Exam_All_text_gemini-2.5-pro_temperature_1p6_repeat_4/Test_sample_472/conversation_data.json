    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify Elision**\nThe first step is to check for elisions, which occur when a word ending in a vowel (or '-m') is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or 'h-').\n*   In the line, \"bene\" ends with a short '-e' and \"esse\" begins with an 'e'.\n*   Therefore, the '-e' in \"bene\" is elided.\n*   The line is read as: \"et tibi ben' esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step 2: Determine Syllable Quantity**\nNext, we determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on the following rules:\n*   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n*   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or by a double consonant (x, z).\n*   All other syllables are short.\n*   The final syllable of a line is considered *anceps*, meaning it can be scanned as either long or short to fit the meter. It is typically marked as long (L) to complete the final foot.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the line:\n\n*   **et**: Long. It is a monosyllable ending in a consonant, followed by a word starting with a consonant. The syllable is closed (\"et-ti...\"), making it long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ti-bi**: The two 'i' vowels in `tibi` are naturally short, and they are in open syllables (followed by a single consonant). -> **S S**\n*   **ben' es-se**:\n    *   **ben'**: The syllable ends in 'n', and is followed by the 's' of 'esse'. The vowel is followed by two consonants ('n' and 's'), so the syllable is long by position. -> **L**\n    *   **es-**: The vowel is followed by two 's' sounds (`es-se`). The syllable is closed, making it long by position. -> **L**\n    *   **-se**: The final syllable of `esse`. The 'e' is short and in an open syllable before the 's' of `soli`. -> **S**\n*   **so-li**: The 'o' and 'i' in `soli` (dative of `solus`) are both naturally long. -> **L L**\n*   **quom**: Long. This syllable ends in '-m' and is followed by a consonant ('s'). It is long by position. -> **L**\n*   **si-bi**: Both 'i' vowels are naturally short and in open syllables. -> **S S**\n*   **sit**: Long. The syllable ends in 't' and is followed by the consonant 'm'. It is long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ma-le**:\n    *   **ma-**: The 'a' is naturally short and in an open syllable. -> **S**\n    *   **-le**: This is the final syllable of the line (*anceps*). It is scanned as long to fit the iambic pattern of the last foot. -> **L**\n\n**Step 3: Group Syllables into Metrical Feet**\nThe line is an iambic senarius, which consists of six iambic feet. The basic pattern is an iamb (S L), but in Plautine comedy, substitutions are very common. Allowed substitutions include a spondee (L L), a dactyl (L S S), an anapest (S S L), and a tribrach (S S S). The final foot is almost always a pure iamb (S L).\n\nNow we group our sequence of syllables (`L S S L L S L L L S S L S L`) into six feet:\n\n1.  **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` -> **L S S** (This is a Dactyl)\n2.  **Foot 2**: `ben' es-` -> **L L** (This is a Spondee)\n3.  **Foot 3**: `-se so-` -> **S L** (This is an Iamb)\n4.  **Foot 4**: `-li quom` -> **L L** (This is a Spondee)\n5.  **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> **S S L** (This is an Anapest)\n6.  **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> **S L** (This is an Iamb)\n\nThe division works perfectly with the rules of the comic senarius.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe scansion is a dactyl, followed by a spondee, an iamb, another spondee, an anapest, and a final iamb.\n\n<<<L S S L L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
