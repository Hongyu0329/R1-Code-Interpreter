    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sound Source:** The question is about hearing \"human muscle twitches.\" When muscles contract, they produce a very low-frequency vibration and sound, often called \"muscle rumble.\" The frequency of this sound is typically in the range of 10-40 Hertz (Hz). This is considered a very low-frequency sound, with a portion of it falling into the category of infrasound (frequencies below 20 Hz).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hearing Range of Each Animal:** Now, let's examine the hearing capabilities of each animal listed in the choices to see if their range includes 10-40 Hz.\n\n    *   **A. Dog:** The typical hearing range for a domestic dog is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their lower limit of 67 Hz is significantly higher than the 10-40 Hz frequency of a muscle twitch. Therefore, a dog would not be able to hear it.\n\n    *   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using high-frequency sound (ultrasound) for echolocation. Their hearing range is typically between 2,000 Hz and 110,000 Hz (and can be even higher). Their hearing is not adapted for low frequencies. Therefore, a bat cannot hear muscle twitches.\n\n    *   **C. Herring:** This is a type of fish. Many fish are sensitive to low-frequency sounds. The herring family (Clupeidae), in particular, are known as \"hearing specialists.\" They have a connection between their swim bladder and inner ear that amplifies sound. Their hearing range is exceptionally broad, extending from infrasound levels (below 20 Hz, sometimes down to less than 1 Hz) up to about 4,000 Hz. Some species can even hear ultrasound. Since the 10-40 Hz range of muscle twitches falls squarely within their low-frequency hearing capability, a herring could likely detect it. This ability is thought to help them hear the swimming movements of approaching predators.\n\n    *   **D. Whale:** Whales, particularly baleen whales (like blue whales and fin whales), are renowned for communicating using very low-frequency sounds that travel long distances underwater. Their hearing is adapted for this range, typically from about 10 Hz to 30,000 Hz. The 10-40 Hz frequency of a muscle twitch is within their hearing range. So, a whale is also a plausible candidate.\n\n    *   **E. Human:** The standard hearing range for a healthy young human is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This range technically includes the upper portion of the muscle twitch frequency (20-40 Hz). You can demonstrate this by plugging your ears and tensing your jaw muscles; the low rumble you hear is your own muscle contraction. However, our ability to hear such a faint, low-frequency sound from an external source is very poor, especially when it travels through the air.\n\n3.  **Compare the Plausible Options and Conclude:**\n    *   Both whales and herrings have hearing ranges that cover the frequency of muscle twitches.\n    *   However, herrings are famous in the scientific community for being \"hearing specialists\" with extreme sensitivity to low-frequency vibrations in the water. This specific adaptation is believed to be a defense mechanism to detect the faint sounds made by predators, such as the sound of their muscles moving as they swim.\n    *   While a whale could also technically hear in this range, the specific example of a prey animal (herring) evolving to hear the muscle movements of its predator is a more direct and well-documented biological reason for this capability. Therefore, the herring is the strongest and most specific answer to the question.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<<<C>>>"
