No, this approach is not valid when considering the ecological function of mimicry syndromes. The core function of bee mimicry is to send a clear warning signal to natural predators, such as birds. The validity of the researcher's method hinges on whether human perception is an adequate proxy for predator perception, which it is not for several key reasons:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The most significant flaw is the difference between human and predator vision. Many avian predators have tetrachromatic vision, allowing them to see ultraviolet (UV) light. Bumblebee color patterns often have UV components that are invisible to the trichromatic vision of humans. Therefore, two species that look identical to an undergraduate might look completely different to a bird, and thus would not be functional mimics.

2.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** The "similarity" perceived by an untrained human is not the same as the "recognition" performed by a predator. A predator learns to associate a specific set of signals (color, pattern, shape, behavior) with a negative experience (a sting). The undergraduate is simply matching patterns without this crucial learning component.

3.  **Use of Static Images:** The method relies on static images, which eliminates other important components of the warning signal, such as flight patterns, posture, and sound, which can also be part of the mimicry.

Because the method uses the wrong observer (human instead of predator) to assess the signal, it cannot produce a valid clustering of functional mimicry syndromes. The resulting clusters would reflect human-perceived similarity, not the shared warning signals that predators actually respond to in the environment.
