Based on this analysis, the predicted effect is that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit increased cytokine release upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. The use of IL-15 during the manufacturing process enriches for less-differentiated, longer-lived memory T cell phenotypes (like Tscm and Tcm) that possess superior metabolic fitness and a greater intrinsic potential for proliferation and robust effector function, which includes the high-level secretion of cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α.
