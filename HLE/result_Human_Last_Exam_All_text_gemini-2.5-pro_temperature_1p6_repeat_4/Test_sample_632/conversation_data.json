    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, which hosts the Pantheon.\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** \"until 1950\", implying it was removed in or around that year.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Architectural Features**\nThe Piazza della Rotonda is dominated by the Pantheon and the Fontana del Pantheon (a fountain topped by an obelisk). Since the Pantheon and the fountain are still there, the removed feature must be something else. The most famous architectural elements ever added to and later removed from the Pantheon building itself were two bell towers.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the History of the Bell Towers**\n*   **Origin:** In the 17th century, under Pope Urban VIII, two bell towers were constructed on top of the Pantheon's facade. They are most often attributed to the great Baroque architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, although some historians attribute the design to his contemporary, Carlo Maderno.\n*   **Appearance and Nickname:** These towers were highly controversial from the moment they were built. Many critics and the Roman populace felt they clashed horribly with the ancient, classical harmony of the Pantheon. They were universally disliked and given the derogatory nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino\"** or **\"the donkey's ears\"**. This certainly qualifies them as a \"unique\" feature.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Date of Removal**\nThis is the most critical point of analysis. The question states the feature was removed in 1950. However, historical records show that the \"donkey's ears\" were demolished much earlier. They were taken down between **1882 and 1883** as part of a restoration project aimed at returning the building to its perceived original Roman state, free from later additions.\n\n**Step 5: Reconcile the Discrepancy**\nThe date in the question (1950) is factually incorrect. There is no record of any major architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. However, the bell towers are by far the most famous and significant \"unique architectural feature\" ever removed from the site. It is highly probable that the question is referring to the bell towers but contains an error regarding the year of their removal. No other removed feature fits the description as well.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unique architectural feature was the pair of 17th-century Baroque bell towers on the Pantheon, which were famously known as \"the donkey's ears\". While the question provides an incorrect removal date of 1950, the feature itself is unmistakable as they were the most prominent and controversial architectural elements ever removed from the famous landmark.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, widely known by their derogatory nickname \"the donkey's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino).>>>"
