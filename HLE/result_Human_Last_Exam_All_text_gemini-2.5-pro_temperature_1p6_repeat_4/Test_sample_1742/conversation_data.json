    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\n*   The algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a quiver of type $A_3$ with linear orientation.\n*   Since $Q$ is an acyclic quiver, the algebra $A$ is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra.\n*   The indecomposable $A$-modules are well-understood. They correspond to intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let's denote them by $M_{ij}$.\n    *   $M_{11} = S_1$ (simple module at vertex 1), dimension vector $(1,0,0)$.\n    *   $M_{22} = S_2$ (simple module at vertex 2), dimension vector $(0,1,0)$.\n    *   $M_{33} = S_3$ (simple module at vertex 3), dimension vector $(0,0,1)$.\n    *   $M_{12}$: representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$, dimension vector $(1,1,0)$.\n    *   $M_{23}$: representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$, dimension vector $(0,1,1)$.\n    *   $M_{13}$: representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$, dimension vector $(1,1,1)$.\n*   The indecomposable projective modules are $P_1 = M_{13}$, $P_2 = M_{23}$, $P_3 = M_{33}$. The regular module is $A \\cong P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n*   The indecomposable injective modules are $I_1 = M_{11}$, $I_2 = M_{12}$, $I_3 = M_{13}$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules and Slices for this Algebra**\n\n*   For a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of **$\\tau$-tilting modules** and **tilting modules** coincide.\n*   A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if:\n    1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 (proj.dim$(T) \\le 1$). Since $A$ is hereditary, this condition holds for all $A$-modules.\n    2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n    3.  $T$ has exactly $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands, where $n$ is the number of simple modules (here, $n=3$).\n*   For hereditary algebras, there is a fundamental connection between tilting modules and slices in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver, $\\Gamma_A$. The AR quiver for $A_3$ with linear orientation is:\n    ```\n            M13 (P1, I3)\n           /   \\\n        M12(I2)  M23(P2)\n       /   \\ /   \\\n    M11(S1,I1) M22(S2) M33(S3,P3)\n    ```\n    (arrows are $\\searrow$ and $\\nearrow$).\n*   A set of indecomposable modules $\\mathcal{S}$ is a **complete slice** if it consists of $n=3$ modules, it is sincere (the support of $\\bigoplus_{M \\in \\mathcal{S}} M$ contains all vertices), and it satisfies certain orthogonality and path-closure conditions.\n*   A key theorem states that for a hereditary algebra, a module $T$ is a tilting module if and only if its indecomposable direct summands form a complete slice in the AR quiver.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contradiction in the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" that is \"not a slice\". According to the standard modern theory for hereditary algebras, every tilting module is a \"slice module\" (the direct sum of modules in a complete slice). This suggests two possibilities:\n1.  There is a subtle definition of \"slice\" being used that distinguishes it from the set of summands of a tilting module.\n2.  There is a unique tilting module that is exceptional in some sense, and the question uses the term \"slice\" to exclude this exceptional case.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Unique/Exceptional Tilting Module**\n\nLet's consider the module $A$ itself, viewed as a left $A$-module. It decomposes into the direct sum of indecomposable projectives:\n$A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{23} \\oplus M_{33}$.\n\nLet's verify if $A$ is a tilting module:\n1.  proj.dim$(A)=0 \\le 1$. This holds.\n2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(A,A) = 0$. This holds because $A$ is a projective module.\n3.  $A$ is the direct sum of 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable modules ($P_1, P_2, P_3$). This holds.\n\nSo, the regular module $A$ is indeed a tilting module.\n\nNow, why is it unique and why might it be considered \"not a slice\"?\n*   **Uniqueness**: For any tilting module $T$, one can form the endomorphism algebra $\\text{End}_A(T)$. By the Brenner-Butler theorem, this endomorphism algebra is a \"tilted algebra\". The module $A$ is the unique (up to isomorphism) tilting module whose endomorphism algebra is $A$ itself. For any other tilting module $T$, $\\text{End}_A(T)$ is a tilted algebra which is not isomorphic to $A$ (though it is derived equivalent).\n*   **\"Not a slice\"**: The term \"slice\" is sometimes used colloquially in tilting theory to refer to the sets of modules that arise from \"tilting\" the projective modules. In this view, the initial set of projectives $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$ is the starting point, but not itself a \"slice\" which is obtained by a tilting procedure. It's the canonical, untilted object. If \"slice module\" means a genuinely \"tilted\" module, then $A$ would be the unique tilting module that isn't one.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Answer**\n\nThe module in question is the regular module $A$, which is the direct sum of all non-isomorphic indecomposable projective modules. It is a tilting module, and it is unique in several ways, most notably that its endomorphism ring is $A$. This exceptional status is likely what the question is referring to by saying it is \"not a slice\".\n\nThe module is $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$. Let's write this in terms of the interval modules or their representations.\n*   $P_1 = M_{13} = (\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C})$\n*   $P_2 = M_{23} = (0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C})$\n*   $P_3 = M_{33} = (0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C})$\n\nThe unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is the direct sum of the indecomposable projective modules, $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n\n<<<P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3>>>"
