    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Core Elements:**\n    *   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n    *   **Character:** A teenager.\n    *   **Key Object:** A pink bike.\n    *   **Key Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   Many 1980s teen films feature bikes (e.g., *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*), but none match the specific combination of a *pink* bike and a direct confrontation with a car.\n    *   Films known for games of \"chicken\" (e.g., *Footloose*, *Rebel Without a Cause*) do not involve a teenager on a pink bike against a car. The vehicles are typically cars vs. cars or tractors vs. tractors.\n    *   The movie *Pretty in Pink* features a teenage protagonist heavily associated with the color pink, but the iconic vehicle is her pink car, not a bike, and the described scene does not occur.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:**\n    *   The collection of quirky and highly specific details points strongly to the 2004 cult classic, **Napoleon Dynamite**.\n\n4.  **Verifying Each Element Against the Film *Napoleon Dynamite*:**\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film from a Major Studio:** *Napoleon Dynamite* was produced in association with Fox Searchlight Pictures and Paramount Pictures (through MTV Films). Both are major studios or subsidiaries of major studios. This criterion is met.\n    *   **A Teenager:** The main character, Napoleon Dynamite (played by Jon Heder), is a student in high school and is therefore a teenager. This criterion is met.\n    *   **A Pink Bike:** In the latter part of the film, Napoleon needs to get to the school dance. He buys a small, bright pink girl's Huffy bicycle, complete with a basket and streamers, from a farmer on the side of the road. This criterion is met.\n    *   **Pedals Directly Toward an Oncoming Car:** Shortly after acquiring the pink bike, Napoleon is furiously pedaling along the shoulder of a road. His Uncle Rico, driving his orange van, sees him. Angry from a previous argument, Rico intentionally swerves the van off the main road and drives directly at Napoleon. Instead of swerving to escape, Napoleon holds his ground and continues pedaling straight forward in the path of the van. Rico is forced to swerve away at the last possible second. While Rico is driving a van, not a car, \"car\" is often used as a general term for a vehicle, and the action perfectly matches the description. This final criterion is met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scene described occurs in the film *Napoleon Dynamite*. The character is the teenager Napoleon Dynamite, who, while riding a small pink bicycle, continues to pedal forward as his Uncle Rico aims his van directly at him.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
