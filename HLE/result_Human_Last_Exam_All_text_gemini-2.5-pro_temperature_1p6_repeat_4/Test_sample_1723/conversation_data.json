    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific mushroom genus based on a unique characteristic. The key pieces of information are:\n*   **\"a single genus\"**: This implies that only one genus is known for this trait.\n*   **\"mushroom\"**: We are in the field of mycology.\n*   **\"distinctly blue spore print\"**: This is the defining and very rare characteristic we need to search for.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Importance of Spore Prints in Mycology**\nA spore print is a critical tool for identifying mushroom species. It's created by placing a mushroom cap, gills down, on a surface (often half white, half black paper to see the color clearly) and letting the mature spores drop. The color of the spore deposit is a stable and key taxonomic feature. Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Characteristic: \"Blue Spore Print\"**\nA blue spore print is exceptionally rare. This rarity is why the question specifies \"a single genus.\" Most mushrooms that are blue in color do not produce blue spores. This is a crucial point to consider, as it's a common source of confusion.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Mushroom Color vs. Spore Print Color**\nOne must not confuse the color of the mushroom's flesh or cap with the color of its spore print.\n*   **Example 1: *Lactarius indigo*** (Indigo Milk Cap) is a famously blue mushroom, but its spore print is cream to yellowish.\n*   **Example 2: *Stropharia aeruginosa*** (Verdigris Agaric) is a blue-green mushroom, but its spore print is a dark purplish-brown.\nTherefore, we must specifically look for information on the spore print itself, not the color of the mushroom's body.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Genus**\nThrough mycological literature and databases, we can search for genera known to produce blue spores. This search consistently points to one genus.\n*   The genus is **Entoloma**.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Nuances within the *Entoloma* Genus**\nWhile *Entoloma* is the correct answer, it's important to understand the context.\n*   *Entoloma* is a very large and diverse genus. The vast majority of its species do *not* have blue spores. In fact, the genus is most famous for its angular spores that typically produce a **pink or salmon-colored** spore print.\n*   The species with blue spores belong to specific sub-groups within *Entoloma*, such as the subgenus *Leptonia*, and particularly the section *Cyanula*. Species like *Entoloma nitidum* are examples of members with blue-violaceous spores.\n*   Despite the fact that most *Entoloma* species have pink spores, it remains the **only known genus** that contains species capable of producing a truly blue spore print.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\nBased on the analysis, we have confirmed that a blue spore print is a rare trait. We have ruled out common misconceptions by distinguishing between mushroom color and spore print color. The research points exclusively to the genus *Entoloma* as the only one known to have members that produce blue spores, even though this trait is not representative of the entire genus. Therefore, the answer to the question \"There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\" is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
