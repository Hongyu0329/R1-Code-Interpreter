    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Understand the Given Information\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables X, Y, and Z:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, W, is a deterministic function of Z. This means that if we know Z, we know W. Mathematically, this is expressed as $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nThe objective is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 2. Derive Additional Information Quantities\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to derive other quantities. The chain rule states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n\nLet's apply this to our variables:\n1.  $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    Using the given values: $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n2.  $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    Using the value we just found and the given values: $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n    This implies $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n3.  The Interaction Information, $I(X;Y;Z)$, can be calculated in several ways and must be consistent.\n    *   $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n    *   $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$.\n    The consistency of the interaction information confirms our derived value for $I(X;Z)$ is correct.\n\nSo, our set of known information quantities is:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y;Z) = 1$\n\n### 3. Establish a Formula for $I(X;Y|W)$\nWe need to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities. We can use the chain rule again.\nConsider the quantity $I(X;Y,Z|W)$:\n1.  $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n2.  $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nSince W is a deterministic function of Z ($H(W|Z)=0$), knowing Z is sufficient to know W. Therefore, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on just $Z$. So, $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second expansion gives:\n$I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we can equate the two expansions for $I(X;Y,Z|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y|Z)=2$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### 4. Analyze the Expression to Maximize\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we must maximize the term $I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Let's call this term $\\Delta(W)$.\n\nThe condition that W is a function of Z ($W=f(Z)$) has several consequences, including the following identities based on the chain rule:\n*   $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$, which implies $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$, which implies $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nNow substitute these into the expression for $\\Delta(W)$:\n$\\Delta(W) = (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y)) = 1 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSo, the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ becomes:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + \\Delta(W) = 2 + (1 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nThe term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ is the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$. To get the largest value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize $I(X;Y;W)$ by choosing an appropriate function $W=f(Z)$.\n\n### 5. Construct a Model to Find the Maximum Value\nThe given information values are consistent and non-negative (where required), so we can construct a model using independent random \"information atoms\" $S_i$. Let $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$ be independent random variables with entropies:\n*   $H(S_1) = I(X;Y;Z) = 1$\n*   $H(S_2) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $H(S_3) = I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   For a consistent model, we also need to satisfy $I(Y;Z|X) \\ge 0$. As $I(X;Y;Z) = I(Y;Z)-I(Y;Z|X)=1$, this condition holds. Let $H(S_4) = I(Y;Z|X) \\ge 0$.\n\nDefine the random variables X, Y, Z in terms of these atoms:\n*   $X = (S_1, S_2, S_3)$\n*   $Y = (S_1, S_2, S_4)$\n*   $Z = (S_1, S_3, S_4)$\n\nThis construction correctly reproduces all the given and derived information quantities. Now, let's use it to analyze $I(X;Y|W)$, where $W=f(Z) = f(S_1, S_3, S_4)$.\n\nFrom the previous section, we have the identity:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nLet's re-evaluate the two terms using our model:\n*   $I(X;Z|W) = I((S_1,S_2,S_3); (S_1,S_3,S_4) | W) = H(S_1,S_2,S_3|W) - H(S_1,S_2,S_3|S_1,S_3,S_4,W)$.\n    Since W is a function of $(S_1,S_3,S_4)$, the second term's conditioning simplifies to $(S_1,S_3,S_4)$.\n    $H(S_1,S_2,S_3|S_1,S_3,S_4) = H(S_2|S_1,S_3,S_4) = H(S_2)=2$.\n    Since $S_2$ is independent of $Z=(S_1,S_3,S_4)$ and thus independent of $W=f(Z)$, $H(S_2|W)=H(S_2)=2$.\n    $H(S_1,S_2,S_3|W) = H(S_2|W) + H(S_1,S_3|W) = 2 + H(S_1,S_3|W)$.\n    So, $I(X;Z|W) = (2+H(S_1,S_3|W)) - 2 = H(S_1,S_3|W)$.\n\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I((S_1,S_2,S_3);(S_1,S_3,S_4)|(S_1,S_2,S_4),W) = H(S_3|S_1,S_2,S_4,W)$.\n    Since $S_3$ is independent of $S_1,S_2,S_4$, this is $H(S_3|W)$.\n\nSubstituting these back into our formula for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + H(S_1,S_3|W) - H(S_3|W)$\n\nUsing the chain rule for entropy, $H(S_1,S_3|W) = H(S_3|W) + H(S_1|S_3,W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (H(S_3|W) + H(S_1|S_3,W)) - H(S_3|W) = 2 + H(S_1|S_3,W)$\n\n### 6. Final Maximization\nOur goal now is to find the largest possible value of $2 + H(S_1|S_3,W)$, by choosing the function $W=f(S_1,S_3,S_4)$.\n\nThe entropy of $S_1$ is $H(S_1)=1$. Conditioning can never increase entropy, so $H(S_1|S_3,W) \\le H(S_1) = 1$.\nTherefore, $I(X;Y|W) \\le 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nTo check if this maximum value of 3 is achievable, we need to find a function $W=f(S_1,S_3,S_4)$ that makes $H(S_1|S_3,W) = 1$. This occurs if the conditioning variables $(S_3,W)$ are independent of $S_1$.\nLet's choose $W$ to be a function that ignores $S_1$. For example, let $W=S_4$. Since $S_4$ is a component of $Z=(S_1,S_3,S_4)$, $W=f(z_1,z_2,z_3)=z_3$ is a valid deterministic function.\nWith $W=S_4$, the term becomes $H(S_1|S_3,S_4)$.\nSince $S_1, S_3, S_4$ are independent by construction, $H(S_1|S_3,S_4) = H(S_1) = 1$.\nThis choice achieves the maximum value.\n\nThus, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 3.\n\nWe can also note that setting W to a constant (which is a deterministic function of Z) yields $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3$. Setting $W=Z$ would yield $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$. Our analysis shows that we cannot achieve a value greater than 3."
