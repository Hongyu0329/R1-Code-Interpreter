    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's book, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three criteria:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe the religious practices they observed there.\n    *   Their description contains a clear reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Examine the Book's Premise:** *The House of the Wolfings* is a fantasy story about a tribe of Goths, the Wolfings, preparing to defend their homeland from an invading Roman army. The perspective is that of the Goths. Therefore, any information about the Romans would likely come from a messenger, scout, or traveler who has had direct contact with them.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Characters:** Early in the novel, the Wolfing tribe gathers to hear news about the approaching Roman threat. A character who has traveled far and wide arrives to deliver this news. This character's role as a traveler makes them the most likely candidate to have visited a Roman city.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Character:** The character who returns from his travels to warn the Wolfings is **Otur**, also known as **Otur the Wanderer** or **Otur the Far-Farer**. He appears in Chapter II, \"The Tidings of the Romans.\"\n\n5.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:** In Chapter II, Otur is in the main hall of the Wolfings and is asked to describe the Romans. He recounts a journey he took into a Roman city where he entered one of their temples.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Description:** Otur explicitly describes an image he saw in the temple, which he understood to be the representation of the \"first Father of their Folk.\" His exact words are:\n    > \"Yea, and I have been in one of their cities and in one of their temples, and I have seen the image of their God, of the first Father of their Folk; and it was a She-wolf with two man-children sucking her teats.\"\n\n7.  **Confirm the Reference:** This description is an unmistakable reference to the Lupa Capitolina (Capitoline Wolf), the famous bronze sculpture depicting a she-wolf suckling the mythical founders of Rome, the twins Romulus and Remus. Readers would immediately recognize this iconic image of Roman mythology.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Character's Name:** The character is named Otur. He is often given the epithet \"the Wanderer\" or \"the Far-Farer\" to emphasize his role as a traveler who brings news from distant lands.\n*   **Thematic Significance:** William Morris uses this detail deliberately. The Goths call themselves the \"Wolfings,\" and their divine guardian is a wolf spirit. Otur's discovery that their enemies, the Romans, also have a foundational myth involving a she-wolf creates a powerful and ironic parallel between the two opposing cultures.\n*   **Source of Information:** The information is delivered orally by Otur to the rest of the tribe, serving as a key piece of exposition that characterizes the enemy from the Goths' perspective.\n*   **Accuracy of the Myth:** Otur's description is precise and directly corresponds to the well-known Roman foundation myth, ensuring that the reader understands the reference.\n\nBased on this analysis, the character who visited a Roman city and described this scene is Otur the Wanderer.\n\n<<<Otur the Wanderer>>>"
