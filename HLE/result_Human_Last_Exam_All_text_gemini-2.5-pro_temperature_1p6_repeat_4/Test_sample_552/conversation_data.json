    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific scientific paper in question:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. Its German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Understand the context of the paper's citations:** A well-known characteristic of Einstein's 1905 papers is their relative lack of citations to prior work, especially compared to modern scientific papers. Einstein often derived his results from first principles. For instance, in this paper, he famously did not cite the experimental work on Brownian motion by botanist Robert Brown or others.\n\n3.  **Search for specific citations within the paper:** Despite the sparse referencing, the paper is not entirely without citations. The core of Einstein's argument in this paper is to provide a theoretical and quantitative explanation for Brownian motion using the principles of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat. To do this, he built upon the statistical mechanics framework developed by others.\n\n4.  **Identify the key figure cited for this framework:** The preeminent figure in the development of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat at that time was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein was familiar with Boltzmann's work, which provided the statistical foundation for thermodynamics.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the exact work cited:** A careful examination of Einstein's paper (or historical analyses of it) reveals a reference to a specific work by Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n6.  **Verify if the cited work qualifies as \"lectures\":** The work Einstein cited is Ludwig Boltzmann's influential two-volume book, **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie.\"** The German word \"Vorlesungen\" translates directly to **\"Lectures.\"** Therefore, the full title is \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" This work was indeed based on the lectures Boltzmann delivered on the topic.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The question specifically asks about *lectures*, not just papers or books. Boltzmann's \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" perfectly fits this description.\n*   **Singularity of the answer:** Historical accounts confirm that the reference to Boltzmann's work is the key relevant citation in this paper that fits the user's query. Einstein built his argument from fundamentals but acknowledged the theoretical foundation laid by Boltzmann.\n*   **Distinguishing from other work:** It's important not to confuse this with other influences. While Einstein's work shares a foundation with that of J. Willard Gibbs, Einstein later stated he was not familiar with Gibbs's detailed work at the time he wrote the 1905 papers. The explicit citation is to Boltzmann.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify that the lectures cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion were those of Ludwig Boltzmann, as published in his book \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
