The pharmacist should counsel Allison on two key points. First, and most critically, the pharmacist should ask clarifying questions about her headache to determine if it is a migraine with aura (e.g., accompanied by visual changes like flashing lights or blind spots). This is because her birth control, Junel Fe, contains estrogen, which is contraindicated in patients with migraine with aura due to a significantly increased risk of stroke. The pharmacist should recommend she speak with her doctor immediately about this potential issue. Second, the pharmacist should advise her that taking Excedrin (which contains aspirin) while on Fluoxetine (an SSRI) increases the risk of stomach bleeding and recommend she watch for symptoms or discuss safer alternatives like acetaminophen with her doctor.
