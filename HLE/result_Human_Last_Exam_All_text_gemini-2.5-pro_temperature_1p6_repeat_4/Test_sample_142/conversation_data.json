    "A full configuration interaction (Full CI) calculation considers all possible ways to distribute the electrons of a system among the available orbitals. The number of resulting spin-adapted configurations is known as the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs). To find this number for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N)\nThe number of electrons in the molecule is the sum of the atomic numbers of its constituent atoms.\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, which consists of:\n*   1 Carbon (C) atom: 6 electrons\n*   3 Hydrogen (H) atoms: 3 × 1 = 3 electrons\n*   1 Silicon (Si) atom: 14 electrons\n*   1 Fluorine (F) atom: 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons (N) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32 electrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions (K)\nThe number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, K) is determined by the chosen basis set (6-31G**) for each atom in the molecule.\n*   **6-31G** basis set notation: This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The `**` indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. For heavy atoms, this is typically a set of d-functions, and for hydrogen, a set of p-functions. In standard implementations (like Gaussian), Pople basis sets use 6 cartesian d-functions.\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with a split valence, resulting in 2 s-type basis functions.\n    *   The second `*` in `**` adds one set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which are 3 functions.\n    *   Total for H = 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives 9 basis functions (3 s-type and 2 sets of p-type functions, i.e., 3s + 2x3p).\n    *   The first `*` in `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions. We assume 6 cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Total for C or F = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    *   For a third-row atom like Si, the 6-31G basis provides 13 basis functions (4 s-type and 3 sets of p-type functions, i.e., 4s + 3x3p).\n    *   The first `*` in `**` adds one set of d-type polarization functions (6 cartesian functions).\n    *   Total for Si = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F):\nK = (1 × 15) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 19) + (1 × 15)\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64 basis functions (spatial orbitals).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Total Spin (S)\nThe molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ has an even number of electrons (N=32) and is a stable molecule. Its ground state is a singlet state, which corresponds to a total spin quantum number S = 0. The problem doesn't specify an excited state, so we calculate the number of CSFs for the ground state singlet manifold.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Formula for the Number of CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a system with K spatial orbitals, N electrons, and a total spin S is given by the formula:\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nFor a singlet state (S=0), the formula simplifies to:\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, 0) = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\binom{K+1}{N/2+1}$\n\nAn equivalent and often computationally simpler formula for singlet CSFs is:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nWe will use the second formula with our values:\n*   K = 64\n*   N = 32, so N/2 = 16\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{16 - 1} \\binom{64}{16 + 1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Result\nThis step involves calculating the binomial coefficients, which result in very large numbers. This requires high-precision arithmetic.\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 18,142,290,653,134,304$\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 55,548,266,400,224,152$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 156,842,163,953,597,120$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = (55,548,266,400,224,152)^2 - (18,142,290,653,134,304) \\times (156,842,163,953,597,120)$\n\n$N_{CSF} = 3,085,619,411,462,817,733,392,621,698,920,544 - 2,844,844,787,459,116,469,682,633,211,009,344$\n\n$N_{CSF} = 240,774,624,003,701,263,709,988,487,911,194,900$\n\n<<<240774624003701263709988487911194900>>>"
