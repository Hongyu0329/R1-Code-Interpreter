    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions given in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** We are working with a group `G` that has a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (A):** A non-empty subset `A` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `A` (including the case where `x = y`), their product `xy` is not in `A`. In set notation, this means `A ⋅ A ∩ A = ∅`, where `A ⋅ A = {xy | x, y ∈ A}`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set `A`, because `e ⋅ e = e`, and this would mean `e ∈ A ⋅ A`, so `A ⋅ A ∩ A` would contain `e`, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `A` is a MIPFS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ A` to `A`, the new set `A ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its MIPFSs is equal to the entire group `G`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** As we established, the identity element `e` can never be in any MIPFS. Therefore, if the definition of \"fills G\" means the union is literally equal to `G`, then no group can be a filled group. The standard interpretation in this context is that the union of all MIPFSs covers every non-identity element. So, a group `G` is filled if `⋃ M_i = G \\ {e}`, where `{M_i}` is the collection of all MIPFSs in `G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow `p`-subgroups. A key property we will use is that in a nilpotent group, elements of coprime order commute.\n\n### Step 2: The Core Problem - Finding \"Uncoverable\" Elements\n\nThe question asks us to identify which finite nilpotent groups are filled. A group `G` is *not* filled if there exists at least one non-identity element `g ∈ G` that is not contained in *any* MIPFS. Such an element is sometimes called an \"elusive\" element.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to determining for which finite nilpotent groups do elusive elements exist. If no elusive elements exist, the group is filled.\n\n### Step 3: A Deceptively Simple (and Flawed) Argument\n\nOne might be tempted by the following simple argument:\n1.  Let `g` be any non-identity element in a finite group `G`.\n2.  The singleton set `{g}` is product-free (since `g² = g` implies `g = e`).\n3.  If `{g}` is a MIPFS, then `g` is covered.\n4.  If `{g}` is not a MIPFS, it must be contained in a larger product-free set `A₁`.\n5.  If `A₁` is not a MIPFS, it is contained in a larger product-free set `A₂`, and so on.\n6.  Since `G` is finite, this process of extending to larger sets must terminate at some set `M`. This `M` will be a product-free set containing `g` which cannot be extended, making it a MIPFS.\n7.  Therefore, every non-identity element `g` is in some MIPFS, and every finite group is filled.\n\nThis argument is a **well-known fallacy**. The flaw is subtle: while any product-free set can be extended to a maximal one, the extension process might not preserve the original element `g`. The argument correctly shows that every non-identity element is in *some* product-free set, but not necessarily in a *maximal* one.\n\n### Step 4: Using a Known Classification Theorem\n\nSince the simple argument is flawed, we must rely on a deeper result from group theory. There is a classification theorem for finite filled groups (proven by V. P. Goryachev and others), which states:\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group `G` is *not* a filled group if and only if `G` can be expressed as a semidirect product `G ≅ K ⋊ C₃`, where:\n1.  `K` is a non-trivial normal subgroup of `G` in which every non-identity element has order 2 (i.e., it is an elementary abelian 2-group).\n2.  `C₃` is a subgroup of `G` of order 3.\n3.  The conjugation action of the generator of `C₃` on `K` is a *fixed-point-free automorphism*. This means that for a generator `x` of `C₃` and any non-identity element `k ∈ K`, we have `xkx⁻¹ ≠ k`.\n\nA finite group `G` is filled if and only if it does not have this specific structure.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Theorem to Finite Nilpotent Groups\n\nNow, we check if a finite nilpotent group `G` can have the structure described by the theorem that would make it \"not filled\".\n\n1.  Let's assume `G` is a finite nilpotent group and it has the structure `K ⋊ C₃` as described above.\n2.  The elements of `K` have order 2, so they belong to the Sylow 2-subgroup of `G`.\n3.  The elements of the subgroup `C₃` have order 3, so they belong to the Sylow 3-subgroup of `G`.\n4.  A fundamental property of finite nilpotent groups is that **elements of coprime order must commute**.\n5.  Let `k` be any element in `K` (order 1 or 2) and `x` be a generator of `C₃` (order 3). Since `gcd(order(k), order(x))` is either `gcd(1,3)=1` or `gcd(2,3)=1`, the elements `k` and `x` must commute. That is, `xk = kx`.\n6.  This implies that the conjugation action of `x` on `k` is trivial: `xkx⁻¹ = kxx⁻¹ = k`.\n7.  This means that `x` fixes *every* element of `K`. This directly contradicts the condition of the theorem that the action must be *fixed-point-free* (for a non-trivial `K`).\n8.  The only way to avoid contradiction is if `K` is the trivial subgroup `{e}`. But the theorem requires `K` to be non-trivial.\n\nTherefore, no finite nilpotent group can have the structure of a non-filled group. This implies that all finite nilpotent groups must be filled. This includes the trivial group `{e}`, for which `G \\ {e}` is the empty set, which is equal to the union of its (empty) collection of MIPFSs.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis using the classification theorem for filled groups shows that the specific structure required for a group to be \"not filled\" is impossible within a finite nilpotent group. The property that elements of coprime order commute in nilpotent groups is the decisive factor. Thus, every finite nilpotent group is a filled group.\n\n<<<All finite nilpotent groups>>>"
