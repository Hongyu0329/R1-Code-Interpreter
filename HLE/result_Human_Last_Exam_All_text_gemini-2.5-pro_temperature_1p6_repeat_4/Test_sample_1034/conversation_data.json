    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we need to interpret the given values.\n- $S = SNYWR$. This is a placeholder, which commonly represents the current year. We will assume the current year is 2024. Therefore, $S = 2024$.\n- We have a triangle $ABC$ with the following properties:\n    - Side $BC$, let's call its length $a$, is equal to $S$. So, $a = 2024$.\n    - The measure of angle $B$ is $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n    - Side $AC$, let's call its length $b$. We are looking for the number of integer values for $b$.\n    - Side $AB$, let's call its length $c$. The condition is that there must be two possible values for $c$.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Geometric Condition**\n\nThe problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines, also known as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. We are given two sides ($a$ and $b$) and a non-included angle ($\\angle B$). The number of possible triangles (and thus the number of possible values for the third side, $c$) depends on the relationship between the lengths of sides $a$, $b$, and the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The key to this problem is knowing the conditions that lead to zero, one, or two possible triangles in the SSA case.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Conditions for Two Triangles**\n\nLet's visualize the triangle. Draw the side $BC$ of length $a=2024$. At vertex $B$, draw a ray that makes a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie on this ray. Now, from vertex $C$, we draw an arc with radius $b$ (the length of side $AC$). The number of times this arc intersects the ray from $B$ determines the number of possible triangles.\n\nLet $h$ be the altitude (height) from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$.\n- In the right triangle formed by the altitude, we have $\\sin(\\angle B) = \\frac{h}{a}$.\n- Therefore, $h = a \\sin(\\angle B)$.\n\nThe conditions for the number of possible triangles when $\\angle B$ is acute ($30^{\\circ} < 90^{\\circ}$) are:\n- If $b < h$: The arc from $C$ is too short to reach the ray. No triangle exists.\n- If $b = h$: The arc is tangent to the ray. One triangle exists (a right-angled triangle).\n- If $b > a$: The arc intersects the ray at one valid point. One triangle exists.\n- If $h < b < a$: The arc intersects the ray at two distinct points. Two triangles exist.\n\n**The condition we need is $h < b < a$.**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Values**\n\nWe have $a = 2024$ and $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$. Let's calculate the altitude $h$.\n- $h = a \\sin(\\angle B)$\n- $h = 2024 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\n- Since $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have:\n- $h = 2024 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1012$.\n\nNow we can state the inequality for $b$ (the length of side $AC$) that results in two possible values for side $AB$.\n- $h < b < a$\n- $1012 < b < 2024$\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Integer Values**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer values* of $AC$ (which is $b$) that satisfy this condition. So we need to count the integers in the interval $(1012, 2024)$.\n\n- The smallest integer value greater than 1012 is 1013.\n- The largest integer value less than 2024 is 2023.\n\nSo we need to count the number of integers from 1013 to 2023, inclusive.\n- Number of integers = (Last Value - First Value) + 1\n- Number of integers = $(2023 - 1013) + 1$\n- Number of integers = $1010 + 1$\n- Number of integers = $1011$\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThere are 1011 integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which two different triangles can be formed, meaning there are two possible lengths for side $AB$.\n\n<<<1011>>>"
