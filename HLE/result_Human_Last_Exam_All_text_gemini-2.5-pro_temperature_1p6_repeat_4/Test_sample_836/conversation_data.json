    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In physics, a pair correlation function, g(r, r'), describes the probability of finding a particle at position r' given a particle is at position r. A \"generalized\" or \"time-dependent\" pair correlation function, often denoted G(r, r', t, t'), extends this concept to include time. It describes the correlation between finding a particle at (r, t) and another at (r', t'). In the context of nuclear criticality, the \"particles\" are neutrons. Assuming a stationary and homogeneous medium (like the steady-state operation of a large reactor), this function depends only on the separations `Δr = r - r'` and `Δt = t - t'`. We can write it as G(Δr, Δt). This function is also known as the **van Hove correlation function**.\n    *   **Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform:** This is a mathematical operation that transforms a function from the space-time domain `(Δr, Δt)` to the frequency domain `(k, ω)`. The variable `k` is the wavevector (spatial frequency), and `ω` is the angular frequency (temporal frequency). The transformation is defined as:\n        `S(k, ω) = ∫∫ G(Δr, Δt) * exp[-i(k ⋅ Δr - ωΔt)] d(Δr) d(Δt)`\n\n2.  **Physical Interpretation of the Transformed Function:**\n    *   According to the **Wiener-Khinchin theorem**, the Fourier transform of a correlation function yields the power spectral density (PSD).\n    *   Therefore, the resulting function `S(k, ω)` is the **Power Spectral Density** of the fluctuations in the neutron population.\n    *   Specifically, it describes how the \"power\" or variance of the neutron noise is distributed across different spatial modes (characterized by `k`) and temporal frequencies (characterized by `ω`). A peak in `S(k, ω)` would indicate strong correlations for neutrons behaving as a wave with wavevector `k` and oscillating with frequency `ω`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Common Name in the Nuclear Community:**\n    *   While \"space-dependent power spectral density\" or \"neutron noise power spectrum\" are descriptive and correct terms, there is a more formal and specific name for this exact mathematical object.\n    *   In the broader field of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics (which provides the theoretical foundation for neutron noise analysis), the space-time Fourier transform of the van Hove correlation function `G(Δr, Δt)` is, by definition, called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, denoted `S(k, ω)`.\n    *   This name is highly descriptive:\n        *   **Structure Factor:** Refers to the `k`-dependence, which reveals information about the spatial structure of correlations.\n        *   **Dynamic:** Refers to the `ω`-dependence, which reveals the time-evolution or dynamics of these correlations.\n    *   This terminology is used in the foundational theoretical literature of reactor noise and neutron transport by authors like M.M.R. Williams and A.Z. Akcasu, who connected the principles of statistical mechanics to the behavior of neutrons in a reactor. While a plant operator might simply talk about the \"noise spectrum,\" a physicist or theorist in the criticality community would recognize `S(k, ω)` by this formal name.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correlation Function vs. Power Spectrum:** The question asks for the name of the *transform*, not the original function. The original function is the generalized pair correlation function; its transform is the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n*   **Name of Function vs. Name of Theory:** The theory used to calculate `S(k, ω)` is often the **Langevin method** or **Schottky formalism**. The famous **Schottky formula** provides an expression for the power spectrum, particularly its source term, but it is not the name of the function `S(k, ω)` itself.\n*   **Specificity:** \"Power Spectral Density\" is a general category of function. \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is the specific name for the power spectral density that is resolved in *both* wavevector and frequency. Given the precise definition in the question (a double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function), this is the most accurate and formal answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is formally and commonly known in the relevant scientific literature as the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
