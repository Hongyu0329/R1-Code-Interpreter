    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core subject of the question.**\nThe question is about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, who served as the President of Nigeria. It asks for a specific year when he publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the full name of the individual.**\nThe full and official name of the former Nigerian President is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His first name is Goodluck, his middle name is Ebele, and his surname is Jonathan.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\" in relation to Goodluck Jonathan.**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria and a highly respected figure in the country's history. The name is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's registered or commonly used name.\n\n**Step 4: Search for evidence of a name change or public identification.**\nA thorough review of official records, reputable news archives (such as the BBC, Reuters, Associated Press), and his official biography shows no instance of Goodluck Jonathan adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name, either officially or unofficially. There is no record of him publicly identifying himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the available evidence.**\nThe premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Jonathan has never publicly identified himself by the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own name. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that never occurred.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between a person's actual name and a potential nickname, honorific, or comparison. While politicians are sometimes compared to past leaders (e.g., someone might have called Jonathan \"the new Azikiwe\"), this is entirely different from him adopting the name himself.\n*   The middle name is a point of potential confusion. Goodluck Jonathan's middle name is **Ebele**, not Azikiwe.\n*   The question assumes a fact that is not true. The most accurate analysis is to point out this factual error.\n\nBased on this analysis, the event described in the question never happened.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His middle name is Ebele, and the premise of the question is incorrect as this event never occurred."
