    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n    *   The parent structure is benzamide: a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group.\n    *   The nitrogen of the amide group is substituted with two ethyl groups (`-N(Et)₂`), making it N,N-diethyl.\n    *   The benzene ring has a dimethylamino group (`-N(Me)₂`) at position 3 (meta to the amide group).\n    *   The structure has two key functional groups on the aromatic ring: the `N,N-diethylcarboxamide` group (`-CON(Et)₂`) at C1 and the `dimethylamino` group (`-N(Me)₂`) at C3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step: Deprotonation with sec-BuLi and TMEDA.**\n    *   `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium) is a very strong organometallic base.\n    *   `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity and reactivity of sec-BuLi.\n    *   This combination of reagents is classic for a reaction called **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on an aromatic ring directs the strong base to remove a proton from an adjacent (ortho) position, forming an aryllithium species.\n    *   We need to identify the most acidic proton on the benzene ring. Both the `-CON(Et)₂` and `-N(Me)₂` groups are directing groups for ortho-metalation.\n    *   **Directing effects:**\n        *   The amide group (`-CON(Et)₂`) at C1 is a very powerful directing group. It directs the lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n        *   The dimethylamino group (`-N(Me)₂`) at C3 is also a directing group, but it is less powerful than the amide group. It directs the lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n    *   **Synergy of directing groups:** The position at C2 is ortho to *both* the powerful amide director and the dimethylamino director. This cooperative effect makes the proton at C2 significantly more acidic than any other proton on the ring. The deprotonation will overwhelmingly occur at this site.\n    *   The intermediate formed is **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step: Reaction with Methyl Iodide.**\n    *   `CH₃I` (methyl iodide) is an electrophile. The carbon atom in the methyl group is electron-deficient and susceptible to attack by a nucleophile.\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile, with the negative charge and electron density concentrated on the C2 carbon atom (effectively a carbanion).\n    *   The carbanion at C2 will attack the methyl group of `CH₃I` in an S_N2-type reaction.\n    *   The iodide ion (`I⁻`) is an excellent leaving group.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The reaction replaces the lithium atom at C2 with a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n    *   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, we add a methyl group at the C2 position.\n    *   The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Recognize that sec-BuLi/TMEDA is used for deprotonation (metalation), not nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl, especially at low temperatures.\n*   Identify all directing groups present on the aromatic ring (`-CON(Et)₂` and `-N(Me)₂`).\n*   Evaluate the relative strength of the directing groups. The tertiary amide (`-CONR₂`) is a much stronger directing group than the tertiary amine (`-NR₂`).\n*   Identify the most acidic proton by considering the synergistic effect of the two directing groups. The proton at C2 is ortho to both groups and is therefore the most favored site for deprotonation.\n*   Recognize that the resulting aryllithium is a strong nucleophile that will react with the electrophile (methyl iodide) to form a new C-C bond.\n\nFinal Answer Structure:\n```\n      C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂\n     /\n  C1--C2(CH₃)\n /     \\\nC6H     C3--N(CH₃)₂\n \\     /\n C5H--C4H\n```\nThe final compound is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
