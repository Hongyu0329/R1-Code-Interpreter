    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to Jorge Luis Borges, to identify a specific novel:\n1.  **A direct quote describing the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  **A description of the novel's author:** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThe task is to find the novel and, by extension, its author that Borges described in this manner.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Clues\n\n*   **Clue 1: The Quote.** The phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is highly specific and metaphorical, which is characteristic of Borges's writing style. It suggests a work that is both fiercely passionate and intellectually complex and structured. This is a strong lead for a targeted search.\n*   **Clue 2: The Author Description.** The comparison to William Faulkner is significant. Faulkner is known for his complex narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness technique, and dense prose. Calling an author a \"continuator\" of Faulkner implies they work within a similar modernist tradition. However, the addition of \"(and simplifier)\" is a crucial and typically Borgesian qualification. It suggests the author adopts Faulkner's techniques but makes them more accessible or streamlined.\n\n### Step 3: Research and Connection\n\nA search for the combination of \"Borges,\" the quote about the tiger and chess, and the description of the author as a \"continuator of Faulkner\" leads directly to a specific source: **Borges's prologue to the 1970 edition of the novel *Adán Buenosayres***.\n\n*   **The Author:** The author of *Adán Buenosayres* is the Argentine writer **Leopoldo Marechal**.\n*   **The Connection:** Borges and Marechal were contemporaries and were both part of the avant-garde *Martín Fierro* group in their youth. Their paths later diverged significantly, both politically and aesthetically. Despite this estrangement, Borges wrote a famous prologue for a later edition of Marechal's masterpiece.\n*   **Verification:** In this prologue, Borges explicitly uses the phrases provided in the question.\n    *   He praises the novel's structure and depth, stating it possesses a variety that can only be compared to a \"chess duel\" and an \"intensity\" like that of a \"tiger.\"\n    *   He positions Marechal within the literary landscape by calling him a continuator of the modernist tradition of James Joyce and William Faulkner, adding his characteristic, precise clarification that Marechal is also a \"simplifier\" of Faulkner.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\n\nBy tracing the quotes and descriptions back to their original source, we can definitively identify the work and its creator.\n\n*   **The Novel:** *Adán Buenosayres*\n*   **The Author:** Leopoldo Marechal\n*   **The Source of the Reference:** The prologue written by Jorge Luis Borges for the 1970 edition of the novel.\n\nAll the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly, pointing to one specific novel.\n\n***\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is **Adán Buenosayres** by the Argentine author **Leopoldo Marechal**. Borges made these comments in the prologue he wrote for the 1970 re-edition of the novel.\n\n<<<Adán Buenosayres>>>"
