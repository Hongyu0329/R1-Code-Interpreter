    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify and find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the right-hand side of the equation as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x)=0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the linearization method, which involves checking the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at $x^*$, i.e., $f'(x^*)$.\n\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method, such as a phase line analysis.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of $x=1$ using a phase line analysis**\n\nSince the derivative test was inconclusive for $x=1$, we must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the regions immediately surrounding $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x \\in (0, 1)$):**\n    In this case, $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. Therefore, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ will be negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving *away* from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x > 1$):**\n    In this case, $x > 0$ and $(x-1)^2 > 0$. Again, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ will be negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ will decrease, moving *towards* $x=1$.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, solutions on *both* sides must approach it. Since solutions starting just to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nFrom our analysis, we have found that:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable (and therefore not stable) equilibrium point.\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the number of stable equilibrium points. Therefore, we have:\n$m = 1$.\n\n**A careful point on wording:** The phrase \"$m$ is a number of stable equilibrium\" is interpreted to mean $m$ is the count of the stable equilibrium points. This is standard in mathematical problems.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value**\n\nThe question asks us to find the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ we found:\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\nThis is the final result.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
