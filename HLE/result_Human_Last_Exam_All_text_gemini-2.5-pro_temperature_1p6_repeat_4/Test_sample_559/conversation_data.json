    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Phase Plane Equation**\n\nWe are given the system of differential equations:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nTo analyze the phase plane, we consider the relationship between $d$ and $u$ by computing $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2} $$\nWe are interested in the region where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u = 0:**\n    The equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow d=0$.\n    So, an equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case u = 1:**\n    The equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**3. Linearize the System to Classify Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$u' = u^3 - u^2$\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so (1, 0) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):** $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (7)(-1)+4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. One positive and one negative eigenvalue mean (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic fixed point.\n\n**4. Identify the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at (1, -1).\n\nLet's find the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). This manifold is a trajectory that leaves the saddle point.\nThe phase plane equation is a Riccati equation for $d(u)$. We can search for simple particular solutions, such as polynomials. Let's test if a parabola of the form $d=au^2+bu+c$ can be a solution. Given the equilibrium points, let's try a simple form like $d=cu^2$.\n\nLet's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$.\nWe need to check if it satisfies the differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$.\n\n*   **LHS (Left Hand Side):**\n    $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n\n*   **RHS (Right Hand Side):**\n    Substitute $d = -u^2$ into the expression:\n    Numerator = $2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n    $= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n    $= -2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^3(u-1)$.\n    Denominator = $u^3 - u^2 = u^2(u-1)$.\n    RHS = $\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\n**5. Confirm the Curve is a Separatrix**\n\nLet's check if this curve is indeed the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n1.  **Does it pass through the saddle point?**\n    At $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, the curve passes through (1, -1).\n2.  **Does it have the correct tangent at the saddle point?**\n    The slope of the tangent to the curve is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1) = -2$.\n    Now let's find the slope of the unstable manifold from the linearization at (1,-1). The Jacobian is $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$. The eigenvector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix}$ satisfies $(J - \\lambda I)v = 0$:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives the equation $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, which simplifies to $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope is $v_d/v_u = -2$.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point (1, -1) and has the same tangent as the unstable manifold at that point. Since there is a unique trajectory with this property, $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nAn unstable manifold of a saddle point is, by definition, a separatrix. It divides the phase plane. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will follow a different fate than those on the other side. Specifically, for $0 < u < 1$, trajectories starting below this curve will go to $d \\to -\\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$ (i.e., as $u \\to 0$), while trajectories starting above it will approach the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is given by the equation $d = -u^2$."
