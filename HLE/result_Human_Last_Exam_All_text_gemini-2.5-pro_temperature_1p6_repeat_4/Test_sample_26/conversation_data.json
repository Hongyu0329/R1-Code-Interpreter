    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its basic topological properties**\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is the zero set of a single non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   $X$ is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 2.\n*   As a real manifold, $X$ is compact, orientable, and has real dimension 4.\n\nWe use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which relates the topology of a complex submanifold to that of the ambient projective space. For a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$.\nIn our case, $n=3$, so the theorem applies for $k < 2$.\n*   **Connectivity:** For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since complex projective spaces are simply connected, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$. Thus, $\\pi_1(X)=0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n*   **Second Homotopy Group:** Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz Theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The Lefschetz theorem on homology states that $H_k(X) \\cong H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k<n-1=2$. A stronger version establishes that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is generated by the class of a hyperplane section of $X$. Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to homology**\nFor a simply connected space like $X$, the Hurewicz Theorem provides an exact sequence that relates the third homotopy group to the third homology group:\n$$ \\pi_2(X) \\otimes \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\Gamma} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{h_3} H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0 $$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Whitehead product map and $h_3$ is the Hurewicz homomorphism, which is surjective.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the third homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\nSince $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable 4-manifold, we can use PoincarÃ© Duality:\n$$ H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{4-3}(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nBy the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology:\n$$ H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Ext}^1_\\mathbb{Z}(H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) $$\nWe know $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ (since $\\pi_1(X)=0$) and $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (since $X$ is connected). The Ext term $\\text{Ext}^1_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$ is zero. Thus:\n$$ H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus 0 = 0 $$\nTherefore, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the algebraic structure of $\\pi_3(X)$**\nSubstituting $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$ and $\\pi_2(X)\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$ into the Hurewicz sequence from Step 2, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\Gamma} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nSince $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, this sequence implies that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Any quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$).\n\n**Step 5: Use the long exact sequence of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$**\nThe long exact sequence in homotopy for the pair $( \\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ gives a relationship between their homotopy groups. A segment of this sequence is:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\dots $$\nThe relative homotopy group can be identified using a result related to the Thom Isomorphism, which states that $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\pi_{k-1}(S(N))$, where $S(N)$ is the unit sphere bundle of the normal bundle $N$ of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. For $k=3$, the sequence becomes:\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(S(N)) $$\n\n**Step 6: Compute $\\pi_2(S(N))$**\nThe normal bundle $N$ to the quintic hypersurface $X$ is the restriction of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(5)$ to $X$. Thus, $S(N)$ is the total space of an $S^1$-bundle over $X$. The Gysin sequence for homotopy groups of this bundle provides the following segment:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_2(S^1) \\to \\pi_2(S(N)) \\to \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{d_*} \\pi_1(S^1) \\to \\dots $$\nWe have the following known groups: $\\pi_2(S^1)=0$, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The map $d_*$ is given by multiplication by the degree of the hypersurface, which is 5. So the sequence is:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_2(S(N)) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 5} \\mathbb{Z} $$\nExactness of this sequence at the central $\\mathbb{Z}$ term implies that the image of the map from $\\pi_2(S(N))$ is equal to the kernel of the \"multiplication by 5\" map. Since the kernel of $\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 5} \\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\{0\\}$, the map $\\pi_2(S(N)) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ must be the zero map. Since this map is also injective (from the start of the sequence segment), we must have $\\pi_2(S(N))=0$.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the calculation**\nFrom Step 5, we have the sequence $\\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(S(N))$. Since $\\pi_2(S(N))=0$, this implies that the map $i_*: \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is a surjection.\nThe homotopy group $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This can be derived from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\to S^7 \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\nSo, we have shown:\n1.  $\\pi_3(X)$ is a cyclic group (Step 4).\n2.  There is a surjective group homomorphism from $\\pi_3(X)$ onto $\\mathbb{Z}$ (Step 7).\n\nA cyclic group can only have $\\mathbb{Z}$ as a quotient if it is $\\mathbb{Z}$ itself. (A finite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ cannot surject onto an infinite group).\nTherefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the size of the largest set of linearly independent elements of infinite order. For $\\mathbb{Z}$, the rank is 1."
