    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nFirst, we need to break down the question into its key components to ensure a precise answer.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Role and Act:** Kitri, Act I variation (her first solo)\n*   **Specific Step:** \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\"\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the Specific Ballet Step**\nThis is the most critical point. A \"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is a highly specific ballet technique.\n*   **Preparation:** The dancer starts in the fifth position, performs a plié (bends the knees).\n*   **Turn:** Pushes off from both feet to relevé onto one supporting leg, while the other leg comes to a retiré position (toe pointed at the knee). The turn is *en dehors*, meaning \"outward,\" away from the supporting leg.\n*   **Turns specified:** The question asks for *single-turn* pirouettes of this type.\n\nIt is crucial not to confuse this step with other common turns in ballet:\n*   **Fouetté turns:** The dancer turns on the spot repeatedly, using a whipping motion of the gesture leg to propel the turn. The preparation is different.\n*   **Piqué turns:** These are traveling turns where the dancer steps directly onto a straight supporting leg on pointe. The preparation is not a two-footed plié in fifth position.\n*   **Chaîné turns:** A series of rapid half-turns performed while traveling.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\nKitri's variation in Act I of Don Quixote (choreography by Marius Petipa/Alexander Gorsky) is famous for its technical difficulty, speed, and flair. We need to analyze its structure, particularly its turning sections. This variation typically includes:\n1.  An opening section with jumps and balances.\n2.  A diagonal sequence of turns.\n3.  A final coda with fast, stationary turns or turns traveling in a circle (a manège).\n\n**Step 4: Examining Natalia Osipova's Performance**\nTo answer accurately, we must analyze how Natalia Osipova performed this specific choreography during her time at the Bolshoi Ballet (around 2008-2011). Recordings of her in this role, such as the widely available 2011 Bolshoi cinema broadcast, show her interpretation. The core choreography for a role in a major company remains consistent from year to year.\n*   **The Diagonal Sequence:** In Osipova's performance, as in the standard choreography, the famous turning diagonal is composed of traveling **piqué turns** in attitude. She does not perform pirouettes from the fifth position in this sequence.\n*   **The Coda and Other Sections:** The end of the variation consists of a series of very fast turns, which are either piqué turns in a circle (manège) or other virtuoso turns, but again, not pirouettes prepared from the fifth position. Reviewing the entire variation, from start to finish, reveals transitional steps but no featured sequence or even individual instances of single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe question asks for a count of a very specific technical step. A careful review of the standard choreography for Kitri's Act I variation, and specifically Natalia Osipova's execution of it, shows that this variation is characterized by other types of turns (primarily piqué turns). The \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is not a choreographic element of this particular solo. Therefore, the number of times she performs this specific step is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
