1. True. Spatially separated events that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first.
2. True. The length of a moving object is measured to be different from its proper length. Specifically, it undergoes length expansion.
3. True. The time interval between events on a moving clock is measured to be different from the proper time. Specifically, it undergoes time contraction (moving clocks run faster).
4. False. The speed of light is not invariant in this theory. An object moving at speed c in one frame will have a different speed in another frame.
5. True. Velocities add according to a non-Newtonian formula.
6. The formula for the relativity of lengths is $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}$, where $L$ is the measured length, $L_0$ is the proper length, and $v$ is the relative velocity.
7. The formula for the relativity of time is $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}}$, where $\Delta t$ is the measured time interval and $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval.
8. The formula for the addition of speeds (for motion along the x-axis) is $u'_x = \frac{u_x-v}{1+u_x v/c^2}$, where $u_x$ is the object's velocity in frame S and $u'_x$ is its velocity in frame S'.
