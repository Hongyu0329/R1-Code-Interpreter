    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the defining parameters:**\n    *   The problem describes a hypersurface in a 5-dimensional complex space $\\mathbb{C}^5$, which corresponds to a 4-dimensional weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n    *   The variables are $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5$.\n    *   The weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   A polynomial equation is given: $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial:**\n    A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous of degree $d$ if every monomial has the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1} z_2^{a_2} z_3^{a_3} z_4^{a_4} z_5^{a_5}$ is $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i$.\n    Let's calculate the degree for each monomial in the given polynomial:\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1(22) + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\n    **Careful Point 1:** The polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous as given, because one monomial has degree 224 while the others have degree 225. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. The invariant relies on the polynomial being quasi-homogeneous. We will proceed by assuming the intended degree is $d=225$.\n\n3.  **Check the Calabi-Yau Condition:**\n    For a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$, the Calabi-Yau condition is that the degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights $\\sum w_i$.\n    *   $\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Since $\\sum w_i = 225$, our assumed degree $d=225$ satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition. This strongly suggests that $d=225$ is correct.\n\n4.  **Check for Isolated Singularity:**\n    The formulas for the invariants are valid for isolated singularities. An isolated singularity is one where the system of partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_i} = 0$ for all $i$ has only the origin $(0,0,0,0,0)$ as a solution.\n    *   The given polynomial $f$ does not have a pure power term for $z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4$. A detailed check reveals that the singularity defined by this specific polynomial is not isolated at the origin.\n\n    **Careful Point 2:** The specific polynomial given has a non-isolated singularity. However, the Crawley-Nordström invariant in this context is a topological invariant of the resulting manifold, which for a generic polynomial with these weights and degree, would be well-defined. The invariant depends only on the weights and the degree, not the specific choice of (generic) polynomial coefficients. Therefore, we can proceed with the calculation based on the weights and the degree.\n\n5.  **Identify the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    For a Sasakian-Einstein 7-manifold given by the link of an isolated quasi-homogeneous singularity satisfying the Calabi-Yau condition, the Crawley-Nordström invariant $\\nu$ is given by:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{\\mu - \\sigma}{4} - 1$\n    where $\\mu$ is the Milnor number of the singularity and $\\sigma$ is the signature of the Milnor fiber.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Milnor Number ($\\mu$):**\n    For a generic isolated quasi-homogeneous singularity, the Milnor number is given by the formula:\n    $\\mu = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^5 (d - w_i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^5 w_i}$\n    *   $d - w_1 = 225 - 22 = 203 = 7 \\times 29$\n    *   $d - w_2 = 225 - 29 = 196 = 4 \\times 49 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$\n    *   $d - w_3 = 225 - 49 = 176 = 16 \\times 11 = 2^4 \\times 11$\n    *   $d - w_4 = 225 - 50 = 175 = 7 \\times 25 = 7 \\times 5^2$\n    *   $d - w_5 = 225 - 75 = 150 = 2 \\times 75 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$\n    *   The numerator is $\\prod (d - w_i) = (7 \\cdot 29) \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 7^2) \\cdot (2^4 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (7 \\cdot 5^2) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2) = 2^7 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 29^1$.\n    *   The denominator is $\\prod w_i = (22) \\cdot (29) \\cdot (49) \\cdot (50) \\cdot (75) = (2 \\cdot 11) \\cdot (29) \\cdot (7^2) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 5^2) \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5^2) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 29^1$.\n    *   $\\mu = \\frac{2^7 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 29^1}{2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 29^1} = 2^{7-2} \\cdot 7^{4-2} = 2^5 \\cdot 7^2 = 32 \\cdot 49 = 1568$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Signature ($\\sigma$):**\n    The signature of the Milnor fiber is given by the formula:\n    $\\sigma = \\sum_{k=1}^{d-1} (-1)^{n_k}$, where $n_k = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\mathbb{I}(d_i | k)$ and $d_i = \\frac{d}{\\text{gcd}(d, w_i)}$.\n    *   $d = 225 = 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$.\n    *   $d_1 = d/\\text{gcd}(225, 22) = 225/1 = 225$.\n    *   $d_2 = d/\\text{gcd}(225, 29) = 225/1 = 225$.\n    *   $d_3 = d/\\text{gcd}(225, 49) = 225/1 = 225$.\n    *   $d_4 = d/\\text{gcd}(225, 50) = 225/25 = 9$.\n    *   $d_5 = d/\\text{gcd}(225, 75) = 225/75 = 3$.\n    *   For $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 224\\}$, the condition $225|k$ is never met. So we only need to consider $d_4=9$ and $d_5=3$.\n    *   $n_k = \\mathbb{I}(9|k) + \\mathbb{I}(3|k)$.\n    *   Case 1: $k$ is not a multiple of 3. Then $n_k = 0$ and $(-1)^{n_k}=1$.\n    *   Case 2: $k$ is a multiple of 3 but not 9. Then $n_k = 1$ and $(-1)^{n_k}=-1$.\n    *   Case 3: $k$ is a multiple of 9. Then $k$ is also a multiple of 3, so $n_k=1+1=2$, and $(-1)^{n_k}=1$.\n    *   We sum from $k=1$ to $224$:\n        *   Number of integers not divisible by 3: $224 - \\lfloor\\frac{224}{3}\\rfloor = 224 - 74 = 150$. Contribution to sum: $150 \\times (+1)$.\n        *   Number of integers divisible by 3 but not 9: $\\lfloor\\frac{224}{3}\\rfloor - \\lfloor\\frac{224}{9}\\rfloor = 74 - 24 = 50$. Contribution to sum: $50 \\times (-1)$.\n        *   Number of integers divisible by 9: $\\lfloor\\frac{224}{9}\\rfloor = 24$. Contribution to sum: $24 \\times (+1)$.\n    *   $\\sigma = 150 - 50 + 24 = 124$.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Invariant:**\n    *   $\\mu = 1568$\n    *   $\\sigma = 124$\n    *   $\\nu = \\frac{\\mu - \\sigma}{4} - 1 = \\frac{1568 - 124}{4} - 1$.\n    *   $\\nu = \\frac{1444}{4} - 1$.\n    *   $\\nu = 361 - 1 = 360$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 360.\n\n<<<360>>>"
