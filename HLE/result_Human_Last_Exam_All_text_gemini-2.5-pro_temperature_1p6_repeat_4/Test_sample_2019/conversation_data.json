    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A \"way\" refers to a distinct set of 4 squares on the board.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and from left to right. If we label the squares by coordinates (r, c) with r, c in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, then all arithmetic involving coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   **Non-attacking Queens:** Two queens are non-attacking if they are not in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this means for any two queens at positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), the following conditions must hold:\n    1.  `r1 ≠ r2`\n    2.  `c1 ≠ c2`\n    3.  `r1 + c1 ≢ r2 + c2 (mod 5)` (sum-diagonal)\n    4.  `r1 - c1 ≢ r2 - c2 (mod 5)` (difference-diagonal)\n\nThis means if we place 4 queens at positions `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`, the four values `r_i` must be distinct, the four values `c_i` must be distinct, the four values `r_i + c_i (mod 5)` must be distinct, and the four values `r_i - c_i (mod 5)` must be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nA direct brute-force counting of 4-queen placements would be extremely complicated. A more elegant method is to relate this problem to the simpler problem of placing 5 queens on the same board. This is possible due to a mathematical property of toroidal boards of size `n x n` where `n` is an odd number (a so-called \"completion theorem\").\n\nLet's assume we have a valid placement of 4 queens. Let the set of coordinates be `Q = {(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}`.\n*   There are 4 distinct rows used. Let the unused row be `r_u`.\n*   There are 4 distinct columns used. Let the unused column be `c_u`.\n*   There are 4 distinct sum-diagonals used. Let the unused sum-diagonal value be `s_u`.\n*   There are 4 distinct difference-diagonals used. Let the unused difference-diagonal value be `d_u`.\n\nWe can attempt to place a 5th queen at the currently unoccupied intersection `(r_u, c_u)`. For this to be a valid addition, it must not attack any of the 4 queens already on the board. The row and column constraints are met by definition. We need to check the diagonal constraints. This requires showing that `r_u + c_u ≡ s_u (mod 5)` and `r_u - c_u ≡ d_u (mod 5)`.\n\nThis can be proven using modular arithmetic. For any odd `n`, the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1` is `n(n-1)/2`, which is a multiple of `n`. Therefore, `Σ(i=0 to n-1) i ≡ 0 (mod n)`. For n=5, we have `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\nLet the sets of all rows, columns, sum-diagonals, and diff-diagonals be `R_all`, `C_all`, `S_all`, `D_all`. The sum of elements in each of these sets is 0 (mod 5).\nThe sum of the 4 used rows is `Σ(r_i) = Σ(R_all) - r_u = 0 - r_u ≡ -r_u (mod 5)`.\nSimilarly, `Σ(c_i) ≡ -c_u (mod 5)`.\n\nFor the sum-diagonals:\n`Σ(r_i + c_i) = Σ(r_i) + Σ(c_i) ≡ -r_u - c_u (mod 5)`.\nAlso, the sum of the 4 used sum-diagonal values is `Σ(S_all) - s_u ≡ -s_u (mod 5)`.\nEquating these gives `-r_u - c_u ≡ -s_u (mod 5)`, or `r_u + c_u ≡ s_u (mod 5)`.\n\nFor the difference-diagonals:\n`Σ(r_i - c_i) = Σ(r_i) - Σ(c_i) ≡ -r_u - (-c_u) = c_u - r_u (mod 5)`.\nAlso, `Σ(D_all) - d_u ≡ -d_u (mod 5)`.\nEquating these gives `c_u - r_u ≡ -d_u (mod 5)`, or `r_u - c_u ≡ d_u (mod 5)`.\n\nThis proves that the 5th queen at `(r_u, c_u)` occupies exactly the unused diagonals, thus creating a valid 5-queen placement. This implies that **every valid 4-queen placement can be uniquely extended to a valid 5-queen placement.**\n\n### Step 3: Use the Bijection\n\nThis \"completion theorem\" establishes a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between:\n1.  The set of all valid 4-queen placements.\n2.  The set of all pairs `(T, q)`, where `T` is a valid 5-queen placement and `q` is one of the 5 queens in that placement.\n\nTo find the number of 4-queen placements, we can simply count the size of the second set. This means we need to find the total number of 5-queen placements (`T_5`) and then multiply it by the number of ways to choose one queen to remove (`C(5, 1) = 5`).\n\nNumber of 4-queen placements = `T_5 × 5`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Number of 5-Queen Placements (T_5)\n\nThe number of ways to place `n` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board is a well-studied problem. For `n=5`, all solutions are known to be \"affine,\" meaning they can be described by linear equations. The fundamental solutions are of the form `c ≡ ar + b (mod 5)`, where `a` must be chosen from `{2, 3}`.\n*   For `a=2`, we have 5 solutions of the form `c ≡ 2r + b (mod 5)` for `b` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   For `a=3`, we have 5 solutions of the form `c ≡ 3r + b (mod 5)` for `b` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nThese 10 sets of 5 coordinates are all distinct. For example, `{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}` is one solution. Mathematical literature and online encyclopedias (like the OEIS) confirm that the total number of 5-queen placements on a 5x5 torus is exactly 10.\nSo, `T_5 = 10`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\nNumber of 4-queen placements = `T_5 × 5`\nNumber of 4-queen placements = `10 × 5 = 50`.\n\nEach of the 10 distinct 5-queen solutions gives rise to 5 distinct 4-queen solutions by removing one queen at a time. Because the extension from a 4-queen solution to a 5-queen solution is unique, none of these 50 resulting configurations overlap."
