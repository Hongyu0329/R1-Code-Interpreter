    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern.**\nFirst, let's try to find the difference between consecutive terms.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious arithmetic or geometric pattern in this sequence of differences. So, a simple addition pattern is unlikely.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern involving multiplication and addition/subtraction.**\nLet's examine the relationship between a term and the next one. A common pattern is `Next Term = (Previous Term * Constant) + another value`. Let's try using 2 as the constant multiplier, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n\n*   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   From 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 23`\n*   From 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 51`\n*   From 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 119`\n\nThe rule seems to be: `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + k_n`, where `k_n` is a sequence of added numbers.\nLet's analyze the sequence `k_n`. The pattern of operations starts from the second term (11).\nThe sequence of added numbers (`k`) is: 1, 5, 17.\nSo, to find the next number in the main sequence, we first need to find the next number in the sequence `k`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the secondary sequence `k`.**\nThe sequence `k` is: 1, 5, 17, ( ? )\nLet's find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are 4, 12.\n\n**Step 5: Find the pattern in the differences of the sequence `k`.**\nThe sequence of differences is 4, 12. We can see a clear geometric progression here. Each term is 3 times the previous term.\n*   4 * 3 = 12\nSo, the next difference should be:\n*   12 * 3 = 36\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the next term in the sequence `k`.**\nTo get the next term in sequence `k`, we add the next difference (36) to the last term of `k` (17).\n*   Next `k` term = 17 + 36 = 53\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final missing number in the original sequence.**\nNow we can use the rule `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + k_n` with the new `k` value we found.\nThe last given number in the main sequence is 119. We need to find the number after it.\n*   Next Term = (2 * 119) + 53\n*   Next Term = 238 + 53\n*   Next Term = 291\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer**\nThe missing number in the sequence is 291. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
