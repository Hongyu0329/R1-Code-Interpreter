    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. A unary predicate $P_i$ can be applied to a single element of the domain, e.g., $P_i(x)$.\n2.  **Logical Connectives**: The allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   $\\exists$: Existential quantification.\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for True and False.\n    *   Atomic formulas from the schema $S$, which are of the form $P_i(v)$ for a variable $v$.\n3.  **Formulas as Classifiers**: We are interested in the VC dimension of the set of classifiers defined by formulas in this language. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with exactly one free variable, $x$, acts as a classifier on a domain $U$. An element $a \\in U$ is classified as positive if the structure satisfies $\\phi(a)$, and negative otherwise. The set of positive elements is $\\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n4.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension of a set of classifiers (a hypothesis space) is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the classifiers. A set $X$ is shattered if, for every possible labeling of points in $X$ as positive or negative, there is a classifier in the space that produces that exact labeling.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Formulas\n\nLet's analyze the general structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n1.  A formula in this language is built from atomic formulas $P_i(v)$ using only $\\land$ and $\\exists$. Any such formula $\\phi(x)$ is logically equivalent to one in prenex normal form: $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\exists y_m \\Psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\Psi$ is a quantifier-free formula.\n2.  Since the only available quantifier-free connective is $\\land$, the formula $\\Psi$ must be a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n3.  Because the predicates are unary, each atomic formula involves only one variable. So, we can group the atomic formulas in the conjunction based on the variable they contain.\n    $\\Psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_0} P_j(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_1} P_j(y_1) \\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_m} P_j(y_m) \\right)$.\n4.  The formula $\\phi(x)$ is $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\left[ \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_0} P_j(x) \\right) \\land \\dots \\right]$.\n5.  We can use the logical equivalence $\\exists z (\\alpha \\land \\beta) \\equiv \\alpha \\land (\\exists z \\beta)$, if the variable $z$ is not free in $\\alpha$. We can apply this repeatedly to pull out the part of the formula that only involves $x$:\n    $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_0} P_j(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\left[ (\\bigwedge_{j \\in I_1} P_j(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\right] \\right)$.\n6.  This shows that any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic is equivalent to a formula of the form $\\psi(x) \\land \\theta$, where:\n    *   $\\psi(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula with the free variable $x$. Specifically, it is a conjunction of some subset of the atomic formulas $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$. Let's call this the \"quantifier-free fragment\".\n    *   $\\theta$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Problem to the Quantifier-Free Fragment\n\nThe VC dimension is the maximum size of a set that can be shattered, where the maximum is taken over all possible structures (domains and predicate interpretations).\n\n1.  For any given structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $\\theta$ is either true or false.\n2.  If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\theta$, the formula $\\psi(x) \\land \\theta$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (False) and defines the empty set.\n3.  If $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\theta$, the formula $\\psi(x) \\land \\theta$ is equivalent to $\\psi(x)$ and defines the same set as $\\psi(x)$.\n4.  This means that for any structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the set of subsets definable by the full logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is a subset of the sets definable by the quantifier-free fragment, plus the empty set.\n5.  The empty set is already definable in the quantifier-free fragment (e.g., by the formula $P_1(x)$ in a structure where no element satisfies $P_1$, or by $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$ in the structure we will construct in Step 4).\n6.  Therefore, the expressive power of the full logic in terms of defining subsets is no greater than that of its quantifier-free fragment. The VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is the same as the VC dimension of its quantifier-free fragment.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the VC Dimension of the Quantifier-Free Fragment\n\nThe problem now is to find the VC dimension of the set of classifiers defined by formulas of the form $\\psi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I} P_j(x)$, where $I$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThis hypothesis space is known as \"monotone conjunctions\" over 4 boolean features. The features of an element are the truth values of $P_1, \\dots, P_4$ for that element. The VC dimension of monotone conjunctions over $d$ variables is $d$. Here $d=4$.\n\n**To show VC dimension $\\ge 4$:**\n\nWe need to construct a set of 4 points and a structure where these points are shattered.\n*   Let the set to be shattered be $X = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$.\n*   Let's define the interpretation of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on this set. For $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let $P_j(c_i)$ be true if and only if $j \\neq i$.\n*   Let's consider an arbitrary subset $Y \\subseteq X$. We want to find a formula $\\psi_I(x)$ that is true for all elements in $Y$ and false for all elements in $X \\setminus Y$.\n*   Let $J_Y = \\{i \\mid c_i \\in Y\\}$ be the set of indices corresponding to the elements in $Y$.\n*   Choose the set of predicate indices for our formula to be $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J_Y$.\n*   Let's check which elements our formula $\\psi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I} P_j(x)$ selects. An element $c_k$ satisfies $\\psi_I(c_k)$ if and only if for all $j \\in I$, $P_j(c_k)$ is true. By our definition, this means for all $j \\in I$, $j \\neq k$. This is equivalent to $k \\notin I$.\n*   So, the set of selected elements is $\\{c_k \\mid k \\notin I\\}$. Since we chose $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J_Y$, the condition $k \\notin I$ is equivalent to $k \\in J_Y$.\n*   Thus, the formula selects exactly the set $\\{c_k \\mid k \\in J_Y\\}$, which is $Y$.\n*   Since we can find a formula for any subset $Y$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**To show VC dimension $\\le 4$:**\n\nWe can use a simple counting argument.\n*   The number of distinct hypotheses in our quantifier-free language is determined by the number of ways we can choose the subset of predicates to include in the conjunction.\n*   The set of indices $I$ can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The number of such subsets is $2^4 = 16$.\n*   So, there are at most 16 distinct formulas (classifiers) in our hypothesis space.\n*   To shatter a set of $k$ points, one must be able to realize all $2^k$ possible labelings of that set. Each labeling must correspond to a (potentially non-unique) classifier.\n*   The number of subsets we can define on a set of points is at most the number of available classifiers.\n*   So, to shatter a set of size $k$, we must satisfy $2^k \\le 16$.\n*   If we try to shatter a set of size $k=5$, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ different subsets. This is impossible as we have at most 16 classifiers.\n*   Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered, and the VC dimension must be less than 5.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have shown that the VC dimension is at least 4 and less than 5. Since the VC dimension is an integer, it must be exactly 4."
