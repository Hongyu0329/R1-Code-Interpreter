    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Historical Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad\n\nThe first step is to comb through Homer's epic poem, the Iliad, and list all the real-world, identifiable mountains that are mentioned. These mountains served as homes to the gods, vantage points, or geographical landmarks in the story.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous mountain in the epic, serving as the home of the Olympian gods. It is the highest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is located near the city of Troy (in modern-day Turkey). In the Iliad, Zeus often sits atop Mount Ida to watch the Trojan War unfold.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 when the goddess Hera travels from Olympus. She leaps from the peak of Athos towards the island of Lemnos. It is a prominent mountain on a peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the war from \"the loftiest peak of wooded Samothrace.\" Samothrace is an island in the northern Aegean Sea, and its highest point is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in the context of Achilles' famous ash spear, which was hewn from its summit. It is also mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships. It is located in Thessaly, Greece.\n*   **Mount Ossa:** This mountain is mentioned alongside Mount Pelion in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2). It is also located in Thessaly, near Pelion and Olympus.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Modern Elevations of These Mountains\n\nTo determine which is the tallest after Olympus, we need their current, accepted heights.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus (Mytikas peak):** ~2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** ~2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ossa (Kissavos):** ~1,978 meters (6,490 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** ~1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion (Pourianos Stavros peak):** ~1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** ~1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Heights and Determine the Second Tallest\n\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. We can now exclude Olympus from our list and rank the remaining mountains by their elevation.\n\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n2.  **Mount Ossa:** 1,978 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Distinguishing between mountains:** It is important to correctly identify the mountains. For example, the Mount Ida of the Iliad is the one near Troy, not the taller Mount Ida on Crete.\n*   **Verification in the text:** All mountains considered must be explicitly mentioned within the text of the Iliad itself, not just in broader Greek mythology. All mountains in this analysis are mentioned.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythical:** The question specifies \"historical\" mountains, meaning real, geographical locations, which all of these are.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter Mount Olympus (2,918 m), the next tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is Mount Athos, with an elevation of approximately 2,033 meters.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
