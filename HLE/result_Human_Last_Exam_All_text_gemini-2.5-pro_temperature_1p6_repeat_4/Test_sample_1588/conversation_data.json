    "The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the solution Z for $e^Z = e^X e^Y$ in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]] + \\dots$\n\nThe terms of order `n` in this expansion are homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree `n` in the variables X and Y. A Lie polynomial is a linear combination of nested commutators. The number of non-zero coefficients of order `n` is equal to the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree `n` in two variables. This quantity is precisely the dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, denoted as $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nTo find this dimension, we use Witt's formula.\n\n### Step 1: State Witt's Formula\nThe dimension of the n-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on k generators, denoted $l_k(n)$, is given by Witt's formula:\n$l_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the degree of the polynomials (the order).\n*   `k` is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Parameters for the Problem\nIn this problem, we are looking for the number of coefficients of order 10, so `n = 10`.\nThe expansion involves two non-commuting quantities, X and Y, so there are two generators, `k = 2`.\nWe need to calculate $l_2(10)$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Divisors of n = 10\nThe positive divisors of 10 are `d = 1, 2, 5, 10`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Möbius Function `μ(d)` for each Divisor\nThe Möbius function is defined based on the prime factorization of `d`:\n*   μ(d) = 1 if d is a square-free integer with an even number of prime factors.\n*   μ(d) = -1 if d is a square-free integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n*   μ(d) = 0 if d has a squared prime factor.\n\nLet's calculate `μ(d)` for the divisors of 10:\n*   **d = 1**: By definition, `μ(1) = 1`. (1 has 0 prime factors, and 0 is an even number).\n*   **d = 2**: 2 is a prime number (1 prime factor). It is square-free. `μ(2) = -1`.\n*   **d = 5**: 5 is a prime number (1 prime factor). It is square-free. `μ(5) = -1`.\n*   **d = 10**: The prime factorization is 10 = 2 × 5 (2 distinct prime factors). It is square-free. `μ(10) = (-1)^2 = 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Apply Witt's Formula\nNow we plug these values into Witt's formula for `n=10` and `k=2`:\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right]$\n\n### Step 6: Perform the Calculation\nSubstitute the values of `μ(d)` we found:\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right]$\n\nCalculate the powers of 2:\n*   $2^{10} = 1024$\n*   $2^5 = 32$\n*   $2^2 = 4$\n*   $2^1 = 2$\n\nSubstitute these results back into the equation:\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n\nPerform the arithmetic inside the brackets:\n$1024 - 32 = 992$\n$992 - 4 = 988$\n$988 + 2 = 990$\n\nFinally, divide by 10:\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{990}{10} = 99$\n\nThus, there are 99 linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10, which corresponds to 99 non-zero coefficients in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\n\n<<<99>>>"
