    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Name**\n\nThe name \"perfluoronanocar\" can be broken down into two parts to understand its structure:\n\n*   **\"perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in chemistry. It indicates that all of the hydrogen (H) atoms on the parent hydrocarbon structure have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n*   **\"nanocar\"**: This is the parent molecule. It is not a standard IUPAC name but a common name for a class of molecules synthesized to resemble a car at the nanoscale, complete with a chassis, axles, and wheels.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Structure and Formula of a Nanocar**\n\nSince \"nanocar\" is a common name for a class of molecules, we must identify a specific, representative structure. The most well-known nanocars were developed by the research group of Professor James M. Tour. One of the most prominent and widely publicized examples consists of:\n\n1.  **Chassis:** An organic framework that forms the \"body\" of the car. For a well-documented version of the nanocar, the chassis has the chemical formula **C₈₂H₆₈**.\n2.  **Wheels:** Four buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀) molecules attached to the chassis.\n\nThe full chemical formula of this specific nanocar is C₃₂₂H₆₈ (from C₈₂H₆₈ + 4 × C₆₀).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms to be Replaced**\n\nThe process of perfluorination replaces hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms. We need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms in the nanocar molecule.\n\n*   The chassis has the formula C₈₂**H₆₈**, which means it contains **68** hydrogen atoms.\n*   The wheels, being C₆₀ fullerenes, are composed entirely of carbon atoms and have no hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of replaceable hydrogen atoms in the entire nanocar molecule is **68**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms**\n\nThe \"perfluoro-\" prefix means that every single hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom. The substitution is a one-to-one exchange.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in the nanocar = 68\n*   Number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar = 68\n\nThus, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, based on this common structure, would have its C₈₂H₆₈ chassis converted to a C₈₂F₆₈ chassis.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** A \"perfluoronanocar\" is a fully fluorinated version of a common nanocar molecule.\n*   **Base Molecule:** We assume the nanocar structure with a C₈₂H₆₈ chassis and C₆₀ wheels.\n*   **Hydrogen Count:** The molecule has 68 hydrogen atoms, all on the chassis.\n*   **Substitution:** Perfluorination replaces all 68 hydrogen atoms with 68 fluorine atoms.\n*   **Result:** The final molecule contains 68 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<68>>>"
