The edges of the image are smoothed and rounded. The iterative process reduces the curvature of the boundaries, causing them to deform towards configurations of minimal length. As a result, sharp corners are rounded off, and the edges tend to become straight lines or, for closed shapes, large-radius circular arcs.
