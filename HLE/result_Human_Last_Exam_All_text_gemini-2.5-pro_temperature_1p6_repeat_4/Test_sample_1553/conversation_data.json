    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its main character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the distant, post-human future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the central relationship of the main character:** Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski's existence is immediately tied to a powerful, god-like being who brought him back. This being becomes his guide, protector, and partner in this new, incomprehensible reality.\n\n3.  **Identify the name of this partner:** The name of the post-human entity with whom Adam Zamoyski forms this deep, life-altering bond is Angelica.\n\n4.  **Interpret the term \"marries\":** In the context of the novel, the relationship between Adam and Angelica is not a traditional human marriage. The concepts of love, partnership, and identity are vastly different in the far future depicted by Dukaj. However, their union is the central, defining partnership of the story. Angelica essentially \"claims\" Adam, and he becomes her companion. Therefore, Angelica is the character who fits the description of the person the main character \"marries.\"\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **The Main Character:** It's crucial to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **The Nature of the \"Marriage\":** The term \"marriage\" is an anthropocentric simplification of the complex, symbiotic, and power-imbalanced relationship between a baseline human and a vastly superior post-human entity. Their bond transcends human concepts of marriage.\n*   **The Partner's Name:** The correct name of the entity is Angelica. She is the one who resurrects Adam and with whom he shares his new existence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a life-binding union with the post-human entity named Angelica.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
