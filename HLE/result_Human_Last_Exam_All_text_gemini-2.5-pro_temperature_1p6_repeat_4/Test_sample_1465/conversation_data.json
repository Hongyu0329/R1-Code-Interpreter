    "This question asks for the determination of the oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helical strands) of five different coiled-coil protein sequences. The oligomeric state is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The packing of side chains at these positions dictates the most stable structure.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each sequence:\n\n**1. General Approach:**\nFirst, we must identify the heptad repeat pattern for each sequence. These sequences are designed peptides and likely follow a standard `g-a-b-c-d-e-f` register, where the first listed residue is in the 'g' position, placing the critical hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. We will analyze the core 'a' and 'd' positions based on established principles from protein design studies.\n\n*   **Dimer (2-mer):** Often stabilized by Leucine (L) at 'd' positions (Leucine Zippers). Polar residues like Asparagine (N) at 'a' positions are very strong dimer determinants.\n*   **Trimer (3-mer):** Favored by Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) or Alanine (A) at 'd'. Polar residues like Threonine (T) or Glutamine (Q) in the core, combined with Isoleucine at 'a', also strongly promote trimers.\n*   **Tetramer (4-mer):** Characterized by Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Higher-order oligomers (5-mer, 7-mer):** Often involve more complex core patterns or rings of polar/charged residues.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Sequence Analysis:**\n\n*   **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** Applying the `g-a-b-c-d-e-f` register, the pattern is `E(g)I(a)A(b)...A(d)...`.\n    *   **Core Positions:** `a` = Isoleucine (I); `d` = Alanine (A).\n    *   **Prediction:** The combination of a β-branched residue (I) at the 'a' position and a small non-polar residue (A) at the 'd' position is a classic motif for a **trimer (3)**. The 'I' at 'a' creates steric hindrance that disfavors a dimer.\n\n*   **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** Parsing this sequence reveals repeats, but with a key substitution in the third repeat: `...E(g)I(a)A(b)...L(d)...` and in the third repeat `...E(g)N(a)A(b)...L(d)...`\n    *   **Core Positions:** `a` = I, I, N, I; `d` = L, L, L, L.\n    *   **Prediction:** This is a classic leucine zipper (`L` at 'd' positions), but with a crucial Asparagine (N) at one 'a' position. A polar residue like Asn in the hydrophobic core is a powerful specificity determinant. The hydrogen bonding capability of the Asn side chain strongly favors and locks in a parallel **dimer (2)**.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The pattern here is `E(g)I(a)A(b)...I(d)...`.\n    *   **Core Positions:** `a` = Isoleucine (I); `d` = Isoleucine (I).\n    *   **Prediction:** Having Isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' core positions is the canonical signature for a parallel **tetramer (4)**. The bulky, β-branched side chains pack efficiently in a four-helix bundle but create unfavorable steric clashes in lower-order oligomers.\n\n*   **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The pattern is `E(g)I(a)Q(b)...Q(d)...`.\n    *   **Core Positions:** `a` = Isoleucine (I); `d` = Glutamine (Q).\n    *   **Prediction:** This sequence has a polar residue (Q) in the 'd' positions. The Isoleucine at 'a' disfavors a dimer. To satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the buried Glutamine, a cyclic hydrogen-bond network is formed in the core. The combination of 'I' at 'a' and 'Q' at 'd' has been experimentally shown to form a stable **trimer (3)**. (Note: some answer choices might incorrectly suggest this is a dimer, assuming the Q-Q H-bond overcomes the I-I steric clash, but trimer is the more accepted state).\n\n*   **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The pattern is `E(g)I(a)A(b)...T(d)...`.\n    *   **Core Positions:** `a` = Isoleucine (I); `d` = Threonine (T).\n    *   **Prediction:** Similar to Sequence 4, this one has a polar residue (Threonine) in the 'd' positions. The β-branching of both Isoleucine at 'a' and Threonine at 'd' is sterically accommodated very well in a **trimer (3)**, where the Threonine hydroxyls can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network.\n\n**3. Final Compilation and Answer Choice Matching:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are:\n1.  Trimer (3)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Tetramer (4)\n4.  Trimer (3)\n5.  Trimer (3)\n\nThe resulting sequence of numbers is **(3, 2, 4, 3, 3)**.\n\nNow, we must compare this result with the given answer choices. None of the choices is an exact match. This suggests there might be an error in the question or options, or a nuanced interpretation is required. Let's re-evaluate by finding the \"best fit\" option, prioritizing the most certain predictions.\n\nOur most confident predictions are: Sequence 2 is a dimer (2), and Sequence 3 is a tetramer (4).\nLet's look for options with `X, 2, 4, X, X`:\n*   Only option D: `2, 2, 4, 2, 3` fits this pattern for the 2nd and 3rd positions.\n\nLet's analyze Option D (`2, 2, 4, 2, 3`):\n*   Seq 1 -> 2 (Mismatch, my prediction is 3)\n*   Seq 2 -> 2 (Match)\n*   Seq 3 -> 4 (Match)\n*   Seq 4 -> 2 (Mismatch, my prediction is 3)\n*   Seq 5 -> 3 (Match)\n\nThis option has three matches with our analysis, including the most certain cases. The mismatches for sequences 1 and 4 both involve the options predicting a dimer where analysis suggests a trimer (due to 'I' at the 'a' position). It is the most plausible option among the choices, assuming some subtleties or nuances not captured by the primary rules (for example, the energetic contribution of polar H-bonds at 'd' compensating for steric clash at 'a' to allow dimerization in Seq 4). No other option has this many strong correlations.\n\nTherefore, despite the discrepancies, option D is the most likely intended answer."
