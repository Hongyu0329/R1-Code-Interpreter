    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Initial Properties of f**\n\n*   **Injectivity:** First, we show that any solution $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $g(x)=e^x$ is injective, it follows that $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Thus, $f$ must be injective.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**2. A Fundamental Inequality for f**\n\n*   **No Fixed Points:** We check if $f$ can have a fixed point, i.e., a point $c$ such that $f(c)=c$.\n    If $f(c)=c$, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$.\n    From the given equation, $f(f(c)) = e^c$. So, we would need $e^c = c$.\n    However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n    Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n*   **f(x) vs. x:** Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, the graph of $f$ must lie entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$. In other words, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Let's test the second case: suppose $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    Let $y = f(x)$. Then $y$ is in the range of $f$. Since $f$ must be defined on its own range, we can apply the inequality to $y$: $f(y) < y$.\n    Combining these inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) = f(y) < y = f(x) < x$.\n    This would imply $e^x < x$. But this is false for all real numbers $x$.\n    So, the case $f(x) < x$ is impossible. This leaves only one possibility:\n    **For any solution $f$, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.**\n\n**3. Case 1: f is Strictly Decreasing (Proof of Impossibility)**\n\nWe will now show that there are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n1.  Assume $f$ is a continuous, strictly decreasing solution.\n2.  From Step 2, we know that for any such solution, $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n3.  Let's combine these two properties. For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, let $y = f(x)$.\n4.  Since $f(x) > x$, we have $y > x$.\n5.  Because $f$ is strictly decreasing and $y > x$, it must be that $f(y) < f(x)$.\n6.  Substitute the definitions of $y$ and $f(y)$: $f(f(x)) < f(x)$.\n7.  Using the original equation, this gives the condition **$e^x < f(x)$** for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n8.  Now we check if a strictly decreasing function $f$ can satisfy $e^x < f(x)$ for all $x$.\n    Let $f(0)=c$. From $e^x < f(x)$, we must have $e^0 < f(0)$, so $1 < c$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, for any $x>0$, we must have $f(x) < f(0)=c$.\n    Combining this with the condition from point 7, we get that for all $x>0$:  $e^x < f(x) < c$.\n    This implies $e^x < c$ for all $x>0$.\n9.  This is a clear contradiction. For instance, we can choose $x=\\ln(c)$. Since $c>1$, $\\ln(c)>0$. For this value of $x$, the inequality becomes $e^{\\ln(c)} < c$, which simplifies to $c < c$, a falsehood.\n10. Therefore, our initial assumption was wrong. **No strictly decreasing solution exists.**\n\n**4. Case 2: f is Strictly Increasing (Existence and Cardinality)**\n\nSince we have eliminated decreasing functions, any solution must be strictly increasing. We now need to determine how many such functions exist.\n1.  **Construction of a Solution:** We can construct a solution by defining $f$ on a specific interval and then extending its definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the equation $f(f(x))=e^x$.\n2.  Let's choose an interval to start. We need to choose the value of $f(0)$. Let $a = f(0)$.\n    From $f(x)>x$, we have $a > 0$.\n    Also, $f(a) = f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$.\n    Since $f$ is increasing and $a>0$, we have $f(a) > f(0)$, which means $1 > a$.\n    So, the value $a = f(0)$ can be any number in the interval $(0,1)$.\n\n3.  **Freedom of Choice:** Let's fix a choice for $a$, for example, $a = 1/2$. So we have $f(0)=1/2$ and $f(1/2)=1$. Now consider the behavior of $f$ on the interval $[0, 1/2]$. Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, it must map the interval $[0, 1/2]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(1/2)] = [1/2, 1]$.\n    We are free to choose $f$ on $[0, 1/2]$ to be *any* continuous, strictly increasing function (a homeomorphism) that maps $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$.\n    For example, $f(x) = x+1/2$ for $x\\in[0,1/2]$. Or $f(x) = 2x^2+1/2$. Or countless others. The number of such homeomorphisms between two closed intervals is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n4.  **Extension:** Once we have defined $f$ on $[0, 1/2]$, its definition is uniquely determined everywhere else.\n    *   For $x \\in (1/2, 1]$, we can write $x = f(t)$ for a unique $t \\in (0, 1/2]$. We must then define $f(x) = f(f(t)) = e^t$.\n    *   This process can be repeated to extend $f$ to $[0, \\infty)$.\n    *   To extend $f$ to $(-\\infty, 0)$, we use the inverse relation. For instance, to define $f$ on $[-1/2, 0)$, we note that for any $x \\in [1/2, 1)$, $x=e^t$ for some $t \\in [- \\ln(2), 0)$. No, that's not the right way. We use $f^{-1}$. If $x \\in [-1, 0)$, we want to find $f(x)$. From $f(f(x))=e^x$, we get $f(x) = f^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    The construction holds and uniquely extends any initial choice to the entirety of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n5.  **Cardinality:** Different choices for the function on the initial interval $[0, a]$ will result in different functions $f$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to choose a continuous increasing function mapping $[0,a]$ to $[a,1]$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n    The set of all continuous functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the number of solutions cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Combining these, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is non-empty. All such functions must be strictly increasing. The number of such functions is determined by the number of ways to define an initial function segment, which can be done in a number of ways equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c} = | \\mathbb{R} |$.\n\n<<<the cardinality of the continuum>>>"
