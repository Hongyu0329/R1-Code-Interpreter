The following are the exact residues from the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, canonical isoform β1b, UniProt P54283-1) that act as hotspots for interaction and gating modulation of the human alpha-1 subunit (CaV2.3).

**1) Hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit (residues forming the Beta Interaction Domain, BID):**

These residues form a hydrophobic binding pocket in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain that directly binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the α1 subunit.

*   **Residues forming the hydrophobic groove:**
    *   **Tyrosine (Y) 382**
    *   **Leucine (L) 385**
    *   **Isoleucine (I) 386**
    *   **Valine (V) 427**
    *   **Leucine (L) 430**
    *   **Tryptophan (W) 440**
    *   **Isoleucine (I) 451**
    *   **Valine (V) 455**
*   **Residue forming the key electrostatic interaction:**
    *   **Aspartic Acid (D) 434:** Forms a critical salt bridge with a conserved arginine in the AID, anchoring the interaction.

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

Gating modulation requires both the primary interaction and contributions from other domains for fine-tuning.

*   **Primary Modulation via Binding (Essential):**
    *   All residues listed in section (1) are fundamental for gating modulation, as disrupting the binding abrogates the modulatory effects.
*   **Fine-tuning of Inactivation Kinetics (Regional Hotspot):**
    *   **The N-terminal Domain (approximately residues 1-70):** This entire region acts as a functional hotspot. It significantly influences the voltage-dependence and kinetics of channel inactivation. Its specific sequence and conformation dictate the modulatory outcome.
*   **Fine-tuning via Structural Integrity of other Domains:**
    *   **Tryptophan (W) 237:** This residue is located in the SH3 domain and is crucial for maintaining the correct three-dimensional fold of the SH3 domain. Proper SH3 structure is required for the full and correct modulatory influence of the β1 subunit on gating.
