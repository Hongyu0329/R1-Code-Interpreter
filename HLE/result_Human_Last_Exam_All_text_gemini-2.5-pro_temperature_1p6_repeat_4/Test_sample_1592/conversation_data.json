    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the location of Waskaganish.\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community in Quebec, Canada.\n*   Geographically, it is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n*   Its approximate coordinates are 51.48° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nNext, we identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec.\n*   To the west: **Ontario**\n*   To the east: **Newfoundland and Labrador**\n*   To the southeast: **New Brunswick**\n*   To the north (across Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and including islands within James Bay): **Nunavut**\n\nThe question requires us to find the closest of these, excluding Quebec itself.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighbor**\nNow, let's assess the distance from Waskaganish to the border of each of these neighboring entities.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border between Quebec and Labrador is located far to the east of Waskaganish, on the other side of the vast Quebec-Labrador Peninsula. This distance is several hundred kilometers and is clearly not the closest.\n*   **New Brunswick:** The border with New Brunswick is far to the southeast of Waskaganish, south of the St. Lawrence River. This is also a very long distance, making it an unlikely candidate.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes the islands in James Bay. The closest major island to Waskaganish that is part of Nunavut is Akimiski Island.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must determine if Akimiski Island is closer than the Ontario border. Akimiski Island lies to the northwest of Waskaganish in the middle of James Bay. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern shore of Akimiski Island is roughly 230 kilometers (about 143 miles).\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Ontario and Quebec runs south directly from the coast of James Bay. Waskaganish is located on the southeastern coast of James Bay. The Ontario border begins on the southwestern coast of James Bay, just across a smaller body of water called Hannah Bay.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Visually on a map, the distance from Waskaganish across Hannah Bay to the Ontario border is very short. The calculated straight-line distance from the community of Waskaganish to the nearest point on the Ontario provincial border is approximately 55 kilometers (about 34 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Closest Candidates**\nThe two most viable candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~55 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): ~230 km\n\nComparing these distances, the border of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the closest part of Nunavut.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the province of Ontario is the closest political entity to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
