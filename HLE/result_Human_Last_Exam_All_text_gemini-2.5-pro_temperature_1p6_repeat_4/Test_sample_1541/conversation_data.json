    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and the calculation of the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to reorder the numbers (summands) in a given sum string so that they appear in non-decreasing (sorted) order. The numbers are guaranteed to be only 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n2.  **Input and Output Format:**\n    *   **Input:** A string like \"3+2+1\". It contains single-digit numbers and '+' signs, with no spaces. The string length is at most 1000.\n    *   **Output:** A string representing the new sum with sorted numbers, like \"1+2+3\".\n\n3.  **Core Constraint:** The problem asks for the *most memory-efficient C program*. This is a crucial constraint that guides the choice of algorithm and data structures. We must minimize the memory allocated for variables.\n\n4.  **Algorithm Selection (Considering Memory Efficiency):**\n    *   **Inefficient Approach:** Reading the entire string into a large character array, then parsing the numbers into an integer array, sorting the integer array, and finally building the output string. This would require two arrays: one for the input string (`~1001` bytes) and one for the integers (`~500 integers * 4 bytes/integer = ~2000` bytes). This is clearly not memory-efficient.\n    *   **Efficient Approach (Counting Sort):** Since the set of possible numbers is very small and fixed (1, 2, 3, 4), we don't need to store the numbers themselves. We can simply count the occurrences of each number. This is the core idea of a Counting Sort.\n    *   **Optimizing Further (Input Processing):** To be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire input string. We can read the input character by character and update our counts on the fly. This eliminates the need for a large input buffer.\n\n5.  **The Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    *   **Phase 1: Counting:**\n        1.  Declare an integer array `counts[4]` initialized to zero. `counts[0]` will store the count of '1's, `counts[1]` for '2's, etc.\n        2.  Read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`.\n        3.  In a loop that continues until the end of the line ('\\n'), check each character.\n        4.  If the character is a digit ('1' through '4'), increment the corresponding counter in the `counts` array. Ignore the '+' characters.\n    *   **Phase 2: Printing:**\n        1.  After reading the whole input, we have the exact counts of each number.\n        2.  Use a flag, let's call it `is_first`, initialized to true. This flag will help us correctly print the '+' signs.\n        3.  Loop from `i = 0` to `3` (representing numbers 1 to 4).\n        4.  Inside this loop, have another loop that runs `counts[i]` times.\n        5.  In the inner loop:\n            a. If `is_first` is false, print a \"+\" character.\n            b. Print the number `i + 1`.\n            c. Set `is_first` to false, as subsequent numbers will need a preceding \"+\".\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Memory, Not Speed:** The primary constraint is memory. An algorithm that is slightly slower but uses less memory is preferred.\n2.  **No Large Buffers:** Avoid declaring large arrays like `char s[1001]`. Reading character by character is key to minimizing memory.\n3.  **Variable Sizes:** The calculation must be based on standard C data type sizes (e.g., `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes on most competitive programming platforms).\n4.  **Counting All Variables:** Every single variable declared in the `main` function (or any helper function) contributes to the total memory usage. This includes loop counters.\n5.  **Output Formatting:** The '+' sign should only be printed *between* numbers, not before the first one or after the last one. A simple flag or a counter is an effective way to handle this logic.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation (m)\n\nLet's implement the most memory-efficient algorithm described above and tally the memory used by its variables.\n\nThe C program would require the following variables:\n\n1.  `int counts[4];`\n    *   Purpose: To store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Memory: 4 elements * `sizeof(int)` = 4 * 4 bytes = **16 bytes**.\n\n2.  `char c;`\n    *   Purpose: To hold each character as it is read from the input stream.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  `int is_first;`\n    *   Purpose: A flag to control the printing of '+' signs. Initialized to 1 (true).\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  `int i;`\n    *   Purpose: Loop counter for the outer printing loop (iterates through numbers 1 to 4).\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n5.  `int j;`\n    *   Purpose: Loop counter for the inner printing loop (iterates for each number's count).\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `is_first`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `j`)\nm = 16 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4\nm = 29 bytes\n\n<<<29>>>"
