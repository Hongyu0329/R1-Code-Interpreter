    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a graph, let's call it $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices in $G$ is $n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$). A complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   The question mentions the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, but does not specify its value. This implies we should consider all possible graphs that fit the description, which will have various maximum degrees.\n    *   We need to find the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This means we need to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions. A proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Question:**\n    Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all graphs $G$ such that $V(G)=12345$ and $G \\neq K_{12345}$. The question asks for the value of $\\max_{G \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\chi(G)$.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n*   **Chromatic Number Definition:** The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the *minimum* number of colors for a proper coloring of a *specific* graph $G$.\n*   **The Question's Objective:** The question is not about a single graph $G$. It asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ over an entire class of graphs (all non-complete graphs with 12345 vertices). We need to find the \"worst-case\" scenario for coloring among these graphs.\n*   **Relationship between Chromatic Number and Vertices:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we know that $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n*   **The \"Not a Complete Graph\" Constraint:** This is the most crucial piece of information. Since $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$, we can immediately use the property mentioned in the point above.\n*   **Brooks' Theorem:** A well-known theorem in graph theory, Brooks' Theorem, states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. While useful, a more fundamental result is sufficient here.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Let $G$ be any graph with $n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   The problem states that $G$ is *not* the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n    *   By definition, if a graph is not complete, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them).\n    *   Because $G \\neq K_n$, it is a known result that its chromatic number is strictly less than $n$. A simple proof is as follows: Since $G$ is not complete, we can find a vertex ordering where the last vertex $v_n$ has a degree of at most $n-2$. A greedy coloring algorithm with this ordering will use at most $(n-2)+1 = n-1$ colors. Therefore, for any non-complete graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n    *   Applying this to our problem, since $G$ is not $K_{12345}$, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n    *   This tells us that the maximum number of colors we could possibly need is 12344.\n\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound (Show the Upper Bound is Achievable):**\n    *   Now we must check if there actually exists a graph $G$ (which is not $K_{12345}$) that requires $12344$ colors. If we can find such a graph, we will have proven that the maximum is exactly 12344.\n    *   Consider the following graph, let's call it $H$. Let $H$ be constructed by taking the complete graph on $12344$ vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   Let's check if this graph $H$ fits our criteria:\n        *   **Number of vertices:** $H$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. (Correct)\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** $H$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$ because the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the other vertices. (Correct)\n    *   Now, let's find the chromatic number of $H$. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n        *   The components of $H$ are $K_{12344}$ and a single vertex ($K_1$).\n        *   $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\chi(H) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n    *   We have successfully constructed a graph that has 12345 vertices, is not the complete graph, and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any graph $G$ meeting the problem's criteria must have $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   We have also shown that there exists at least one such graph $H$ for which $\\chi(H) = 12344$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\n(Another example of a graph achieving this bound is $K_{12345}$ with a single edge removed. This graph contains a clique of size 12344, so its chromatic number is at least 12344. Since it is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 12344. Thus, it is exactly 12344.)\n\n<<<12344>>>"
