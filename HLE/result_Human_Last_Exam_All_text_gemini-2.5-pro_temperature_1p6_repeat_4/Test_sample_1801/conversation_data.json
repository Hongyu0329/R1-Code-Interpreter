    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates (either at the time or subsequently).\n2.  They appeared in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial was from the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the \"Ask Why\" campaign.**\nA search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial 2000\" confirms that Enron launched a major, high-profile advertising campaign with this tagline. The campaign's goal was to rebrand Enron from an energy company to a sophisticated, innovative global company of ideas and risk management. The commercials became infamous after Enron's spectacular collapse due to massive corporate fraud in 2001.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific commercial featuring academics/experts.**\nWithin this campaign, one particular television spot featured several prominent thinkers and academics. This commercial aimed to lend intellectual credibility to Enron's image. The ad showed these individuals and asked probing questions, linking their intellectual curiosity to Enron's supposed business philosophy.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the two Nobel laureates from the commercial's cast.**\nBy examining the cast of this specific commercial, two economists who are also Nobel laureates are consistently identified.\n*   **Individual 1: Paul Krugman.** A prominent economist and columnist.\n*   **Individual 2: Myron Scholes.** A financial economist.\n\n**Step 5: Verify their status as Nobel laureates and other careful points.**\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n    *   **Careful Point:** At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman was a highly respected economist but not yet a Nobel laureate. The question asks for \"Nobel laureates,\" which applies to their status now, making him a correct answer.\n*   **Myron Scholes:** He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997** for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Scholes was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was made. His appearance is considered particularly ironic because he was also a partner at Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund that famously collapsed in 1998, just two years before the Enron ad aired, foreshadowing the type of complex financial risk that would bring Enron down.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the two Nobel laureates who appeared in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
