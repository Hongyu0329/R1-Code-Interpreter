    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the name of a specific character from a specific piece of media.\n2.  **Break Down the Media:**\n    *   **Franchise:** \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoon series.\n    *   **Sub-series:** \"Teen Girl Squad\".\n    *   **Specific Episode:** Episode #15.\n3.  **Identify the Scene:** The scene is the Junior prom.\n4.  **Identify the Object of Interest:** A cardboard cutout that is \"performing\".\n5.  **Identify the Required Information:** The name of the fictional singer depicted on the cutout.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Fictional Singer:** The answer must be a character *within* the Homestar Runner universe, not a real-world musician.\n*   **Episode Specificity:** The information must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and not another episode where a band or singer might perform. Other bands like Limozeen or singers like Strong Bad are prominent in the universe but may not be the correct answer for this specific scene.\n*   **\"Cardboard Cutout\":** This detail is crucial. The performer isn't a \"live\" animated character but a static prop, which is part of the episode's humor.\n*   **\"Singer\":** The question asks for a \"singer\", but the answer could be the name of a band. In the context of the source material, the band name is used to identify the musical act.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the four girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attend their Junior Prom.\n2.  The entertainment for the prom is shown. Instead of a live band, it is a large, full-color cardboard cutout of a musical act.\n3.  The cutout depicts a mopey-looking musician with a guitar and a drum kit. The name of the band is written on the kick drum.\n4.  The name on the kick drum is \"sloshy\".\n5.  \"sloshy\" is a recurring fictional indie/mope-rock band within the Homestar Runner universe, known for their hit \"We're a New Band, sloshy\", which plays during this scene.\n\nTherefore, the fictional singer/band whose cardboard cutout performs at the Junior prom is sloshy.\n\n<<<sloshy>>>"
