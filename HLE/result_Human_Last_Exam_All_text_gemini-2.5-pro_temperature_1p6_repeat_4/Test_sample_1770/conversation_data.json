    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the gene that should be knocked out.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid that has been successfully produced in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. This means we need to block the metabolic pathway that uses p-coumaric acid as a starting material (substrate).\n\n2.  **Identify the Degradation Pathway:** The first step is to determine how *C. glutamicum* naturally breaks down p-coumaric acid. This compound is a phenylpropanoid, and bacteria that can metabolize it typically funnel it into central metabolism, often via the β-ketoadipate pathway. In *C. glutamicum*, p-coumaric acid is known to be catabolized via the protocatechuate branch of this pathway.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the First Step of Degradation:** In metabolic engineering, the most effective way to prevent the loss of a desired product is to block the very first enzymatic step of its degradation. This prevents the cell from committing the product to a downstream pathway and avoids the accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates.\n\n4.  **Characterize the First Enzymatic Reaction:** The degradation of p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum* begins with its \"activation.\" This is a common strategy for metabolizing carboxylic acids. The cell attaches a Coenzyme A (CoA) molecule to the p-coumaric acid. The reaction is as follows:\n    *   p-Coumaric acid + ATP + CoA → p-Coumaroyl-CoA + AMP + PPi\n\n5.  **Identify the Responsible Enzyme and Gene:** The enzyme that catalyzes this initial activation step is a type of ligase called **p-coumarate:CoA ligase** (also known as p-coumaroyl-CoA synthetase). By searching the *C. glutamicum* genome and relevant literature, this enzyme is found to be encoded by the gene designated as **`pcs`** (for **p**-**c**oumarate **c**atabolism **s**ystem).\n\n6.  **Formulate the Knockout Strategy:** By knocking out the `pcs` gene, the cell will lose the ability to produce the p-coumarate:CoA ligase enzyme. Without this enzyme, the cell cannot perform the first step of degradation (converting p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA). As a result, the p-coumaric acid produced by the engineered biosynthetic pathway will not be degraded and will accumulate, achieving the desired engineering goal.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Target Specificity:** It's crucial to knock out the correct gene. Knocking out a gene further down the pathway (e.g., one involved in degrading protocatechuate) would be ineffective, as the p-coumaric acid would still be converted into other intermediate compounds.\n*   **Essentiality:** The `pcs` gene is part of a catabolic pathway for a specific external carbon source. It is not essential for the general growth of *C. glutamicum* on standard lab media (like glucose), so knocking it out is unlikely to be lethal to the cells.\n*   **Biosynthesis vs. Degradation:** Do not confuse the degradation pathway with the production pathway. The question states that the biosynthetic genes have been *introduced*. A common biosynthetic enzyme is Tyrosine Ammonia-Lyase (TAL), which converts L-tyrosine to p-coumaric acid. Knocking out TAL would stop production, which is the opposite of the desired outcome.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is p-coumaric acid. The gene to be knocked out must be the one that acts *on* this product. The `pcs` gene encodes the enzyme that directly uses p-coumaric acid as its substrate.\n\nBased on this analysis, the clear target for knockout is the gene encoding p-coumarate:CoA ligase.\n\n<<<pcs>>>"
