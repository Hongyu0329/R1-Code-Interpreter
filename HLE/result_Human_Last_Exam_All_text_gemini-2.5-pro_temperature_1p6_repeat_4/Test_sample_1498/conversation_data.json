    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Poem's Structure**\nThe poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a metrical summary (*matn*) of the essential articles of Sunni Islamic creed, primarily based on the Ash'ari school of theology. It is structured to be easily memorized by the \"layman\" or beginner. The topics follow a logical sequence: Allah's attributes, then the Prophets, Angels, Divine Books, the Last Day, and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on Prophets**\nBefore listing the prophets' names, the author typically introduces the topic. In this poem, he states that it is obligatory for every responsible Muslim (*mukallaf*) to know the details of the twenty-five prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an. This serves as an introduction to the list.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Introductory Verse**\nThis introductory statement is found in **Bayt 28**. The verse reads:\n`تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ... كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\nTranslation: \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every obligated person, so verify this and seize the opportunity.\"\nThis verse sets the stage but does not contain any of the names itself.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the First Verse Containing Names**\nThe very next verse begins the enumeration of the prophets' names. This is **Bayt 29**:\n`هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\nTranslation: \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\nThis is the starting point of the list of names.\n\n**Step 5: Trace the List Through Subsequent Verses**\nThe author continues to list the names over the next few verses to fit the poetic meter and rhyme scheme.\n*   **Bayt 30** continues with: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 31** continues with: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Verse Containing Names**\nThe list of the 25 prophets concludes in the following verse, which mentions the last few prophets and ends with Prophet Muhammad, referred to by his name 'Taha'. This is **Bayt 32**:\n`اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\nTranslation: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the Seal [of the prophets]; leave misguidance.\"\nThis verse marks the end of the list of names.\n\n**Step 7: Note the Concluding Verse for the Section**\nThe verse immediately following the list (**Bayt 33**) sends peace and blessings upon all the prophets mentioned, thereby concluding the specific topic before moving on to the next article of faith (the Angels). While it does not contain names, it is thematically part of the section.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Scope of the Question:** The question asks specifically for the verses where the **names** of the Prophets are mentioned, not the entire section about them. Therefore, the introductory verse (28) and concluding prayer (33) are context, but the core answer is the verses containing the list of names.\n2.  **Numbering Consistency:** While the numbering from 28 to 33 is standard in most editions of 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam, very slight variations (e.g., by one verse) might exist in some manuscripts or printings. However, the sequence of the content remains the same.\n3.  **Name for Prophet Muhammad:** The author uses \"Taha\" (طه), one of the names/titles of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, to refer to him in the final verse of the list, which is a common practice in Islamic devotional poetry.\n4.  **The Answer Range:** Based on the analysis, the enumeration of the names begins at Bayt 29 and finishes at Bayt 32.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The list of prophets' names starts in Bayt 29.\n*   The list of prophets' names ends in Bayt 32.\n*   Therefore, the names are mentioned from Bayt 29 to Bayt 32.\n\n<<<From bayt (verse) 29 to bayt (verse) 32>>>"
