    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for a specific number of \"historical saints\" who are \"mentioned by name\" within the epic poem *Paradise Lost*. The key terms to define carefully are:\n*   **Historical Saint**: This term can be ambiguous. It could refer to any person who lived in history (i.e., not a mythological figure or an angel) and is considered a saint by a major Christian tradition. This raises a sub-question: do we include biblical figures (like the apostles or Old Testament patriarchs) or only post-biblical figures (like the Church Fathers or medieval saints)? Given Milton's Protestantism, his engagement with \"sainthood\" is likely to be critical, especially concerning figures venerated by the Roman Catholic Church. The most reasonable approach is to look for named individuals who are unequivocally historical persons and are widely recognized as saints.\n*   **Mentioned by Name**: The reference must be to the individual's specific name (e.g., \"Peter,\" \"Dominic\"), not a title, a description, or a group named after them (e.g., \"the Virgin,\" \"the Baptist,\" \"Franciscan\").\n\n### Step 2: Searching the Text of *Paradise Lost*\nWe must search the twelve books of the poem for names of saints. The most fruitful sections for this are those dealing with post-biblical Church history.\n\n*   **Books XI and XII**: In the poem's conclusion, the angel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history. This section names numerous figures from the Old Testament, such as **Adam, Eve, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David,** and **Solomon**. In some Christian traditions (particularly Eastern Orthodoxy), these patriarchs and prophets are considered saints. However, Milton presents them as figures in salvation history, not in the context of their veneration as \"saints.\" Including all of them would misinterpret the common understanding of the term \"saint\" in this context, which usually refers to figures known for their post-biblical holiness and miracles.\n\n*   **Book III**: This book contains a famous satirical passage describing the \"Limbo of Vanity\" or \"Paradise of Fools\" (Book III, lines 444-497). Here, Milton mocks what he sees as the follies and corruptions of the Roman Catholic Church. This is the most direct engagement with the concept of sainthood in the poem.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Mentions in Book III\nIn the passage on the Paradise of Fools, Milton describes deluded souls who hoped to get into heaven through superstitious means. Here we find the key mentions:\n\n1.  **Dominic**: In Book III, line 479, Milton writes of those who, \"Dying put on the weeds of **DOMINIC**\". This is a direct reference by name to **Saint Dominic** (c. 1170â€“1221), the Spanish priest who founded the Dominican Order. The \"weeds of Dominic\" refers to the habit (clothing) of a Dominican friar, mocking the belief that being buried in it would guarantee entry into heaven. Saint Dominic is unequivocally a historical, post-biblical saint mentioned by name.\n\n2.  **Peter**: A few lines later, Milton mentions that these foolish souls think they see \"Saint **PETER** at Heav'ns Wicket\" (Book III, line 484). This is a clear reference to the apostle **Saint Peter**, a foundational figure in Christianity. As an apostle who lived and died in the 1st century AD, he is an undisputed historical figure and a universally recognized saint. Milton mentions him by name and with the title \"Saint,\" specifically referencing his traditional role as the gatekeeper of heaven.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating Other Potential Candidates\n*   **St. Francis of Assisi**: In the same line as Dominic, Milton mentions those who \"in **Franciscan** think to pass disguis'd\". This refers to the order founded by St. Francis. However, \"Franciscan\" is an adjective; the name \"Francis\" itself is not mentioned. Therefore, St. Francis does not meet the \"mentioned by name\" criterion.\n*   **The Virgin Mary**: Mary is referred to multiple times as \"the Virgin\" or as the mother of the Son, but her personal name, \"Mary,\" does not appear in the poem's verse.\n*   **John the Baptist**: He is alluded to as the \"great Proclaimer\" but is not mentioned by name.\n*   **Other Apostles**: Besides Peter, no other apostle is mentioned by name in the poem.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on a careful analysis of the text, only two figures fit all the criteria of being a \"historical saint\" \"mentioned by name\":\n\n1.  **Dominic** (a post-biblical saint)\n2.  **Peter** (a biblical saint and apostle)\n\nBoth are clearly identified by name in a passage that directly engages with the concept of sainthood and veneration. While many Old Testament patriarchs are named elsewhere, it is not in the context of their status as \"saints\" in the way Peter and Dominic are referenced.\n\n<<<2>>>"
