    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe user's question is \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\". To answer this accurately, we need to break it down.\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\" in MLB**\n\nFirst, we must understand what constitutes a Triple Crown for a batter in Major League Baseball. A player wins the Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Ambiguities and Careful Points**\n\nThere are several points that require careful consideration when compiling a definitive list:\n\n*   **Number of Winners vs. Number of Times Won:** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., unique players), not the number of times the Triple Crown has been awarded. Some players have won it more than once. We must count these players only once to answer the question correctly.\n*   **Historical Leagues:** Modern MLB consists of the American League (AL) and National League (NL). However, in the 19th century, other leagues were also considered \"major leagues,\" such as the American Association. Wins from these leagues are often included in historical records.\n*   **Historical Statistics:** In the early days of baseball, some statistics like RBI were not officially tracked. Winners from that era are often credited retroactively, which can lead to some debate, but they are generally accepted by most baseball historians and record-keepers.\n\n**Step 3: List all Instances of a Triple Crown Win**\n\nLet's list every player who has achieved the Triple Crown, along with their league and the year, to ensure a complete count.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, NL): Providence Grays. (.358 AVG, 4 HR, 50 RBI).\n    *   *Careful Point:* RBIs were not an official statistic in 1878. He was retroactively credited with the league lead.\n\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, AA): St. Louis Browns. (.435 AVG, 14 HR, 123 RBI).\n    *   *Careful Point:* This was achieved in the American Association, which is recognized as a major league for that period but is not the AL or NL.\n\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL): Boston Beaneaters. (.440 AVG, 18 HR, 145 RBI).\n\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL): Philadelphia Athletics. (.426 AVG, 14 HR, 125 RBI).\n\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL): Detroit Tigers. (.377 AVG, 9 HR, 107 RBI).\n\n6.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, NL): St. Louis Cardinals. (.401 AVG, 42 HR, 152 RBI).\n\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, NL): St. Louis Cardinals. (.403 AVG, 39 HR, 143 RBI).\n    *   *Careful Point:* This is Hornsby's second Triple Crown.\n\n8.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL): Philadelphia Phillies. (.368 AVG, 28 HR, 120 RBI).\n\n9.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL): Philadelphia Athletics. (.356 AVG, 48 HR, 163 RBI).\n\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL): New York Yankees. (.363 AVG, 49 HR, 166 RBI).\n\n11. **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL): St. Louis Cardinals. (.374 AVG, 31 HR, 154 RBI).\n    *   This is the last time a player won the Triple Crown in the National League.\n\n12. **Ted Williams** (1942, AL): Boston Red Sox. (.356 AVG, 36 HR, 137 RBI).\n\n13. **Ted Williams** (1947, AL): Boston Red Sox. (.343 AVG, 32 HR, 114 RBI).\n    *   *Careful Point:* This is Williams's second Triple Crown.\n\n14. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL): New York Yankees. (.353 AVG, 52 HR, 130 RBI).\n\n15. **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL): Baltimore Orioles. (.316 AVG, 49 HR, 122 RBI).\n\n16. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL): Boston Red Sox. (.326 AVG, 44 HR, 121 RBI).\n\n17. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL): Detroit Tigers. (.330 AVG, 44 HR, 139 RBI).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Number of Winners**\n\nNow, we count the number of *unique players* from the list above.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice)\n7.  Chuck Klein\n8.  Jimmie Foxx\n9.  Lou Gehrig\n10. Joe Medwick\n11. Ted Williams (won twice)\n12. Mickey Mantle\n13. Frank Robinson\n14. Carl Yastrzemski\n15. Miguel Cabrera\n\nBy counting each player only once, regardless of how many times they won, we arrive at the total number of Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere have been a total of 17 Triple Crown-winning seasons in MLB history, but these were accomplished by 15 different players. Two players, Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, won the Triple Crown twice. Therefore, the number of unique Triple Crown winners is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
