    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem's Premise:**\n    The question describes a special scenario in the context of Tverberg's theorem. We are given:\n    *   A set $X$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n    *   An integer partition of $n$ into $r$ parts: $n = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_r$.\n    *   A constraint on the size of the parts: $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$ for all $i$.\n    *   A crucial condition on the point set $X$: *every* Tverberg partition of $X$ into $r$ parts is of type $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$. This means that for any partition of the set $X$ into $r$ disjoint subsets $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_r\\}$ such that their convex hulls have a common point ($\\cap_{i=1}^r \\text{conv}(X_i) \\neq \\emptyset$), the multiset of cardinalities $\\{|X_1|, \\dots, |X_r|\\}$ is precisely $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$.\n\n    The goal is to determine the total number of such Tverberg partitions for this specific set $X$.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Implicit Geometric Condition:**\n    The existence of a point set $X$ with such a rigid structure on its Tverberg partitions is a very strong condition. In the theory of Tverberg partitions, the number and types of partitions are related to the dimension of an associated configuration space.\n    *   For a generic point set, if the number of Tverberg partitions of a specific type is finite and non-zero, it implies that a certain dimensional equation must be satisfied.\n    *   The condition that *all* Tverberg partitions are of a single type, and that they partition the entire set $X$, forces the problem into this specific \"zero-dimensional\" case.\n    *   This implicit condition, which must hold for such a set $X$ to exist as described, is:\n        $$ \\sum_{i=1}^r (a_i - 1) = d(r-1) $$\n    We can therefore proceed by assuming this condition on the given parameters $a_i, d,$ and $r$.\n\n3.  **Citing the Relevant Mathematical Result:**\n    The problem of counting Tverberg partitions for generic point sets under this specific dimensional constraint has been solved. The result provides a formula for the number of such partitions. We first consider the number of **ordered** partitions, i.e., tuples $(X_1, \\dots, X_r)$ where $|X_i|=a_i$ for each $i$. For a generic point set satisfying the condition from Step 2, this number is given by a formula established in works by mathematicians like Roudneff, Onn, and Živaljević.\n\n    The number of ordered Tverberg partitions of type $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$ is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{ordered}} = \\binom{d(r-1)}{a_1-1, a_2-1, \\dots, a_r-1} \\cdot ((r-1)!)^d $$\n    The term on the left is a multinomial coefficient, which can be expanded as:\n    $$ \\binom{d(r-1)}{a_1-1, \\dots, a_r-1} = \\frac{(d(r-1))!}{(a_1-1)!(a_2-1)!\\cdots(a_r-1)!} $$\n    Note that this is well-defined because $\\sum(a_i-1) = d(r-1)$.\n\n4.  **Adjusting for Unordered Partitions:**\n    A \"Tverberg partition\" is typically defined as an **unordered** set of subsets $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_r\\}$. The formula from Step 3 counts ordered tuples. To find the number of unordered sets, we must divide by the number of possible orderings of the parts. This is a standard combinatorial correction for overcounting.\n    *   If all the part sizes $a_i$ are distinct, we would simply divide by $r!$.\n    *   However, if some part sizes are identical, the number of distinct permutations of the parts is smaller. We need to account for this by dividing by the product of the factorials of the multiplicities of each size.\n    *   Let the distinct values among $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$ be $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$.\n    *   Let $m_j$ be the multiplicity of the size $s_j$ in the list $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$. (So, $\\sum_{j=1}^k m_j = r$).\n    *   The symmetry factor (the size of the automorphism group of the multiset) is $m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!$.\n\n5.  **Formulating the Final Answer:**\n    By dividing the number of ordered partitions by the symmetry factor, we get the number of unordered Tverberg partitions.\n\n    Number of partitions of $X = \\frac{N_{\\text{ordered}}}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!}$\n\n    Substituting the formula for $N_{\\text{ordered}}$:\n    $$ \\text{Number of partitions} = \\frac{1}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\binom{d(r-1)}{a_1-1, a_2-1, \\dots, a_r-1} ((r-1)!)^d $$\n    Expanding the multinomial coefficient, the final expression is:\n    $$ \\text{Number of partitions} = \\frac{((r-1)!)^d}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\cdot \\frac{(d(r-1))!}{(a_1-1)!(a_2-1)!\\cdots(a_r-1)!} $$\n    where $m_j$ is the number of times each distinct part size appears in the list $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$. This formula gives the number of Tverberg partitions for the set $X$ described in the problem.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\nLet $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k$ be the multiplicities of the distinct values in the integer partition $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$. The number of Tverberg partitions of the set $X$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{((r-1)!)^d}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\cdot \\frac{(d(r-1))!}{(a_1-1)!(a_2-1)!\\cdots(a_r-1)!} $$\n\n<<<Let $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_k$ be the multiplicities of the distinct values in the integer partition $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$. The number of Tverberg's partitions of X is $\\frac{((r-1)!)^d}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\cdot \\frac{(d(r-1))!}{(a_1-1)!(a_2-1)!\\cdots(a_r-1)!}$.>>>"
