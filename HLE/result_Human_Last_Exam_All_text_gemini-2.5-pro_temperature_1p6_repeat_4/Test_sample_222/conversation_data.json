    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n    *   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving the elements of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n2.  **Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\":**\n    *   Calculating an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M > N involves a process called time-domain aliasing.\n    *   Let the desired 4-point DFT be `Y_4(k)`. By definition, `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_4^{nk}`, where `W_4 = e^{-j2π/4} = -j`.\n    *   We can split the sum: `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} y(n) W_4^{nk} + sum_{n=4}^{7} y(n) W_4^{nk}`.\n    *   Using the property `W_4^{nk} = W_4^{(n+4)k}`, we can rewrite the second sum: `sum_{n=0}^{3} y(n+4) W_4^{(n+4)k} = sum_{n=0}^{3} y(n+4) W_4^{nk}`.\n    *   Combining these, `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} (y(n) + y(n+4)) W_4^{nk}`.\n    *   This shows that the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)` is the same as the 4-point DFT of a 4-point aliased sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Time-Domain Sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`:**\n    *   We need to perform an Inverse DFT (IDFT) on `X(k)` and `H(k)`. The 4-point IDFT formula is `f(n) = (1/4) * sum_{k=0}^{3} F(k) W_4^{-nk}`. Note that `W_4^{-1} = j`.\n\n    *   **Finding `x(n)` from `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`:**\n        We recognize that `X(k) = (j)^k = (W_4^3)^k`. This is a standard DFT pair corresponding to a shifted delta function. `DFT{δ(n-n₀)} = W_N^{n₀k}`. Here, `N=4` and `n₀=3`.\n        Thus, `x(n) = δ(n-3)`.\n        `x(n) = [0, 0, 0, 1]`\n\n    *   **Finding `h(n)` from `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`:**\n        `h(0) = (1/4)[H(0)+H(1)+H(2)+H(3)] = (1/4)[0 + (1+j) + 1 + (1-j)] = 3/4`.\n        `h(1) = (1/4)[H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^{-1} + H(2)W_4^{-2} + H(3)W_4^{-3}] = (1/4)[0 + (1+j)(j) + (1)(-1) + (1-j)(-j)] = (1/4)[j-1 - 1 -j-1] = -3/4`.\n        `h(2) = (1/4)[H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^{-2} + H(2)W_4^{-4} + H(3)W_4^{-6}] = (1/4)[0 + (1+j)(-1) + (1)(1) + (1-j)(-1)] = (1/4)[-1-j + 1 -1+j] = -1/4`.\n        `h(3) = (1/4)[H(0)W_4^0 + H(1)W_4^{-3} + H(2)W_4^{-6} + H(3)W_4^{-9}] = (1/4)[0 + (1+j)(-j) + (1)(-1) + (1-j)(j)] = (1/4)[-j+1 - 1 +j+1] = 1/4`.\n        `h(n) = [3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4]`.\n\n4.  **Construct the Aliased Sequence `z(n)`:**\n    *   First, write out the 8-point sequence `y(n)`:\n        `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n        `y(n) = {0, 3/4, 0, -3/4, 0, -1/4, 1, 1/4}`.\n    *   Now, create the 4-point aliased sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n        `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n        `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 2/4 = 0.5`\n        `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n        `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -3/4 + 1/4 = -2/4 = -0.5`\n        So, `z(n) = [0, 0.5, 1, -0.5]`.\n\n5.  **Compute the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`:**\n    *   Let the result be `Y_4(k)`. We use the DFT formula `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} z(n) W_4^{nk}`.\n    *   `Y_4(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1`.\n    *   `Y_4(1) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^1 + z(2)W_4^2 + z(3)W_4^3 = 0 + (0.5)(-j) + (1)(-1) + (-0.5)(j) = -0.5j - 1 - 0.5j = -1 - j`.\n    *   `Y_4(2) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^2 + z(2)W_4^4 + z(3)W_4^6 = 0 + (0.5)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-0.5)(-1) = -0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 1`.\n    *   `Y_4(3) = z(0)W_4^0 + z(1)W_4^3 + z(2)W_4^6 + z(3)W_4^9 = 0 + (0.5)(j) + (1)(-1) + (-0.5)(-j) = 0.5j - 1 + 0.5j = -1 + j`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the sequence is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
