    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the equilibrium point of the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Classical Game\n\nFirst, we analyze the game in its classical form. The payoff matrix is:\n```\n          Player B\n         Cooperate    Defect\n       +-----------+-----------+\nAlice  |           |           |\nCooperate|  (5, 5)   |  (0, 7)   |\n       |           |           |\n       +-----------+-----------+\n       |           |           |\nDefect |  (7, 0)   |  (1, 1)   |\n       |           |           |\n       +-----------+-----------+\n```\n*   **Payoffs are (Alice's, Bob's).**\n*   **Alice's perspective:**\n    *   If Bob Cooperates, Alice is better off Defecting (7 > 5).\n    *   If Bob Defects, Alice is better off Defecting (1 > 0).\n*   **Bob's perspective:**\n    *   If Alice Cooperates, Bob is better off Defecting (7 > 5).\n    *   If Alice Defects, Bob is better off Defecting (1 > 0).\n\nFor both players, Defect (D) is the dominant strategy. This means that regardless of what the other player does, defecting always yields a better or equal outcome. The unique **Nash Equilibrium** in the classical game is therefore (Defect, Defect), leading to the payoff **(1, 1)**. The dilemma lies in the fact that this rational outcome is worse for both players than the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of **(5, 5)**.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Quantum Game\n\nTo see if this dilemma can be resolved, we move to a quantum mechanical framework, following the well-established Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The problem states that we can design the initial state for an optimal outcome. The standard and optimal choice is to prepare the players' qubits in a **maximally entangled state**. This is achieved by an entangling operator `J` acting on a base state like `|CC>`. The resulting state is a Bell state, for instance: `|ψ_i> = J|CC> = (1/√2)(|CC> + i|DD>)`.\n\n*   **Player Strategies:** The players' actions are no longer just C or D, but any valid quantum operation (a unitary transformation) on their respective qubit. We consider an expanded strategy set that includes the classical-like strategies `C` and `D`, plus a new, purely **quantum strategy `Q`**.\n    *   Cooperate (`C`): The \"do nothing\" strategy, represented by the Identity matrix `I`.\n    *   Defect (`D`): The classical \"bit-flip\" strategy, represented by the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x`.\n    *   Quantum (`Q`): A uniquely quantum strategy that involves a phase change, represented by the matrix `iσ_z`.\n\n*   **Outcome Calculation:** The final state of the game is determined by the players' chosen strategies (`U_A` for Alice, `U_B` for Bob) and the initial entangled state. The final probabilities of measuring `|CC>`, `|CD>`, `|DC>`, or `|DD>` are calculated, and the expected payoffs are determined from these probabilities.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Payoffs in the Quantum Game\n\nBy calculating the expected payoffs for all nine combinations of strategies from the set {C, D, Q}, we can construct a new 3x3 payoff matrix for the quantum version of the game.\n\nThe calculations (which involve quantum mechanical formulas) yield the following payoff matrix for this specific setup:\n\n| Alice \\ Bob | Cooperate (C) | Defect (D) | Quantum (Q) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Cooperate (C)** | (5, 5) | (0, 7) | (5, 5) |\n| **Defect (D)** | (7, 0) | (1, 1) | (0, 7) |\n| **Quantum (Q)** | (5, 5) | (7, 0) | (5, 5) |\n\n### Step 4: Find the Equilibrium in the Quantum Game\n\nNow, we find the Nash Equilibrium in this new 3x3 game. An equilibrium is a cell in the matrix from which neither player has a unilateral incentive to move.\n\n*   **Is (D, D) still an equilibrium?** The payoff is (1, 1). Let's look from Alice's perspective. If Bob plays D, Alice gets 1. If she unilaterally switches her strategy to Q, her payoff would be 7 (from the (Q, D) cell). Since 7 > 1, she has a strong incentive to switch. Therefore, **(D, D) is no longer a Nash Equilibrium.** The classical equilibrium has been eliminated.\n\n*   **Is (Q, Q) a new equilibrium?** The payoff is (5, 5). Let's look from Alice's perspective. If Bob plays Q, Alice gets 5.\n    *   If she unilaterally switches to C, her payoff is still 5 (from the (C, Q) cell). She does not gain.\n    *   If she unilaterally switches to D, her payoff becomes 0 (from the (D, Q) cell). She loses.\n    Since there is no move that improves her payoff, she has no incentive to switch. By symmetry, the same logic applies to Bob. Therefore, **(Q, Q) is a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy playing the Prisoner's Dilemma in quantum space with an optimally designed entangled initial state, the paradox is resolved. The suboptimal classical equilibrium at (1, 1) disappears, and a new, stable Nash Equilibrium emerges. This new equilibrium corresponds to both players choosing the quantum strategy `Q`. The equilibrium point, defined by the payoffs at this stable outcome, is the Pareto-optimal result that was inaccessible in the classical game.\n\nThe equilibrium point is **(5, 5)**.\n\n<<(5, 5)>>>"
