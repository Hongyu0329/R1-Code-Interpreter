    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   To factor 589, we test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. Trying 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all distinct.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The conductor is a square-free integer (a product of distinct primes). This simplifies the conditions for primitivity.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Structure of the Character Group\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n*   **Primitivity Condition:** For a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive. A character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal (trivial) character. This means the order of each $\\chi_i$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Order Condition:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Possible Orders for Component Characters\nFrom the two conditions:\n1.  **Primitivity:** $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) = k_i > 1$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n2.  **Overall Order:** $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. This implies that each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\nCombining these, the possible orders for each component character $\\chi_i$ are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We must ensure that characters of these orders exist for each prime modulus.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Available Component Characters\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, the number of elements of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $n$.\n\nLet's check this for each prime factor:\n*   **For $p_1=7$**: The character group has order $\\phi(7)=6$. The orders $k_1 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **For $p_2=13$**: The character group has order $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders $k_2 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 12.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **For $p_3=19$**: The character group has order $\\phi(19)=18$. The orders $k_3 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 18.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **For $p_4=31$**: The character group has order $\\phi(31)=30$. The orders $k_4 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ all divide 30.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** For each prime factor $p_i$, the number of available characters with orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is the same. For each $i$, we have $1+2+2 = 5$ choices for the character $\\chi_i$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Choices Using Combinatorics\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ for each $i$, and the additional condition $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$ is met.\n\nThis lcm condition is satisfied if and only if:\n(a) At least one order $k_i$ is divisible by 2 (i.e., is 2 or 6).\n(b) At least one order $k_j$ is divisible by 3 (i.e., is 3 or 6).\n\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$ with order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nThe number of choices for each position is $1 (\\text{order } 2) + 2 (\\text{order } 3) + 2 (\\text{order } 6) = 5$.\nThe total number of tuples in $S$ is $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we subtract the tuples that do not satisfy the lcm condition. The condition fails if:\n*   (Case A) None of the orders $k_i$ are divisible by 2. This means all $k_i$ must be 3.\n*   (Case B) None of the orders $k_j$ are divisible by 3. This means all $k_j$ must be 2.\n\nLet's calculate the number of tuples for each failure case:\n*   **Case A:** All orders $k_i=3$. For each position $i$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   **Case B:** All orders $k_i=2$. For each position $i$, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The sets of tuples for Case A and Case B are disjoint. A tuple cannot have all its orders equal to 3 and simultaneously all its orders equal to 2. Therefore, the number of tuples to be excluded is simply the sum of the numbers for Case A and Case B.\n\nNumber of failing tuples = (Number of tuples for Case A) + (Number of tuples for Case B) = $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe final number of valid primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of tuples minus the failing ones:\nNumber = $|S|$ - (Number of failing tuples) = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
