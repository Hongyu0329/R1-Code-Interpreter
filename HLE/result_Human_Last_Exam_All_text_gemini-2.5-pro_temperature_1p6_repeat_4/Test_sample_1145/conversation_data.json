    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Wave Function:**\n    The system is a particle in a one-dimensional box of length `a`. The normalized wave function for a particle in the n-th energy state is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    The problem specifies the quantum number `n = 2`. Therefore, the wave function for this state is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density Function:**\n    The probability density, `P(x)`, is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|²`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|² = (sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n3.  **Set up the Probability Integral:**\n    The probability of finding the particle in a specific interval `[x₁, x₂]` is found by integrating the probability density function over that interval.\n    Given interval: `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n    `Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] P(x) dx`\n    `Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Interval and the Integrand:**\n    The interval width is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small fraction (1%) of the total box length. The interval is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\n    For `n = 2`, the probability density `P(x) = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a)` has a node (a point where the probability is zero) at the center of the box, `x = 0.5a`, because `sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0`.\n    Since the interval is very small and centered at a node, we expect the probability to be very small. A direct approximation like `P(0.5a) * Δx` would incorrectly yield zero. A more careful approximation is needed.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Integral using an Approximation:**\n    Because the integration interval is small, we can approximate the `sin` function. Let's make a substitution `u = x - 0.5a` to center the integral at `u=0`. The limits of integration become `u₁ = -0.005a` and `u₂ = 0.005a`.\n    The integrand becomes: `(2/a) * sin²(2π(u + 0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a + π)`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, it follows that `sin²(θ + π) = sin²(θ)`.\n    So, the integral becomes: `Prob = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu / a) du`\n    Within this small interval, the argument of the sine function, `θ = 2πu/a`, is very small. We can therefore use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    The integrand is approximated as: `(2/a) * (2πu / a)² = (8π² / a³) * u²`\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Approximated Integral:**\n    Now we solve the much simpler integral:\n    `Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π² / a³) * u² du`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² / a³) * [u³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`.\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [2 * (0.005a)³]`\n    `Prob ≈ (16π² / (3a³)) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n    The `a³` terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    `Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    Using `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `Prob ≈ (157.9136 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `Prob ≈ 52.6378 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)`\n    `Prob ≈ 6.5797 x 10⁻⁶`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Normalization:** Always ensure you are using the correctly normalized wave function, which is `sqrt(2/a)` for the 1D box.\n*   **Correct Quantum Number:** Use the given `n=2`, not `n=1`. The probability distribution is very different for different `n`.\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ` is valid because the interval `Δx` is small.\n*   **Approximation at a Node:** When the interval is centered on a node (a zero) of the function, the simple approximation `f(x_center) * Δx` fails. A Taylor expansion (which is what we implicitly did with the small angle approximation) is required.\n*   **Units:** The final probability must be a dimensionless quantity, which it is, as the length unit `a` cancels out during the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the specified interval is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
