    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Rule Activation Level:** In fuzzy logic, this term can sometimes refer to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part). However, when the context includes a consequent membership value and a t-norm, it typically refers to the result of the implication step, which determines the shape or value of the output fuzzy set for that rule.\n    *   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This is a highly complex type of fuzzy set used to model high levels of uncertainty. However, the problem provides simplified, crisp (single number) values, which means the calculation will not involve the full complexity of IT3 FSs. We can treat the problem as a standard fuzzy logic calculation where the given values are scalar.\n    *   **Φ_k(x′) = 0.7:** This represents the firing strength of the antecedent part of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. It indicates the degree to which the \"IF\" condition of the rule is met, with a value of 0.7.\n    *   **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9:** This represents the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part of the rule). It tells us that the value `y_j` belongs to the consequent set with a degree of 0.9.\n    *   **T-norm Operation:** A t-norm is a function used to model a fuzzy logical `AND`. In the context of fuzzy rule implication (like the Mamdani method), a t-norm is used to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function. This process \"scales\" or \"cuts\" the consequent set based on how strongly the rule was fired.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The goal is to calculate the value of the output fuzzy set from rule `k` at point `y_j`. This is achieved by applying a t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership grade at that point.\n\n    *   `Output_k(y_j) = t-norm ( Antecedent_Firing_Strength, Consequent_Membership_Grade(y_j) )`\n    *   `Output_k(y_j) = t-norm ( Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j) )`\n\n3.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   **Simplification:** The problem is simplified from a true IT3 FS context to a calculation with crisp numbers. The complex nature of IT3 FSs does not affect the final calculation based on the given values.\n    *   **Choice of T-norm:** The question does not specify which t-norm to use. The two most common t-norms in fuzzy systems are:\n        1.  **Minimum (min) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most common t-norm, used in the standard Mamdani fuzzy inference method.\n        2.  **Product (prod) t-norm:** `t(a, b) = a * b`. This is another widely used t-norm.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Given that a t-norm operation is explicitly mentioned to combine the antecedent and consequent values, we are calculating the result of the implication, not simply reporting the antecedent firing level.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    We will perform the calculation using the most common t-norm, the **minimum** operator.\n\n    *   **Given values:**\n        *   `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n        *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   **Applying the minimum t-norm:**\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n        *   `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n    If the product t-norm were used instead, the result would be `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, the minimum operator is the standard and most fundamental choice.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe rule activation level resulting from the fuzzy implication is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership value. Using the standard minimum t-norm, we combine the given values of 0.7 and 0.9. The minimum of these two values is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
