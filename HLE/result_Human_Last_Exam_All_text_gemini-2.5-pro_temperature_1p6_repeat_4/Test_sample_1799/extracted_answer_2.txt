No, it is not true. The second postulate is an independent axiom that cannot be derived from the first. The first postulate (the principle of relativity) is also a foundation of classical Galilean physics, which predicts that velocities are relative, including the velocity of light. It is only by adding the second postulate as a separate, independent requirement—that the speed of light is constant—that one is forced to abandon Galilean relativity and derive the new physics of special relativity.
