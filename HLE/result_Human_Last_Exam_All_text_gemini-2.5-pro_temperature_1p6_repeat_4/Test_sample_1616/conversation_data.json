    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change in English. The basic rule is that a long vowel becomes short when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\nFor this rule to apply, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The word must be at least three syllables long.\n2.  The vowel in question must have been a long vowel at some point in its history before it was shortened.\n\nThe question asks which of the given words has **not** undergone this process. This means we are looking for a word that either:\na) Is not three syllables long, making the rule inapplicable in its modern form.\nb) Never had a long vowel in its root syllable to be shortened in the first place.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nLet's examine each word based on its etymology and structure to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing. We look for a related base word with a long vowel that corresponds to a short vowel in the given word.\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (from Old English `sūþ`, with a long vowel /uː/ which became /aʊ/ after the Great Vowel Shift).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `southern` has two syllables (`south-ern`). The vowel /aʊ/ in `south` shortens to /ʌ/ in `southern`. While a shortening has occurred, the word is only two syllables long, so this is not an example of *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (from Latin `dērīvāre`, with a long vowel `ī`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /aɪ/ in `derive` (de-**rive**) becomes the short vowel /ɪ/ in the four-syllable word `derivative` (de-**riv**-a-tive). This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (from Latin `serēnus`, with a long vowel `ē`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /iː/ in `serene` (se-**rene**) becomes the short vowel /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word `serenity` (se-**ren**-i-ty). This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (from Old French `plaisir`, from Latin `placēre`, with a long vowel `ē`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /iː/ in `please` becomes the short vowel /ɛ/ in `pleasant` (`pleas-ant`). Like `southern`, a shortening has occurred, but the resulting word has only two syllables. Therefore, this is not an instance of *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word:** `grate` (related to Latin `grātus`, with a long vowel `ā`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /eɪ/ in `grate` becomes the short vowel /æ/ in the three-syllable word `gratitude` (**grat**-i-tude). The vowel is in the third syllable from the end. This is a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade` (from Old English `scead`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `shadow` comes from Old English `sceadu`. In `sceadu`, the first vowel (`æ`) was **short**. It never had a long vowel. The related word `shade` acquired its long vowel later in Middle English. Since `shadow` always had a short vowel in its historical form, it could not have undergone a process of *shortening*.\n\n### Step 3: Conclude and Select the Final Answer\n\nWe have three words (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`) that do not fit the trisyllabic laxing rule as it applies to words of three or more syllables. However, `southern` and `pleasant` both derive from roots that *did* have long vowels, and a shortening process of some kind has occurred.\n\nThe word **shadow** is unique in this list because its historical root (Old English `sceadu`) always had a short vowel. Since trisyllabic laxing is a process of shortening a *long* vowel, it could not have applied to `shadow`, which never had a long vowel to begin with. Therefore, it is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone this sound change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
