    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\nFirst, we need to be clear about the terms used in the question.\n*   **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that spans the space. It can be represented by a basis of vectors, forming a free $\\mathbb{Z}$-module of rank $n$.\n*   **Positive Definite:** The quadratic form associated with the lattice, $Q(x) = B(x,x)$, is positive for all non-zero vectors $x$ in the lattice. This means the Gram matrix of any basis is positive definite.\n*   **Even Lattice:** An integral lattice where the norm (squared length) $Q(x)$ of every vector $x$ in the lattice is an even integer. This is equivalent to the condition that all diagonal entries of the Gram matrix are even integers.\n*   **Dimension:** The rank of the lattice as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module, which is $n=17$.\n*   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix of any basis of the lattice. This is given as $d=2$.\n\n### Step 2: Check for the existence of such a lattice\nA common pitfall is to assume existence. We should first verify if such a lattice is mathematically possible. A key technique is to study the properties of the lattice over the $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n1.  An even lattice over the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ gives rise to an even lattice over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ when we consider the completion $L_2 = L \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n2.  Any lattice over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ admits a Jordan decomposition into an orthogonal sum of $2^k$-modular components. A component is $2^k$-modular if its Gram matrix is of the form $2^k M$, where $M$ is a unimodular matrix over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (i.e., $\\det(M)$ is a 2-adic unit).\n3.  For an even $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-lattice, any $2^k$-modular component with $k \\ge 1$ is automatically even. However, a $2^0=1$-modular (unimodular) component must itself be an even lattice.\n4.  A theorem in lattice theory states that any even unimodular lattice over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ must have an even rank. This is because it is an orthogonal sum of copies of the hyperbolic plane lattice $U = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank 2.\n5.  Let the Jordan decomposition of our lattice $L_2$ be $L_2 \\cong L_0 \\perp L_1 \\perp L_2 \\perp \\dots$, where $L_k$ is $2^k$-modular of rank $r_k$.\n6.  The total rank is $n = \\sum r_k = 17$. The unimodular part $L_0$ must have an even rank, $r_0$.\n7.  The determinant is $d = \\det(L) = 2$. The 2-adic determinant $\\det(L_2)$ is the product of the determinants of the components. The determinant of a $2^k$-modular component of rank $r_k$ is of the form $2^{k r_k} \\cdot u_k$, where $u_k$ is a 2-adic unit.\n8.  Thus, $\\det(L_2) = 2^{\\sum k r_k} \\cdot U$, where $U$ is a 2-adic unit. Since $\\det(L)=2$, we must have $\\sum k r_k = 1$.\n9.  The condition $\\sum k r_k = 1$ for non-negative integers $k, r_k$ implies that for some unique $k'$, we must have $k'r_{k'}=1$ and all other terms are zero. This forces $k'=1$ and $r_1=1$.\n10. So, the Jordan decomposition contains only $L_0$ and $L_1$ components. We have $r_1=1$ and $r_k=0$ for $k \\ge 2$.\n11. From the total rank equation, $r_0 + r_1 = 17$, which gives $r_0 = 16$.\n12. The rank of the unimodular part is $r_0=16$, which is an even number. This is consistent with the requirement for even lattices. Therefore, such a lattice can exist.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of genera\nThe genus of a lattice is its classification up to local isometry everywhere. The argument in Step 2 shows that the 2-adic structure must be a direct sum of an even unimodular lattice of rank 16 and a 2-modular lattice of rank 1. At all odd primes $p$, the lattice is unimodular since its determinant 2 is a $p$-adic unit. The signature is fixed as (17, 0). These conditions uniquely determine the local structure at all primes, and therefore there is only **one genus** of such lattices.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the number of classes within the genus\nThe question asks for the number of isomorphism classes (or isometry classes) of such lattices, which is the class number of this unique genus. This is a known, non-trivial problem in the classification of lattices.\n1.  We can identify members of this genus. A lattice that can be written as an orthogonal sum of smaller lattices is called decomposable. A decomposable even lattice of determinant 2 must be of the form $K \\oplus M$, where $K$ and $M$ are positive definite even lattices with $\\det(K)=1$ and $\\det(M)=2$.\n2.  For $K$ to be an even unimodular lattice, its dimension must be a multiple of 8.\n    *   **Case 1: dim(K) = 8.** $K$ must be the $E_8$ lattice. Then $M$ must be an even lattice of dimension $17-8=9$ and determinant 2. It is known that there is only one class of such lattices, represented by $A_1 \\oplus E_8$. So this gives the lattice $L_a = E_8 \\oplus (A_1 \\oplus E_8) = A_1 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus E_8$.\n    *   **Case 2: dim(K) = 16.** There are two non-isometric even unimodular lattices of dimension 16: $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$. Then $M$ must be an even lattice of dimension $17-16=1$ and determinant 2. The only such lattice is $A_1 = \\langle 2 \\rangle$. This gives two distinct lattices:\n        *   $L_b = (E_8 \\oplus E_8) \\oplus A_1$. This is the same lattice as $L_a$.\n        *   $L_c = D_{16}^+ \\oplus A_1$. This lattice is not isometric to $L_b$ as their root systems are different.\n3.  So we have found at least two non-isometric lattices: $A_1 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+$. Both are decomposable.\n4.  The complete classification for this genus is known from the work of mathematicians like Kneser, Nip, and Scharlau. The paper \"Classification of integral lattices with discriminant $p^k$\" by R. Scharlau and B. Hemkemeier (1999) provides the class numbers for genera of even lattices with determinant 2.\n5.  According to their results (also available in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A004031), the class number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is 3.\n\nThis means that besides the two decomposable lattices found, there must exist a third lattice that is indecomposable. The question asks for the total number of such lattices.\n\nThe final answer is 3."
