Therefore, the answer should list both numbers found.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to ensure the information is for the \"Teva\" brand specifically, as other manufacturers of generic fluoxetine will use different imprints.\n*   The query specifies capsules, not tablets.\n*   The analysis must exclude information about color, size, and any other brand names or words explicitly forbidden by the user's request (such as \"PLIVA\"). The response will focus solely on the numerical identifiers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the different numbers on the specified capsules are 7193 and 3105.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is 7193, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 3105.>>>"
