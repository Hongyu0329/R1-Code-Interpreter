The conditions for the functions to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:

1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**. Let their respective distance functions be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.

2.  **Joint Contraction Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a contraction inequality. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, and for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:

    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`
    `≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`

If these two conditions are met, then there exists a unique triplet `(x*, y*, z*)` in `X × Y × Z` such that `F(x*, y*, z*) = x*`, `G(y*, x*, y*) = y*`, and `H(z*, y*, x*) = z*`.
