    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The request asks for two pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita*: its currently used common name within its native range (North America) and the year that common name was coined. The final answer must follow the format `<name>, <year>`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Common Name:**\n    *   The genus *Perdita* is a very large group of small to minute bees native to the deserts and arid regions of North America.\n    *   Due to their diminutive size (some are less than 2 mm long) and often iridescent, metallic sheen, they have been given a descriptive common name.\n    *   A search of modern entomological resources, including the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, university extension publications, and popular field guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016), confirms that the most widely accepted and used common name for the genus *Perdita* is **\"fairy bees\"**. Other less specific names like \"dwarf mining bees\" exist, but \"fairy bees\" is the most distinctive and prevalent name for the genus as a whole.\n\n3.  **Determine the Coining Year:**\n    *   Unlike formal scientific names, common names often emerge gradually and their \"coining\" can be difficult to pinpoint to a single event. The best approach is to find the earliest significant, citable publication that introduces or popularizes the name in the scientific or public sphere.\n    *   The term \"fairy bees\" is often attributed in entomological circles to melittologists (bee scientists) like Jerome G. Rozen, Jr. of the American Museum of Natural History, who may have used it informally or in museum displays before it appeared in major publications.\n    *   To find a formal \"coining\" date, we must look for its first appearance in a major, authoritative text.\n    *   The seminal, encyclopedic work **\"The Bees of the World\" by Charles D. Michener**, is a primary global reference for bee taxonomy. In the first edition, published in **2000**, Michener formally documented the name. On page 320, he writes: \"Because of their minute size and often bright metallic coloration, species of *Perdita* are sometimes referred to as “fairy bees.”\"\n    *   While the name may have existed colloquially among specialists before this, Michener's 2000 publication represents its first formal introduction and documentation in the definitive bee text of the modern era. This serves as the most robust and verifiable date for when the name was established in the broader scientific literature. Subsequent popular works have solidified its use.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   **Name:** Fairy bees (capitalized as it is treated as a proper name for the group in influential texts).\n    *   **Year:** 2000 (the year of publication of \"The Bees of the World,\" 1st edition, which documented the name).\n    *   **Combined and formatted:** Fairy bees, 2000\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2000>>>"
