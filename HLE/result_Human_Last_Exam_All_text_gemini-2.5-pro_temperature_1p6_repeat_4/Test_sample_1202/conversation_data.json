    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks about the evolutionary fate of genes after a duplication event. Specifically, it seeks the mechanism that explains two outcomes:\n1.  **Retention:** Why are both copies of the gene kept in the genome instead of one being lost?\n2.  **Divergence:** Why do the two copies change over time to become different from each other?\n\nAfter a gene is duplicated, one copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function. The second copy is redundant and free from the usual purifying selection. This makes it vulnerable to accumulating disabling mutations and becoming a non-functional pseudogene. For both copies to be retained, there must be a selective advantage to keeping them.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where a DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, resulting in them becoming identical. Gene conversion acts to homogenize duplicate genes, working *against* divergence. Therefore, it does not explain how duplicate genes diverge and are retained for different functions.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates inactivating mutations and becomes non-functional. This is the most common fate for duplicate genes, but it represents the *loss* of the duplicate, not its *retention* in a functional form. Thus, it does not explain the retention aspect of the question.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that eventually result in a new, beneficial function. This mechanism explains both retention (as both genes are now useful) and divergence (as they have different functions). However, it relies on a rare event—the acquisition of a new beneficial function—happening before the redundant copy is lost through pseudogenization.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in different tissues/at different times (i.e., it had multiple subfunctions). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that degrade different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose subfunction A while retaining subfunction B, and copy 2 might lose subfunction B while retaining subfunction A. As a result, both copies are now required to perform the full set of the original gene's functions. This \"complementation\" ensures the retention of both copies. This mechanism explains both retention (both copies are now necessary) and divergence (they have specialized and lost different parts of the ancestral function).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism for the retention and divergence of individual genes within a genome. It operates at the level of species, not genes.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the valid mechanisms (C and D) and determine which is \"most likely\".**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are valid and recognized mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" one.\n\nThe primary challenge for a newly duplicated gene is to avoid being lost to pseudogenization.\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare gain-of-function mutation to occur in the redundant gene before a more common loss-of-function mutation inactivates it.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** relies on common loss-of-function mutations happening in a complementary fashion across the two duplicates. Because losing function is a much more frequent event than gaining a new one, this model provides a more probable pathway for the initial preservation of both copies. Once both copies are preserved because they are both necessary, they are locked in and have ample evolutionary time to diverge further.\n\nTherefore, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization a more common and thus \"more likely\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes, as it provides a plausible way to escape the fate of pseudogenization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization provides a more probable pathway for the retention of duplicate genes than neofunctionalization because it relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) to make both copies indispensable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
