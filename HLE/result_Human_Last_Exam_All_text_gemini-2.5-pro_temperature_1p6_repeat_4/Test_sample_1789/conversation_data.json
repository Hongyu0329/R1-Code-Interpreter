    "Answering this question involves concepts from extremal set theory applied to the poset of integers under division.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    The question asks for the size of the largest possible union of 20 antichains in the set of integers $S = \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ where $N = 823564528378596$, ordered by divisibility.\n\n2.  **Reformulating the Problem using Dilworth's Theorem:**\n    A key result in poset theory is the dual of Dilworth's theorem (also known as Mirsky's theorem). It states that the minimum number of antichains needed to partition a poset is equal to the length of the longest chain in the poset.\n    A generalization of this states that a subset of a poset is a union of $k$ antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length $k+1$.\n    In our case, we are looking for the largest union of 20 antichains. This is equivalent to finding the size of the largest subset of $\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ that does not contain a chain of length 21. A chain of length 21 is a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{21}$ such that $a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_{21}$.\n\n3.  **Constructing Antichains:**\n    A well-known way to partition the set $[1, N]$ into antichains is to use the sets $C_j$ defined as:\n    $C_j = \\{m \\in [1, N] \\mid \\lfloor N/m \\rfloor = j\\}$, for $j = 1, 2, ...$\n    Each set $C_j$ is an antichain. To prove this, suppose for contradiction that there are two elements $a, b \\in C_j$ with $a < b$ and $a|b$. This implies $b = k \\cdot a$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$.\n    From $a, b \\in C_j$, we have $j \\le N/a < j+1$ and $j \\le N/b < j+1$.\n    Substituting $b=ka$, we get $j \\le N/(ka) < j+1$.\n    This means $N/a < (j+1)k$.\n    Also, from $j \\le N/a$, we get $k \\cdot j \\le k \\cdot (N/a)$.\n    Combining these, we have $j \\le N/b < (j+1)/k$. Since $k \\ge 2$, this gives $j < (j+1)/2$, which implies $2j < j+1$, or $j < 1$. This is a contradiction, as $j$ must be at least 1. Thus, each $C_j$ is an antichain.\n\n4.  **Finding the Largest Union:**\n    The sets $C_j$ form a partition of $[1, N]$. To find the largest union of 20 antichains, a natural strategy (and a conjectured optimal one for this problem) is to take the union of the 20 largest of these antichains $C_j$.\n    Let's find the size of $C_j$:\n    $|C_j| = |\\{m \\mid j \\le N/m < j+1\\}| = |\\{m \\mid N/(j+1) < m \\le N/j\\}|$\n    $|C_j| = \\lfloor N/j \\rfloor - \\lfloor N/(j+1) \\rfloor$.\n    Approximating, $|C_j| \\approx (N/j) - (N/(j+1)) = N/(j(j+1))$.\n    This size is a decreasing function of $j$. Therefore, the 20 largest antichains in this family are $C_1, C_2, ..., C_{20}$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Size of the Union:**\n    The union of these 20 antichains is $U = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup ... \\cup C_{20}$.\n    This corresponds to the set of all integers $m \\in [1, N]$ such that $\\lfloor N/m \\rfloor$ is one of $\\{1, 2, ..., 20\\}$.\n    This condition can be written as $1 \\le \\lfloor N/m \\rfloor \\le 20$.\n    The inequality $1 \\le \\lfloor N/m \\rfloor$ is true for any $m \\le N$.\n    The inequality $\\lfloor N/m \\rfloor \\le 20$ means $N/m < 21$, which rearranges to $m > N/21$.\n    So, the set is $U = \\{m \\in [1, N] \\mid m > N/21\\}$.\n    The number of elements in this set is:\n    $|U| = \\lfloor N \\rfloor - \\lfloor N/21 \\rfloor = N - \\lfloor N/21 \\rfloor$.\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We are given $N = 823564528378596$.\n    First, we need to calculate $\\lfloor N/21 \\rfloor$:\n    $823564528378596 \\div 21 = 39217358494218.857...$\n    So, $\\lfloor N/21 \\rfloor = 39217358494218$.\n\n    Now, we find the size of the union:\n    Size = $N - \\lfloor N/21 \\rfloor$\n    Size = $823564528378596 - 39217358494218$\n\n    Let's perform the subtraction:\n      823564528378596\n    -  39217358494218\n    ------------------\n      784347169884378\n\n    So, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is 784,347,169,884,378.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{784347169884378}$.\n<<<784347169884378>>>"
