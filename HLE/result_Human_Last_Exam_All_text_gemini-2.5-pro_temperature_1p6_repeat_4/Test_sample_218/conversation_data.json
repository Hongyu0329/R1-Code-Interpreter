    "An irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. The dimension of the irreducible representation corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe key properties we will use are:\n1.  The dimension of an irreducible representation $d_\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the representation corresponding to the conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n2.  Representations corresponding to partitions that are \"hook-like\" (i.e., have only one row or one column of length greater than 1) tend to have smaller dimensions. As the Young diagram becomes \"fatter\" or more centrally balanced, the dimension generally increases.\n\nWe will systematically list partitions of 25 and compute their corresponding dimensions. We can focus on partitions where the first part $\\lambda_1$ is large, as their conjugates will cover the cases where the number of parts is large.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nWe will list partitions $\\lambda$ starting with the largest possible first part, $\\lambda_1$, and check if their dimension $d_\\lambda$ is less than 500,000. For each such partition found, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ will also have a dimension less than 500,000. We need to count both unless the partition is self-conjugate (where $\\lambda=\\lambda'$).\n\nLet's compute the dimensions for partitions $\\lambda$ of 25, starting with large $\\lambda_1$:\n\n**1. $\\lambda_1 = 25$**\n*   $\\lambda = (25)$: $d_{(25)} = 1$. This is the trivial representation. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, the sign representation, which also has $d_{(1^{25})}=1$. This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n**2. $\\lambda_1 = 24$**\n*   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension. This gives us 2 more irreps.\n\n**3. $\\lambda_1 = 23$**\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n*   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$: $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\nBoth have dimensions < 500,000. Their conjugates, $(2^2, 1^{21})$ and $(3, 1^{22})$, also do. This gives us 4 more irreps.\n\n**4. $\\lambda_1 = 22$**\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2000$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = 2024$.\nAll have dimensions < 500,000. This adds $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps.\n\n**5. $\\lambda_1 = 21$**\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1^2)$: $d_{(21,2,1^2)} = 52,500$.\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\nAll have dimensions < 500,000. This adds $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps.\n\n**6. $\\lambda_1 = 20$**\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164,220$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1^2)$: $d_{(20,3,1^2)} = 371,800$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 288,750$.\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: $d_{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\nAll have dimensions < 500,000. This adds $6 \\times 2 = 12$ irreps.\n\n**7. $\\lambda_1 = 19$**\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n*   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d_{(19,1^6)} = 134,596$.\nCalculations show that other partitions starting with 19, like $(19,5,1)$ ($d=514,800$) have dimensions greater than 500,000. So we have 2 partitions for $\\lambda_1=19$. This adds $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n**8. $\\lambda_1 = 18$**\n*   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$.\n*   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)} = 346,104$.\nOther partitions starting with 18 have larger dimensions. This adds $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n**9. $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$**\n*   Calculations for partitions starting with 17, such as $(17,8)$ and $(17,1^8)$, give dimensions greater than 500,000. Partitions that are \"less hook-like\" will have even larger dimensions. Thus, there are no more partitions with dimensions less than 500,000.\n\n**Summary of partitions:**\nWe have found the following number of partitions (listing only one from each conjugate pair):\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 25$: 1 partition, (25).\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 24$: 1 partition, (24,1).\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 23$: 2 partitions, (23,2) and (23,1^2).\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 22$: 3 partitions, (22,3), (22,2,1), (22,1^3).\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 21$: 5 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 20$: 6 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 19$: 2 partitions.\n*   From $\\lambda_1 = 18$: 2 partitions.\n\nTotal number of such partitions (up to conjugacy) is $1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 22$.\n\nNone of these 22 partitions are self-conjugate (i.e., for each $\\lambda$, $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$). Therefore, each partition corresponds to a unique conjugate pair.\n\nThe total number of irreducible representations is the number of these partitions multiplied by 2.\nTotal irreps = $22 \\times 2 = 44$."
