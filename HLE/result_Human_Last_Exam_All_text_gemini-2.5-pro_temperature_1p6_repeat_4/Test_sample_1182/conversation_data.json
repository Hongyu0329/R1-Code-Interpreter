    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Find a suitable model for the curve.**\nThe given equation is $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+8x$.\nThe coefficients are 2-adic integers, so this defines a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, this model may not be minimal, meaning the valuation of its discriminant might not be as small as possible. A better model can often simplify the analysis of the reduction.\n\nWe perform a change of variables. Let $x = X/2$ and $y=Y/2$.\n$(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n$Y^2/4 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n$Y^2/4 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\nMultiplying by 4, we get a new model with integral coefficients:\n$C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$.\nLet $f_1(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$. This model is birationally equivalent to the original one and will have the same stable reduction. This type of transformation often simplifies the root structure of the polynomial, which is key to determining the reduction type.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the roots of the polynomial $f_1(X)$.**\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$ is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the differences of the roots of $f(x)$. We first need to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f_1(X)$.\n$f_1(X) = X(X^4 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16)$.\nOne root is $R_1=0$.\nLet $g_1(X) = X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16$. We use the Newton polygon method for $g_1(X)$ with respect to the prime $p=2$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g_1(X)$ are:\n$v_2(1)=0$ (for $X^4$)\n$v_2(1)=0$ (for $X^3$)\n$v_2(2)=1$ (for $X^2$)\n$v_2(1)=0$ (for $X$)\n$v_2(16)=4$ (for the constant term)\n\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_{4-i}))$ where $a_j$ is the coefficient of $X^j$. The points are $(0, v_2(a_4))=(0,0)$, $(1, v_2(a_3))=(1,0)$, $(2, v_2(a_2))=(2,1)$, $(3, v_2(a_1))=(3,0)$, $(4, v_2(a_0))=(4,4)$. Re-indexing in standard form (i, v(coeff of x^i)):\nPoints are: $(4,0), (3,0), (2,1), (1,0), (0,4)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,4)$ to $(1,0)$. The slope is $(0-4)/(1-0) = -4$. The horizontal length is 1. This means there is one root, say $R_2$, with valuation $v_2(R_2) = -(-4) = 4$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,0)$ passing through $(3,0)$. The slope is $(0-0)/(4-1) = 0$. The horizontal length is 3. This indicates three roots, $R_3, R_4, R_5$, each with valuation $v_2(R_i) = -(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the roots of $f_1(X)$ are:\n- $R_1=0$\n- $R_2$, with $v_2(R_2)=4$.\n- $R_3, R_4, R_5$, with $v_2(R_3)=v_2(R_4)=v_2(R_5)=0$. These are 2-adic units.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pairwise valuations of root differences.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction depends on how the roots cluster 2-adically. This is measured by $v_2(R_i - R_j)$.\n-   $v_2(R_1 - R_2) = v_2(0 - R_2) = v_2(R_2) = 4$.\n-   For $i \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, $v_2(R_1 - R_i) = v_2(-R_i) = v_2(R_i) = 0$.\n-   For $i \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, $v_2(R_2 - R_i)$: Since $v_2(R_2)=4 > v_2(R_i)=0$, we have $v_2(R_2 - R_i) = \\min(v_2(R_2), v_2(R_i)) = 0$.\n-   For $i, j \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$ with $i \\neq j$: The roots $R_3, R_4, R_5$ are units. To see if they are distinct modulo 2, we check the reduction of $g_1(X)$ modulo 2:\n    $g_1(X) \\pmod 2 \\equiv X^4 + X^3 + X = X(X^3+X^2+1)$.\n    The roots of $g_1(X)$ with valuation 0 correspond to the non-zero roots of its reduction. The polynomial $X^3+X^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ and has three distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_8$. By Hensel's Lemma, these lift to three distinct roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, for $i,j \\in \\{3,4,5\\}, i \\ne j$, $R_i \\not\\equiv R_j \\pmod 2$, which implies $R_i-R_j$ is a 2-adic unit, so $v_2(R_i-R_j)=0$.\n\nThe only pair of roots $(R_i,R_j)$ with $v_2(R_i-R_j)>0$ is $(R_1,R_2)$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the number of double points.**\nFor a hyperelliptic curve whose stable reduction is semistable (i.e., has only ordinary double points as singularities), the number of double points $\\delta$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\delta = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 2g+2} \\lfloor \\frac{v_p(e_i - e_j)}{2} \\rfloor $$\nwhere $e_i$ are the roots of the polynomial. Even if the curve is not semistable over the base field, this formula often gives the number of double points of the stable reduction, which is by definition semistable. This is a standard recipe in the arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves.\n\nApplying this formula to our set of roots $R_1, ..., R_5$ and prime $p=2$:\n$$ \\delta = \\lfloor \\frac{v_2(R_1-R_2)}{2} \\rfloor + \\sum_{\\text{other pairs } (i,j)} \\lfloor \\frac{v_2(R_i-R_j)}{2} \\rfloor $$\nWe found that $v_2(R_1-R_2)=4$, and for all other pairs, the valuation of the difference is 0.\n$$ \\delta = \\lfloor \\frac{4}{2} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{0}{2} \\rfloor + \\dots + \\lfloor \\frac{0}{2} \\rfloor $$\n$$ \\delta = 2 + 0 + \\dots + 0 = 2 $$\nThe cluster of roots $\\{R_1, R_2\\}$ contributes 2 double points. The other roots are well-separated and do not contribute any double points.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points."
