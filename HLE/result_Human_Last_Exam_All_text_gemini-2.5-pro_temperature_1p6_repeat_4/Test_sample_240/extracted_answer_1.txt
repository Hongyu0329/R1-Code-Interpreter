The most common reason a functional MRI receive coil shows no resonance when probed with a VNA and a magnetic loop is that its **active decoupling circuit** is not being properly biased.

Modern MRI coils contain active circuits, typically using PIN diodes, to protect them from the high-power transmit pulse. These circuits require a specific DC bias voltage from the MRI scanner to put the coil into its high-Q (Quality Factor) "receive" mode. Without this DC bias, which is absent during a bench test, the coil defaults to a "decoupled" state. In this state, the PIN diodes are often conductive, which spoils the coil's Q-factor or shifts its resonance far from the operating frequency.

Essentially, you are testing the coil while it is in its self-protective "off" state. The coil is perfectly functional, but it requires the correct power and control signals from the scanner to become an active, resonant circuit.

Other possible, though often secondary, reasons include:
1.  **Incorrect Probe Positioning:** The probe might be placed in a magnetic field null of the coil, especially in complex phased array or quadrature coils.
2.  **Unpowered Preamplifier:** An unpowered preamplifier can present a low impedance to the coil, loading it down and killing its resonance.
