    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts based on the parameter `t`:\n\n*   **Part 1: For `t` in `[0, π]`**\n    *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$).\n    *   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    *   As `t` goes from `0` to `π`, `x` goes from `1` to `-1`, and `y = \\sin t` is always non-negative (`y ≥ 0`).\n    *   This part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of radius 1, centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Part 2: For `t` in `(π, 2π)`**\n    *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$).\n    *   These are parametric equations for an ellipse. We can write $x^2 = \\cos^2 t$ and $(y/5)^2 = \\sin^2 t$. Adding them gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$.\n    *   As `t` goes from `π` to `2π`, `x` goes from `-1` to `1`, and `y = 5\\sin t` is always negative (`y < 0`).\n    *   This part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse** with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis), centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Find the Bounding Box of the Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates. This will define the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Finding the range of `x`:**\n    *   The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n    *   The cosine function, over a full period, ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   The maximum value is $x_{max} = \\cos(0) = 1$.\n    *   The minimum value is $x_{min} = \\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Finding the range of `y`:**\n    *   We must consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is $y_{max1} = \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. The minimum value is $y_{min1} = \\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. The range for this part is `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, $y = 5\\sin t$. In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 down to -1 and back up to 0. So, $5\\sin t$ ranges from 0 down to -5. The minimum value is $y_{min2} = 5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = 5(-1) = -5$. The range for this part is `[-5, 0)`.\n    *   Combining the ranges from both parts, the overall maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The overall minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**3. Determine the Smallest Enclosing Square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that encloses this rectangle (and therefore the figure) must have a side length that is at least as large as both the width and the height.\n\n*   Side Length, `s` = `max(Width, Height)`\n*   `s` = `max(2, 6)`\n*   `s` = `6`\n\nSo, the smallest square that outcircles the figure has a side length of 6.\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = $s^2$\n*   Area = $6^2$\n*   Area = 36\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Piecewise Definition:** The most crucial point is recognizing that the curve's formula for `y` changes. This leads to a composite shape (half-circle and half-ellipse).\n*   **Bounding Box:** The key to finding the \"outcircling\" or \"enclosing\" square is to determine the figure's maximum extent in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions.\n*   **Side of the Square:** The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the larger of the figure's total width and total height.\n*   **Parameter vs. Coordinate:** It is important not to confuse the parameter `t` with the coordinates `x` and `y`. `t` is used to generate the points on the curve.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that the figure has a total width of 2 and a total height of 6. The smallest square that can enclose this shape must have a side length equal to the larger dimension, which is 6. The area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
