Yes. Based on the Generality Constraint, understanding `Fa` means you possess the general, recombinable concept of the property `F` (i.e., you understand the propositional function `Fx`). Since you are also given the premise that you understand the concept of universal quantification (`∀`), you possess all the necessary conceptual components to form and understand the proposition `∀x(Fx)`. The Generality Constraint's core idea is that concepts are compositional, so being able to combine the concept of `F` with the concept of `∀` is a direct consequence of the theory.
