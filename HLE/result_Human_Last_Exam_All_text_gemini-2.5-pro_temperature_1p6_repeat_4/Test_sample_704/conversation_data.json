    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the colors defining the range.**\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between two points on Newton's colour circle.\n*   The first point is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In both subtractive (pigment) and additive (light) color models, the intermediary color between yellow and blue is **Green**.\n*   The second point is the color **Blue** itself.\n*   Therefore, the specified range is from **Green** to **Blue**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's colour circle and its musical correspondence.**\nIsaac Newton, in his 1704 book *Opticks*, divided the circle of colors from the light spectrum into seven parts. He then drew an analogy between these seven colors and the seven notes of a Western musical scale.\n*   The seven colors are: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (ROYGBIV).\n*   The seven musical notes are from a diatonic scale. Newton specifically used the Dorian mode.\n\n**Step 3: Map the colors to the specific musical notes Newton used.**\nNewton's analogy, based on the Dorian mode starting on the note D, creates the following correspondence:\n*   Red → D\n*   Orange → E\n*   Yellow → F\n*   **Green → G**\n*   **Blue → A**\n*   Indigo → B\n*   Violet → C\n\n**Step 4: Determine the note for the specified range.**\nThe question asks for the single musical note that corresponds to the range *from Green to Blue*. This range on Newton's circle encompasses the sector for Green and the sector for Blue. The musical notes for this range are G and A. However, the question asks for a singular \"musical note\". Given the phrasing, \"the range between [Green]... and blue\", the most logical interpretation is to identify the note associated with the starting color of that range.\n*   The starting color is Green.\n*   The musical note corresponding to Green in Newton's system is **G**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correct Color Combination:** It is essential to correctly identify Green as the color between yellow and blue in this context.\n2.  **Newton's Specific Scale:** The answer must rely on Newton's specific model, which maps colors to the notes of the Dorian mode (D, E, F, G, A, B, C), not a standard major scale starting on C.\n3.  **Singular Answer:** The question asks for a single \"note\", not an interval or multiple notes. This requires interpreting the \"range\" as having a primary or starting note, which is G for Green.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the musical note for the beginning of the range described is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
