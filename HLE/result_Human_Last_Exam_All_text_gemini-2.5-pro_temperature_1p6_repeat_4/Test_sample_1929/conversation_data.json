    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, buta-1,3-diene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene, which acts as a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry and regiochemistry.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted reaction, forming two new sigma bonds and one new pi bond simultaneously.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This considers the orientation of the reactants when they combine. We have a symmetrical diene (butadiene) reacting with an unsymmetrical dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene).\n*   **Careful Point:** When one of the reactants is symmetrical, only one constitutional isomer (regioisomer) can be formed. It does not matter which end of the symmetrical diene attacks which end of the unsymmetrical dienophile; the resulting product molecule is the same. For example, if C1 of butadiene attacks the CCl₂ carbon, the product has a C1-CCl₂ bond. If C1 attacks the CF₂ carbon, the product has a C1-CF₂ bond. However, since butadiene is symmetrical, we can relabel its ends (C1 becomes C4 and vice versa). Relabeling the second product makes it identical to the first. Therefore, only one product is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n1.  The four carbons of butadiene and the two carbons of the ethene derivative form a six-membered ring.\n2.  The two double bonds of butadiene are consumed, and a new double bond is formed between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original diene. The product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n3.  The double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond. The CCl₂ and CF₂ groups remain attached to their respective carbons, which are now part of the cyclohexene ring and are adjacent to each other.\n4.  The terminal carbons of butadiene (C1 and C4) form bonds to the carbons of the dienophile.\n5.  The resulting connectivity in the ring is a sequence of atoms: -CH=CH-CH₂-C(X₂)-C(Y₂)-CH₂-, where {X₂, Y₂} = {Cl₂, F₂}. Let's draw the sequence explicitly: -CH=CH-CH₂-CCl₂-CF₂-CH₂-.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC name of the product.**\n1.  **Parent Ring:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is a cyclohexene.\n2.  **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be numbered C1 and C2. The numbering must then proceed around the ring in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n3.  **Locants:** The substituents (Cl and F atoms) are attached to the two carbons that came from the dienophile. These carbons are adjacent to the CH₂ groups of the ring, which are in turn adjacent to the double bond. This places the substituents at positions 4 and 5 of the cyclohexene ring. The locant set for the substituents is therefore {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n4.  **Tie-Breaking:** We have two possible ways to number the ring that result in the same locant set {4, 4, 5, 5}:\n    *   Path A: The CCl₂ group is at position 4, and the CF₂ group is at position 5. The name would be **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   Path B: The CF₂ group is at position 4, and the CCl₂ group is at position 5. The name would be **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n5.  **Alphabetical Priority:** When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that the numbering is chosen to give the alphabetically first substituent group the lower locant number.\n    *   The substituent prefixes are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\".\n    *   Alphabetically, \"dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the dichloro group must be assigned the lower locant, which is 4. This corresponds to Path A.\n6.  **Final Name:** The correct IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nFinal Answer Structure:\n```\n      CH=CH\n     /     \\\n  H2C       CH2\n   |         |\n  C(Cl2) -- C(F2)\n```\n*Note: The actual molecule is not planar, but this 2D representation correctly shows the connectivity and allows for proper IUPAC naming.*\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
