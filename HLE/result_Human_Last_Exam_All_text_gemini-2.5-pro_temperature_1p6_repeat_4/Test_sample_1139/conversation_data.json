    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the supersymmetric sigma-model for a specific symmetry class and calculating the dimension of its bosonic sector.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Supersymmetric Sigma-Model Target Space\n\nThe problem asks about the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of **symmetry class D**. According to the Altland-Zirnbauer classification and the corresponding sigma-model theory (developed by Efetov, Zirnbauer, and others), the target space for class D is the symmetric superspace:\n$$ M = \\frac{OSp(2n|2n)}{OSp(n|n) \\times OSp(n|n)} $$\nHere, `OSp` denotes the orthosymplectic supergroup. The parameter `n` corresponds to the number of replicas used in the model. The problem specifies **two replicas**, so we set `n=2`.\n\nThe target space is therefore:\n$$ M = \\frac{OSp(4|4)}{OSp(2|2) \\times OSp(2|2)} $$\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Bosonic Sector of the Target Space\n\nThe field of the sigma model takes values in the supermanifold `M`. A supermanifold has both bosonic (standard, commuting coordinates) and fermionic (Grassmann, anti-commuting coordinates) dimensions. The question asks for the number of non-Grassman (i.e., bosonic) variables, which is the dimension of the **bosonic submanifold**, `M_B`.\n\nThe bosonic part of a symmetric superspace `G/H` is itself a symmetric space `G_B/H_B`, where `G_B` and `H_B` are the maximal bosonic subgroups of the supergroups `G` and `H`, respectively.\n\n*   The bosonic subgroup of `G = OSp(2n|2n)` is `G_B = O(2n) \\times Sp(2n, \\mathbb{R})`.\n*   The bosonic subgroup of `H = OSp(n|n) \\times OSp(n|n)` is `H_B = (O(n) \\times Sp(n, \\mathbb{R})) \\times (O(n) \\times Sp(n, \\mathbb{R}))`.\n\nThe embedding of `H_B` into `G_B` is diagonal. Therefore, the bosonic manifold `M_B` is a product of two symmetric spaces:\n$$ M_B = \\frac{O(2n)}{O(n) \\times O(n)} \\times \\frac{Sp(2n, \\mathbb{R})}{Sp(n, \\mathbb{R}) \\times Sp(n, \\mathbb{R})} $$\n*A key point of caution: The symplectic group `Sp(n, \\mathbb{R})` is only defined for even `n`. The problem specifies `n=2` replicas, which is an even number, so this formulation is valid.*\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Dimension of the Bosonic Manifold\n\nThe total dimension of `M_B` is the sum of the dimensions of its two component spaces. We use the formula `dim(G/H) = dim(G) - dim(H)`. We need the dimensions of the relevant Lie groups for `n=2`.\n\n**Part 1: The Orthogonal Component**\n\nThe first component is `M_O = O(2n)/(O(n) \\times O(n))`.\nFor `n=2`, this is `O(4)/(O(2) \\times O(2))`.\nThe dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is `k(k-1)/2`.\n*   `dim(O(4)) = 4(3)/2 = 6`\n*   `dim(O(2)) = 2(1)/2 = 1`\n*   `dim(O(2) \\times O(2)) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2)) = 1 + 1 = 2`\nThe dimension of the orthogonal part is:\n$$ \\text{dim}(M_O) = \\text{dim}(O(4)) - \\text{dim}(O(2) \\times O(2)) = 6 - 2 = 4 $$\nAs a general formula, this dimension is `n^2`. For `n=2`, this is `2^2=4`.\n\n**Part 2: The Symplectic Component**\n\nThe second component is `M_{Sp} = Sp(2n, \\mathbb{R})/(Sp(n, \\mathbb{R}) \\times Sp(n, \\mathbb{R}))`.\nFor `n=2`, this is `Sp(4, \\mathbb{R})/(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\times Sp(2, \\mathbb{R}))`.\nThe dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2k, \\mathbb{R})` is `k(2k+1)`.\n*   For `Sp(4, \\mathbb{R})`, `k=2`. So, `dim(Sp(4, \\mathbb{R})) = 2(2*2+1) = 2(5) = 10`.\n*   For `Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})`, `k=1`. So, `dim(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})) = 1(2*1+1) = 1(3) = 3`.\n*   `dim(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\times Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})) = dim(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})) + dim(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})) = 3 + 3 = 6`.\nThe dimension of the symplectic part is:\n$$ \\text{dim}(M_{Sp}) = \\text{dim}(Sp(4, \\mathbb{R})) - \\text{dim}(Sp(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\times Sp(2, \\mathbb{R})) = 10 - 6 = 4 $$\nAs a general formula for even `n=2k`, this dimension is `(2k)^2 = n^2`. For `n=2`, this is `2^2=4`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables needed is the total dimension of the bosonic manifold `M_B`.\n$$ \\text{dim}(M_B) = \\text{dim}(M_O) + \\text{dim}(M_{Sp}) = 4 + 4 = 8 $$\nThis result matches the general formula `2n^2` for the dimension of the bosonic part for even `n`, evaluated at `n=2`.\n\nFinal careful points checklist:\n*   Correctly identified the symmetric superspace for class D.\n*   Correctly identified the bosonic part of this superspace.\n*   Correctly handled the `n=2` replica case, noting that this makes the symplectic group `Sp(n, R)` well-defined.\n*   Used the correct dimension formulas for the Lie groups `O(k)` and `Sp(2k, R)`.\n*   Calculated the dimension of the two factor spaces and summed them.\n\nThe final result is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
