    "This problem asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. The context about the Markov quiver is extra information, as the matrix is given explicitly.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the matrix and the task.**\nWe need to compute the determinant of the matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the matrix for any special properties.**\nBefore performing a brute-force calculation, it's often helpful to look for properties that might simplify the problem. One such property is the linear dependence of rows or columns. Let's check the sum of the column vectors.\nLet $C_1, C_2, C_3$ be the columns of the matrix A.\n$C_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's compute their sum:\n$C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the matrix property to the determinant.**\nA fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that the determinant of a square matrix is zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent.\nSince we found a non-trivial linear combination of the columns that equals the zero vector (specifically, $1 \\cdot C_1 + 1 \\cdot C_2 + 1 \\cdot C_3 = \\mathbf{0}$), the columns are linearly dependent.\nTherefore, the determinant of matrix A must be 0.\nThis is the most efficient way to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Verification using a standard determinant formula (optional but recommended).**\nWe can verify this result using the Sarrus' rule for 3x3 matrices:\ndet(A) = $a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$\nFor matrix A:\n$a = 2, b = -1, c = -1$\n$d = -1, e = 2, f = -1$\n$g = -1, h = -1, i = 2$\n\ndet(A) = $2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) - (-1) \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) + (-1) \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot (-1) - 2 \\cdot (-1))$\ndet(A) = $2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 - (-2))$\ndet(A) = $2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3)$\ndet(A) = $6 - 3 - 3$\ndet(A) = $0$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The information \"Markov quiver for $m_{1/2} = 13$\" is contextual and not required for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly provided. Do not get distracted by it.\n*   The property that the sum of the columns is the zero vector is a shortcut. It implies that $\\lambda=0$ is an eigenvalue, which means the determinant (the product of eigenvalues) must be zero.\n*   When calculating the determinant by hand, be meticulous with signs and arithmetic. Using a second method for verification is a good practice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the linear dependence of the columns, which is confirmed by direct calculation, the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
