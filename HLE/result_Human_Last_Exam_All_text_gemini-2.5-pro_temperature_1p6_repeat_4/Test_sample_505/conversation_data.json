    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Building Blocks: The Surface Code Patch**\n    *   A single, standard, planar patch of a surface code (with no holes) encodes **one logical qubit** (`k=1`).\n    *   The logical information is stored in non-local operators that stretch across the entire patch. For example, a logical X operator might be a string of physical X operators from the left boundary to the right, and a logical Z operator might be a string of physical Z operators from the top boundary to the bottom.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of Holes**\n    *   Holes (which are essentially excised regions of the code) introduce new boundaries within the patch.\n    *   These new boundaries allow for the definition of new logical operators. For each hole you introduce, you can define a new, independent logical qubit.\n    *   The formula for the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a single planar patch with `h` holes is:\n        `k = h + 1`\n    *   Let's check this:\n        *   For a standard patch with `h=0` holes, `k = 0 + 1 = 1`. This is correct.\n        *   For a patch with `h=1` hole, `k = 1 + 1 = 2`. One logical qubit is the original \"planar\" qubit, and the second is associated with the hole (e.g., a logical operator that loops around the hole).\n        *   For a patch with `h=2` holes, `k = 2 + 1 = 3`. One \"planar\" qubit plus one for each of the two holes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the System Configuration**\n    *   The system consists of **two separate patches** of surface code. Since they are separate, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch.\n    *   `Total Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)`\n    *   We have a total of **two holes** to distribute between these two patches.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Possible Distributions to Maximize the Qubit Count**\n    *   The goal is to find the *maximum* number of logical qubits. We need to consider all ways to distribute the two holes between the two patches.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Both holes in one patch.**\n        *   **Patch 1:** Gets 2 holes (`h_1 = 2`).\n            *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n        *   **Patch 2:** Gets 0 holes (`h_2 = 0`).\n            *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n        *   **Total logical qubits in this case:** `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One hole in each patch.**\n        *   **Patch 1:** Gets 1 hole (`h_1 = 1`).\n            *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   **Patch 2:** Gets 1 hole (`h_2 = 1`).\n            *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n        *   **Total logical qubits in this case:** `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    *   Both possible distributions of the two holes result in the same total number of logical qubits: 4.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Independent Patches:** It's crucial to recognize that \"two patches\" means two separate, non-interacting codes. The total number of qubits is the sum of the qubits in each. If they were connected into one larger patch, the calculation would be different.\n*   **Formula for Qubits:** Correctly applying the formula `k = h + 1` for a planar code with `h` holes is the key to the calculation. One must remember that even a patch with zero holes still encodes one logical qubit.\n*   **\"At Most\":** The question asks for the maximum possible value. We analyzed all possible configurations and found that the maximum (and in this case, only) possible outcome is 4.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we calculate the total number of logical qubits for all possible distributions of the two holes between the two patches. In every scenario, the total is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
