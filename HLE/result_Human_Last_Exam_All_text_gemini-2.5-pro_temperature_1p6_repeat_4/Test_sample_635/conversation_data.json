    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular matrix (i.e., $\\det(D(s)) \\not\\equiv 0$).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are \"left coprime\".\n\n**Careful Point:** Left coprimeness means that the only common left divisors of $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are unimodular matrices (polynomial matrices with a constant non-zero determinant). A practical way to check for left coprimeness is to verify that the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**2. Set up the Equation**\n\nThe relation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ can be rewritten as:\n$D(s) H(s) = N(s)$\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Since $N(s)$ must be a polynomial matrix, the product $D(s)H(s)$ must also be a polynomial matrix.\n\nLet's compute the product:\n\\[\nD(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor this to be a polynomial matrix $N(s)$, all its entries must be polynomials.\nFrom the second column, we can see that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\nFrom the first column, the entries must also be polynomials. Let's analyze the top-left entry:\n\\[\nd_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}\n\\]\nThis expression must be a polynomial.\n\n**3. Determine Constraints on the Elements of D(s)**\n\nFor the expression above to be a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator, $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. This means the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n*   **At s = 1:**\n    $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    This means $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n\n*   **At s = -1:**\n    $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nThe same set of conditions applies to the second row of $D(s)$, i.e., for $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$:\n*   $d_{22}(1) = 0$ (so $d_{22}(s)$ has a factor of $(s-1)$).\n*   $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We need to find two \"linearly independent\" rows for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions. If the rows are linearly dependent, $\\det(D(s))$ would be zero, and $D^{-1}(s)$ would not exist.\n\n**4. Find Suitable Polynomials for the Rows of D(s)**\n\nWe seek the simplest (lowest degree) polynomial solutions to these conditions.\n\n*   **For the first row, $[d_{11}(s), d_{12}(s)]$**:\n    Let's try a constant for $d_{11}(s)$, say $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    The second condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    The first condition is $d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    Let's try a degree 1 polynomial for $d_{12}(s)$, say $d_{12}(s) = as+b$.\n    $d_{12}(1) = a+b = 0 \\implies b=-a$. So $d_{12}(s) = a(s-1)$.\n    $d_{12}(-1) = a(-1-1) = -2a$.\n    Since we need $d_{12}(-1)=-2$, we have $-2a = -2 \\implies a=1$.\n    So, $d_{12}(s) = 1(s-1) = s-1$.\n    Thus, a valid first row is $D_1(s) = [1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **For the second row, $[d_{21}(s), d_{22}(s)]$**:\n    We need another solution that is not just a multiple of the first one. Let's try setting one of the polynomials to zero.\n    Let $d_{22}(s) = 0$. This automatically satisfies the condition $d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    The second condition becomes $2d_{21}(-1) + 0 = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1)=0$.\n    This means $d_{21}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s+1)$. The simplest non-zero polynomial is $d_{21}(s) = s+1$.\n    Thus, a valid second row is $D_2(s) = [s+1 \\quad 0]$.\n\nThese two rows are linearly independent since the determinant $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = -(s-1)(s+1) = 1-s^2$ is not identically zero.\n\n**5. Construct D(s) and N(s)**\n\nUsing the rows we found:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\cdot\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 1\\cdot 1 + (s-1)\\cdot 0 \\\\ (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0\\cdot\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (s+1)\\cdot 1 + 0\\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nLet's simplify the entries:\n$N_{11}(s) = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1) + 2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$.\n$N_{12}(s) = 1$.\n$N_{21}(s) = (s-1)$.\n$N_{22}(s) = s+1$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nWe need to check if $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$. The rank is 2 unless all $2 \\times 2$ sub-determinants (minors) are zero for some value of $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nLet's calculate one of the minors. For example, the determinant of the submatrix formed by the first and third columns:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s+1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (s-1) - 1 \\cdot (s+1) = s - 1 - s - 1 = -2\n\\]\nSince this minor is a non-zero constant (-2), it can never be zero for any value of $s$. Therefore, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ always has full row rank (rank 2).\nThis confirms that our factorization is indeed left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe left coprime factorization is given by $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ where:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
