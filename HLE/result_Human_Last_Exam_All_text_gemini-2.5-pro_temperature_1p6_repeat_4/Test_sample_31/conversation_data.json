    "This problem asks for the minimum number of sticker colors on the side of the last layer that must be known to uniquely identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the PLL Stage\n\nIn the CFOP method, the PLL stage is the final step where all the last layer pieces are correctly permuted. At the start of this stage, the top face is already solved (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), meaning the top face provides no information about which of the 21 PLLs it is. The identification must be done by observing the patterns on the four side faces of the top layer. The last layer has 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces. Each corner has 2 side stickers, and each edge has 1 side sticker, for a total of (4 * 2) + (4 * 1) = 12 non-top-facing stickers.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nA common method for PLL recognition is \"2-sided recognition\". A solver looks at the sticker patterns on two adjacent faces (e.g., the Front and Right faces). The stickers visible are:\n*   **Front face:** 1 edge sticker, 2 corner stickers (3 total).\n*   **Right face:** 1 edge sticker, 2 corner stickers (3 total).\n\nThe corner shared between the Front and Right faces (the UFR corner) shows one sticker on each face. Therefore, the total number of unique stickers observed is 3 (on Front) + 3 (on Right) - 1 (for the shared corner's second sticker) is not quite right.\nLet's count the stickers on the pieces visible from one corner:\n1.  The sticker on the Front face of the UF edge piece.\n2.  The sticker on the Front face of the UFL corner piece.\n3.  The sticker on the Front face of the UFR corner piece.\n4.  The sticker on the Right face of the UFR corner piece.\n5.  The sticker on the Right face of the UR edge piece.\n6.  The sticker on the Right face of the UBR corner piece.\n\nThis is a set of **6** stickers. It is a well-established fact in the speedcubing community that looking at two adjacent sides is sufficient to distinguish all 21 PLL cases. Therefore, 6 stickers is a sufficient number, establishing an upper bound. The question is whether we can do it with fewer.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound by Finding Ambiguity\n\nTo find the minimum number, we need to find the \"hardest\" cases to distinguish. If we can find two different PLL cases that look identical after observing `N` stickers, then the minimum number required must be greater than `N`.\n\nLet's test if 4 stickers are enough. Consider the G-perms, specifically the **Ga** and **Gc** permutations.\n*   **Common features of G-perms:** G-perms are characterized by having one pair of \"headlights\" (two corners on a face showing the same color) and a \"1x2 block\" (an adjacent corner and edge pair showing the same color).\n*   **The Ambiguity:** It's possible to orient the cube so that both the Ga and Gc perms present the *exact same* pattern on two adjacent faces. For instance, both can be oriented to show:\n    1.  Headlights on the Left face.\n    2.  A 1x2 block on the Front face.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The \"headlights on Left\" pattern is determined by the two stickers on the left face of the UBL and UFL corner pieces. The \"block on Front\" pattern is determined by the sticker on the front face of the UFR corner and the UF edge piece. This makes a total of **4** stickers. Since both Ga and Gc can produce the identical set of colors for these 4 stickers, seeing only these 4 is **insufficient** to tell them apart.\n\nThis proves that the minimum number of stickers must be greater than 4.\n\n### Step 4: Breaking the Ambiguity\n\nSince 4 stickers are not enough to distinguish Ga and Gc, we must look at a fifth sticker.\n*   **The Difference:** The difference between the Ga and Gc permutations (when oriented as described above) lies in how the other unsolved pieces are cycled. Specifically, the UR (Up-Right) and UB (Up-Back) edges are permuted in opposite directions.\n*   **The Fifth Sticker:** By observing the color of a fifth sticker—for example, the sticker on the Right face of the UR edge piece—we can break the ambiguity.\n    *   For a Ga perm, the UR edge piece will be from the UL position, showing the color of the Left face.\n    *   For a Gc perm, the UR edge piece will be from the UB position, showing the color of the Back face.\nSince these colors are different, this fifth sticker successfully distinguishes between Ga and Gc.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We have shown that **4** stickers are insufficient due to the ambiguity between the Ga and Gc PLL cases.\n*   We have shown that this ambiguity can be resolved by observing a **5th** sticker.\n*   While a full proof that 5 stickers are sufficient for all 210 pairs of cases is complex, the Ga/Gc ambiguity is widely considered the most difficult to resolve. The fact that it requires a 5th sticker sets a firm lower bound.\n*   Combining the lower bound (must be > 4) and the fact that 5 stickers can solve the most difficult case, we conclude that 5 is the minimum number required.\n\nTherefore, a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify any PLL case.\n\n<<<5>>>"
