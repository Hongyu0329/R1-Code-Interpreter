    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C7H8\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are also called basis functions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Basis Set Notation:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the Pople-style `6-31G` notation.\n    *   The hyphen (`-`) separates the description of core atomic orbitals from valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **`6`:** This describes the core orbitals. It means each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`31`:** This describes the valence orbitals. It indicates a \"split-valence\" basis, where the valence shell is represented by two sets of basis functions.\n        *   The \"inner\" part of the valence shell is described by one CGF per orbital, where each CGF is a sum of 3 PGFs.\n        *   The \"outer\" part of the valence shell is described by another CGF per orbital, where each CGF is made of a single (uncontracted) PGF.\n    *   **`G`:** Stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n2.  **Atom Types:** Different rules apply to different elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** As a first-row element, it only has a valence orbital (1s) and no core orbitals. Therefore, only the `31G` part of the notation applies to it.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row element, it has both core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. The full `6-31G` notation applies.\n3.  **Counting Functions:** Remember that a p-shell consists of three separate functions (px, py, pz).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Functions per Atom\n\n#### For each Carbon (C) atom:\n*   Carbon is a second-row element with electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The `6-` part applies. This gives **1** CGF for the 1s orbital.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The `-31G` part applies. The valence shell is split into an inner and outer part.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** This part provides one s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz). This contributes 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4** CGFs.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** This part provides another s-function and another set of p-functions (px, py, pz). This contributes 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4** CGFs.\n*   **Total per Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n#### For each Hydrogen (H) atom:\n*   Hydrogen has only a valence orbital (1s) and no core orbitals. The `6-` part of the basis set name does not apply.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The `31G` part applies, splitting the description into two functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** This provides one s-function. This is **1** CGF.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** This provides a second, more diffuse s-function. This is **1** CGF.\n*   **Total per Hydrogen atom:** 1 + 1 = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total for the Toluene Molecule (C7H8)\n\nNow, we sum the functions from all the atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   There are 7 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = **63 functions**.\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   There are 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = **16 functions**.\n\n*   **Total Contracted Gaussian Functions for Toluene:**\n    *   Total = (Functions from Carbon) + (Functions from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
