    "An step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Challenge**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. We are considering the regime where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nIn this limit, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$ can become very large if the denominator becomes very small. The denominator is minimal where $P(x)$ is minimal. In the integration interval $[0, 15]$, $P(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$ has a single root at $x=0$.\nAt $x=0$, $P(0)=0$, so the denominator becomes $\\epsilon$. For any $x>0$, $P(x) > 0$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrand develops a sharp peak at $x=0$. This indicates that the value of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ will be dominated by the contribution from the region near $x=0$. This is a characteristic of a singular perturbation problem.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Denominator Near the Dominant Point**\n\nNear the point $x=0$, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$, as higher powers of $x$ become negligible for very small $x$.\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Approximate the Integral**\n\nBased on the reasoning in Step 1 and Step 2, the leading behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ can be captured by an approximate integral where we replace $P(x)$ with its leading term $9x^5$.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\nFurthermore, because the integrand is sharply peaked at $x=0$ and decays rapidly away from $x=0$, the contribution from the upper part of the integration range (e.g., from some small number up to 15) is less significant than the contribution from the peak region. The error introduced by extending the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ is a lower-order effect. This simplification facilitates an exact analytical calculation.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Approximate Integral Analytically**\n\nWe solve this integral using a change of variables.\nLet's introduce a scaling variable. Let $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} u$.\nThen $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} du$.\nThe denominator becomes: $\\epsilon + 9x^5 = \\epsilon + 9 \\left( (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} u \\right)^5 = \\epsilon + 9 \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{9} u^5 \\right) = \\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5 = \\epsilon(1+u^5)$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{ (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon(1+u^5)} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{1/5 - 1} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Standard Definite Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard form related to the Euler Beta function. The general formula is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^n} dt = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\nIn our case, $n=5$. So,\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstitute the value of the definite integral back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$\nCombining the constant factors gives the final analytical approximation:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThe problem statement uses decimal powers (5.0, 6.0, 8.0). This implies the exponents can be represented as decimals. So, $-4/5 = -0.8$ and $1/5 = 0.2$. The formula can also be written as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$\nThis formula captures the dominant singular behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon$ approaches zero.\n\nCareful points to be noted:\n*   The approximation is valid for $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$.\n*   The leading behavior is a power law, $I(\\epsilon) \\propto \\epsilon^{-\\alpha}$, where the exponent $\\alpha = 1 - 1/n = 4/5$, with $n=5$ being the lowest power of $x$ in $P(x)$.\n*   The coefficient depends on the coefficient of the leading term of $P(x)$ (which is $a=9$).\n*   Calculating further terms in the asymptotic expansion (like a constant term or other powers of $\\epsilon$) is significantly more complex and is usually not required unless explicitly asked. The leading term provides the most crucial information about the integral's behavior.\n\nThe final derived analytical formula is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\n<<<>>>\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$"
