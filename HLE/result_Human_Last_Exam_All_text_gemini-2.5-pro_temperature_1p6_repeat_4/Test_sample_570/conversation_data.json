    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects a specific set of lines.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Set of Lines\nThe problem requires a convex domain `K` to intersect every line `L` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's list a few of these lines to get a feel for them:\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (0,1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (0,-1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,1)`, the line is `x + y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (1,-1)`, the line is `x - y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,1)`, the line is `-x + y = 1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (-1,-1)`, the line is `-x - y = 1`, or `x + y = -1`.\n*   If `(p,q) = (2,1)`, the line is `2x + y = 1`.\n*   And so on for all pairs of coprime integers `(p,q)`.\n\nLet `S` be the set of all such pairs `(p,q)`. Note that if `(p,q)` is in `S`, then `(-p,-q)` is also in `S`. The line for `(-p,-q)` is `-px - qy = 1`, or `px + qy = -1`. So `K` must intersect both `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Condition Mathematically\nA convex domain `K` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in either of the open half-planes `px + qy > 1` or `px + qy < 1`.\nThis means the set of values of the expression `px + qy` for all points `(x,y)` in `K` must include the value 1. Mathematically:\n`inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy)`\n\nThis condition must hold for all coprime integer pairs `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Problem to Centrally Symmetric Domains\nLet `K` be a convex domain that satisfies the condition. Consider its central symmetrization, `K_s = (1/2)(K - K) = { (1/2)(k_1 - k_2) | k_1, k_2 ∈ K }`.\n*   `K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex domain (symmetric about the origin).\n*   By the Rogers-Shephard inequality, `Area(K_s) ≤ Area(K)`. This means that if we are looking for a minimal area, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric domains.\n\nLet's verify that if `K` works, `K_s` also works.\nThe support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(p,q) = (1/2) * (h_K(p,q) + h_K(-p,-q))`, where `h_K(p,q) = sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px+qy)`.\nThe original condition on `K` is `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` and `inf(px+qy) = -h_K(-p,-q) ≤ 1`, which implies `h_K(-p,-q) ≥ -1`.\nHowever, since `(-p,-q)` is also a pair of coprime integers, the condition must also hold for them: `h_K(-p,-q) ≥ 1`.\nThus, for any coprime `(p,q)`, we have `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-p,-q) ≥ 1`.\nFor `K_s`, its support function is `h_{K_s}(p,q) = (1/2)(h_K(p,q) + h_K(-p,-q)) ≥ (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1`.\nFor a centrally symmetric set like `K_s`, `inf(px+qy) = -sup(px+qy)`, so the condition simplifies to `sup(px+qy) ≥ 1`.\nSince `h_{K_s}(p,q) ≥ 1`, `K_s` satisfies the condition.\nTherefore, the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain.\n\n### Step 4: Using Polar Duality\nLet `K` be a centrally symmetric convex domain containing the origin. The condition is `h_K(p,q) = sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1` for all `(p,q) ∈ S`.\nLet's consider the polar dual of `K`:\n`K* = { (u,v) | ux + vy ≤ 1 for all (x,y) ∈ K }`.\n`K*` is also a centrally symmetric convex domain.\n\nThe support function of `K` is related to `K*`. A point `(p,q)` is in the interior of `K*` if and only if `sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) < 1`.\nOur condition `sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p,q)` means that no primitive integer point `(p,q)` can be in the interior of `K*`.\nSo, `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`.\n\nFurthermore, this implies that the interior of `K*` cannot contain *any* non-zero integer lattice point `(p,q)`.\nWhy? Suppose `(p,q) ≠ (0,0)` is an integer point in `int(K*)`. Let `d = gcd(p,q)`. Then we can write `(p,q) = d * (p',q')`, where `(p',q')` is a primitive integer point (and thus is in `S`). Since `K*` is convex and contains the origin, if `d*(p',q')` is in `int(K*)`, then `(p',q')` must also be in `int(K*)`. This contradicts `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`.\nSo, the condition on `K` is equivalent to its polar dual `K*` being a centrally symmetric convex domain whose interior contains no non-zero integer lattice points `Z^2 \\ {0}`.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Domain with Minimal Area\nWe want to find the `K` with minimal area. We can use the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, which in the plane for centrally symmetric bodies, takes the form of Mahler's inequality:\n`Area(K) * Area(K*) ≥ 8`\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we need to maximize `Area(K*)`.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into: What is the maximum possible area of a centrally symmetric convex domain `K*` whose interior contains no non-zero integer lattice points?\nAccording to Minkowski's convex body theorem, if a centrally symmetric convex body `C` in the plane has an area greater than 4, it must contain a non-zero integer lattice point.\nThis implies that `Area(K*)` cannot be greater than 4. So, `max Area(K*) = 4`.\n\nThis maximum area of 4 is achieved by the square `Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1] = { (u,v) | |u| ≤ 1, |v| ≤ 1 }`. The interior of this square, `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, contains no non-zero integer points, so it is a valid choice for `K*`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimal Area\nWe have found that `max Area(K*) = 4`. Substituting this into Mahler's inequality:\n`Area(K) * 4 ≥ 8`\n`Area(K) ≥ 2`\n\nThe minimum possible area is 2. This minimum is achieved if equality holds in Mahler's inequality, which occurs if and only if `K` (and `K*`) is a parallelogram.\nOur choice for the maximal `K*` was the square `Q`, which is a parallelogram. Its polar dual `K` will also be a parallelogram. Let's find it.\n`K = { (x,y) | ux + vy ≤ 1 for all (u,v) in Q }`\n`K = { (x,y) | sup_{|u|≤1, |v|≤1} (ux + vy) ≤ 1 }`\nThe supremum is achieved by taking `u = sgn(x)` and `v = sgn(y)`, so `sup(ux+vy) = |x| + |y|`.\nThus, `K` is the domain defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n\nThis is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\nThe area of this square is `(√2)² = 2`.\n\nWe have found a convex domain `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of 2. Our derivation shows that no smaller area is possible.\n\nFinal check: The set `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|<=1}` must intersect every line `px+qy=1` where `gcd(p,q)=1`. The maximum value of `px+qy` on `K` is `max(|p|, |q|)` and the minimum value is `-max(|p|, |q|)`. Since `p,q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. If one is zero, e.g., `p=0`, then `|q|=1`, so `max(|p|,|q|)=1`. If both are non-zero, `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`. In all cases, `max(|p|,|q|) >= 1`, so the interval `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]` contains `1`. The condition is satisfied.\n\nThe minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
