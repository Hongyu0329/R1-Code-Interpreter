    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. Examples include the closed interval [0, 1], a circle, or a square.\n*   **Product of Two Continua:** If *X* and *Y* are continua, their Cartesian product *X* × *Y* with the product topology is also a continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point *p* in a continuum *X*, the composant of *p* is the set of all points *q* in *X* such that there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of *X* containing both *p* and *q*. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space *X*. The set of all distinct composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the possible number of composants for any continuum**\n\nA fundamental and deep result in continuum theory, established by S. Mazurkiewicz and later refined by J. Krasinkiewicz and P. Minc, states that the number of composants of any continuum is either:\n1.  **1**\n2.  **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, which is the size of the set of real numbers, an uncountable infinity).\n\nThis means no continuum can have, for example, 2, 5, or a countably infinite number of composants. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants for *any* continuum, including the product of two continua, cannot be greater than **c**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine if the maximum value (c) is achievable for the product of two nondegenerate continua**\n\nTo show that **c** is the largest *possible* number, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one pair of nondegenerate continua, *X* and *Y*, such that their product *X* × *Y* has **c** composants.\n\nLet's consider the conditions under which a continuum has 1 or **c** composants:\n*   A continuum has **1** composant if and only if all of its composants are equal to the space itself. This is the case for arc-connected continua like the interval [0,1], the square [0,1]x[0,1], or the n-sphere.\n*   A continuum has **c** composants if and only if it has at least one composant that is a proper subset of the space.\n\nNow, let's analyze the product space *X* × *Y*:\n\n1.  **Case 1: Both X and Y are arc-connected.**\n    *   If *X* and *Y* are arc-connected, their product *X* × *Y* is also arc-connected.\n    *   In an arc-connected continuum, any two points can be joined by an arc. An arc is a proper subcontinuum (unless the space itself is an arc). This means any two points belong to the same composant.\n    *   Therefore, if *X* and *Y* are arc-connected nondegenerate continua (e.g., two closed intervals), their product (*e.g.*, a square) is arc-connected and has only **1** composant.\n\n2.  **Case 2: At least one of X or Y is not arc-connected.**\n    *   For the product *X* × *Y* to have **c** composants, it must have a proper composant. This is more likely to happen if the product space is not arc-connected. A product *X* × *Y* is not arc-connected if at least one of its factors is not arc-connected.\n    *   Let's choose a classic example of a non-arc-connected continuum: the **topologist's sine curve**, denoted *S*. *S* is the closure of the graph of *y = sin(1/x)* for *x* > 0. It is a nondegenerate continuum.\n    *   Let *X = S* and *Y = [0, 1]* (the closed unit interval). Both are nondegenerate continua.\n    *   The product space is *Z = S* × *[0, 1]*. Since *S* is not arc-connected, the product *Z* is also not arc-connected.\n    *   It is a known theorem in continuum theory (proven, for instance, by K. Kuperberg) that if *C* is a non-arc-connected curve (a 1-dimensional continuum, which *S* is), then the product *C* × *[0, 1]* has **c** composants.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nFrom our analysis:\n*   The number of composants of the product *X* × *Y* can be **1** (e.g., for *X* = [0,1], *Y* = [0,1]).\n*   The number of composants of the product *X* × *Y* can be **c** (e.g., for *X* = Topologist's Sine Curve, *Y* = [0,1]).\n*   The number of composants for any continuum cannot exceed **c**.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
