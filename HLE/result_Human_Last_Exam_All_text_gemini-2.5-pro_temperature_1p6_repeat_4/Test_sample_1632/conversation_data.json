    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, a(10).\n\n**1. Defining the Problem**\n*   **Lattice:** A Manhattan lattice is a 2D square grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **Walk:** A walk is a sequence of points (v0, v1, ..., vn) where each point vi is adjacent to the previous point vi-1. Adjacent means differing by 1 in exactly one coordinate. For a point (x,y), the neighbors are (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step walk:** A walk with n steps, which involves n+1 points.\n*   **Self-avoiding:** A walk where all the points (v0, v1, ..., vn) are unique. The walk never visits the same point twice.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of n-step self-avoiding walks. By convention, the starting point is fixed (e.g., at the origin (0,0)), as the number of walk shapes is independent of the starting position on an infinite lattice.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation for small n**\n\n*   **a(1): The number of 1-step walks**\n    *   Starting at (0,0), we can move to one of 4 adjacent points: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All 4 are valid self-avoiding walks.\n    *   **a(1) = 4**\n\n*   **a(2): The number of 2-step walks**\n    *   From each of the 4 possible endpoints of a 1-step walk, we can take a second step.\n    *   Let's consider the walk (0,0) -> (1,0). The next step from (1,0) cannot be back to (0,0). The available neighbors are (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). So, there are 3 choices.\n    *   Since this applies to any of the initial 4 directions, the total number of 2-step SAWs is 4 * 3.\n    *   **a(2) = 12**\n\n*   **a(3): The number of 3-step walks**\n    *   For any 2-step walk, we consider the next step from its endpoint.\n    *   For a \"straight\" walk like (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0), the neighbors of the endpoint (2,0) are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). Since (1,0) is already on the path, there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   For a \"turning\" walk like (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1), the neighbors of (1,1) are (1,0), (2,1), (0,1), (1,2). Since (1,0) is already on the path, there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   In all 12 cases of 2-step walks, the endpoint has exactly one neighbor that is already part of the walk (the previous point). Thus, there are always 3 choices for the third step.\n    *   Total number of 3-step SAWs is a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3.\n    *   **a(3) = 36**\n\n**3. Identifying the Complication**\n\n*   **a(4): The number of 4-step walks**\n    *   One might assume the pattern continues, giving 36 * 3 = 108. However, this is incorrect. The number of available moves at step `k` depends on the entire shape of the (k-1)-step walk, not just the last point.\n    *   Consider a 3-step walk that forms a \"U\" shape, for example: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n    *   The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (1,1), (-1,1), (0,0), and (0,2).\n    *   The path has already visited two of these neighbors: (1,1) and the starting point (0,0).\n    *   Therefore, there are only 2 valid choices for the next step: to (-1,1) or (0,2).\n    *   For other 3-step walks that are not U-shaped (e.g., (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0) or (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)), the endpoint only has one previously visited neighbor (the point it just came from). These walks have 3 valid choices for the next step.\n    *   To calculate a(4), we must count how many 3-step paths are U-shaped and how many are not.\n        *   There are 8 U-shaped 3-step paths. Each gives 2 further paths. (8 * 2 = 16)\n        *   There are 36 - 8 = 28 non-U-shaped 3-step paths. Each gives 3 further paths. (28 * 3 = 84)\n        *   **a(4)** = 16 + 84 = **100**\n\n**4. Finding a(10)**\nCalculating `a(n)` by hand becomes combinatorially explosive as `n` increases. There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). This is a well-known and difficult problem in computational physics and combinatorics. The values have been computed using sophisticated algorithms and extensive computer time. The resulting sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nWe list the known values of a(n) from this sequence:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
