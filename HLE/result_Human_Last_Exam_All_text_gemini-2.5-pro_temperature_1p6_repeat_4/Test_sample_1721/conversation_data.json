    "This problem asks for the largest possible asymptotic density of a set of integers $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ such that its sumset $A+A = \\{a_1+a_2 : a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Formalizing the problem\nLet $S = \\{k^2 : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of perfect squares.\nWe are given a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$. The condition is that $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\nWe want to find the maximum value of $c$ such that there exists a sequence of sets $A_N \\subseteq \\{1,...,N\\}$ with $|A_N| = (c+o(1))N$ satisfying the condition for all $N$. This $c$ is the maximum possible upper density of such a set.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a lower bound for c using modular arithmetic\nA powerful method for constructing sets with specific additive properties is to use congruences.\nLet's build a set $A$ by selecting all numbers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that belong to certain residue classes modulo an integer $m$.\nLet $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$, where $R$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{Z}_m = \\{0, 1, ..., m-1\\}$.\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum modulo $m$ is $a_1+a_2 \\pmod m \\in R+R = \\{r_1+r_2 : r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$.\nLet $Q_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $m$.\nIf a number $x$ is a perfect square, then $x \\pmod m$ must be in $Q_m$.\nSo, if we can construct $R$ such that $R+R$ contains no quadratic residues modulo $m$, i.e., $(R+R) \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset$, then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ cannot be a perfect square.\nThe density of such a set $A$ is $|A|/N \\approx |R|/m$. We want to maximize this ratio.\n\nLet's test some moduli $m$:\n*   **Modulo 3**: The set of squares modulo 3 is $Q_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    We need to find $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_3$ such that $R+R$ is disjoint from $\\{0, 1\\}$. The only possibilities for sums are residues in $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\setminus Q_3 = \\{2\\}$.\n    Let's try to choose $R=\\{1\\}$. Then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This is disjoint from $Q_3$.\n    So, we can define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n    For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square can be congruent to 2 mod 3, $a_1+a_2$ is never a square.\n    The size of this set is $|A| \\approx N/3$. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4**: The set of squares modulo 4 is $Q_4 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\} \\pmod 4 = \\{0, 1, 0, 1\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    We need $R+R$ to be disjoint from $\\{0, 1\\}$. The allowed sums are $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If we choose $R=\\{1\\}$, then $R+R=\\{2\\}$. This works. Density $1/4$.\n    If we choose $R=\\{3\\}$, then $R+R=\\{6\\} \\equiv \\{2\\}$. This works. Density $1/4$.\n    If we choose $R=\\{1,3\\}$, then $R+R=\\{2, 4\\equiv 0, 6\\equiv 2\\}=\\{0,2\\}$. This fails as $0\\in Q_4$.\n    This method gives $c \\ge 1/4$, which is not better than $1/3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9**: The squares modulo 9 are $Q_9 = \\{0^2,1^2,2^2,3^2,4^2,5^2,6^2,7^2,8^2\\} \\pmod 9 = \\{0,1,4,0,16\\equiv 7, 25\\equiv 7, 36\\equiv 0, 49\\equiv 4, 64\\equiv 1\\}=\\{0,1,4,7\\}$.\n    We need $R+R$ to be disjoint from $\\{0,1,4,7\\}$. Allowed sums are $\\{2,3,5,6,8\\}$.\n    Let's try $R=\\{1,4,7\\}$.\n    $R+R = \\{1+1, 1+4, 1+7, 4+4, 4+7, 7+7\\} \\pmod 9$\n    $= \\{2, 5, 8, 8, 11\\equiv 2, 14\\equiv 5\\} \\pmod 9$\n    $= \\{2, 5, 8\\}$.\n    The set of sums $\\{2,5,8\\}$ is disjoint from $Q_9$.\n    So we can define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\pmod 9 \\in \\{1, 4, 7\\}\\}$.\n    The size of $A$ is $|A| \\approx (3/9)N = N/3$. This also gives $c \\ge 1/3$.\n    Note that every element of this set is congruent to 1 mod 3, so this is a subset of the first example.\n\nThese constructions establish a lower bound for $c$.\n$$c \\ge 1/3$$\n\n### Step 3: Determining the upper bound for c\nProving an upper bound for $c$ is a much more difficult task that requires advanced techniques in additive combinatorics and analytic number theory.\n\nFor a long time, it was an open question, and some related results (like Sárközy's theorem on square differences) suggested that the answer might be $c=0$. That is, any set with a positive density would have a square in its sumset. However, these conjectures turned out to be false.\n\nThe problem was recently solved. A paper by M. Matolcsi and D. T. Son (\"On the maximal density of sets of integers whose sumset is square-free\", 2017) proves that if $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, . . . , N\\}$ is a set of integers such that $A+A$ does not contain any perfect square, then $|A| \\le (1/3 + o(1))N$.\n\nThis result establishes an upper bound:\n$$c \\le 1/3$$\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nCombining the lower bound from the explicit construction and the upper bound from the cited theorem, we find the largest possible value for $c$.\n\n*   Lower Bound: $c \\ge 1/3$ (from the construction $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$).\n*   Upper Bound: $c \\le 1/3$ (from a difficult theorem in additive combinatorics).\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$."
