The quantum correction to the conductivity is $\delta\sigma = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar} \left( \frac{1}{L_\phi} - \frac{1}{l_e} \right)$, where $l_e$ is the elastic mean free path and $L_\phi$ is the phase coherence length. Since $L_\phi > l_e$ at low temperatures, this correction is negative, representing a decrease in conductivity.
