    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Interpreting the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Ensemble:** The system is in the **grand canonical ensemble**, which means it can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir. This ensemble is described by constant temperature $T$ (or inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/k_B T$), volume $V$, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **Partition Function Definition:** The grand canonical partition function, which we denote as $\\mathcal{Z}$, is defined as the trace ($\\text{Tr}$) over the full Fock space of the system:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\n    where $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   **Interpreting the given \"Hamiltonian\":** The question specifies that the system has a \"Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\". In the context of the grand canonical ensemble, the operator in the exponent, $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$, is often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian. The most natural interpretation of the problem is that this entire operator is given by $-\\mu \\hat{N}$. This simplifies to a model where the system's own Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is zero (e.g., a gas of non-interacting particles where kinetic energy is ignored), and the chemical potential is $\\mu$.\n*   **Objective:** We need to calculate $\\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right) = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}} \\right)$ using the path integral formalism.\n\n**2. Setting up the Path Integral**\n\nThe partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ can be expressed as a path integral over quantum fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and their complex conjugates $\\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is imaginary time running from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nThe action $S$ is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. The general form for the action is $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\hbar \\partial_\\tau + \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$.\nIn our case, with $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$, the action becomes:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n(We set $\\hbar=1$ for convenience).\nWe can express this action as a sum over single-particle states (e.g., momentum modes) indexed by $k$:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau)(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\n**3. Matsubara Frequency Expansion**\n\nThe fields must be periodic or anti-periodic in imaginary time, i.e., $\\psi_k(\\beta) = \\zeta \\psi_k(0)$, where $\\zeta = +1$ for bosons and $\\zeta = -1$ for fermions. This allows us to expand them in a Fourier series, known as the Matsubara expansion:\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n\\tau} \\psi_{k,n}$\n\nThe Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$ depend on the statistics:\n*   **Bosons ($\\zeta=1$):** $\\omega_n = \\frac{2n\\pi}{\\beta}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Fermions ($\\zeta=-1$):** $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action, the derivative term $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The integral over $\\tau$ projects the action onto the diagonal basis in the frequency index $n$:\n$S = \\sum_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\n**4. Evaluating the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral measure becomes a product of integrals over the complex coefficients $\\psi_{k,n}$ and $\\psi_{k,n}^*$.\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\int \\left(\\prod_{k,n} d\\psi_{k,n}^* d\\psi_{k,n}\\right) \\exp\\left[ -\\sum_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}^*(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)\\psi_{k,n} \\right]$\nThis is a product of independent Gaussian integrals. The result of a Gaussian integral depends on whether the variables are complex numbers (bosons) or Grassmann numbers (fermions).\nThe partition function is given by the determinant of the operator in the action:\n$\\mathcal{Z} \\propto (\\det[G^{-1}])^{-\\zeta}$ where $G^{-1}_{k,n} = -i\\omega_n - \\mu$.\nSo, $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu)^{-\\zeta}$.\nTaking the logarithm:\n$\\ln \\mathcal{Z} = -\\zeta \\sum_k \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\n**5. Summing Over Matsubara Frequencies**\n\nThis sum is a standard result in thermal field theory. The result of the sum over $n$ depends on the statistics.\n*   **For Bosons ($\\zeta=1$):**\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_B = -\\sum_k \\left[ \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\right]$\n    The Matsubara sum evaluates to $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$ (up to regularization-dependent constants which are discarded).\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_B = -\\sum_k \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\n*   **For Fermions ($\\zeta=-1$):**\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_F = -(-1) \\sum_k \\left[ \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\right]$\n    The Matsubara sum (with fermionic frequencies) evaluates to $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$.\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_F = \\sum_k \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\n**6. Final Result and Interpretation**\n\nThe sum $\\sum_k$ is over all available single-particle states. Since the grand canonical Hamiltonian does not depend on the state index $k$ (e.g., momentum), each state contributes identically. If there are $M$ such states, the sum becomes a multiplication by $M$.\n\n*   **For a system of Bosons:**\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_B = -M \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    Exponentiating gives the partition function:\n    $\\mathcal{Z}_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n    For the partition function to converge (i.e., for the system to be thermodynamically stable), the argument of the logarithm must be positive, which means $1 - e^{\\beta\\mu} > 0$. This implies $e^{\\beta\\mu} < 1$, which requires the chemical potential to be **negative ($\\mu < 0$)**.\n\n*   **For a system of Fermions:**\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_F = M \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n    Exponentiating gives the partition function:\n    $\\mathcal{Z}_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\n    This expression is well-defined for all real values of $\\mu$, as $1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$ is always positive.\n\nWe can write a single, compact expression for both cases using a statistical parameter $\\zeta$ (+1 for bosons, -1 for fermions).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe partition function Z can be expressed in a unified form for both bosons and fermions. Let $M$ be the total number of single-particle states and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ be the inverse temperature.\n\n*   For a system of **bosons**:\n    $Z = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$, which is valid for a negative chemical potential, $\\mu < 0$.\n\n*   For a system of **fermions**:\n    $Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$.\n\nThese two results can be combined into a single expression using a parameter $\\zeta$, where $\\zeta=+1$ for bosons and $\\zeta=-1$ for fermions:\n$Z = (1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta M}$\n\n<<<For Bosons: $Z = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$ (where $\\mu<0$)\nFor Fermions: $Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^{M}$\nHere, M is the number of single-particle states.>>>"
