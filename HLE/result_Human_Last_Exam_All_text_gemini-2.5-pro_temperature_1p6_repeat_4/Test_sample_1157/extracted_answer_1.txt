The appropriate management is a multi-phased approach. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Medical referral to begin treatment and control her diabetes mellitus (target HbA1c < 7.0%), along with dental wound management including cleaning the sockets, suturing lacerations, prescribing antibiotics, and providing pain relief. Replantation is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay. **Phase 2 (Transitional):** After initial healing, provide a temporary removable denture for aesthetics while her medical condition stabilizes over several months. **Phase 3 (Definitive):** Once her diabetes is well-controlled, a permanent solution can be chosen.

The key **cells of interest** for socket healing are osteoblasts (bone formation), fibroblasts (connective tissue formation), and macrophages (wound cleaning and repair signaling).

If a **denture replacement** is chosen, the recommendation is a **Cast Partial Denture** made with a **Cobalt-Chromium metal framework** and acrylic teeth. The **abutment teeth** would be the **left second premolar** and, for cross-arch stabilization, the **right first and/or second molars**. This choice uses strong posterior teeth to support the denture and distribute chewing forces, preventing stress on weaker anterior teeth and providing superior stability, which is important given her skeletal Class III jaw relationship.
