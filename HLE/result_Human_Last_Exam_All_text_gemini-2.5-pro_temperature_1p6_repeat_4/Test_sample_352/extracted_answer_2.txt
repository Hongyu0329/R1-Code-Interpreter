The best replacement for the Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate (S-E-E-D) sequence at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine (A-A-A-A). This change would remove the potential for negative charge from phosphorylation at Serine 47 and eliminate the existing negative charges from Glutamate and Aspartate at positions 48, 49, and 50, thereby directly testing the hypothesis that the negatively charged environment of this patch causes autoinhibition.
