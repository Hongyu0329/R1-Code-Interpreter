    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron, which is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices. The problem states that the icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base of the tank. By the symmetry of the icosahedron, there must be another triangular face parallel to the base at the top of the tank.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"half-filled\" condition.**\n\"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water occupies exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron tank. The surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 3: Use symmetry to locate the water surface.**\nA regular icosahedron has a point of inversion symmetry at its geometric center. This means that for any point within the icosahedron, the point diametrically opposite through the center is also within the icosahedron. A key consequence of this symmetry is that any plane passing through the center of the icosahedron divides its volume into two equal halves. Since the tank is half-filled, the horizontal water surface must be the plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape of the water surface.**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane. We need to determine the shape of this specific cross-section.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the cross-section.**\n1.  **Symmetry of the Cross-Section:** The axis passing through the center of the bottom face and the top face is a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis for the icosahedron. The cutting plane (the water surface) is perpendicular to this axis. The symmetries of the icosahedron with respect to this axis must be reflected in the shape of the cross-section. This means the shape will have at least 3-fold rotational symmetry. Furthermore, because the plane passes through the center of the highly symmetric icosahedron, the resulting shape will be very regular.\n2.  **Convexity:** An icosahedron is a convex solid. Any cross-section of a convex solid by a plane is a convex polygon. This rules out any star-shaped possibilities (like a hexagram).\n3.  **Identifying the Polygon:** It is a well-known property of the icosahedron that a central cross-section taken perpendicular to an axis joining the centers of two opposite faces is a regular hexagon. This plane cuts through 6 of the icosahedron's edges that are arranged symmetrically around the \"equator\" of the shape in this orientation. The six points where the plane intersects these edges form the six vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCombining these points, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron forms a regular hexagon.\n\nCareful points to consider:\n*   The high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron is the key to solving the problem without complex coordinate geometry.\n*   Understanding that \"half-filled\" corresponds to a plane through the center of a centrally symmetric object is crucial.\n*   The orientation \"standing on a face\" defines which of the possible central cross-sections is the relevant one.\n*   The cross-section of a convex shape is always convex.\n\nThe shape of the water surface will be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
