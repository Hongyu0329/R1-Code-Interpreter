The product is a tricyclic ether formed via intramolecular cyclization. A new ether bond is formed between the oxygen of the original hydroxyl group (at C2) and the C5 carbon of the original double bond. The original C5=C6 double bond is saturated during the reaction. The cyclopentenyl substituent and the 7,7-dimethoxy ketal remain unchanged.
