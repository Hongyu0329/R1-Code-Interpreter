    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source:** A \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" This phrasing is a key clue. It could mean an essay translated *into* Russian, or it could be a slightly inaccurate way of saying \"an essay written in Russian.\"\n    *   **Setting:** The essay describes the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" This points to a specific, well-known urban feature, likely the Ringstrasse.\n    *   **Clue:** The surname of an \"English poet\" is mentioned in this description. The distinction between \"poet\" and \"writer\" might be loose.\n    *   **Task:** Identify the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Source Text:**\n    The combination of clues points strongly to a famous passage by the Russian writer Yuri Olesha. The specific work is his book of memoirs and notes, \"No Day Without a Line\" («Ни дня без строчки»). This book is not a single essay but a collection of thoughts, observations, and fragments, which is very essay-like in nature. The most critical point is that this is a work *originally written in Russian*, so the phrase \"Russian translation\" in the question is likely a minor inaccuracy, referring instead to a \"Russian-language text.\"\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Relevant Passage from Olesha:**\n    In \"No Day Without a Line,\" Olesha reflects on the difference between the narrow streets of Odessa and the grand boulevards of a city like Vienna. He tries to find the right word for such a wide street and thinks of the Russian word **«проспект» (prospekt)**, which means avenue or boulevard.\n\n4.  **Making the Connection to the English Surname:**\n    This is the central part of the puzzle. Through a process of sound association, the Russian word «проспект» (prospekt) reminds Olesha of the surname of a famous English writer. In Russian, this writer's name is written as **«Уэллс»**.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Poet/Writer:**\n    The surname «Уэллс» is the Russian transliteration of **Wells**. The writer Olesha is referring to is H.G. Wells.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **\"Russian translation\" vs. \"Russian text\":** The question is slightly misphrased. The source is a Russian original, not a translation. This is a common feature in such riddle-like questions, where a small inaccuracy can distract from the main path.\n*   **\"Poet\" vs. \"Writer\":** Yuri Olesha refers to H.G. Wells as an \"English writer\" (английский писатель). The question uses the word \"poet.\" While H.G. Wells is overwhelmingly known as a novelist and \"father of science fiction,\" this discrepancy is likely a simplification in the question's wording. In a broader literary sense, the term can sometimes be used more loosely.\n*   **The Linguistic Pun:** The solution hinges entirely on understanding the sound association in Russian between \"prospekt\" (a type of boulevard) and \"Wells\" (the surname). This is the creative leap made by Olesha in his text.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe essay in question is Yuri Olesha's \"No Day Without a Line.\" When describing the wide boulevards of Vienna, he thinks of the Russian word for them, \"prospekt,\" which, by its sound, reminds him of the surname of the English writer H.G. Wells. Therefore, the surname is Wells.\n\n<<<Wells>>>"
