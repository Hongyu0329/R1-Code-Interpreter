    "Answering this question requires analyzing the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's break down the analysis into clear steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the algebraic structure**\nThe algebra is $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, often called the small quantum group. Since $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (e.g., $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$), its square $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$ is also a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell$ be the multiplicative order of $q^2$, so $\\ell=3$.\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is the finite-dimensional algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$ generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with the relations:\n1.  $K K^{-1} = K^{-1} K = 1$\n2.  $K E K^{-1} = q^2 E$\n3.  $K F K^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n4.  $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n5.  $E^3 = 0, F^3 = 0, K^3 = 1$\nThis is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra of dimension $3^3=27$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the percentage of irreducible representations among all indecomposable representations.\nLet $C$ be the category of finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ modules. The objects of interest are the isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules in $C$.\nLet $|\\mathrm{Ind}|$ be the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\nLet $|\\mathrm{Irr}|$ be the number of non-isomorphic irreducible (or simple) modules.\nSince every irreducible module is by definition indecomposable, the set of irreducible modules is a subset of the set of indecomposable modules.\nThe required percentage is $\\frac{|\\mathrm{Irr}|}{|\\mathrm{Ind}|} \\times 100\\%$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the irreducible representations**\nFor any finite-dimensional algebra, the number of non-isomorphic simple modules is finite. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $\\ell=3$, the irreducible representations are well-classified:\n*   There is a family of 1-dimensional irreducible representations, parametrized by an eigenvalue $c$ for $K$. Since $K^3=1$, $c$ can be $1, q,$ or $q^2$. So there are 3 non-isomorphic 1-dimensional irreducible modules.\n*   There is a family of 2-dimensional irreducible representations. These are highest-weight modules whose classification gives 3 distinct isomorphism classes.\nThus, the total number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations is $3 + 3 = 6$. So, $|\\mathrm{Irr}| = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the indecomposable representations**\nTo determine the total number of indecomposable representations, we need to know the representation type of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. The representation type depends on the value of $\\ell = \\mathrm{ord}(q^2)$.\n*   For $\\ell=1, 2$, the algebra is of **finite representation type**, meaning there is a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   For $\\ell \\geq 3$, the algebra is of **wild representation type**.\n\nIn this problem, $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, so $\\ell=3$. Therefore, $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is of wild representation type.\nBy definition, an algebra of wild representation type has **infinitely many** non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. This means $|\\mathrm{Ind}| = \\infty$.\nThis infinitude can be seen, for example, from the structure of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the module category, which contains components of type $\\mathbb{Z}A_\\infty$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the percentage**\nNow we can calculate the percentage of irreducible objects among the indecomposable objects of the category $C$.\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{|\\mathrm{Irr}|}{|\\mathrm{Ind}|} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{6}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% $$\nThis ratio evaluates to 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct algebra**: It is crucial to identify the algebra as the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, which is finite-dimensional. The representation theory of the 'big' quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is different (it has infinitely many irreducibles, for one). The notation $u_q$ and the finiteness of the representation dimensions strongly point to the small quantum group.\n2.  **Representation type**: The pivotal point of the argument is the representation type of this algebra. The fact that it is 'wild' for $\\ell \\ge 3$ is a deep result in the theory. Assuming this result, the conclusion is straightforward.\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Percentage\"**: The most natural interpretation in this context is the ratio of the cardinalities of the sets of isomorphism classes. Alternative interpretations, such as a density measure over dimensions, would also yield 0 because the number of irreducibles is bounded while the number of indecomposables is not.\n4.  **Possibility of a trick question**: The specificity of the question ($q$ being a third root of unity) suggests a precise answer is expected. The answer '0' is precise and stems from a fundamental property of the algebra. It contrasts with the case of $q$ being, for example, a primitive fourth root of unity ($q=i, \\ell=2$), where the algebra would be of finite representation type, yielding a non-zero percentage.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of irreducible representations is finite (specifically 6). The number of indecomposable representations is infinite because the algebra is of wild representation type. Therefore, the percentage of indecomposable representations that are irreducible is 0."
