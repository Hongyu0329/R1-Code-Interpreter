    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms in the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. A classic example is the pseudo-arc. Unless it is a single point, such a continuum is non-degenerate.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. Composants partition the indecomposable continuum.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes any metric space), its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space, i.e., $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. We will denote our space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ by $Y$ and its remainder by $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Space and its Remainder\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. To answer this, we need to understand the topological nature of $R$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Consider the case of a degenerate continuum.**\nIf $X = \\{x\\}$ is a single point, it is technically a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum. In this case, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\emptyset$ is the empty set. The Stone-Cech compactification of the empty set is the empty set, so $\\beta(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$. The remainder $R = \\beta(\\emptyset) \\setminus \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. The empty set has 0 composants. This gives us one possible value.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Consider the case of a non-degenerate continuum.**\nLet's assume $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum (i.e., it contains more than one point).\n*   The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a metric space, so it is Tychonoff. Since $X$ is compact, $Y$ is locally compact. Since $X$ is a continuum, it is not a finite set of points, so $Y$ is not compact.\n*   Is $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ connected? A non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum has no cut points. Therefore, removing a single point $x$ leaves the space connected.\n*   Is $Y$ connected at infinity? A locally compact space is connected at infinity if for every compact subset $K \\subset Y$, there is a larger compact subset $K' \\subset Y$ such that $Y \\setminus K'$ is connected. For $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, this property holds because $X$ is a continuum without local cut points.\n*   **Theorem:** For a locally compact, non-compact, sigma-compact space $Y$, the remainder $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is a continuum if and only if $Y$ is connected and connected at infinity.\n*   Our space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ satisfies these conditions. Therefore, the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a **non-degenerate continuum**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Structure of the Remainder\n\nNow we know $R$ is a non-degenerate continuum. But what kind of continuum? The question asks about its composants, which are primarily a feature of indecomposable continua.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The remainder of a continuum is indecomposable.**\nThere is a fundamental theorem in continua theory due to D.P. Bellamy:\n*   **Theorem (Bellamy, 1971):** If $M$ is a non-degenerate metric continuum and $p \\in M$, then the remainder $\\beta(M \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (M \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an **indecomposable continuum**.\n\nSince our space $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum, this theorem applies directly. Thus, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Composants of the Remainder\n\nWe have established that for any non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. The final step is to determine how many composants such a continuum has.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.**\nThis is a standard result in the theory of continua:\n*   **Theorem:** Any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, sometimes denoted by $c$) pairwise disjoint composants. Each composant is a dense $F_\\sigma$ subset.\n\nSince $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it must have exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. This result is independent of the specific structure of $X$ (as long as it's a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum) and the choice of point $x$. For example, if $X$ is the pseudo-arc, its remainder is also a pseudo-arc, which is hereditarily indecomposable and thus has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Even if $X$ is a different hereditarily indecomposable continuum leading to a remainder $R$ that is indecomposable but not hereditarily so (like a solenoid), $R$ would still have $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe need to find the *maximum possible* number of composants. Let's summarize our findings:\n1.  If $X$ is a single point, the number of composants of the remainder is 0.\n2.  If $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum, the number of composants of the remainder is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe maximum of these two values is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe number of composants is a fixed cardinality for any non-trivial case, so the maximum is simply this value.\n\nFinal answer: The maximum possible number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
