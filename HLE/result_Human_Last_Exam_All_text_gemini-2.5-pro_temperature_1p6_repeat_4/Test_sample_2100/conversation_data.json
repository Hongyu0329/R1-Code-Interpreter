    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the quotes and author:** The question begins by quoting the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. The quotes are \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This points to a specific work by Voznesensky about a historical figure who was a mariner/explorer and whose burial site was unknown for a long time.\n\n2.  **Identify the work:** The quotes are from Voznesensky's famous poem which served as the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This rock opera is one of the most famous in Russian culture.\n\n3.  **Identify the protagonist:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He undertook a famous sea voyage to California in the early 19th century aboard the ships *Juno* and *Avos*. The poetic description \"a joy-discovering sailor\" aptly fits Rezanov's role as the leader of this expedition.\n\n4.  **Analyze the clue about the grave:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" refers to a specific historical fact about Rezanov. On his return journey from Russian America, he fell ill and died in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried at the Resurrection Cathedral. However, in the 1930s, the Soviet government demolished the cathedral, and the exact location of his grave was lost. For decades, the burial place of this famous historical figure was unknown.\n\n5.  **Analyze the final clue:** The question states, \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is the key to confirming the identity. Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" during the era of Glasnost, there was a surge of public interest in finding Rezanov's lost grave. In the late 1980s, historical and archaeological work in Krasnoyarsk successfully identified the probable location of the burial site. This discovery was a significant cultural event, directly answering the question posed in Voznesensky's poem.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the answer:** The man described is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
