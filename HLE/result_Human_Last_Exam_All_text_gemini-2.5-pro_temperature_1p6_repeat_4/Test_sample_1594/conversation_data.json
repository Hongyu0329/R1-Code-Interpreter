    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high schools in Pisa.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks to identify the letter of the alphabet formed by the buildings of two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Schools:** The schools are the \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and the \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\".\n\n3.  **Locate the Schools:** The first step is to find these schools on a map. Using an online mapping service (like Google Maps), we can search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti Pisa\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini Pisa\". The search reveals they are indeed located right next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce.\n\n4.  **Examine the Aerial View:** The crucial part of the analysis is to switch the map view to \"Satellite\" or \"Aerial\" to see the actual shape of the buildings from above.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Shape of Each Building:**\n    *   The building complex for the Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" forms a very long, straight structure. This will serve as the main vertical line of the letter.\n    *   The adjacent building complex for the I.I.S. \"G. Galilei - A. Pacinotti\" is connected to the \"Ulisse Dini\" building. It consists of two main wings that extend outwards from the long structure of the Dini.\n\n6.  **Combine the Shapes:**\n    *   We take the long, vertical building of the \"Ulisse Dini\" as the spine of the letter.\n    *   We then add the two horizontal wings of the \"Galilei-Pacinotti\" which branch off from this spine. One wing is near the top, and the other is near the middle.\n\n7.  **Identify the Letter:** The resulting shape—a long vertical stroke with two shorter horizontal strokes extending from its side (one at the top, one in the middle)—is clearly recognizable as the letter **F**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Both schools together:** It's important to understand that the shape is formed by the *combination* of the two adjacent school buildings, not just one of them.\n*   **Perspective:** The letter shape is only visible from a top-down or aerial perspective.\n*   **Verification:** This is a well-known piece of local trivia in Pisa, and a quick search for \"Pisa schools form letter\" or \"Scuole Pisa forma di F\" confirms this observation.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the shape formed by the two high schools.\n\n<<<F>>>"
