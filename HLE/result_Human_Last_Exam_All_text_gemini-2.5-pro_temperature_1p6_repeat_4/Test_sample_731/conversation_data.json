    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the properties of its power subgroups.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = b^2 = 1, bab = a^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nIn this problem, the group size is 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\nSo, we are analyzing the group $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$. Its presentation is:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = b^2 = 1, bab = a^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe group consists of $2^9 = 512$ elements, which can be written in the form $a^i$ or $a^i b$ for $0 \\leq i < 256$. The subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a \"power subgroup\" if it is of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\nFor any finite p-group (a group whose order is a power of a prime p), the set $G^k$ is always a subgroup of $G$. Since $SD_{512}$ is a 2-group, this property holds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating $G^k$ based on the parity of k**\n\nWe need to analyze the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for different values of $k$. We can split this analysis into two cases based on whether $k$ is odd or even.\n\n*   **Case 1: k is odd**\n    Let's find the elements of $G^k = \\{(a^i)^k\\} \\cup \\{(a^i b)^k\\}$.\n    -   For elements in $\\langle a \\rangle$: The elements are $(a^i)^k = a^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, |a|) = \\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. This means the mapping $x \\mapsto x^k$ is an automorphism of $\\langle a \\rangle$. Thus, $\\{(a^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\} = \\langle a \\rangle$.\n    -   For elements of the form $a^i b$: The calculation of $(a^i b)^k$ shows that when $k$ is odd, the set of all such elements is the same as the set of all elements of the form $a^j b$. Specifically, $(a^i b)^k = a^{i(1+(k-1)2^{n-3})}b$. Since $1+(k-1)2^{n-3}$ is odd, the map from $i$ to $j=i(1+(k-1)2^{n-3}) \\pmod{256}$ is a permutation. So, $\\{(a^i b)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\} = \\{a^j b \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$.\n    -   Combining these results, for any odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle a \\rangle \\cup \\{a^j b \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{256}\\} = G$.\n    -   This means all odd values of $k$ produce the same power subgroup, which is the group $G$ itself. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even**\n    Let $k=2m$ for some integer $m$.\n    -   For elements in $\\langle a \\rangle$: $(a^i)^k = a^{ik} = a^{i(2m)}$. The set of all such elements forms the subgroup $\\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n    -   For elements of the form $a^i b$: We calculate $(a^i b)^k = (a^i b)^{2m} = ((a^i b)^2)^m$. A key relation in $SD_{2^n}$ is $(a^i b)^2 = a^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$. In our case, $(a^i b)^2 = a^{128i}$. So, $(a^i b)^k = (a^{128i})^m = a^{128im}$.\n    -   The set $G^k$ is the union of $\\{(a^i)^k\\}$ and $\\{(a^i b)^k\\}$, both of which consist of powers of $a$. So $G^k$ is a subgroup of $\\langle a \\rangle$. The subgroup generated is $\\langle a^k, a^{128m} \\rangle$. Since $k=2m$, we have $128m = (k/2) \\cdot 128 = 64k$. The subgroup is $\\langle a^k, a^{64k} \\rangle = \\langle a^{\\gcd(k, 64k)} \\rangle = \\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n    -   Therefore, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nNow we need to count how many distinct subgroups arise from this analysis.\n1.  From odd $k$, we get one subgroup: $G$.\n2.  From even $k$, we get subgroups of the form $\\langle a^k \\rangle$. The subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ is cyclic of order 256. Its subgroups are of the form $\\langle a^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 256. The divisors are $2^j$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, 8$.\n    A subgroup $\\langle a^{2^j} \\rangle$ is a power subgroup if it can be written as $\\langle a^k \\rangle$ for some even $k$.\n    $\\langle a^k \\rangle = \\langle a^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$. So we need to find which values $2^j$ can be expressed as $\\gcd(k, 256)$ for some even $k$.\n    Since $k$ is even, $v_2(k) \\ge 1$, where $v_2$ is the 2-adic valuation. Thus, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 2^{\\min(v_2(k), 8)}$ must be a power of 2 greater than or equal to $2^1$.\n    The possible values for $\\gcd(k, 256)$ are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$. Each of these can be achieved by setting $k=2^j$ for $j=1, 2, \\dots, 8$.\n    So, the distinct power subgroups generated by even $k$ are:\n    $\\langle a^2 \\rangle, \\langle a^4 \\rangle, \\langle a^8 \\rangle, \\langle a^{16} \\rangle, \\langle a^{32} \\rangle, \\langle a^{64} \\rangle, \\langle a^{128} \\rangle, \\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n    These are 8 distinct subgroups. Note that $\\langle a \\rangle = \\langle a^{2^0} \\rangle$ cannot be generated, as that would require $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$, which means $k$ must be odd.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups is:\n-   $G$ (from odd k)\n-   The 8 distinct cyclic subgroups of $\\langle a \\rangle$: $\\langle a^2 \\rangle, \\langle a^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese two sets are disjoint because $G$ is non-abelian, while the other 8 are abelian (cyclic).\nThe total number of power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\nMore generally, for any semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ with $n \\ge 3$, the number of power subgroups is $n$. For $SD_{512}$, $n=9$, so the answer is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
