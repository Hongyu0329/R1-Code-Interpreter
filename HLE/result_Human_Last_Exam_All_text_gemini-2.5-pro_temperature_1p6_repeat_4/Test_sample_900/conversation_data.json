    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Question:**\n    *   **Piece:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (also sometimes known by other names, but recognizable by its signature jetés)\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Company/Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015\n    *   **Action to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n2.  **Analysis of the term \"pas de Balanchine\":**\n    *   The primary challenge in this question is defining a \"pas de Balanchine.\" In the formal vocabulary of classical ballet, there is no officially recognized or codified step with this name. It is not a standard term like *plié*, *tendu*, or *jeté*.\n    *   The term likely refers colloquially to a movement or pose that is characteristic of the style of choreographer George Balanchine. This could be a specific lunge, a particular use of the arms (port de bras), an off-balance position, or a swift connecting step. However, there is no universal agreement on what a single \"pas de Balanchine\" is.\n    *   It's a descriptive phrase, not a technical one.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Choreography:**\n    *   William Forsythe's choreography, particularly in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" is famously an extension and deconstruction of the classical ballet vocabulary established by predecessors like Marius Petipa and, very significantly, George Balanchine.\n    *   Forsythe trained and danced in a Balanchine-influenced environment. His work takes Balanchine's principles—speed, angularity, off-balance movement, and extreme lines—and pushes them even further.\n    *   Therefore, one could argue that the *entire solo* is a continuous expression of a post-Balanchine style. Trying to isolate a specific, repeating \"pas de Balanchine\" is like trying to count individual \"brushstrokes of Impressionism\" in a Monet painting. The influence is foundational and pervasive, not a series of discrete, countable events.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:**\n    *   Since \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a defined, countable step within the ballet lexicon, it is impossible to count how many were performed.\n    *   The question is based on a flawed premise that such a countable step exists. Svetlana Gileva performed many steps that were *in the style of Balanchine as re-interpreted by Forsythe*, but she did not perform any steps formally called a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n    *   Therefore, the correct numerical answer, based on the formal definitions of ballet terminology, must be zero.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the final answer is determined as follows:\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" does not refer to a specific, codified step in the ballet vocabulary. It is a colloquialism for a movement in the style of choreographer George Balanchine. As it is not a defined, countable step, no performer can technically execute a \"pas de Balanchine.\" William Forsythe's choreography is heavily influenced by Balanchine's style, but this influence is pervasive throughout the movement rather than appearing as a discrete, repeating step. Therefore, the number of formally defined \"pas de Balanchines\" Svetlana Gileva performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
