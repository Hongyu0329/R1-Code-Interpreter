    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe want to find the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functions `f` and `g`**\n*   **Degree:** $f$ and $g$ are both polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n    *   Let $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   **Derivatives:** $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions over the entire real line.\n    *   The derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n        *   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$\n        *   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$\n    *   For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive and its discriminant must be negative.\n        *   For $f'(x)$: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$. And $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n        *   For $g'(x)$: $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$. And $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Fixed Point Equation**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$.\n\n*   **Degree of the Composite Function:** The degree of $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(h) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   **Degree of the Fixed Point Polynomial:** The polynomial is $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n    *   The leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$.\n    *   Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive and non-zero.\n    *   Thus, $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**4. Find the Maximum Number of Roots**\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 9 can have at most **9** real roots. This means $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**5. Determine if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\nNow, we must determine if it's possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 distinct real fixed points.\n\n*   **Condition for 9 Roots:** For a degree 9 polynomial to have 9 distinct real roots, it must have 8 distinct real critical points (where its derivative is zero), and the function's values at these critical points must alternate in sign.\n*   **Critical Points:** Let's find the derivative of $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n    *   Using the chain rule, $P'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   The critical points are the solutions to $P'(x) = 0$, which means we must solve the equation $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = 1$.\n*   **Analyzing the Critical Point Equation:** Let's determine the nature of the function $H(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is a composition of a degree 2 polynomial and a degree 3 polynomial, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $H(x)$ is the product of a degree 6 polynomial and a degree 2 polynomial, so its degree is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   **Number of Critical Points:** The equation for the critical points, $H(x) = 1$, is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. Such an equation can have up to 8 distinct real roots. Therefore, it is possible for $P(x)$ to have 8 distinct real critical points.\n*   **Arranging the Critical Values:** Let the 8 critical points be $c_1 < c_2 < \\dots < c_8$. For $P(x)$ to have 9 roots, the values $P(c_1), P(c_2), \\dots, P(c_8)$ must alternate in sign. For example, $P(c_1)>0, P(c_2)<0, P(c_3)>0, \\dots, P(c_8)<0$.\n    *   The coefficients of $f$ and $g$ provide significant freedom. The constant term of $f(x)$, which is $d$, does not affect $f'(x)$ or $g'(x)$. Therefore, it does not change the location of the critical points $c_i$.\n    *   However, changing $d$ shifts the entire graph of $P(x)$ vertically: $P(x) \\to P(x)+d$.\n    *   By choosing an appropriate value for $d$, we can shift the graph of $P(x)$ up or down. As long as the local maxima and minima are not all equal, we can position the x-axis to cut through all the \"wiggles\" of the polynomial, creating 9 distinct roots. The condition for this is that the minimum of all the local maximum values must be greater than the maximum of all the local minimum values.\n    *   While constructing an explicit example is complicated, the argument shows that there is enough freedom in the coefficients of the general 3rd-degree polynomials $f$ and $g$ (subject to the derivative constraints) to create a situation where `f(g(x)) - x = 0` has 8 distinct critical points and their values can be arranged to produce 9 roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem reduces to finding the maximum number of real roots of a polynomial of degree 9. This maximum is 9. The analysis shows that the constraints on $f$ and $g$ do not fundamentally restrict the number of roots to be less than the degree of the polynomial. The necessary conditions for achieving 9 roots (having 8 critical points whose values allow for 9 zero-crossings) are plausible for this class of functions.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n>>>9"
