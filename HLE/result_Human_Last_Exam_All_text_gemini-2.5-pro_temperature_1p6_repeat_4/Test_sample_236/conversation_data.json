    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant knots**\nFirst, we list all knots with a crossing number of four or less. We must distinguish between a knot and its mirror image if they are chiral.\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$. It is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the full list of knots to consider is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $\\overline{3_1}$, and $4_1$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the surgery operation**\nThe question asks for elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. These elements are represented by oriented integral homology 3-spheres. An integral homology 3-sphere is a 3-manifold $M$ whose first homology group $H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial.\n\nWhen we perform $n$-surgery on a knot $K$ in $S^3$, the resulting manifold, denoted $S^3_n(K)$, has its first homology group given by $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be a homology sphere, we need $|n|=1$. Thus, we are restricted to performing $+1$ or $-1$ surgery on each of the knots identified in Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the surgeries on each knot and identify the resulting homology cobordism classes**\nWe will analyze the homology spheres obtained from $\\pm 1$ surgery on each knot. Two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ represent the same element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ if they are homology cobordant. To distinguish between homology cobordism classes, we can use invariants such as the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) and the Froyshov invariant ($h$). For an element $[M] \\in \\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, these invariants satisfy $\\lambda(-[M]) = -\\lambda([M])$ and $h(-[M]) = -h([M])$.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ both yield the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   Invariants: $\\lambda(S^3)=0$, $h(S^3)=0$.\n    *   This gives us **1 element**: the trivial one.\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   **+1 surgery:** $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ is the Poincar√© homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda=1$ and $h=2$.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ is another homology sphere. Its invariants are $\\lambda=-1$ and $h=0$.\n    *   The pairs of invariants $(\\lambda, h)$ are $(1,2)$ and $(-1,0)$. Since these are distinct from each other and from $(0,0)$, these represent two new, distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$)**:\n    We use the formula $S^3_n(\\overline{K}) = -S^3_{-n}(K)$, which relates surgery on a mirror knot to the oriented reversal of surgery on the original knot.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1}) = -S^3_{-1}(3_1)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -(-1) = 1$ and $h = -h(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -0 = 0$. The invariant pair is $(1,0)$.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1}) = -S^3_{+1}(3_1)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -(1) = -1$ and $h = -h(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -(2) = -2$. The invariant pair is $(-1,-2)$.\n    *   The pairs of invariants $(1,0)$ and $(-1,-2)$ are new and distinct from all previous ones. This gives two more distinct elements.\n\n4.  **Figure-eight knot ($4_1$)**:\n    This knot is amphichiral, meaning $4_1$ is equivalent to $\\overline{4_1}$. This implies the relation $S^3_n(4_1) = -S^3_{-n}(4_1)$.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** The manifold $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space. Its invariants are $\\lambda=1$ and $h=-2$. The invariant pair is $(1,-2)$.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** From the amphichirality relation, $S^3_{+1}(4_1) = -S^3_{-1}(4_1)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = -(1) = -1$ and $h = -h(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = -(-2) = 2$. The invariant pair is $(-1,2)$.\n    *   The pairs of invariants $(1,-2)$ and $(-1,2)$ are new and distinct from all previous ones. This gives two more distinct elements.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the distinct elements**\nLet's list the distinct homology cobordism classes we found, identified by their $(\\lambda, h)$ invariants:\n1.  From the unknot: $(0,0)$ - the trivial element.\n2.  From the right-handed trefoil: $(1,2)$ and $(-1,0)$.\n3.  From the left-handed trefoil: $(1,0)$ and $(-1,-2)$.\n4.  From the figure-eight knot: $(1,-2)$ and $(-1,2)$.\n\nThe set of all unique invariant pairs is:\n$\\{ (0,0), (1,2), (-1,0), (1,0), (-1,-2), (1,-2), (-1,2) \\}$\n\nAll seven of these pairs are distinct. Since the pair of invariants $(\\lambda, h)$ is an invariant of homology cobordism, two manifolds with different $(\\lambda, h)$ pairs must belong to different homology cobordism classes. Therefore, we have found 7 distinct elements.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy analyzing integral surgeries on all knots with four or fewer crossings, we have identified 7 distinct homology cobordism classes: the trivial class from the unknot, four distinct classes from the right- and left-handed trefoils, and two distinct classes from the figure-eight knot.\n\nFinal count:\n*   Unknot: 1 element ($S^3$)\n*   Trefoils ($3_1, \\overline{3_1}$): 4 elements ($S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$, $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$)\n*   Figure-eight ($4_1$): 2 elements ($S^3_{+1}(4_1)$, $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$)\nTotal = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.\n\nThis result might seem small, but it comes from a very restricted set of knots and surgery coefficients. The homology cobordism group itself is infinitely generated.\n\n<<<7>>>"
