    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to determine the total number of unique members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 Family Member\"**\nA microRNA family is a group of miRNAs that share a common \"seed sequence.\" The seed sequence consists of nucleotides 2 through 8 of the mature miRNA and is the primary determinant of which messenger RNA (mRNA) targets the miRNA will bind to. For the let-7 family, the canonical seed sequence is **GAGGUAG**. A \"member\" of the family is typically defined as a unique mature miRNA sequence that contains this seed, regardless of how many different genes produce it.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Canonical \"let-7\" Members**\nFirst, we list the miRNAs explicitly named \"let-7\" in humans. These are the core members of the family. Consulting authoritative databases like miRBase (the primary repository for miRNA data), we find the following human members:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n\nThis gives us an initial count of 8 members.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Other miRNAs Belonging to the Family**\nFamily membership is based on the seed sequence, not the name. Therefore, we must also identify other human miRNAs that are not named \"let-7\" but share the same seed sequence.\n*   **miR-98:** It is well-established and universally recognized that miR-98 shares the let-7 seed sequence and is functionally a part of the let-7 family.\n\nAdding miR-98 to our list brings the total number of members to **9**.\n\n**Step 5: List the Final Members of the let-7 Family**\nBased on the current consensus from major databases (miRBase, TargetScan), the human let-7 family consists of the following 9 distinct members:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Members vs. Genes:** It is crucial to distinguish between the number of unique miRNA members and the number of genes that encode them. Some members are encoded by multiple genes (paralogs). For example:\n    *   **let-7a** is produced by 3 different genes (hsa-let-7a-1, hsa-let-7a-2, hsa-let-7a-3).\n    *   **let-7f** is produced by 2 different genes (hsa-let-7f-1, hsa-let-7f-2).\n    *   The other 7 members are each produced from a single gene.\n    This means there are a total of 12 distinct genes (3 + 2 + 7*1) that produce the 9 members of the let-7 family. The question asks for the number of **members**, not genes.\n\n2.  **Exclusion of let-7h:** In the past, let-7h was sometimes mentioned. However, it is not found in the human reference genome and is not classified as a human miRNA in miRBase. It is found in other primates but not humans.\n\n3.  **Other Potential Members:** While other miRNAs, such as miR-4500, have been noted to possess the let-7 seed sequence, they are not yet officially classified as part of the let-7 family in the major reference databases (miRBase, TargetScan). Therefore, based on the established and standard classification, the count remains 9.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a systematic review of the canonical members and other miRNAs that share the family's defining seed sequence, as cataloged in authoritative biological databases, the human let-7 family is comprised of 9 distinct members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
