    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character's Structure**\nThe kanji character in question is 謄. To find its radical (部首, bushu), we need to break it down into its constituent parts. Visually, 謄 can be separated into a left component and a right component.\n*   Left Component: 言\n*   Right Component: A phonetic component derived from 朕 (chin) or 滕 (tō).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical**\nIn the standard system for classifying kanji (the Kangxi radical system), characters are grouped under a single, definitive radical. This is typically the part that indicates the character's general semantic category.\n*   The left part, 言, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The right part provides the sound.\nCharacters related to language, speech, documents, or records often use the 言 radical. Since 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" placing it under the 言 radical is logical. Dictionaries and standard radical lists confirm that 謄 is classified under the 言 radical.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical 言 has several names in Japanese. However, the name often changes depending on its position within a character.\n*   The general name for the radical is ことば (kotoba) or げん (gen).\n*   When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for 言 when it is on the left side is ごんべん (gonben). This comes from \"gon\" (an on'yomi for 言) + \"hen\" (meaning \"left side\").\n\n**Step 4: Provide the Hepburn Transcription of the Radical's Name**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name ごんべん using Hepburn romanization.\n*   ご -> go\n*   ん -> n\n*   べ -> be\n*   ん -> n\nCombining these gives \"gonben\". Following the example \"Onnahen\" for 媛, using the positional name is the correct approach.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correct Radical Identification:** Do not confuse the phonetic component on the right as the radical. The radical is the classifying element, which is 言 on the left.\n2.  **Positional Naming:** Radicals have different names depending on their position (e.g., hen, tsukuri, kanmuri, ashi, etc.). The example \"Onnahen\" for 媛 indicates that the positional name is required. For 謄, the radical 言 is on the left, making it a \"hen\", specifically \"gonben\".\n3.  **Accurate Romanization:** Ensure the Hepburn transcription is correct. ごんべん is \"gonben\".\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined that the radical of 謄 is 言, its positional name is ごんべん, and its Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
