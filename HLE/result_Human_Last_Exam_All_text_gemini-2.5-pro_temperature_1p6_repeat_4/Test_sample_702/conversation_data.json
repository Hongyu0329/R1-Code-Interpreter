    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n**1. Understand the Spaces and the Map**\n\n*   **Spaces:**\n    *   Source space: `X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)`.\n        *   `\\Omega S^n` is the loop space of the n-sphere. `S^n` is `(n-1)`-connected, so `\\Omega S^n` is `(n-2)`-connected.\n        *   `\\Omega S^4` is 2-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n        *   `\\Omega S^6` is 4-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n        *   The smash product `A \\wedge B` has connectivity `conn(A \\wedge B) \\ge conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`. So, `\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6` is at least `2 + 4 + 1 = 7` connected. More accurately, using the Kunneth theorem for homology, the first non-trivial homology group is `H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}`. By the Hurewicz theorem, the space `\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6` is 7-connected, and `\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n        *   The suspension `\\Sigma Z` of a `k`-connected space `Z` is `(k+1)`-connected. So the source space `X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)` is `7+1=8`-connected.\n        *   The first non-trivial homotopy group of the source is `\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n    *   Target space: `Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)`.\n        *   `S^4 \\wedge S^6` is homeomorphic to `S^{10}`.\n        *   So the target space is `Y = \\Omega S^{10}`.\n        *   `S^{10}` is 9-connected. The loop space `\\Omega S^{10}` is therefore `9-1=8`-connected.\n        *   The first non-trivial homotopy group of the target is `\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n\n*   **The Map:** `f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)`\n    This map is a standard map in homotopy theory, often denoted `\\alpha_{4,6}`. It is related to the Samelson and Whitehead products. A crucial property of this map, as `p=4` and `q=6` are both even, is that its adjoint `adj(f): \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))` is rationally trivial. This means that for any rational cohomology class in the target, its pullback is zero. This implies that any map on rational homotopy groups induced by `f` is the zero map.\n\n**2. Analyze the Connectivity**\n\nThe connectivity of a map `f: X \\to Y` is the largest integer `k` such that the induced map on homotopy groups, `\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)`, is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of `f`, denoted `F_f`, being `(k-1)`-connected.\n\n*   **Lower Connectivity (`i < 9`):**\n    *   The source space `X` is 8-connected, so `\\pi_i(X) = 0` for `i \\le 8`.\n    *   The target space `Y` is 8-connected, so `\\pi_i(Y) = 0` for `i \\le 8`.\n    *   For `i \\le 8`, the map `\\pi_i(f)` is a map from the zero group to the zero group (`0 \\to 0`), which is an isomorphism.\n    *   So, the connectivity of `f` is at least 9. We need to check if `\\pi_9(f)` is a surjection.\n\n*   **Connectivity at `i = 9`:**\n    *   We need to analyze the map `\\pi_9(f): \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)`.\n    *   From Step 1, we know `\\pi_9(X) = \\mathbb{Z}` and `\\pi_9(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n    *   The map `\\pi_9(f)` is a homomorphism `\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}`.\n    *   Since the map `f` is rationally trivial, the induced map on rational homotopy groups, `\\pi_9(f) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}: \\pi_9(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\pi_9(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}`, must be the zero map.\n    *   `\\pi_9(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}` and `\\pi_9(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}`. The map is `0: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{Q}`.\n    *   This implies that the original integer map `\\pi_9(f): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}` must be the zero map.\n    *   The zero map from `\\mathbb{Z}` to `\\mathbb{Z}` is not a surjection (its image is `{0}`, not `\\mathbb{Z}`).\n    *   Since `\\pi_9(f)` is not a surjection, the connectivity `k` must be less than 9.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Connectivity:**\n    *   `\\pi_i(f)` is an isomorphism for `i < 9` (in fact for `i \\le 8`).\n    *   `\\pi_9(f)` is not a surjection.\n    *   This contradicts the definition of `k`-connectivity for `k=9`. Let's re-examine the definition and the low-dimensional isomorphisms.\n    *   A map `f` is `k`-connected if `\\pi_i(f)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i=k`.\n    *   Let's check `k=8`. `\\pi_i(f)` must be an iso for `i < 8`, and `\\pi_8(f)` must be a surjection.\n    *   We found `\\pi_i(f)` is an iso for `i \\le 8`. So it is certainly an iso for `i<8` and a surjection for `i=8`. Thus, the map is at least 8-connected.\n    *   Let's check `k=9`. `\\pi_i(f)` must be an iso for `i < 9`, and `\\pi_9(f)` must be a surjection.\n    *   `\\pi_i(f)` is indeed an iso for `i < 9` (i.e., for `i \\le 8`).\n    *   But `\\pi_9(f)` is the zero map `\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}`, which is not surjective.\n    *   Therefore, the connectivity is exactly 8.\n\n*   **Verification using the Homotopy Fiber:**\n    *   The connectivity of `f` is `k` if its fiber `F_f` is `(k-1)`-connected.\n    *   Let's analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration `F_f \\to X \\to Y`:\n        `... \\to \\pi_9(X) \\xrightarrow{\\pi_9(f)} \\pi_9(Y) \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to \\pi_8(X) \\to \\pi_8(Y) \\to ...`\n    *   Plugging in the known groups and maps:\n        `... \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to ...`\n    *   From exactness at `\\pi_9(Y)`, we have `Im(\\pi_9(f)) = Ker(\\pi_9(Y) \\to \\pi_8(F_f))`. Since `Im(\\pi_9(f)) = 0`, the map `\\pi_9(Y) \\to \\pi_8(F_f)` is injective.\n    *   From exactness at `\\pi_8(F_f)`, we have `Im(\\pi_9(Y) \\to \\pi_8(F_f)) = Ker(\\pi_8(F_f) \\to \\pi_8(X))`. Since the map to `\\pi_8(X)=0` is the zero map, this kernel is all of `\\pi_8(F_f)`.\n    *   This gives a short exact sequence: `0 \\to \\pi_9(Y) \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to \\pi_8(X) \\to 0`, which simplifies to `0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to 0 \\to 0`.\n    *   This implies `\\pi_8(F_f) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}`.\n    *   Since `X` and `Y` are 8-connected, `\\pi_i(F_f) = 0` for `i \\le 7`.\n    *   Thus, the fiber `F_f` is 7-connected.\n    *   If the fiber is `(k-1)`-connected, the map is `k`-connected. Here `k-1=7`, so `k=8`.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 8.\n\n>>>8"
