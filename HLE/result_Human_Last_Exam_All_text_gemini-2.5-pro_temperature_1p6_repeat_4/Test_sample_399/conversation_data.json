    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so it is a separable differential equation.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo separate the variables, we want to get all terms involving $x$ on one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ on the other side with $dt$. We can achieve this by dividing both sides by $x^2$ and multiplying by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we implicitly assume that $x(t)$ is not identically zero. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If we substitute $x(t)=0$ into the original equation, we get $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. By the existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations, our solution cannot cross the equilibrium solution $x(t)=0$. Thus, we can safely proceed with the division.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\nThe left-side integral is:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} + C_1 = -\\frac{1}{x} + C_1 $$\nThe right-side integral is:\n$$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C_2 $$\nCombining the results and merging the constants of integration ($C = C_2 - C_1$), we get the general solution in implicit form:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution to find the value of the constant $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\nSo, the particular solution for this initial value problem is:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Find the value of x(1)**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution we just found.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. Multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to get $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe differential equation is separable. After separating variables, we get $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$. Integrating both sides gives $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$. Using the initial condition $x(0)=-8$, we substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ to find $C$: $-\\frac{1}{-8} = 0 - 0 + C$, which gives $C=\\frac{1}{8}$. The particular solution is $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$. To find $x(1)$, we substitute $t=1$: $-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}$, and so $x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
