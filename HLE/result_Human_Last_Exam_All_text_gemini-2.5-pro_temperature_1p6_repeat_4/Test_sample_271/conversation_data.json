    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the possible degrees of the normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its factors.**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find common factors among the terms.\nWe can regroup the terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$g(x) = x^2 - 2$\n$h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThe roots of $g(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe degree of this extension is $[K_g : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nThe Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g / \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nFirst, we check for irreducibility of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n- The prime $p=3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides -9, 0, 0, 3).\n- The prime $p=3$ does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n- $p^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\nThus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nNext, we determine its Galois group, which is a subgroup of $S_5$.\nSince $h(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, its Galois group must contain an element of order 5 (a 5-cycle).\nTo further identify the group, we determine the number of real roots of $h(x)$. We analyze its derivative:\n$h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\nThe critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. The critical points are $x_0$ and $-x_0$. We evaluate $h(x)$ at these points:\n- $h(-x_0) = -(-x_0)^5 - 9(-x_0) + 3 = -x_0^5 + 9x_0 + 3 = -(x_0^4)x_0 + 9x_0 + 3 = -(9/5)x_0 + 9x_0 + 3 = (36/5)x_0 + 3$. Since $x_0 > 0$, $h(-x_0) > 0$. This is a local maximum.\n- $h(x_0) = x_0^5 - 9x_0 + 3 = (x_0^4)x_0 - 9x_0 + 3 = (9/5)x_0 - 9x_0 + 3 = -(36/5)x_0 + 3$. To check the sign: $( (36/5)x_0 )^4 = (36/5)^4 (9/5) > 3^4=81$, so $(36/5)x_0 > 3$. Thus, $h(x_0) < 0$. This is a local minimum.\nSince we have a local maximum that is positive and a local minimum that is negative, the polynomial $h(x)$ must have three real roots. The other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\nThe complex conjugation is an automorphism in the Galois group that acts as a transposition, swapping the two complex roots while fixing the three real roots.\nA subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle and a transposition must be $S_5$ itself.\nSo, the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$. The degree of this extension is $[K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n$K$ is the compositum of $K_g$ and $K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$. The order is given by the formula:\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] [K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_h$ is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_h$.\nThe Galois group of $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. The only normal subgroup of index 2 is $A_5$. By Galois theory, $K_h$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^5+px+q$ is $D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}((-4)^4 p^5 + 5^5 q^4)$, wait the formula for $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe square-free part of $D$ is not 2. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSo, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the possible degrees of normal sub-extensions.**\nWe are looking for the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ for normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these fields $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = [G:H]$.\nWe need to find the indices of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include:\n1.  Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft G_2$.\n2.  \"Diagonal\" subgroups, which arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors.\n\nLet's list the subgroups of type 1 and their indices:\n-   $H_1 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_1| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/120 = 2$.\n-   $H_2 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2| = 2$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/2 = 120$.\n-   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_3| = 120$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$.\n-   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_4| = 60$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/60 = 4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the diagonal subgroups. These arise from isomorphisms $\\phi: G_1/N_1 \\to G_2/N_2$. In our case, this means an isomorphism $\\phi: (C_2/N_1) \\to (S_5/N_2)$. The only non-trivial possibility is when both quotient groups are isomorphic to $C_2$.\nThis occurs when we take $N_1=\\{e\\}$ and $N_2=A_5$. We have the isomorphism $\\phi: C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2 \\to S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. Let $C_2 = \\{c_e, c_1\\}$. This map is unique up to the generator of $C_2$. It defines a normal subgroup:\n$H_5 = \\{(g,s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(g) = sA_5 \\}$.\nThis subgroup consists of pairs $(c_e, s)$ where $s \\in A_5$ and pairs $(c_1, s)$ where $s \\notin A_5$.\nThe order is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\nThe index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nAll these subgroups correspond to fields $L$ that are proper subfields of $K$ and proper extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe possible indices we have found are 2, 4, and 120. These are the possible degrees for the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe possible degrees are the elements of the set $\\{[G:H_1], [G:H_2], [G:H_3], [G:H_4], [G:H_5]\\} = \\{2, 120, 2, 4, 2\\} = \\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal list of careful points checked:\n1.  Correct factorization of the polynomial.\n2.  Correct Galois groups for the factors.\n3.  Correct logic for determining the Galois group of the compositum.\n4.  Correct application of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.\n5.  Systematic and complete search for normal subgroups of the product group $C_2 \\times S_5$.\n6.  Correct calculation of indices for these subgroups.\n\nThe possible degrees of such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
