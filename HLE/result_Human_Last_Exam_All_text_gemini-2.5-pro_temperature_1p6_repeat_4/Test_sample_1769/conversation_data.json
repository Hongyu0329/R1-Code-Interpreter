    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Modern English Word and its Origin:**\n    The modern word is \"sister\". This word comes from Old English, the language of the Anglo-Saxons. The original Old English word was *sweostor*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Old Norse Equivalent:**\n    The Norse invaders spoke Old Norse. Their word for sister was *systir*. It's important to note that both Old English *sweostor* and Old Norse *systir* are cognates, meaning they both evolved from the same even older root word in Proto-Germanic, which was **swestÄ“r*. Because of this shared origin, they were already quite similar.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Influence of Old Norse on Old English:**\n    When the Norse settled in large parts of England (an area known as the Danelaw), their language mingled with Old English. In cases where cognates existed, like *sweostor* and *systir*, the two forms influenced each other. The Old Norse form *systir* was phonetically simpler. Over time, the influence of the numerous Old Norse speakers pushed the pronunciation of the English word towards their version.\n    *   The initial `sw-` in Old English *sweostor* was simplified to `s-`, matching the Old Norse *systir*.\n    *   The Old English `eo` vowel sound was replaced by a sound closer to the Old Norse `y` (which is like a modern `i`), leading to the form we see today.\n\n4.  **Examine the Linguistic Evidence from Middle English:**\n    During the Middle English period, after the height of the Norse invasions, we can see this linguistic battle playing out in written texts.\n    *   In the North and East of England (the former Danelaw), the form **\"sister\"** appeared and became dominant. This is the direct result of Norse influence.\n    *   In the South and West of England, where Norse influence was much weaker, the native Old English word *sweostor* evolved more naturally. It became **\"suster\"**.\n\n5.  **Project the Outcome Without Norse Influence:**\n    If the Norse had never invaded, there would have been no Old Norse speakers in England to influence the language. The Northern \"sister\" form would never have developed. Therefore, the Southern English form, \"suster\", which was the natural evolution of the original Anglo-Saxon word *sweostor*, would have continued to be the standard form throughout the country. Other West Germanic languages that did not have this specific Norse influence show similar outcomes (e.g., Dutch *zuster*, West Frisian *suster*).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout the linguistic pressure from the Old Norse word *systir*, the Old English word *sweostor* would have followed its own natural evolutionary path. Based on the evidence from dialects in areas with minimal Norse contact and comparison with related languages, this path would have led to the word **\"suster\"**. The form \"sister\" is a direct result of the interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
