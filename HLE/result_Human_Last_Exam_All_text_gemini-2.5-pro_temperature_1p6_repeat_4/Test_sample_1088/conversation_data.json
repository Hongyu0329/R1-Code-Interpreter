    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G**\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` provides a recipe for how to build basis functions from primitive Gaussian functions for each atom. Let's break down each part:\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the **core** atomic orbitals. It means that each core atomic orbital is represented by a single basis function, which is a linear combination (a contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (pGTOs).\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the **valence** atomic orbitals. The valence shell is described by a \"triple-zeta\" set of basis functions, meaning three functions are used for each valence orbital.\n    *   The first number, `3`, means the first (inner) valence basis function is a contraction of **3** pGTOs.\n    *   The second number, `1`, means the second (middle) valence basis function is uncontracted, consisting of **1** pGTO.\n    *   The third number, `1`, means the third (outer) valence basis function is also uncontracted, consisting of **1** pGTO.\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating that Gaussian-type orbitals are being used.\n*   **`**` (the two asterisks)**: These indicate the addition of **polarization functions**, which improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of polarization functions to all \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., non-hydrogen atoms). For second-row atoms (like C, N, O), this is a single set of `d`-functions. This set is typically uncontracted, meaning it is built from a single primitive Gaussian shell.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) adds a set of polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This is a single set of `p`-functions, which is also uncontracted and built from a single primitive Gaussian shell.\n\n### Step 2: Address the Ambiguity of the Question\n\nThe question asks for a single number for the entire basis set. However, the total number of primitives depends on the specific molecule (the number and type of atoms) being calculated. To provide a single numerical answer, we must assume a specific, common molecule. The most archetypal molecule used in computational chemistry examples is **methane (CH₄)**, which contains one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. We will proceed with this assumption.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Primitives for a Carbon Atom (Second-Row Heavy Atom)\n\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** Carbon has a `1s` core orbital. Following the `6-` rule, this is described by 1 shell of **6** primitive s-Gaussians.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The `-311` rule applies. For Pople basis sets on heavy atoms, the `s` and `p` valence orbitals share the same primitive exponents (these are called `SP` shells).\n    *   Inner valence `SP` shell (from `-3`): **3** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Middle valence `SP` shell (from `-1`): **1** primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Outer valence `SP` shell (from `-1`): **1** primitive Gaussian.\n    *   *Total valence primitives:* 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Polarization Functions (`*`):** A single, uncontracted `d`-shell is added. This requires **1** primitive d-Gaussian.\n*   **Total Primitives for Carbon:** 6 (core) + 5 (valence) + 1 (polarization) = **12 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom\n\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part is not applicable.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (1s):** The `-311` rule applies to the `1s` orbital.\n    *   Inner valence `s`-shell (from `-3`): **3** primitive s-Gaussians.\n    *   Middle valence `s`-shell (from `-1`): **1** primitive s-Gaussian.\n    *   Outer valence `s`-shell (from `-1`): **1** primitive s-Gaussian.\n    *   *Total valence primitives:* 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Polarization Functions (`**`):** A single, uncontracted `p`-shell is added. This requires **1** primitive p-Gaussian.\n*   **Total Primitives for Hydrogen:** 5 (valence) + 1 (polarization) = **6 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Primitives for Methane (CH₄)\n\nNow, we sum the primitives for all atoms in the assumed molecule, CH₄.\n\n*   Total Primitives = (Primitives for 1 Carbon atom) + (Primitives for 4 Hydrogen atoms)\n*   Total Primitives = (12) + (4 × 6)\n*   Total Primitives = 12 + 24\n*   Total Primitives = 36\n\n<<<36>>>"
