    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the given infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of a full product from n=1**\n\nThe given product starts from $n=3$. We can relate it to the product that starts from $n=1$. Let the desired product be $P$.\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nLet $P_{full}$ be the product from $n=1$ to infinity:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nThe full product can be written as the product of its first two terms ($n=1, 2$) and the rest of the terms (from $n=3$).\n$$ P_{full} = \\left( \\prod_{n=1}^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ P_{full} = \\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) \\cdot P $$\nTherefore, we can find $P$ by dividing $P_{full}$ by the first two terms:\n$$ P = \\frac{P_{full}}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)} $$\nOur main task now is to evaluate $P_{full}$.\n\n**Step 2: Factor the general term of the product**\n\nWe use the factorization for the difference of cubes, $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$, but a more useful factorization involves the complex cube roots of unity. Let $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$ be the cube roots of unity, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. The factorization of $1-x^3$ is $(1-x)(1-\\omega x)(1-\\omega^2 x)$.\nApplying this to the term in our product with $x = z/n$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the full product to the Gamma function**\n\nSubstituting this factorization into the expression for $P_{full}$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe overall product converges absolutely because $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} |z^3/n^3| = |z|^3 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 1/n^3$ converges. This allows us to regroup the terms.\nHowever, individual products like $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - z/n)$ diverge. To handle this, we introduce convergence factors. We group the terms as follows:\n$$ P_{full} = \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n}\\right] $$\nThis regrouping is valid because for each $n$, the product of the convergence factors is $e^{z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega^2 z/n} = e^{(z/n)(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}$. Since the sum of the cube roots of unity is $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, this factor is $e^0=1$.\n\nNow, we relate these convergent products to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. One of the standard forms is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{-\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\nThis gives us:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\nWe apply this formula to each of the three products in our expression for $P_{full}$ by setting $x=z$, $x=\\omega z$, and $x=\\omega^2 z$.\n\\begin{align*} \\label{eq:1} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n} &= \\frac{e^{\\gamma z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)} \\\\ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n} &= \\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)} \\\\ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n} &= \\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega^2 z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} \\end{align*}\nMultiplying these three expressions gives $P_{full}$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)} \\cdot \\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)} \\cdot \\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega^2 z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nAgain using $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, the numerator becomes $e^0=1$. So,\n$$ P_{full} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Combine results to get the final answer**\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $P_{full}$ back into our formula for $P$ from Step 1:\n$$ P = \\frac{P_{full}}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nThis expression can be written more tidily by clearing the fraction in the denominator:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\frac{8-z^3}{8}\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} = \\frac{8}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(8-z^3\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Final verification of careful points:**\n*   The product starts at $n=3$, which is handled by dividing the full product by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n*   The absolute convergence of the original product validates the manipulations.\n*   The use of convergence factors and their cancellation due to $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$ is a key step.\n*   The zeros of the full product $P_{full}$ correspond to the poles of the Gamma functions in the denominator. The factors $(1-z^3)$ and $(1-z^3/8)$ in the denominator of $P$ correctly cancel out the zeros corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$, leaving only the zeros for $n \\ge 3$, as expected from the original product definition.\n\nFinal Answer: The value of the infinite product is expressed in terms of the Gamma function and its arguments involving the cube roots of unity."
