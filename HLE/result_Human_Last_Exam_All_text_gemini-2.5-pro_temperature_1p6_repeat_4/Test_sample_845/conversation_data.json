    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" which is used as the basis for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It mentions that this value is captured as a \"beat-to-beat interval\" using a PPG sensor.\n\n2.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** The average number of heartbeats in a minute (BPM).\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the heart rate itself, but the measure of the *variation* in time from one heartbeat to the next. A healthy heart does not beat with perfect regularity; the time between beats is constantly changing.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** As the name suggests, this is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats. This series of time intervals is the raw data used to calculate all HRV metrics.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology (often used in smartwatches and fitness trackers) that measures blood volume changes in your tissue. Each heartbeat pushes a pulse of blood, which is detected by the PPG sensor as a peak. The time between these peaks is measured.\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology:** The question is asking for the technical name of this beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   In electrocardiography (ECG), which is the clinical gold standard, the most prominent electrical signal of a heartbeat is the \"R-peak\". The time measured between two consecutive R-peaks is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   This term, **R-R interval**, has become the standard and most widely used term in scientific and clinical literature for the time between heartbeats, even when the data is collected by other means like PPG.\n    *   Other correct, but perhaps more general or technology-specific terms, include:\n        *   **Interbeat Interval (IBI):** A general term for the time between heartbeats.\n        *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval (BBI):** Another general term, used in the question's phrasing itself.\n        *   **NN Interval (Normal-to-Normal Interval):** This refers to a series of R-R intervals after filtering out any abnormal or ectopic beats. This is what is typically used for HRV analysis.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** While \"Interbeat Interval\" (IBI) is a correct and general term, the most common and foundational term used in the field of HRV analysis for the time between successive heartbeats is the **R-R interval**. It refers to the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves of the ECG signal, which is the physiological event that the PPG sensor is estimating.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Input and Output:** The question is asking for the *input* value (the interval itself), not the final *output* of an HRV calculation (like RMSSD or SDNN, which are statistical metrics computed *from* these intervals).\n*   **Technology Specificity (ECG vs. PPG):** Although the question specifies PPG, the terminology from the gold-standard ECG (\"R-R interval\") is ubiquitously used in the entire field of HRV.\n*   **\"Normal-to-Normal\" (NN) vs. \"R-R\":** R-R is the raw interval. NN is the filtered interval used for analysis. For a simple definition, R-R interval is the most fundamental answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe \"value between heartbeats\" is the time interval. This fundamental time measurement in the context of HRV analysis is most commonly and standardly referred to as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
