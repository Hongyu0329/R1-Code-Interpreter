    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts in the question.**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in Ballroom dancing where the couple rotates to the left (counter-clockwise).\n*   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the amount of turn prescribed by the standard syllabus technique for a given figure. For example, if a figure is supposed to turn 3/4, overturning would mean turning 7/8 or a full turn.\n*   **Disregarding the technique:** This means performing an action that fundamentally violates the characteristic style and technical principles of that specific dance. These principles include things like footwork (heel/toe leads), rise and fall, body sway, staccato vs. flowing motion, and how feet are placed.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the dance where the very nature of its technique makes it impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn. In other dances, overturning might be considered poor form or a variation, but it is physically possible while staying within the general mechanics of the dance. In the correct answer, attempting to overturn would force the dancer to do something completely alien to that dance's style.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the technique of the Reverse Turn in each dance.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. While the syllabus specifies amounts of turn for the reverse and natural turns to achieve a full 360-degree rotation over 6 steps, skilled dancers can and do slightly adjust the rotation to navigate the floor. It is not technically *impossible* to overturn slightly, even if not ideal. The flowing nature allows for this flexibility.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This dance is defined by its pronounced \"rise and fall\" and body sway. A standard Reverse Turn can be and very often is overturned, especially when danced at a corner of the room. This is a common and accepted variation. The rise and fall action facilitates this extra rotation, so it is not considered a violation of the technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is unique among the Ballroom dances. Its technique is characterized by:\n    *   No rise and fall. The dancers move on a level plane.\n    *   Staccato (sharp, punctuated) movements.\n    *   No body sway.\n    *   Feet are picked up and placed, not glided.\n    *   When one foot closes to the other, there is no turn and no rise. This is a critical point.\n    In the Tango Reverse Turn, step 3 for the Leader is \"Left Foot closes to Right Foot\". The technique book explicitly states there is **\"no turn\"** on this step. The turn happens on steps 1 and 2. To overturn the figure, a dancer would need to add rotation during or after step 3. But adding rotation on a closed-foot position in Tango, without any rise, would require a sharp, twisting pivot on the feet. This action is completely contrary to the controlled, placed, non-swaying technique of the Tango. It would instantly break the character of the dance. Therefore, it's considered impossible to overturn this figure without disregarding the fundamental Tango technique.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, Foxtrot is a smooth, flowing dance. Its technique, characterized by \"heel turns,\" continuous movement, and body sway, allows for flexibility in rotation. Figures are often modified in their amount of turn to create different amalgamations. Overturning a reverse turn is entirely possible and often done without violating the core principles of Foxtrot movement.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a fast, dynamic dance with hops, skips, and chasses. The speed and bouncy nature of the Quickstep technique naturally allow for quick changes in rotation. Overturning a Reverse Turn is definitely possible and can be used to lead into various other figures.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis to find the answer.**\n\nComparing the five dances, the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep all have techniques (rise and fall, sway, continuous flow) that permit overturning a Reverse Turn as a variation. The Viennese Waltz allows for minor adjustments in rotation. Only the European Tango has a specific technical rule (no turn on a closing step, no rise and fall) that makes the action of overturning a Reverse Turn a direct violation of its fundamental character and technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
