    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which African flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we can imagine it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color. Let's represent Red as 'R' and White as 'W'.\n2.  **Identify Unique Row Patterns:** The rows of this matrix will have one of two patterns:\n    *   A row that intersects only the horizontal bar of the white cross will consist entirely of White (`[W, W, W, ...]`).\n    *   A row that is on the red field (above or below the horizontal cross bar) will intersect the vertical bar of the cross. This pattern will be mostly Red, with a segment of White (`[R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`).\n3.  **Assess Linear Independence:** The problem states we must assume values are chosen to maximize the rank. This means different color patterns should be considered linearly independent unless they are forced to be dependent.\n    *   Let's check if our two row patterns are linearly independent. Can a multiple of one equal the other? Is `k * [W, W, W, ...]` equal to `[R, ..., W, ..., R]`? No, because this would require `k*W = R` and `k*W = W`, which implies `k=1` and thus `R=W`, a contradiction for a two-color flag.\n    *   Similarly, can a multiple of `[R, ..., W, ..., R]` equal `[W, W, W, ...]`? No, this would require `k*R = W` and `k*W = W`, which again implies `k=1` and `R=W`.\n4.  **Conclusion on Rank:** Since there are exactly two distinct, linearly independent row patterns, the rank of the matrix representing the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations for Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags that also have exactly two linearly independent row (or column) patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with only solid horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone) or only solid vertical stripes (e.g., Chad, Mali) have a rank of 1. This is because every row (for horizontal stripes) or every column (for vertical stripes) is a scalar multiple of a vector of ones, `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, making all such rows/columns linearly dependent.\n\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex patterns, such as multiple diagonal bands (Seychelles, Tanzania), emblems that cross multiple color fields (Ethiopia, Kenya), or complex geometric arrangements (South Africa, Burundi), will generate three or more linearly independent row/column patterns. Their rank is therefore greater than 2.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** Flags with a rank of 2 typically fall into two categories:\n\n    1.  **Simple Geometric Division:** The flag is divided into two main regions by a line, creating exactly two distinct row or column patterns.\n        *   **Benin:** A vertical green stripe at the hoist with two horizontal stripes (yellow over red) on the fly. The two row patterns are `[Green, ..., Yellow, ...]` and `[Green, ..., Red, ...]`. These are linearly independent.\n        *   **Madagascar:** A vertical white stripe at the hoist with two horizontal stripes (red over green) on the fly. The two row patterns are `[White, ..., Red, ...]` and `[White, ..., Green, ...]`. These are linearly independent.\n\n    2.  **Rank 1 Design with a Simple Emblem:** The flag is based on a Rank 1 design (like horizontal or vertical stripes) but includes a simple emblem contained *within a single color field*. This introduces one new linearly independent pattern.\n        *   The basis vectors for the matrix space become:\n            1.  A \"solid color\" vector (representing any row/column with a single, solid color).\n            2.  An \"emblem\" vector (representing the row/column that is modified by the emblem).\n        *   Examples of this include:\n            *   **Ghana:** A horizontal tricolor (rank 1) with a black star on the central yellow stripe. This creates a new row pattern `[Yellow, Black, Yellow]`, which is linearly independent from the solid color rows.\n            *   **Senegal:** A vertical tricolor (rank 1) with a green star on the central yellow stripe. This creates a new column pattern `[Yellow, Green, Yellow]`, which is linearly independent from the solid color columns.\n            *   **Egypt:** Horizontal tricolor with an eagle on the central white stripe.\n            *   **Cameroon:** Vertical tricolor with a star on the central red stripe.\n            *   **Eswatini:** Horizontal stripes with a shield on the central red stripe.\n            *   **Lesotho:** Horizontal tricolor with a hat on the central white stripe.\n            *   **Libya:** Horizontal tricolor with a crescent/star on the central black stripe.\n            *   **Malawi:** Horizontal tricolor with a rising sun on the top black stripe.\n            *   **Mauritania:** Green field (with central emblem) and red bars top and bottom. The row patterns are \"solid red\", \"solid green\", and \"green with emblem\". The solid color rows are linearly dependent, resulting in two independent patterns overall.\n            *   **Niger:** Horizontal tricolor with a circle on the central white stripe.\n            *   **Rwanda:** Horizontal stripes with a sun on the top blue stripe.\n\n### Step 3: Final List of Nations\n\nBased on the analysis, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   Benin\n*   Cameroon\n*   Egypt\n*   Eswatini\n*   Ghana\n*   Lesotho\n*   Libya\n*   Madagascar\n*   Malawi\n*   Mauritania\n*   Niger\n*   Rwanda\n*   Senegal\n\n<<<Benin, Cameroon, Egypt, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal>>>"
