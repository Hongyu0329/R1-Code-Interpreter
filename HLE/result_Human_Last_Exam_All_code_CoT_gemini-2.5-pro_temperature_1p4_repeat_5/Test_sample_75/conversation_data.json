    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Establish Start and End Dates:** The Second Great War begins in the year 2504 with the start of the Brood War events and concludes in the year 2508 with the defeat of Amon in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue.\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:** The duration can be calculated by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n3.  **Round Up:** The result will be rounded up to the nearest whole number as requested.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** A Python script will be created to perform the calculation and print the full equation along with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore starts in 2504 and ends in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The problem asks to round up, although the result is already a whole number.\n# We will use math.ceil to formally meet this requirement.\nrounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore began in the year {} and ended in the year {}.\".format(start_year, end_year))\nprint(\"Calculating the duration:\")\nprint(\"{} - {} = {}\".format(end_year, start_year, duration))\nprint(\"The total duration is {} years.\".format(rounded_duration))\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
