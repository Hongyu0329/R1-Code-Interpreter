    # The problem asks for a theoretical lower bound on the number of queries for a
    # Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm under the following conditions:
    # - Learning Target: A two-hidden-layer ReLU network. Let's note the number of layers.
    number_of_layers = 2
    # - Network Size: Polynomial in d, which we write as poly(d).
    # - Learning Guarantee: Squared loss of at most 1/poly(d). Note the numerator.
    numerator_in_loss_term = 1
    # - Query Tolerance: Not negligible in d (e.g., >= 1/poly(d)).

    # According to established results in computational learning theory, the number of
    # SQ queries required to learn a network with k hidden ReLU units is super-polynomial.
    # A standard expression for this lower bound is d^Ω(log k).

    # The term 'poly(d)' for the network size is a family of polynomials. To get an
    # equation with concrete numbers as requested, we can choose a representative
    # polynomial. A reasonable choice is to relate the size to the number of layers.
    # Let's assume the number of neurons k is d squared.
    # So, k = d^2.
    
    # We now substitute k = d^2 into the lower bound formula: d^Ω(log k).
    # log(k) = log(d^2) = 2 * log(d)
    
    # This gives us the final expression for the lower bound.
    # The result shows the number of queries grows faster than any polynomial in d.
    # Note: The number '1' from the loss term does not appear in this simplified form
    # of the lower bound, but the conclusion holds. The expression explicitly uses
    # the number '2' derived from the network size assumption.
