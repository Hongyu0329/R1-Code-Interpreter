# The user wants an explanation of the appearance of Mercury's sodium tail
# under specific observation conditions. No calculation is needed, but the
# thinking process can be structured.

# Step 1: Identify the wavelength of light emitted by the sodium tail.
# The dominant emission lines of sodium (the D-lines) are at approximately 589 nm.
sodium_emission_wavelength = 589  # in nanometers
color_of_sodium_emission = "Yellow-Orange"

# Step 2: Identify the wavelength the telescope is observing.
# A bandpass filter centered at 486 nm is used.
filter_center_wavelength = 486  # in nanometers
color_of_filtered_light = "Blue-Green"

# Step 3: Compare the emission wavelength with the filter wavelength.
# The filter allows light around 486 nm to pass through.
# The sodium tail emits light around 589 nm.
# The filter will block the light from the sodium tail.

print("\n--- Additional Analysis on Tail Length ---")
print("The tail is created by pressure from solar radiation and solar wind.")
print("At perihelion (closest to the Sun), this pressure is strongest, creating a LONGER tail.")
print("At aphelion (farthest from the Sun), this pressure is weakest, creating a SHORTER tail.")
print("So, statements that the tail is 'longer at aphelion' are physically incorrect.")
print("\nBased on the primary analysis of the filter's properties, the correct conclusion is that no tail would be visible.")
