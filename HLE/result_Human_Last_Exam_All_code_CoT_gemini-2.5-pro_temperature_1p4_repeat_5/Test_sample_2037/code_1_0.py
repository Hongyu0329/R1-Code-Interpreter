    # Step 1: Analyze the character
    character_analysis = "The character is Hades. Key clues include the direct mention of 'his fucked up underworld' and the description of 'That girl, a slight figure lost in light, slipped out towards the sun,' which perfectly describes Persephone leaving Hades' realm."

    # Step 2: Analyze the setting
    setting_analysis = "The setting is a bar. Clues like 'spin jukebox coins' and the phrase 'It\'s closing time' are quintessential elements of a bar or pub. The 'half-dark' and lonely atmosphere further supports this setting."

    # Step 3: Analyze the form
    form_analysis = "The form is a sonnet. While presented as a single block of text, the poem can be logically arranged into 14 lines. It has a single theme (Hades' loneliness) and a clear turn in thought (a volta), which are characteristic features of a sonnet, even if it doesn't follow a strict, traditional rhyme scheme."
