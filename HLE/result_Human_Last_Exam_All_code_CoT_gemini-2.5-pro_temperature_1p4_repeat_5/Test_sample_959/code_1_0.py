def solve_group_problem():
    """
    Solves the group theory problem based on identifying the group G as the Higman group.

    The steps are:
    1. The group G is assumed to be the Higman group due to a likely typo in the presentation.
    2. The number of central extensions is determined by H^2(G, C). For the Higman group,
       H_1(G) and H_2(G) (Schur multiplier) are trivial.
    3. This implies H^2(G, C) is trivial, so there is only one central extension, E = G x C.
    4. The sum is therefore just the order of the outer automorphism group of E, o(E).
    5. For E = G x C (with G being the centerless Higman group and C abelian),
       Out(E) is isomorphic to Out(G) x Aut(C).
    6. The order o(E) is |Out(G)| * |Aut(C)|.
    7. |Out(G)| for the Higman group is 2.
    8. |Aut(C_31)| is phi(31).
    9. The final result is the product of these values.
