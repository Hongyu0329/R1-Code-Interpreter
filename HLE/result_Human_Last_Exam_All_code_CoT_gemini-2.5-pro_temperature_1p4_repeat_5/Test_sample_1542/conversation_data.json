    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of the ring $R$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This transformation can be represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P$ with entries in $R$ whose determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The group of all such invertible matrices is denoted $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nIf we have a transformation of variables:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = P \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & \\delta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$\nThen a quadratic form $Q(x, y)$ transforms into a new form $Q'(x, y) = Q(\\alpha x + \\beta y, \\gamma x + \\delta y)$. The coefficients of the new form $(a', b', c')$ can be calculated from the old coefficients $(a, b, c)$ and the matrix elements $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta$.\n\nThe problem is thus to find the number of orbits of the set of all quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince there are $8$ choices for each of the $3$ coefficients ($a, b, c$), there are $8^3 = 512$ possible quadratic forms in total. A direct analytical classification can be quite complex. A computational approach provides a clear path to the solution.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a set containing all 512 possible quadratic forms, represented by tuples of their coefficients $(a, b, c)$.\n2.  Iterate through this set. In each step, if the set is not empty, pick a form to be a representative of a new equivalence class.\n3.  For each representative, find its entire equivalence class (orbit) by repeatedly applying a set of generator matrices for the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n4.  All forms found to be in the orbit of the representative are removed from the main set.\n5.  The number of equivalence classes is the number of representatives we had to pick.\n\nThe generating set for $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ can be constructed from elementary matrices and diagonal matrices. The following set of matrices is sufficient to generate the group:\n$P_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $P_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $P_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} u & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $P_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & u \\end{pmatrix}$ for all units $u \\in \\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this algorithm to find the number of equivalence classes.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The set of all possible forms (a, b, c)\n    forms = set()\n    for a in range(8):\n        for b in range(8):\n            for c in range(8):\n                forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    # Generators for the group GL_2(Z/8Z)\n    # A sufficient set of generators.\n    units = [3, 5, 7]\n    generators = [\n        ((1, 1), (0, 1)),  # T\n        ((1, 0), (1, 1)),  # T^t\n    ]\n    for u in units:\n        generators.append(((u, 0), (0, 1)))\n        generators.append(((1, 0), (0, u)))\n\n    def transform(form, P):\n        \"\"\"Applies a linear transformation P to a quadratic form.\"\"\"\n        a, b, c = form\n        (alpha, beta), (gamma, delta) = P\n        \n        # Transformation formulas for Q'(x,y) = Q(alpha*x + beta*y, gamma*x + delta*y)\n        # This is a right action on the function space.
