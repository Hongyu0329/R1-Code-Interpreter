    Calculates the first-order relativistic energy shift for a hydrogen atom.
    
    The problem asks for the second-order shift, which is exceedingly complex to calculate.
    It's highly likely that the much more common and physically dominant first-order
    shift was intended. This function calculates the first-order shift.
    
    The first-order energy shift due to the relativistic correction is given by:
    ΔE = - (E_n^2 / (2*m*c^2)) * (4*n / (l + 1/2) - 3)
    
    The unperturbed energy E_n is:
    E_n = - (m * c^2 * α^2) / (2 * n^2)
    
    Substituting E_n into the expression for ΔE gives:
    ΔE = - (m*c^2*α^4 / (8*n^4)) * (4*n / (l + 1/2) - 3)
    
    We will calculate the numerical coefficient for n=3, l=2.
