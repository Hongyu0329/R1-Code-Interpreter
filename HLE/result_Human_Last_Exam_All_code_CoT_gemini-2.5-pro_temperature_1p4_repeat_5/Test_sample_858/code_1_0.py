    # Step 1: Understand the definitions from the problem statement.
    # - Continuum X: A compact, connected Hausdorff space.
    # - Aposyndetic X: For any two distinct points x, y in X, there exists a subcontinuum K
    #   with x in the interior of K, and K contained in X without y.
    # - Non-block point p: The set X \ {p} contains a dense, continuum-connected subset.

    # Step 2: Consider the simplest possible example of a continuum.
    # The most basic continuum is a space consisting of a single point. Let's call it X = {p}.
    # This space is compact (as it's finite), connected, and Hausdorff, so it is a valid continuum.

    # Step 3: Check if this single-point space X = {p} is aposyndetic.
    # The condition for being aposyndetic applies to pairs of *distinct* points.
    # Since X = {p} does not contain two distinct points, the condition is vacuously satisfied.
    # Thus, X = {p} is an aposyndetic continuum.

    # Step 4: Identify the non-block points in X = {p}.
    # We need to check if the point 'p' is a non-block point.
    # According to the definition, 'p' is a non-block point if the set X \ {p}
    # contains a dense, continuum-connected subset.
    
    # In our example, X \ {p} is the empty set, ∅.
    
    # We now check if the empty set meets the requirements for being a dense, continuum-connected subset of itself:
    # 1. Is ∅ dense in ∅? Yes, the closure of the empty set is itself.
    # 2. Is ∅ continuum-connected? Yes, the condition "for any x, y in ∅..." is vacuously true
    #    because there are no elements x, y in ∅.
    
    # Since X \ {p} (the empty set) contains a dense, continuum-connected subset (itself),
    # the point 'p' is by definition a non-block point.

    # Step 5: Calculate the cardinality.
    # The set of non-block points in the space X = {p} is the set {p}.
    # The number of elements (cardinality) in this set is 1.
    
    # This shows that a cardinality of 1 is possible. Since the cardinality cannot be
    # less than 1 for a non-empty space, this is the smallest possible value.
    # (For contrast, the interval [0,1] is another aposyndetic continuum, and its
    # set of non-block points is {0, 1}, with cardinality 2).
