    "My plan is to solve the problem by first expressing the infinite product, which starts from $n=3$, in terms of a more standard infinite product that starts from $n=1$.\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product**: The product from $n=3$ can be written as the product from $n=1$ divided by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Product from n=1**: The term $(1-z^3/n^3)$ can be factored using the roots of unity. Let $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ be the principal cube root of unity. Then:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n    The infinite product from $n=1$ can be expressed using the Gamma function's Weierstrass product representation. The result is a known identity in the theory of special functions:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n3.  **Combine the Results**: By substituting the result from step 2 into the expression from step 1, we get the final closed-form expression.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify and Code**: I will simplify this expression and use the `sympy` library in Python to represent and print the final equation. I will construct the expression from its numerical components to satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import I, pi, exp\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the closed-form expression for the given infinite product\n    and prints the result as a formatted equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable z.\n    z = sympy.Symbol('z')\n\n    # Define the principal cube root of unity, omega.\n    omega = exp(2 * pi * I / 3)\n\n    # The left-hand side of the equation we want to solve.\n    lhs_str = \"Product_{n=3 to oo} (1 - z**3/n**3)\"\n\n    # The result is derived from the well-known product identity for the Gamma function.\n    # The product from n=1 to infinity is 1 / (Gamma(1-z)*Gamma(1-z*w)*Gamma(1-z*w^2)).\n    # We divide this by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    # Term n=1: (1 - z^3/1^3) = 1 - z**3\n    # Term n=2: (1 - z^3/2^3) = 1 - z**3/8 = (8 - z**3)/8\n    # The denominator becomes (1 - z**3)*(8 - z**3)/8 * Product_of_Gammas\n    # This simplifies to 8 / ((1-z**3)*(8-z**3)*Product_of_Gammas).\n\n    # To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we define the numerical components of the final expression here.\n    numerator_val = 8\n    \n    # Components of the (1-z^3) term\n    c1 = 1\n    p1 = 3\n    \n    # Components of the (8-z^3) term\n    c2 = 8\n    p2 = 3\n\n    # Construct the symbolic expression for the final result.\n    gamma_product = sympy.gamma(1 - z) * sympy.gamma(1 - z * omega) * sympy.gamma(1 - z * omega**2)\n    denominator_z_terms = (c1 - z**p1) * (c2 - z**p2)\n    \n    # The full expression.
