# The riddle describes the Ten Commandments (Decalogue).
# The "prohibition against representation" refers to the Second Commandment against making graven images.
# The "end of HIS work" dealing with "another's material possessions" refers to the Tenth Commandment against coveting a neighbor's property (house, ox, donkey, etc.).
# Veronika Campan, a biblical scholar, has written about the structure of the Decalogue, noting the tension between the abstract prohibition of images and the concrete, "representable" list of items at the end.
# The historical and religious figure credited with receiving and transmitting the Ten Commandments is Moses.
