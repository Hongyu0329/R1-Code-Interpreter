    Determines for which subset of integers t in {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 15}
    the number of t-omino tilings of an n x n grid is even for any positive integer n.

    The solution is based on a mathematical proof using a symmetry argument.
    The argument shows that for straight 1xt tiles (t-ominoes), the number of
    tilings of an n x n grid is always even for any t > 1.
    
    The proof summary:
    1. Reflection across the main diagonal pairs up non-symmetric tilings.
    2. Thus, the total number of tilings is even if and only if the number of
       symmetric tilings is even.
    3. We prove that no symmetric tiling can exist for t > 1. Any tile covering
       a diagonal cell (k,k) would have to overlap with its own reflection,
       which is a distinct tile. This is a contradiction.
    4. So, the number of symmetric tilings is 0 (which is even).
    5. Therefore, the total number of tilings is always even for t > 1.

    This code checks which elements from the given set satisfy t > 1.
