    "My plan is to analyze the training methodologies of the ballet schools provided in the answer choices, with a specific focus on their approach to pointe work during barre exercises. I will structure the information within a Python script to compare and contrast each school. The script will then print out an explanation for each school's method and conclude which one is most renowned for having dancers train predominantly on pointe shoes at the barre.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school methodologies to determine which is known\n    for extensive pointe work at the barre.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools_info = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala',\n            'notes': 'Associated with the Italian Cecchetti method.
