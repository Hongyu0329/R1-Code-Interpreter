# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
# of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# As derived from the principles of point-set topology, the construction
# of a continuum by joining two indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc)
# at a single point provides an example with exactly two such subcontinua.

# Let H and K be two such indecomposable continua.
# Let the decomposable continuum be X = H U K.
# The collection of regular proper subcontinua is {H, K}.
# The cardinality of this collection is 2.

# It is a known result in topology that this value is the minimum possible.
# A decomposable continuum cannot have 0 or 1 regular proper subcontinua.

smallest_possible_cardinality = 2

# Final answer is printed below.
