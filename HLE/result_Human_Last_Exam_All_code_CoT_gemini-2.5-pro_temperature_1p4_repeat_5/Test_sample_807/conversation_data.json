    "The chemical compound in question is `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. My plan is to first identify the common name for this chemical. Then, I will search for which Crayola crayon color uses this chemical as a pigment. Finally, I will write a Python script to print out the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Crayola crayon color containing a specific chemical.\n    The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\n    is commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye known for its\n    vibrant pink-to-magenta color. It was famously used by Crayola in several colors,\n    most notably 'Cerise'.\n    \"\"\"\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n    crayon_color = \"Cerise\"\n\n    print(f\"The Crayola crayon color that contains the chemical '{chemical_name}' is: {crayon_color}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Cerise>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
