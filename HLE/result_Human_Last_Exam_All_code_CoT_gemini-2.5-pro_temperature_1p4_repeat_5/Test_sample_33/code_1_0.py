Based on the FTIR data, the observed behavior can be explained as follows:

1.  **Initial State:** The problem states the proteins are initially disordered. This corresponds to the broad peak observed at {disordered_peak} cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of random coil or disordered protein structures.

2.  **Gelation upon Concentration Increase:** Gelation is an ordering process. The concentration titration experiment shows a simultaneous increase in the peaks at {alpha_helix_peak} cm⁻¹ and {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm⁻¹.
    *   The peak at {alpha_helix_peak} cm⁻¹ is a well-known signature for **alpha-helical structures**.
    *   The peak at {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm⁻¹, along with its corresponding high-frequency partner at {beta_sheet_high_peak} cm⁻¹, is a classic indicator of **anti-parallel beta-sheet structures**.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since increasing the concentration causes the hydrogel to form and simultaneously increases the signals for *both* alpha-helices and beta-sheets, the most accurate explanation is that the initially disordered proteins fold into a combination of alpha-helices and beta-sheets upon gelation.

This conclusion aligns with Answer Choice I.
