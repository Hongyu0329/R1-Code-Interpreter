    print("\nThe task is to determine which of the following loss functions are HALOs (Human-Aware Losses) according to the given definition: CSFT, DPO, KTO, PPO-Clip, SLiC.")

    print("\n--- Step 1: Analyze the provided HALO definition ---")
    print("A loss function f is a HALO if it can be written as:")
    print("f = E[a * v(r - E[r'])] + C")
    print("Key conditions:")
    print("1. r is the log-ratio reward: r = l(y) * log(pi_theta(y|x) / pi_ref(y|x))")
    print("2. v(z) is a value function that must be non-decreasing everywhere and concave in (0, infinity).")
    print("3. a is a sign, either +1 or -1.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Test each function against the strict definition ---")
    print("A strict application of this formula reveals the following:")
    print(" * SLiC: Fits the definition. Loss is -(r_w - r_l). This works with a=-1 and v(z)=z. The function v(z)=z is non-decreasing and concave.")
    print(" * DPO: Fits the definition. Loss is log(1 + exp(-(r_w - r_l))). This works with a=-1 and v(z) = -log(1 + exp(-z)). This v(z) is non-decreasing and concave.")
    print(" * KTO: Does NOT fit. The loss for 'desirable' and 'undesirable' data, log(1 + exp(-r_gap)) and log(1 + exp(r_gap)), cannot be unified under a single value function `v` and sign `a` that satisfy the conditions.")
    print(" * PPO-Clip: Does NOT fit. The loss is a function of both the reward gap and the probability ratio itself, so it cannot be simplified to the form a * v(gap).")
    print(" * CSFT: Does NOT generally fit. Standard contrastive SFT lacks the required reward gap structure. While specific hinge-loss variants can be made to fit, it's not a general property.")
    print("\nStrict Conclusion: Based on the provided definition, only SLiC and DPO are clearly HALOs. This answer ('DPO, SLiC') is not among the options.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Reconcile the discrepancy ---")
    print("The discrepancy implies that the definition in the prompt is a simplification. The source paper (Ethayarajh et al., 2024) presents a broader framework where the listed methods are considered special cases, sometimes under a more general loss form or with certain approximations.")
    print("Therefore, the question should be interpreted as 'Which of these functions are considered HALOs by the authors who defined the term?'.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Final Conclusion based on the source paper ---")
    print("In the original paper, the authors frame all five functions as instances of the HALO framework:")
    print(" - CSFT is presented as a HALO.")
    print(" - DPO is presented as a HALO.")
    print(" - KTO is presented as a HALO.")
    print(" - PPO-Clip is presented as a HALO.")
    print(" - SLiC is presented as a HALO.")
    print("\nThis means all five functions listed are considered HALOs in the context of the paper that introduced the term.")
