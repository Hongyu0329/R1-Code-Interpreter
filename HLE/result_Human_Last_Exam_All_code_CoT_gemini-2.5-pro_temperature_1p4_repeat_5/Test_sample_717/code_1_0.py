# Based on the analysis of the problem from representation theory, the integer 'n'
# corresponds to the Calabi-Yau dimension of the category to which the functor F belongs.
#
# The problem's conditions (a "tame" functor being "discretized") constrain F
# to be a preprojective module. The stable category of preprojective modules over
# a tame hereditary algebra is a well-studied object known to be 2-Calabi-Yau.
#
# Therefore, n is 2.

# The final equation is n = 2.
n = 2

# The instruction asks to output each number/symbol in the final equation.
# The equation is n = 2.
