    # The following statements were determined to be true based on the analysis:
    # C: The junction tree uses the joint distributions within nodes.
    # E: High treewidth on a graph can cause the junction tree algorithm to become impractical.
    # G: A reason why the junction tree algorithm is not resilient to graphs with high treewidth is because the junction tree uses the joint distributions within nodes.
    # I: The computational efficiency of the junction tree algorithm will diminish exponentially as the number of discrete variables in the largest clique increases linearly.
    # L: If a tree has the running intersection property, then it means most precisely that any variable contained in three or more cliques is also necessarily contained in all cliques on paths that connect the three cliques.
