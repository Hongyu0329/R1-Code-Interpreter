    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values $p_i$, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Set the derivatives in the given system of differential equations to zero. This will transform the differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  The resulting system of equations is:\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  We also have the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n4.  We will solve this system of linear equations to find the values of $p_0$ and $p_1$. It is most convenient to express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ and then use the normalization condition to find the value of $p_1$.\n5.  Finally, we will calculate the desired sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given transition rates\nl01 = 0.019\nl10 = 0.65\nl12 = 0.4\nl21 = 0.392\nl23 = 0.008\nl31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations for the steady state (p_i' = 0)\n# We can express p0, p2, and p3 in terms of p1.\n# From 0 = -l01*p0 + l10*p1  => p0 = (l10/l01)*p1\n# From 0 = l12*p1 - (l21+l23)*p2 => p2 = (l12/(l21+l23))*p1\n# From 0 = l23*p2 - l31*p3 => p3 = (l23/l31)*p2\n\n# Calculate the coefficients for p0, p2, p3 in terms of p1\ncoeff_p0 = l10 / l01\ncoeff_p2 = l12 / (l21 + l23)\ncoeff_p3 = (l23 / l31) * coeff_p2\n\n# Step 3: Use the normalization condition p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1 to solve for p1\n# p1*(coeff_p0 + 1 + coeff_p2 + coeff_p3) = 1\nsum_of_coeffs = coeff_p0 + 1 + coeff_p2 + coeff_p3\np1 = 1 / sum_of_coeffs\n\n# Step 4: Calculate p0 using the relation from Step 2\np0 = coeff_p0 * p1\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final required sum\nresult = p0 + p1\n\n# Output the results in the required format\nprint(f\"By solving the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities, we find:\")\nprint(f\"P_0(+infinity) = {p0}\")\nprint(f\"P_1(+infinity) = {p1}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the value of P_0(+infinity) + P_1(+infinity) is:\")\nprint(f\"{p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462517680169492>>>"
