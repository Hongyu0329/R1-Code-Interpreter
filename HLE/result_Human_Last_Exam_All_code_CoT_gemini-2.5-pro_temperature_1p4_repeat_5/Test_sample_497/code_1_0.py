# The problem requires finding a value for a capacitor 'x' in terms of 'c'
# such that the total equivalent capacitance is independent of the number of cells.
# This condition leads to the quadratic equation for the ratio k = x/c:
# 2*k^2 + 2*k - 1 = 0

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation a*k^2 + b*k + c_quad = 0
a = 2
b = 2
c_quad = -1

# We solve for k using the quadratic formula.
# Since k represents a ratio of capacitances, it must be a positive value.
discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c_quad
if discriminant < 0:
    print("No real solutions for k exist.")
else:
    # We choose the positive root for the physical solution.
    k = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)

    # The final expression for x is x = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2
    # The final equation involves the numbers 3, 1, and 2.
    # As instructed, we will print these numbers.
