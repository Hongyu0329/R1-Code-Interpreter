    # --- Scientific Background ---
    print("Step 1: Understand the core scientific principle.")
    print("A declining 13C ratio means the tree incorporated relatively less 13C over time.")
    print("This happens when the plant can be more 'selective' in fixing CO2.")
    print("   - Plentiful water -> Stomata open -> High discrimination against 13C -> LOWER 13C ratio.")
    print("   - Water stress (drought) -> Stomata close -> Low discrimination against 13C -> HIGHER 13C ratio.")

    # --- Analysis of Answer Choices ---
    print("Step 2: Evaluate the provided answer choices.")

    # Choice A: Increase in tree ring thickness
    print("\nAnalyzing A: Tree ring thickness...")
    print("Result: This is a growth characteristic, not a direct driver of the isotope chemistry itself. Unlikely to be the predominant factor.")

    # Choice B: Periods of drought
    print("\nAnalyzing B: Periods of drought...")
    print("Result: Drought causes a HIGHER 13C ratio, which contradicts the observed declining trend.")

    # Choice C: Increased photosynthetic reserves
    print("\nAnalyzing C: Increased starch reserves...")
    print("Result: This is a result of photosynthesis, not the primary cause of a change in isotope fractionation over a century.")

    # Choice D: Thinning earlywood proportion
    print("\nAnalyzing D: Earlywood proportion...")
    print("Result: This relates to the seasonal pattern of wood growth, not the fundamental isotopic composition. Not the primary driver.")

    # Choice E: Changes in the SE Asia monsoon
    print("\nAnalyzing E: Changes in the SE Asia monsoon...")
    print("Result: The monsoon is the primary control on water availability in Southeast Asia.")
    print("A trend towards a stronger/wetter monsoon would lead to more open stomata, causing a DECLINING 13C ratio. This matches the observation.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("Step 3: Conclude the most predominant factor.")
    final_answer = 'E'
    explanation = "Changes in the SE Asia monsoon directly affect regional water availability, which controls stomatal behavior and, consequently, carbon isotope discrimination. This provides the most direct and powerful explanation for a long-term decline in the 13C ratio among the given options."
