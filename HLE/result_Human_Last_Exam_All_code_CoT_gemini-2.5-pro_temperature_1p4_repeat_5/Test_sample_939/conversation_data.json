    "Answering this question requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB components (R, G, or B) fall outside the standard range of `[0.0, 1.0]`, the color cannot be represented in sRGB and is considered \"out-of-gamut\".\n\nROMM RGB has a much wider gamut (range of colors) than sRGB, especially in saturated greens and blues. Therefore, highly saturated ROMM RGB colors are likely to be outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nI will use Python with the `colour-science` library, which is the standard for accurate color space conversions. The code will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the list of ROMM RGB colors provided in the question.\n2.  Iterate through each color.\n3.  For each color, use the `colour.RGB_to_RGB` function to convert it from the 'ProPhoto RGB' colorspace to the 'sRGB' colorspace. This function correctly handles the underlying matrix math and chromatic adaptation between the different white points (D50 for ROMM RGB and D65 for sRGB).\n4.  Check if the resulting linear sRGB values are all within the `[0, 1]` range.\n5.  Keep track of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n6.  Finally, print the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors in ascending order, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the colour-science library: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which of a list of ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to test.\n    # These are treated as linear values in the [0, 1] range.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),      # Pure Blue in ROMM\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),      # Pure Green in ROMM\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])       # White\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"--- Plan ---\")\n    print(\"1.
