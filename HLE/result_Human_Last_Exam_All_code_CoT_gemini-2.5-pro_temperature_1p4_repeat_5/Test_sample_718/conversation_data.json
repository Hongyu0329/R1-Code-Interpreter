    "Answering this question requires delving into the representation theory of algebras, specifically the theory of representations of partially ordered sets (posets). The key is to correctly interpret the terms \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Translating the Problem:** The problem is set in the language of category theory, but it is equivalent to a problem in homological algebra.\n    *   A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is a *representation* of the poset $J$. The category of such functors, $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is equivalent to the category of left modules over the *incidence algebra* $KJ$ of the poset $J$.\n    *   A functor being \"$n$-resolvable\" means that it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. The smallest such $n$ is the projective dimension of the functor (or module), denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$. The question asks for an upper bound on this dimension.\n    *   The phrase \"a tame functor\" is ambiguous. It could refer to an individual functor with a specific property, or it could mean that the entire category $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is of *tame representation type*. A category is tame if its indecomposable objects can be classified and, for each dimension, fall into a finite number of discrete objects and a finite number of one-parameter families. This is the most standard interpretation.\n\n2.  **The Challenge of Finite Type vs. Tame Type:**\n    *   Representation types are often classified as *finite*, *tame*, or *wild*. Finite type (only a finite number of indecomposable representations) is a special case of tame type.\n    *   Let's consider a simple chain poset $J = C_m = \\{1 < 2 < \\dots < m\\}$. This is an upper semilattice and is of **finite** representation type, so it is also tame. The incidence algebra $KC_m$ is the algebra $T_m(K)$ of $m \\times m$ upper triangular matrices. The global dimension of this algebra is known to be $m-1$.\n    *   If we allow these finite-type cases, we could take $m$ to be arbitrarily large. This would mean there is no single integer $n$ that works for all tame upper semilattices.\n\n3.  **Restricting to \"Strictly\" Tame Type:**\n    *   The contradiction above suggests that the question implicitly excludes the finite-type cases and refers to posets that are tame but **not** of finite type. This is a common convention in the field.\n    *   So, we are looking for a bound on the projective dimension of functors over an incidence algebra $KJ$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice of tame, non-finite representation type.\n\n4.  **Tilted Algebras and Global Dimension:**\n    *   There is a very important class of tame algebras called **tilted algebras**. These are formed by \"tilting\" a hereditary algebra (like the path algebra of a quiver).\n    *   A fundamental theorem by Dieter Happel and Claus Michael Ringel states that any tilted algebra $A$ has a global dimension of at most 2 (i.e., $\\text{gl.dim}(A) \\le 2$).\n    *   It is a deep result in representation theory that the incidence algebras of posets that are upper semilattices and of tame, non-finite type belong to this class of tilted algebras (or a closely related class with the same homological bound).\n    *   For example, the 4-subspace poset, $J=\\{a<m, b<m, c<m, d<m\\}$, is an upper semilattice and is of tame, non-finite type. Its incidence algebra is the path algebra of the $\\tilde{D}_4$ quiver, which is hereditary and has a global dimension of 1. Tilting this algebra can produce algebras of global dimension 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   If we assume \"tame functor\" implies the underlying poset algebra $KJ$ is of tame, non-finite type, then it follows from the theory of tilted algebras that $\\text{gl.dim}(KJ) \\le 2$.\n    *   Since the global dimension of an algebra is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its modules, any functor $f$ in this category must be $n$-resolvable for $n=2$.\n\nTo explore this, the following Python code calculates the global dimension of the incidence algebra for any given finite poset. The global dimension is calculated as the maximum projective dimension among all simple modules $S_i$. The projective dimension of a simple module $S_i$ corresponding to a poset element $i$ can be found with the recursive formula:\n*   $\\text{pd}(S_i) = 0$ if $i$ is a minimal element.\n*   $\\text{pd}(S_i) = 1 + \\max_{j \\in \\text{maximals}(\\{k | k<i\\})} \\text{pd}(S_j)$ otherwise.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_poset_global_dimension(poset_relations):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the global dimension of the incidence algebra of a finite poset.\n\n    Args:\n        poset_relations (list of tuples): A list of pairs (a, b) representing the\n                                         relation a < b in the poset.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not poset_relations:\n        print(\"Global dimension for an empty or discrete poset is 0.\")\n        return\n\n    # Create a directed graph from the poset relations (edges from smaller to larger)\n    G = nx.DiGraph()\n    G.add_edges_from(poset_relations)\n    \n    # Ensure the graph is a valid poset (acyclic)\n    if not nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(G):\n        raise ValueError(\"The provided relations do not form a valid poset (contains cycles).\")\n\n    # Get a topological sort of the nodes to process them from minimal to maximal\n    try:\n        nodes = list(nx.topological_sort(G))\n    except nx.NetworkXUnfeasible:\n        # This case is caught by the is_directed_acyclic_graph check, but good practice\n        raise ValueError(\"The provided relations do not form a valid poset.\")\n\n    # Memoization cache for projective dimensions of simple modules\n    pd = {}\n\n    print(\"Calculating projective dimensions for simple modules S_i:\")\n    for i in nodes:\n        # Find all predecessors of node i\n        predecessors = list(G.predecessors(i))\n\n        if not predecessors:\n            # i is a minimal element\n            pd[i] = 0\n            print(f\"  pd(S_{i}) = 0 (since {i} is a minimal element)\")\n        else:\n            # i is not minimal.
