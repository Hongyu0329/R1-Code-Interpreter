# Step 1: Explain the problem setup for a concrete example.
# We aim to find the minimum number of Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria (PSNE)
# in an n-player symmetric game. We can demonstrate that this minimum is 1
# by constructing a game that achieves it. Let's use n=10 players.
n = 10

# Step 2: Construct a game with a minimal number of equilibria.
# A game where one action is strictly dominant will have a single, predictable outcome.
# Let's define a game where Action 'B' is always better than 'A'.
# The payoff difference `d[j] = payoff(A) - payoff(B)` when j other players
# choose A is therefore always negative. We can set d[j] = -1 for all j.
d = [-1] * n

# Step 3: Calculate the number of PSNEs for this game.
# A profile with 'k' players on 'A' is a PSNE if certain conditions on 'd' are met.
total_psne = 0
final_equation_parts = []

# Case k=0: all players choose B. PSNE if d[0] <= 0.
k = 0
if d[0] <= 0:
    num_profiles = math.comb(n, k)
    total_psne += num_profiles
    final_equation_parts.append(f"C({n}, {k})")

# Case 0 < k < n: PSNE if d[k-1] >= 0 AND d[k] <= 0.
# This condition can never be met here because d[k-1] is -1, which is not >= 0.

# Case k=n: all players choose A. PSNE if d[n-1] >= 0.
# This condition is not met because d[n-1] is -1.

# Step 4: Output the result.
# The calculation shows that only the k=0 case results in equilibria.
