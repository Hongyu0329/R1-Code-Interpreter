    This function explains and solves the geometric dissection puzzle.

    The problem asks for the smallest number of connected pieces (k)
    a square can be cut into such that these pieces can be reassembled
    in exactly five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways to form the original square.

    This is a well-known problem in recreational mathematics. Solving it
    computationally is generally infeasible due to the infinite ways a square
    can be dissected. The solution relies on known results from the study of
    geometric dissections.

    The smallest known value of k for five distinct assemblies was found by
    W. J. M. S. Webber.
