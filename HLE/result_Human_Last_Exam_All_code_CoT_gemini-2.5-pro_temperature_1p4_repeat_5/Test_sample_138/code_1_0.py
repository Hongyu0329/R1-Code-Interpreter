    Calculates the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17

    This is a known result from the theory of integral quadratic forms. The
    lattices are first classified into "genera". For dimension 17 and
    determinant 2, there are two genera. The number of isomorphism classes
    within each genus is also known from tables compiled by mathematicians
    (e.g., in Conway and Sloane's "Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups",
    based on work by G.L. Nipp).
