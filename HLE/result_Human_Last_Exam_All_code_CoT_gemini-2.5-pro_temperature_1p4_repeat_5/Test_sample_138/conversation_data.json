    "This problem asks for the number of distinct structures (isomorphism classes) of a specific type of mathematical object known as a positive definite even lattice with dimension 17 and determinant 2. This is a problem in the field of number theory and the theory of quadratic forms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical problem**: The question is about counting lattice isomorphism classes, a well-studied but complex area of mathematics.\n2.  **Method of solution**: Solving this from first principles would require a very sophisticated computational algebra system. Instead, I will rely on the known classification of these lattices from mathematical literature. The standard approach involves:\n    *   Grouping lattices into \"genera\" based on their structure over rational numbers and p-adic numbers.\n    *   Counting the number of \"isomorphism classes\" within each genus.\n3.  **Applying the known results**: For lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, it is known that they fall into two distinct genera. The number of classes in each genus has been calculated by mathematicians like Kneser and Nipp, and these results are compiled in standard references such as Conway and Sloane's book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\".\n4.  **Final Calculation**: I will add the number of classes from each genus to get the total count.\n5.  **Code**: The python script will present this established result and compute the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17\n    and determinant 2 based on known mathematical classification results.\n\n    This is a known result from the theory of integral quadratic forms. The\n    lattices are first classified into \"genera\". For dimension 17 and\n    determinant 2, there are two genera. The number of isomorphism classes\n    within each genus is also known from tables compiled by mathematicians\n    (e.g., in Conway and Sloane's \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\",\n    based on work by G.L. Nipp).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification, there are two genera for lattices with\n    # dimension 17 and determinant 2.
