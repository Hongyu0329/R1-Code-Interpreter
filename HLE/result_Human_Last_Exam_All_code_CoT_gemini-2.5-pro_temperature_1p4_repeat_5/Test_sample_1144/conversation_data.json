    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns and Unknowns**:\n    *   Known: Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   To find: The ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum (Δp / p).\n\n2.  **Apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**:\n    *   The principle states: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   We can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) as: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n\n3.  **Determine Momentum from the Bohr Model**:\n    *   For an electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is quantized: L = mvr = nħ = ħ.\n    *   Since momentum p = mv, we can write the angular momentum as L = p * r₁.\n    *   Therefore, the momentum (p) of the electron is: p = ħ / r₁, where r₁ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (the Bohr radius).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p)**:\n    *   The ratio is (Δp / p) = [ħ / (2 * Δx)] / [ħ / r₁].\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the equation to: **Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)**.\n\n5.  **Code the Solution**:\n    *   Define the constants for the Bohr radius (r₁) and the uncertainty in position (Δx).\n    *   Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n    *   Print the final equation with the values substituted in, along with the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants\n# Bohr radius (r1) in meters. This is the radius of the first Bohr orbit.\nbohr_radius = 5.29177e-11  # meters\n# Uncertainty in position (delta_x) provided by the user, converted to meters.\ndelta_x = 10e-12  # meters (since 1 pm = 1e-12 m)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio\n# The ratio of momentum uncertainty (delta_p) to momentum (p) can be simplified to:\n# Ratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n# This is derived from Heisenberg's principle (delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x))\n# and the momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p = h_bar / r1).\nratio = bohr_radius / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 3: Print the result and the equation\nprint(\"The ratio is calculated using the formula: Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(f\"Where the radius of the first Bohr orbit (r₁) = {bohr_radius:.5e} m\")\nprint(f\"And the uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.5e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {bohr_radius:.5f} / (2 * {delta_x:.5f})\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated Ratio: {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
