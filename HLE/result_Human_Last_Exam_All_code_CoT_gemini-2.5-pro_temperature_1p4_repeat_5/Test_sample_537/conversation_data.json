    "Based on my analysis, the pattern is a Caesar cipher where each letter is shifted one position backward in the alphabet. This is often called a \"shift of -1\".\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The first word, `utpshtheas`, appears to be a clue.\n2.  If we apply this \"shift back by 1\" rule to `utpshtheas`, we get `tsorgsgdzr`.\n3.  `tsorgsgdzr` is a near-perfect anagram of the word `retrogrades`, which means \"to move backward\". This strongly suggests the rule is to shift each letter backward.\n4.  The prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation\" fits perfectly with this kind of letter-by-letter mathematical transformation.\n\nThe following Python code will apply this pattern to decode the word `anhaeketn`. It will print the step-by-step \"equation\" for each letter and then the final result.\n\n```python\ndef decode_word(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Decodes a word by shifting each letter one position backward in the alphabet.\n    It prints the decoding equation for each letter and the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    decoded_word = []\n    final_equation_parts = []\n    \n    print(\"Decoding the word:\", word)\n    print(\"Pattern: Shift each letter back by 1 (e.g., b -> a, a -> z).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    for char in word:\n        # Convert character to its 1-26 alphabetical position\n        original_pos = ord(char) - ord('a') + 1\n        \n        # Shift back by one\n        new_pos = original_pos - 1\n        \n        # Handle wraparound from 'a' to 'z'\n        if new_pos == 0:\n            new_pos = 26\n            \n        # Convert new position back to a character\n        new_char = chr(new_pos + ord('a') - 1)\n        \n        # Store the character for the final word\n        decoded_word.append(new_char)\n        \n        # Print the equation for the current character\n        print(f\"{char} ({original_pos}) - 1 = {new_char} ({new_pos})\")\n        \n    final_word = \"\".join(decoded_word)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Final decoded word:\", final_word)\n    return final_word\n\n# The word to decode\nencoded_word = \"anhaeketn\"\ndecode_word(encoded_word)\n```\n<<<zmgzdjdsm>>>"
