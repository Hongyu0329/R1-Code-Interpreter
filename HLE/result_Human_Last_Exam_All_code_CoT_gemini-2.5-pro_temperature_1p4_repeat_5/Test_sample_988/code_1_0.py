    1.  **Stressor and Effect:** High temperature exposure (29°C) is a significant stressor for Microcystis aeruginosa. This stress disrupts metabolic pathways, especially photosynthesis, leading to the rapid overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), such as the superoxide radical (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

    2.  **Cellular Damage:** This sudden increase in ROS causes a state of 'oxidative stress', which can damage essential cellular components like lipids in membranes, proteins, and DNA.

    3.  **The First Line of Defense:** To survive, the cell must immediately counteract this ROS burst. The most rapid and efficient initial response comes from the cell's enzymatic antioxidant system.

    4.  **Role of Enzymatic Antioxidants:** This system includes enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT).
        - **SOD** immediately converts the highly reactive superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide.
        - **CAT** then rapidly breaks down the hydrogen peroxide into harmless water and oxygen.
        These enzymes are present in the cell and their catalytic activity provides an immediate, powerful defense, making them the primary *initial* responders.

    5.  **Role of Other Antioxidants:** While hydrosoluble antioxidants (like glutathione), liposoluble antioxidants (like carotenoids), and pigments are also crucial for overall protection, their role is often supportive or part of a more sustained, long-term response. For instance, synthesizing new non-enzymatic antioxidants or significantly changing pigment concentrations takes more time than activating existing enzymes.

    6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the enzymatic antioxidants are the defense mechanism initially activated to counteract the immediate oxidative stress from high temperature exposure.
