    This script analyzes ballet techniques to answer the user's question.

    The question asks to identify the pair of ballet institutions where dancers prepare for
    pirouettes from fourth position with arms in an 'allongé' (elongated) position.

    Let's analyze the major schools/methods:

    1. Vaganova Method (Vaganova Academy):
       - Preparation is typically with rounded arms (front arm in 1st, back arm in 2nd).
       - This is NOT an allongé position.
       - This eliminates choices C and D.

    2. French School (Paris Opera Ballet School):
       - Known for its elegance and long lines.
       - A characteristic pirouette preparation from fourth position uses open, extended arms.
       - This IS an allongé position.

    3. Balanchine Method (School of American Ballet):
       - Emphasizes speed and expansive movement.
       - The preparation often involves dynamic, open, and stretched arms to generate momentum.
       - This IS also considered an allongé position.

    4. Royal Ballet School and La Scala (Cecchetti):
       - These schools generally use more rounded and contained arm positions for this preparation,
         though styles can be blended. They are not as distinctly known for this specific
         'allongé' preparation as the French and Balanchine styles.

    Conclusion:
    The two institutions most famous for this specific technique are the
    Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet.
