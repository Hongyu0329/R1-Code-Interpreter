    Calculates the number of allowed ordered pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a, b <= 1000.
    
    An ordered pair (a,b) is allowed if one of the following conditions is met:
    1. a = 1 or b = 1.
    2. a does not divide b, and b does not divide a.
    
    Let N = 1000.
    The total number of pairs is N*N.
    
    The number of pairs where a|b is sum(floor(N/a) for a in 1..N). Let this be n_div_sum.
    The number of pairs where b|a is also n_div_sum by symmetry.
    The number of pairs where a=b is N. These are counted in both of the above.
    
    So, the number of pairs where one divides the other is 2 * n_div_sum - N.
    
    The number of pairs where neither divides the other is N*N - (2 * n_div_sum - N).
    
    The number of pairs where a=1 or b=1 is N + N - 1 = 2*N - 1.
    These two categories of allowed pairs are disjoint.
    
    Total allowed pairs = (N*N - (2 * n_div_sum - N)) + (2*N - 1)
                        = N*N - 2*n_div_sum + N + 2*N - 1
                        = N*N + 3*N - 1 - 2*n_div_sum
