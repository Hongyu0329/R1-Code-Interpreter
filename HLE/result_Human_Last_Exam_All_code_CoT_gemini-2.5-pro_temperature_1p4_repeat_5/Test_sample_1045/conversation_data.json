    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (also called basis functions) for each atom in toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set and then sum them up.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the 6-31G basis set notation:**\n    *   **Core electrons:** The `6` indicates that each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence electrons:** The `31` indicates that the valence shell is split into two parts (a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta\" basis set).\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function made of 3 primitives.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function made of 1 primitive.\n\n2.  **Count functions for each atom type:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):**\n        *   **Core (1s):** 1 contracted function.\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** The valence shell has one s-orbital and three p-orbitals (px, py, pz). Each of these four orbitals is split into two functions (inner and outer).\n        *   Total for C = 1 (core) + 2 * (1s + 3p) = 1 + 2 * 4 = 9 functions.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   **Core:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n        *   **Valence (1s):** The 1s orbital is split into two functions (inner and outer).\n        *   Total for H = 2 functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Multiply the number of functions per atom by the count of each atom in the molecule and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print out the steps.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule: C7H8\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom with the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1s(core) + 2s(valence_inner) + 2p(valence_inner) + 2s(valence_outer) + 2p(valence_outer)\n# This simplifies to 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner 2sp) + 4 (for outer 2sp) = 9 functions.\ncgf_per_carbon = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1s(valence_inner) + 1s(valence_outer) = 2 functions.\ncgf_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total contribution from Carbon atoms\ntotal_cgf_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * cgf_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total contribution from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_cgf_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * cgf_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for the molecule\ntotal_cgf = total_cgf_carbon + total_cgf_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\\n\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen_atoms}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {cgf_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {cgf_per_hydrogen}\\n\")\n\n# Print the final equation with all numbers\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {cgf_per_carbon} funcs/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {cgf_per_hydrogen} funcs/H)\")\nprint(f\"                = {total_cgf_carbon} + {total_cgf_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"                = {total_cgf}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
