    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we must identify the set of continuous transformations of the independent variables ($t, x, y, z$) and dependent variables (velocity components $u_x, u_y, u_z$ and pressure $p$) that leave the form of the equations unchanged.\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group is equal to the number of independent infinitesimal generators that form the basis of the corresponding Lie algebra. For the force-free incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, these generators correspond to the following physical transformations:\n\n1.  **Time translation**: Shifting the time origin.\n2.  **Spatial translations**: Shifting the spatial origin in any of the 3 directions.\n3.  **Spatial rotations**: Rotating the coordinate system in space.\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: Shifting to a new reference frame moving at a constant velocity.\n5.  **Scaling**: A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure.\n6.  **Pressure shift**: Shifting the pressure by a constant value.\n\nWhile there exists an infinite-dimensional symmetry related to shifting the pressure by an arbitrary function of time ($p \\to p + c(t)$), the standard result for the dimension of the Lie point symmetry group refers to the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra, where the pressure shift is restricted to a constant.\n\nThe Python code below calculates the total dimension by summing the number of generators for each of these transformations.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 3D\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The dimension is the sum of the number of generators for each\n    independent symmetry transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Using an OrderedDict to maintain the order for printing\n    symmetries = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"Time translation\", 1),\n        (\"Spatial translations\", 3),\n        (\"Spatial rotations\", 3),\n        (\"Galilean boosts\", 3),\n        (\"Scaling (dilation)\", 1),\n        (\"Constant pressure shift\", 1)\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is calculated by summing the dimensions of its constituent symmetry generators:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"{name:<25}: {dim} dimension(s)\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Calculate the total dimension\n    total_dimension = sum(symmetries.values())\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(dim) for dim in symmetries.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {equation_str} = {total_dimension}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
