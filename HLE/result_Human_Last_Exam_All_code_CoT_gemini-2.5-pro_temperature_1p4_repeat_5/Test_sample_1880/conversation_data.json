    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for analyzing quartic polynomials.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I will determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). I will use Eisenstein's criterion for this. An irreducible quartic polynomial has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial will be calculated. Whether or not the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ determines if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: I will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with the quartic.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I will check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots.\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: Based on the irreducibility of the polynomial, the nature of the discriminant, and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, I can identify the specific Galois group and its order from the known classification of transitive subgroups of $S_4$.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get all integer divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n\n    print(\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Check Irreducibility (Analytical)\n    print(\"Step 1: Check Irreducibility\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime 2 on f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14:\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 divides the coefficients 0, 8, and 14.\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(\" - The prime's square, 4, does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over Q.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant (Delta)\")\n    p_pow_4 = p**4\n    q_pow_3 = q**3\n    delta = 256 * q_pow_3 - 27 * p_pow_4\n    print(f\"For x^4 + px + q, the formula is Delta = 256*q^3 - 27*p^4.\")\n    print(f\"With p = {p} and q = {q}:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * ({q}^3) - 27 * ({p}^4)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * ({q_pow_3}) - 27 * ({p_pow_4})\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * q_pow_3} - {27 * p_pow_4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check if Discriminant is a Perfect Square\n    print(\"Step 3: Check if Delta is a perfect square\")\n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    is_square = (sqrt_delta_int * sqrt_delta_int == delta)\n    if is_square:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is a perfect square ({sqrt_delta_int}^2).\")\n        print(\"This means the Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The integer square root of {delta} is {sqrt_delta_int}, but {sqrt_delta_int}^2 != {delta}.\")\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is not a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Form and analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n    print(\"Step 4: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic g(y)\")\n    p_sq = p**2\n    g_coeff1 = -4 * q\n    g_coeff0 = -p_sq\n    print(f\"For x^4 + px + q, the resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 - 4*q*y - p^2.\")\n    print(f\"g(y) = y^3 - 4*({q})*y - ({p}^2)\")\n    print(f\"g(y) = y^3 + ({g_coeff1})y + ({g_coeff0})\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Checking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem...\")\n    possible_roots = get_divisors(g_coeff0)\n    has_rational_root = False\n    rational_root = None\n    for r in possible_roots:\n        if r**3 + g_coeff1 * r + g_coeff0 == 0:\n            has_rational_root = True\n            rational_root = r\n            break\n\n    if has_rational_root:\n        print(f\"A rational root was found: y = {rational_root}.\")\n        print(f\"g({rational_root}) = ({rational_root})^3 + ({g_coeff1})*({rational_root}) + ({g_coeff0}) = {rational_root**3 + g_coeff1*rational_root + g_coeff0}\")\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic is reducible over Q.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No rational roots were found.\")\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic is irreducible over Q.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the Galois Group and its Order\n    print(\"Step 5: Conclude the Galois Group and its Order\")\n    print(\"Summary of findings:\")\n    print(\" - The polynomial is irreducible.\")\n    print(\" - The discriminant is NOT a perfect square.\")\n    print(\" - The resolvent cubic IS reducible.\")\n    print(\"This combination of properties implies the Galois group is the Dihedral Group D_4.\")\n    \n    final_order = 8\n    print(f\"\\nThe order of the Galois group D_4 is {final_order}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
