# This algorithm represents the solution under the hypothetical
# case where the answer to the question "does a god exist?" is "yes".
#
# According to computability theory, a problem is decidable if a
# correct, halting algorithm for it exists.
#
# - If the true answer is "yes", this program is that algorithm.
# - If the true answer is "no", then a different program ('print("no")')
#   is that algorithm.
#
# Since one of these two programs MUST be the correct one, a
# correct, halting algorithm is guaranteed to exist. Therefore,
# the problem is decidable.
