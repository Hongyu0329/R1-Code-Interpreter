    "To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the smallest circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius 1. This is a well-known mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\".\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the arrangement:** For n=14 circles, the proven optimal packing arrangement has a specific structure. It consists of a central group of circles and an outer layer of 8 circles that are all tangent to the inside of the large, containing circle.\n2.  **Use the geometric formula:** The radius `R` of the large circle can be calculated based on the radius `r` of the small circles and the number of circles in the outer layer, `k`. The formula is:\n    `R = r * (1 + 1 / sin(Ï€ / k))`\n3.  **Plug in the values:** In this case, the radius of the small circles `r` is 1, and the number of circles in the outer layer `k` is 8.\n4.  **Write the code:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculation using the `math` library. The script will print the formula, show the values being substituted, and then display the final result formatted to 4 significant digits.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle tightly packing 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the problem\n    # r is the radius of the small circles\n    r = 1.0\n    # k is the number of circles in the outer layer for the optimal packing of 14 circles\n    k = 8\n\n    # Explain the context and the formula being used\n    print(\"This problem is a case of 'circle packing in a circle'.\")\n    print(\"For 14 circles of radius 1, the optimal arrangement has an outer layer of 8 circles.\")\n    print(\"The radius 'R' of the containing circle is calculated with the formula:\")\n    print(\"R = r * (1 + 1 / sin(pi / k))\\n\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation step-by-step and print the equation with numbers\n    print(\"Plugging in the values r=1 and k=8:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Show the initial formula with numbers\n    print(f\"R = {r} * (1 + 1 / sin(pi / {k}))\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate intermediate values to show the process\n    sin_val = math.sin(math.pi / k)\n    print(f\"R = {r} * (1 + 1 / {sin_val:.7f})\")\n    \n    inv_sin_val = 1 / sin_val\n    print(f\"R = {r} * (1 + {inv_sin_val:.7f})\")\n    \n    R = r * (1 + inv_sin_val)\n    print(f\"R = {R:.7f}\\n\")\n\n    # Format the final result to 4 significant digits\n    # The '.4g' format specifier is used for rounding to a certain number of significant figures.\n    formatted_R = f\"{R:.4g}\"\n\n    print(f\"The radius of the large circle, rounded to 4 significant digits, is: {formatted_R}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_packing_radius()\n```\n<<<3.613>>>"
