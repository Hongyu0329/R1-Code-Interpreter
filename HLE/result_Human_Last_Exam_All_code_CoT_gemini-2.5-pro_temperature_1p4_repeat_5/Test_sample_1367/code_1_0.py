    Solves the theoretical questions about the vertex algebra V(p).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The vertex algebra V(p), also known as the triplet algebra W(p), is simple if and only if p is not a prime number.
        Since there are prime numbers >= 1 (e.g., p=2, 3, 5), V(p) is not simple for all p. Thus, the answer is No.

    (b) In a vertex operator algebra with a conformal structure (like V(p)), any non-trivial proper ideal must be generated by a "singular vector"
        (a highest-weight vector for the Virasoro algebra that is not the vacuum). Therefore, the ideal must contain such a vector.
        This is the most fundamental condition that leads to the existence of a non-trivial ideal.

    (c) The simplicity of the VOA V(p) is equivalent to the absence of singular vectors (other than the vacuum).
        The irreducibility of V(p) as a highest-weight module for its own Virasoro algebra is also defined by the absence of singular vectors.
        The vertex algebra L_k(sl_2) and V(p) are intrinsically linked and share the same Virasoro structure. Interpreting "L_k(sl_2)-module"
        as a module for this common Virasoro algebra (a standard convention in this context), the simplicity of V(p) does imply its irreducibility.
        Thus, the answer is Yes.
