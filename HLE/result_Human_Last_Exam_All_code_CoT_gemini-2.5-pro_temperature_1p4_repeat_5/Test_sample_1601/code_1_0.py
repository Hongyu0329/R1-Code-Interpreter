# Based on the analytical study of the ODE system, the set Omega of initial conditions
# (a(0), b(0)) that leads to the specified blow-up (a(t) -> infinity, b(t) -> -infinity)
# corresponds to the region where a(0) is in (0, 1] and b(0) is in [10, 20].

# Define the boundaries of the set Omega.
a_min = 0
a_max = 1
b_min = 10
b_max = 20

# The measure of the set Omega is its area in the a(0)-b(0) plane.
# The area of a rectangle is calculated as (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y).
area = (a_max - a_min) * (b_max - b_min)

# Print the final calculation and the result.
# The instruction is to output each number in the final equation.
