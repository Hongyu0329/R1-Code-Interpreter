def solve_crystal_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the crystal modeling problem.

    Part A: Dimension of the bundle's fibers.
    The connection C that encodes the local crystal structure is identified with the distortion tensor,
    a 3x3 matrix. The space of 3x3 matrices is 9-dimensional.
    So, the dimension of the fiber is 9.

    Part B: Number of coefficients for the energy functional E.
    The energy E is a quadratic form in the strain tensor components, consistent with linear dynamics
    and rotation invariance. For a cubic crystal, this form is specified by 3 coefficients (c11, c12, c44).
    The additional constraint of "invariance to rigid translation cell-by-cell up the z axis" is
    interpreted as implying a microscopic model with central forces, which leads to the Cauchy relation: c12 = c44.
    This relation reduces the number of independent coefficients from 3 to 2.
