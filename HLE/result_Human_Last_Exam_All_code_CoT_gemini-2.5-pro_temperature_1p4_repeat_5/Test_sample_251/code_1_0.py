    This script calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a Lagrangian
    submanifold constructed via an iterated Biran lift.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. Start with the known number of Maslov 2 disks for the base Lagrangian,
       the Chekanov torus in CP^2.
    2. Determine the number of Biran lifts performed.
    3. Add one new disk for each lift operation.
    4. Sum these numbers to get the final count.
