    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{p/q}\\)**: The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is given by the formula:\n    \\[ m_{p/q} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9p^2 - 8pq + 4q^2}}{q} \\]\n2.  **Substitute Values**: For the specific case of \\( m_{4/7} \\), we will substitute \\(p=4\\) and \\(q=7\\) into the formula. This gives us the number \\( x = m_{4/7} \\) for which we need to find the continued fraction.\n    \\[ \\Delta = 9(4^2) - 8(4)(7) + 4(7^2) = 144 - 224 + 196 = 116 \\]\n    So, \\( m_{4/7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{116}}{7} \\).\n3.  **Prepare for the Continued Fraction Algorithm**: The standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational requires the number to be in the form \\( \\frac{\\alpha_0 + \\sqrt{D}}{\\beta_0} \\), with the condition that \\(\\beta_0\\) must divide \\(D - \\alpha_0^2\\). To meet this condition, we can rewrite \\( m_{4/7} \\) as:\n    \\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{116}}{7} = \\frac{0 + \\sqrt{116 \\cdot 7^2}}{7^2} = \\frac{0 + \\sqrt{5684}}{49} \\]\n    This gives us the initial values for the algorithm: \\( \\alpha_0 = 0 \\), \\( \\beta_0 = 49 \\), and \\( D = 5684 \\).\n4.  **Implement the Algorithm**: We will write a Python script that iteratively calculates the coefficients \\(a_k\\) of the continued fraction using the following recurrence relations:\n    *   \\(a_k = \\lfloor \\frac{\\alpha_k + \\sqrt{D}}{\\beta_k} \\rfloor\\)\n    *   \\(\\alpha_{k+1} = a_k \\beta_k - \\alpha_k\\)\n    *   \\(\\beta_{k+1} = \\frac{D - \\alpha_{k+1}^2}{\\beta_k}\\)\n5.  **Detect Periodicity**: Since \\(m_{4/7}\\) is a quadratic irrational, its continued fraction must be periodic. The script will detect the repeating block by storing the pairs \\((\\alpha_k, \\beta_k)\\) and checking for repetition. When a pair is encountered for the second time, the periodic part of the fraction has been identified.\n6.  **Output the Coefficients**: Finally, the script will print the resulting coefficients, clearly separating the integer part (non-repeating) from the periodic part. This will present all the numbers that constitute the \"final equation\" representing the continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Calculate the number m_{p/q} = sqrt(Delta)/q\n    delta_orig = 9 * p**2 - 8 * p * q + 4 * q**2\n    \n    # Step 3: Prepare for the continued fraction algorithm\n    # We use D = delta_orig * q^2 to ensure integer arithmetic\n    D = delta_orig * q**2\n    sqrt_D = math.isqrt(D)\n    \n    # Initial state for the algorithm: x = (alpha_0 + sqrt(D)) / beta_0\n    alpha = 0\n    beta = q**2\n    \n    # Check if the initial state satisfies the algorithm's divisibility condition\n    if (D - alpha**2) % beta != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: The initial state for p={p}, q={q} does not satisfy the algorithm's requirements.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Implement the algorithm and detect periodicity\n    coeffs = []\n    seen_states = {}\n    \n    while (alpha, beta) not in seen_states:\n        seen_states[(alpha, beta)] = len(coeffs)\n        \n        # Calculate the next coefficient a_k\n        a = (alpha + sqrt_D) // beta\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        \n        # Calculate the next state (alpha_{k+1}, beta_{k+1})\n        alpha_next = a * beta - alpha\n        beta_next = (D - alpha_next**2) // beta\n        \n        alpha = alpha_next\n        beta = beta_next\n\n    # The loop terminates when a state is repeated.
