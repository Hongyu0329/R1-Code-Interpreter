# The user wants to identify the correct statement about the self-stabilizing effect of knowledge acquisition.

# Step 1: Analyze the provided concepts.
# The core idea is that discovering "knowledge gaps" increases interest in learning more.
# - Early phase: Low awareness of gaps -> weak effect.
# - Intermediate phase: Growing awareness of gaps -> stronger effect.
# - Late phase: Comprehensive knowledge allows for the discovery of the most numerous and complex gaps -> peak effect.

# Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.
# A is too general.
# B is incorrect because the effect is weakest in the early phase.
# C correctly states that the effect peaks in the late phase because expertise is required to perceive the deepest and most numerous knowledge gaps.
# E is incorrect as the effect is dynamic, not constant.

# Step 3: Conclude that C is the correct answer.
correct_answer = 'C'

# Step 4: Print the final answer as requested.
print(f"The correct statement is C.")
print(f"Reasoning: The self-stabilizing effect is driven by the perception of knowledge gaps. A learner in the late phase possesses the most comprehensive knowledge, which uniquely enables them to identify the most subtle, complex, and numerous gaps at the frontiers of the subject. Therefore, the effect peaks in this phase.")

# Final answer to be provided in the specified format.
# The code doesn't perform a calculation, but it follows the instruction to use a code block to deliver the solution.
final_answer_letter = correct_answer
# print("The letter corresponding to the correct answer is:")
# print(final_answer_letter) # This could also be the output, but the user wants the reasoning too.
