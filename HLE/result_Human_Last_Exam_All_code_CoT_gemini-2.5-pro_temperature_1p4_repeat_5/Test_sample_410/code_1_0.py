# Step 1: Determine the coefficients of f(x) = a_coeff*e^(2x) + b_coeff*e^x + c_coeff.
# The variables a, b, c here are coefficients of the function.

# Condition 1: lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/e^x = 1.
# Rewriting the expression inside the limit:
# (a_coeff*e^(2x) + b_coeff*e^x + c_coeff + 3) / e^x = a_coeff*e^x + b_coeff + (c_coeff+3)*e^(-x)
# As x approaches -infinity, e^x approaches 0 and e^(-x) approaches infinity.
# For the limit to be a finite number (1), the coefficient of the term that goes to infinity must be zero.
# Therefore, c_coeff + 3 = 0, which means c_coeff = -3.
# With c_coeff = -3, the limit becomes lim_{x->-inf} (a_coeff*e^x + b_coeff) = b_coeff.
# The condition states this limit is 1, so b_coeff = 1.

# Condition 2: f(ln(2)) = 0.
# The function is now f(x) = a_coeff*e^(2x) + 1*e^x - 3.
# f(ln(2)) = a_coeff*e^(2*ln(2)) + e^(ln(2)) - 3 = 0
# a_coeff*(e^(ln(2)))^2 + 2 - 3 = 0
# a_coeff*(2)^2 - 1 = 0
# 4*a_coeff - 1 = 0
# This gives a_coeff = 1/4.

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation to find the new a and b.
# These a and b are the variables we need to solve for, not the coefficients.
# The integral equation is ∫[0, a] g(x) dx + ∫[ln(2), ln(b)] f(x) dx = a*ln(b).
# We use the general identity for integrals of inverse functions:
# ∫[y1, y2] f(x) dx + ∫[f(y1), f(y2)] g(x) dx = y2*f(y2) - y1*f(y1).
# Let's set y1 = ln(2) and y2 = ln(b).
# From the problem statement, we know f(y1) = f(ln(2)) = 0.
# So the identity becomes:
# ∫[ln(2), ln(b)] f(x) dx + ∫[0, f(ln(b))] g(x) dx = ln(b)*f(ln(b)) - ln(2)*f(ln(2)) = ln(b)*f(ln(b)).
# Comparing this identity to the given integral equation:
# 1. For the integral limits of g(x) to match, we must have: a = f(ln(b)).
# 2. For the right-hand sides to match, we must have: a*ln(b) = ln(b)*f(ln(b)).
# If we enforce condition (1), a = f(ln(b)), then condition (2) is automatically satisfied.
# So, the entire integral equation is equivalent to the single condition a = f(ln(b)).

print("\nStep 2: The integral equation implies the condition a = f(ln(b)).")

# Step 3: Use the given information to find a specific solution for a and b.
# We have two similar-looking equations from our analysis:
# Equation (1): a = f(ln(b))
# Equation (2): 0 = f(ln(2))
# By comparing these two equations, we can see that if we choose b=2 in Equation (1),
# we get a = f(ln(2)). Then, from Equation (2), we know this means a = 0.
# This provides a unique solution that is consistent with all the problem's conditions.
