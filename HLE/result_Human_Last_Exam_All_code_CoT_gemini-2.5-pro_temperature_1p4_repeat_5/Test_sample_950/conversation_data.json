    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve this problem, followed by a Python script that carries out the calculation and provides the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$.\n2.  **Use Homogeneous Space Representation:** The Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ can be represented as a quotient of Lie groups, specifically a homogeneous space: $Gr(k, n) \\cong SO(n) / (SO(k) \\times SO(n-k))$. For our case, this is $Gr(3, 5) \\cong SO(5) / (SO(3) \\times SO(2))$.\n3.  **Apply Borel's Theorem:** A key theorem by Armand Borel states that for a compact homogeneous space $G/H$, if the rank of the Lie group $G$ is equal to the rank of the subgroup $H$, then the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G/H; \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free.\n4.  **Calculate Ranks:** The rank of the special orthogonal group $SO(m)$ is $\\lfloor m/2 \\rfloor$. We will calculate the ranks for $G=SO(5)$ and $H=SO(3) \\times SO(2)$ and compare them.\n5.  **Determine the Torsion Subgroup:** Based on the comparison of ranks, we'll determine if the cohomology has torsion. If it is torsion-free, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$.\n6.  **Find the Rank of the Torsion Subgroup:** The rank of an abelian group is the rank of its free part. A torsion group, by definition, has a free part of rank 0. Therefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is always 0, regardless of its specific structure.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral \n    cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n\n    This space is the Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    k = 3\n    n_minus_k = n - k\n\n    # Helper function for SO(m) rank\n    def rank_so(m):\n        return math.floor(m / 2)\n\n    print(\"This program calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of H*(Gr(3, 5); Z).\")\n    print(f\"The space Gr({k}, {n}) is represented as the homogeneous space G/H = SO({n}) / (SO({k}) x SO({n_minus_k})).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Calculate the ranks of the Lie groups G and H ---\")\n    \n    # Rank of G = SO(n)\n    rank_g = rank_so(n)\n    print(f\"The rank of G = SO({n}) is floor({n}/2).\")\n    print(f\"rank(G) = {rank_g}\")\n\n    # Rank of H = SO(k) x SO(n-k)\n    rank_h_1 = rank_so(k)\n    rank_h_2 = rank_so(n_minus_k)\n    rank_h = rank_h_1 + rank_h_2\n    print(f\"The rank of H = SO({k}) x SO({n_minus_k}) is rank(SO({k})) + rank(SO({n_minus_k})).\")\n    print(f\"rank(SO({k})) = floor({k}/2) = {rank_h_1}\")\n    print(f\"rank(SO({n_minus_k})) = floor({n_minus_k}/2) = {rank_h_2}\")\n    print(f\"rank(H) = {rank_h_1} + {rank_h_2} = {rank_h}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Apply Borel's theorem ---\")\n    print(f\"Comparing the ranks: rank(G) = {rank_g} and rank(H) = {rank_h}.\")\n    if rank_g == rank_h:\n        print(\"Since rank(G) = rank(H), a theorem by A.
