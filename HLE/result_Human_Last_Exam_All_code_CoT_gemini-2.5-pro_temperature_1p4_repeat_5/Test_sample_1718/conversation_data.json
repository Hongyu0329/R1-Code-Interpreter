    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the special symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Manifold:** A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric. Its dimension is always even. We will denote the complex dimension by `m`, which means the real dimension is `n = 2m`.\n\n2.  **Identify Additional Symmetries:** The compatibility between the complex structure and the metric on a Kähler manifold imposes strong constraints on the Riemann curvature tensor. These are in addition to the usual symmetries of the Riemann tensor on a general Riemannian manifold.\n\n3.  **Use Complex Coordinates:** In a local complex coordinate system, the Riemann tensor is entirely determined by its components of the form $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$, where the indices $i, j, k, l$ run from 1 to `m`.\n\n4.  **Derive the Formula:** The symmetries of these components allow us to establish that the number of independent real components is given by the square of the dimension of the space of symmetric `m x m` complex matrices.\n    *   First, we find the dimension of the space of symmetric `m x m` matrices, let's call it `N`. This is given by the formula: `N = m * (m + 1) / 2`.\n    *   Second, the number of independent real entries in the Riemann tensor is simply `N` squared.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** We will write a Python script to perform this calculation. Since the problem does not specify a dimension, we will use a common example from physics and mathematics: a manifold of complex dimension `m = 3` (like a Calabi-Yau threefold). The code will print out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_kaehler_riemann_components():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem does not specify a dimension.
