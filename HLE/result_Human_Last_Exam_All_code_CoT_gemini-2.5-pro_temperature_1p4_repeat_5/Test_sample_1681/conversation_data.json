    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Quantum Game Setup:** I will use the Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantizing the Prisoner's Dilemma. This involves:\n    *   An initial quantum state shared between the two players (Alice and Bob), which is maximally entangled. This entanglement is created by an operator `J`.\n    *   Players' strategies are no longer just \"Cooperate\" (C) or \"Defect\" (D), but a continuous set of quantum operations (unitary matrices). The classical strategies C and D are a subset of these quantum strategies.\n    *   A \"miracle\" quantum strategy, `Q`, exists which is not available in the classical game.\n    *   After players apply their chosen strategies, a disentangling operator `J†` is applied, and the final state is measured. The probabilities of the outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD) determine the players' payoffs.\n\n2.  **Identify the Equilibrium:** In the classical game, the only Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect) with a payoff of (1, 1). However, in the quantum version with maximal entanglement, a new, better Nash Equilibrium appears at `(Q, Q)`. This equilibrium resolves the dilemma because the outcome is Pareto-optimal.\n\n3.  **Simulate with Python:** I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to perform the quantum calculations:\n    *   Define the payoff values: Reward (R=5), Sucker (S=0), Temptation (T=7), and Punishment (P=1).\n    *   Represent the quantum state as a vector and the operators (`J`, `Q`, etc.) as matrices.\n    *   Start with the initial state `|00>`.\n    *   Apply the entangling gate `J` to create the shared state.\n    *   Apply the players' equilibrium strategies, `Q` for Alice and `Q` for Bob.\n    *   Apply the disentangling gate `J†`.\n    *   Calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes from the final state vector.\n    *   Use these probabilities and the payoff values to compute the final expected payoff for each player.\n    *   The code will print the full calculation step-by-step to show how the final equilibrium payoff is reached.\n\nThe script will demonstrate that the `(Q, Q)` strategy profile leads to the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome with 100% probability, yielding a payoff of (5, 5). This is the equilibrium point in the quantum game under optimal conditions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the payoff matrix values for the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n# 2.
