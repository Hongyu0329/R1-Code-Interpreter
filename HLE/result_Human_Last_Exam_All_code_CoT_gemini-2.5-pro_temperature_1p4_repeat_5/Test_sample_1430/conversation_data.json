    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Understand the problem:** We need to find the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group, `rho(X)`, of `X = C^(15)`, where `C` is a genus 3 Riemann surface (a smooth complex projective curve of genus `g=3`).\n\n2.  **Relate `rho(X)` to the Jacobian of C:** The variety `X = C^(15)` is the 15th symmetric power of the curve `C`. Its geometry is closely tied to the Jacobian variety of `C`, denoted `J(C)`. The Jacobian `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety that parametrizes degree-0 line bundles on `C`. There is a fundamental relationship between the Picard group (and thus the Néron-Severi group) of a symmetric power `C^(d)` and the Jacobian `J(C)`. For any `d >= 1`, the following isomorphism holds:\n    `Pic(C^(d)) ≅ Pic(J(C))`.\n    This implies that their Néron-Severi groups are also isomorphic up to a certain component: `NS(C^(d)) ≅ NS(J(C)) ⊕ Z`. Taking the rank of these groups gives the crucial formula:\n    `rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1`\n    Our problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `rho(J(C))` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n3.  **Find the minimum rank:** The rank `rho(J(C))` is the dimension of the `Q`-vector space of symmetric elements in the endomorphism algebra `End_0(J(C)) = End(J(C)) ⊗ Q`. For a *very general* curve `C` (which corresponds to a generic point in the moduli space of genus 3 curves), the Jacobian `J(C)` has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers: `End(J(C)) = Z`.\n    In this case, `End_0(J(C)) = Q`. The Rosati involution on `Q` is the identity, so all elements are symmetric.\n    Therefore, the space of symmetric elements is `Q` itself, which has dimension 1.\n    So, the minimum possible rank is `rho(J(C))_min = 1`.\n    This gives the smallest rank for `X`: `rho(X)_min = rho(J(C))_min + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n4.  **Find the maximum rank:** The maximum rank `rho(J(C))` occurs for a special curve `C` whose Jacobian has the largest possible endomorphism algebra (Complex Multiplication, or CM) and potentially decomposes. A Jacobian `J(C)` of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. It can be simple or it can decompose into a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties.\n\n    *   **Decomposable Case:** The maximum rank occurs when `J(C)` is isogenous to a product of three mutually isogenous elliptic curves with Complex Multiplication, i.e., `J(C) ~ E × E × E = E^3`, where `E` has CM. There exist genus 3 curves (e.g., the Fermat quartic `x^4 + y^4 = 1`) whose Jacobians have this structure.\n    *   Let's calculate `rho(E^3)`. The endomorphism algebra `End_0(E)` is an imaginary quadratic field `K`, with `[K:Q] = 2`. The endomorphism algebra of the product is the matrix algebra `End_0(E^3) = M_3(K)`.\n    *   The rank `rho(E^3)` is the dimension over `Q` of the space of symmetric elements in `M_3(K)`. With respect to the product polarization, the Rosati involution on `M_3(K)` is conjugate transpose. A symmetric element is a Hermitian matrix `H` (where `H` equals its own conjugate transpose).\n    *   A `3x3` Hermitian matrix `H = (h_ij)` over `K` has diagonal entries `h_ii` that are real (i.e., in `Q`) and off-diagonal entries satisfying `h_ij = conjugate(h_ji)`.\n    *   The dimension of this space over `Q` is calculated as follows:\n        *   3 diagonal entries, which must be in `Q`. This gives `3 * dim_Q(Q) = 3 * 1 = 3`.\n        *   3 upper-triangular entries (`h_12, h_13, h_23`) which can be any element of `K`. The lower-triangular ones are then determined. This gives `3 * dim_Q(K) = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n    *   The total dimension is `3 + 6 = 9`. So, `rho(J(C))_max = 9`. This value is higher than the maximum possible rank for a simple 3-dimensional abelian variety (which is 6).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have found the minimum and maximum possible ranks for `rho(J(C))`.\n    *   `rho(J(C))_min = 1`\n    *   `rho(J(C))_max = 9`\n    Using the formula from step 2, we can find the ranks for `X = C^(15)`:\n    *   Smallest rank: `rho(X)_min = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Largest rank: `rho(X)_max = 9 + 1 = 10`\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riemann_surface_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks\n    of the Neron-Severi group for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    g = 3  # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    d = 15 # The symmetric power for X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g={}.\".format(g))\n    print(\"Let X be its {}-th symmetric power, X = C^({})\".format(d, d))\n    print(\"We want to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted rho(X).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Key Formula ---\")\n    print(\"The rank rho(X) is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The smallest rank occurs for a 'generic' curve C.\")\n    print(\"For a generic curve, the Jacobian J(C) has the minimum number of endomorphisms.\")\n    rho_j_min = 1\n    print(\"In this case, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian is rho(J(C)) = {}.\".format(rho_j_min))\n    \n    smallest_rank = rho_j_min + 1\n    print(\"Therefore, the smallest possible rank of NS(X) is:\")\n    print(\"{} + {} = {}\".format(rho_j_min, 1, smallest_rank))\n    print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"--- Largest Possible Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The largest rank occurs for a special curve C whose Jacobian has the maximum number of endomorphisms (Complex Multiplication) and is decomposable.\")\n    print(\"This happens when J(C) is isogenous to E^3, the product of three isogenous elliptic curves with CM.\")\n    \n    dim_K = 2 # Dimension over Q of the CM field K=End_0(E)\n    n = 3 # We have a product of n=3 elliptic curves\n    \n    # rho(J(C)) = dim_Q(Hermitian_matrices(n, K))\n    # dim = n * dim_Q(Q) + (n*(n-1)/2) * dim_Q(K)\n    num_diagonal_entries = n\n    num_off_diagonal_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    rho_j_max = num_diagonal_entries * 1 + num_off_diagonal_pairs * dim_K\n    print(\"The rank rho(J(C)) is the dimension of the space of 3x3 Hermitian matrices over the CM field K.\")\n    print(\"This dimension is {} (for the diagonal) + {} * {} (for off-diagonals) = {}.\".format(num_diagonal_entries, num_off_diagonal_pairs, dim_K, rho_j_max))\n    \n    largest_rank = rho_j_max + 1\n    print(\"Therefore, the largest possible rank of NS(X) is:\")\n    print(\"{} + {} = {}\".format(rho_j_max, 1, largest_rank))\n    print(\"-\" * 20 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(\"The smallest possible rank is {}.\".format(smallest_rank))\n    print(\"The largest possible rank is {}.\".format(largest_rank))\n\nsolve_riemann_surface_problem()\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.>>>"
