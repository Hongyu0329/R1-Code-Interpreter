# Step 1: Define the properties of the minimal surface from the problem description.

# The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
# The degree 'd' of the Gauss map is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials.
deg_numerator = 1
deg_denominator = 3
d = max(deg_numerator, deg_denominator)

# The surface M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.
# This means the surface has one end, so k=1.
k = 1

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the Morse index.
# The formula is Index = 2d + k - 1.
index = 2 * d + k - 1

# Step 3: Print the results and the calculation steps.
