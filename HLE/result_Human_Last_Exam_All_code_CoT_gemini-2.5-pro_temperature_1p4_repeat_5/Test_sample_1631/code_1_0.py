        'A': "Incorrect. Wrinkles are primarily managed by blankholder force and drawbeads, which control compressive stresses.",
        'B': "Incorrect. Notches create stress concentrations; they do not relieve distributed residual stresses.",
        'C': "Incorrect. Friction is managed with lubricants and surface coatings, not by modifying the blank's perimeter.",
        'D': "Correct. This is the primary function. Notches are added to the blank to control how the material flows from the flange into the die cavity, especially around difficult features like sharp corners or deep-drawn sections. This prevents tearing, uncontrolled thinning, and other flow-related defects.",
        'E': "Incorrect. Anisotropy is mainly managed by optimizing the blank's orientation relative to the sheet's rolling direction.",
        'F': "Incorrect. Burrs are a result of cutting/trimming operations, not forming.",
        'G': "Incorrect. Trapped lubricants/air are managed with vents in the die surface, not notches on the part's edge.",
        'H': "Incorrect. Rollover is a characteristic of a cut edge, not a forming defect that notches are designed to solve.",
        'I': "Incorrect. Excessive thinning is a symptom of poor material flow. Addressing the material flow (Option D) is the root-cause solution.",
        'J': "Incorrect. While relief notches are used for simple bends, 'bypass notches' is a broader term related to managing flow in complex 3D shapes, as described in D.",
        'K': "Incorrect. Biaxial stretching is a state of forming to be managed, not a defect to be counteracted. Management is achieved by controlling material flow (Option D)."
