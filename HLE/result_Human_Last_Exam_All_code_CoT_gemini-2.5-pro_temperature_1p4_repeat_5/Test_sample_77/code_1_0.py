    # 1. The Domain
    # The domain object defines the boundaries of the simulation. Fluid cannot exist or travel outside of it.
    # Describing it as a container and a barrier is its correct and primary function.
    print("Component 1: Domain")
    print("  - Role: Defines the simulation's boundaries and contains the fluid.")

    # 2. The Fluid Emitter (Inflow)
    # An inflow object continuously generates new fluid particles during the simulation.
    # A small sphere is a perfectly valid shape for an inflow object.
    print("Component 2: Inflow (Fluid Emitter Sphere)")
    print("  - Role: To continuously introduce fluid into the scene.")
    print("  - Assessment: Using a sphere as an inflow object is a standard and effective technique. It will function as intended.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # 3. The Obstacle
    # An obstacle object interacts with the fluid, causing it to collide, splash, and change direction.
    # A plane is a common and simple type of obstacle.
    print("Component 3: Obstacle (Plane)")
    print("  - Role: To block and interact with the fluid.")
    print("  - Assessment: The plane will correctly act as a collider for the falling fluid. It will function as intended.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # 4. Final Conclusion
    # With all components correctly defined, the simulation will proceed as expected:
    # Fluid will be emitted from the sphere, fall due to gravity, hit the obstacle plane,
    # splash and flow across it, and ultimately be contained by the domain.
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("  Yes, all components are described in their correct roles for a fluid simulation.")
    print("  This setup will create a functioning simulation.")
