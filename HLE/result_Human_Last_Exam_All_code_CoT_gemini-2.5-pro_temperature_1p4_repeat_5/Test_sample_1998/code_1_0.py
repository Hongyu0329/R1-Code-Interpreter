    # Step 1: Analyze the field K.
    # The problem states that K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    # and its residue field is a local field of characteristic 2.
    # An example of such a field is K = F_q((t))((u)), where q is a power of 2.
    # This field is a 2-dimensional local field.

    # Step 2: Use known invariants of K.
    # The u-invariant of a field, u(K), is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic
    # quadratic form over that field.
    # For a field with the structure of K, it is a known result in the theory of quadratic forms
    # that its u-invariant is 8.
    u_invariant = 8

    # Step 3: Analyze what the u-invariant implies for the number N.
    # The problem is about a property of *anisotropic* quadratic forms.
    # If we choose N > u(K), i.e., N > 8, then by definition of the u-invariant,
    # any quadratic form in N variables is isotropic. There are no anisotropic ones.
    # The condition is therefore vacuously true for any N > 8.
    # This tells us that the answer must be N <= u(K) + 1 = 9.

    # Step 4: Check if N = 8 satisfies the condition.
    # Let Q be any anisotropic quadratic form in N=8 variables.
    # For the given field K, there is a powerful theorem which states that any
    # anisotropic form of the maximal dimension u(K)=8 must be "similar" to a
    # special type of form called a 3-fold Pfister form.
    # This means Q = c * P for some non-zero c in K and some 3-fold Pfister form P.
    # Another deep result, which relies on the now-proven Bloch-Kato conjecture,
    # implies that any anisotropic 3-fold Pfister form over K is "universal",
    # which means the map defined by the form is surjective.
    # If P is surjective, its image is K. The image of Q is then c * K, which is also K.
    # Thus, for N=8, any anisotropic quadratic form is surjective.

    # Step 5: Check if the property holds for N < 8.
    # To show that N=8 is the smallest such number, we must show that for N=7,
    # the property fails. We need to find at least one anisotropic 7-dimensional
    # quadratic form that is not surjective.
    #
    # We can construct such a form. Start with an anisotropic 8-dimensional Pfister
    # form P (which exists since u(K)=8). As we saw, P is surjective, so it must
    # represent the value 1. This means there is a vector v such that P(v) = 1.
    # Using v, we can define a 7-dimensional subspace V_0 of K^8.
    # Let's consider the restriction of P to this subspace, let's call it P_0.
    # P_0 is a 7-dimensional quadratic form. It can be proven that:
    # 1. P_0 is anisotropic.
    # 2. P_0 cannot represent the value 1. If it did, P would become isotropic,
    #    which is a contradiction.
    #
    # Since P_0 does not represent 1, it is not surjective.
    # So we have found an anisotropic 7-dimensional form that is not surjective.
    # This means the property does not hold for N=7.

    # Step 6: Conclude the final answer.
    # The property holds for N=8, but fails for N=7.
    # Therefore, the smallest such natural number is 8.
    
    N = 8
