    print("1. Assume there are two distinct dispersion points, let's call them p1 and p2.")
    print("2. Since X is a continuum, for any two points in it, there exists a sub-continuum 'C' that is 'irreducible' between them. This means C is a compact and connected subset of X containing p1 and p2, and no proper connected subset of C contains both points.")
    print("3. By the definition of a dispersion point, X \\ {p1} is totally disconnected.")
    print("4. Because C is a subset of X, C \\ {p1} is a subset of X \\ {p1}. A subset of a totally disconnected space must also be totally disconnected. Thus, C \\ {p1} is totally disconnected.")
    print("5. Now, we use a known theorem from continuum theory: For an irreducible continuum C between p1 and p2, the set C \\ {p1} is connected.")
    print("6. From steps 4 and 5, the set C \\ {p1} must be both connected and totally disconnected.")
    print("7. The only non-empty space that is both connected and totally disconnected is a space with a single point.")
    print("8. Since p2 is in C and p2 is not p1, C \\ {p1} is not empty. Therefore, C \\ {p1} must contain exactly one point. This point must be p2.")
    print("9. This implies that the continuum C is the two-point set {p1, p2}.")
    print("10. However, a set with only two points in a metric space is not connected. This contradicts the fact that C is a continuum.")

    print("2. The 'Knaster-Kuratowski fan' is a famous example of a compact connected metric space constructed in the plane.")
    print("3. It is constructed as a modified cone over the Cantor set with an apex 'p'.")
    print("4. The apex 'p' is a dispersion point: the space with 'p' removed, K \\ {p}, can be proven to be totally disconnected.")
    print("5. Any other point 'q' is not a dispersion point: the space K \\ {q} remains path-connected (and therefore connected), as any two points can still be connected by a path going through the apex 'p'.")
