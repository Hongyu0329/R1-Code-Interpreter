    This function analyzes the given Capablanca chess position and determines the minimal number of moves for White to win.
    
    The problem is a "mate in X" puzzle. The solution is found by analyzing the board and identifying a forced checkmate sequence.

    1. Initial Position:
       - White: K(a1), Q(d3), A(h2), P(a2), P(b2)
       - Black: k(j8), c(f7), p(h7), b(i7)
       - White to move.

    2. Analysis:
       - A mate in 1 is not possible. For any check, Black has a valid escape or block.
       - A mate in 2 is possible with the move 1. Qe8+.
         - This move puts the Black king in check.
         - The king has no escape squares, as Q(e8) covers i8, j7, and i7.
         - The queen cannot be captured.
         - The check can be blocked by three moves: ...Cf8, ...Ch8 (knight move), or ...Bh8.
         - In all three cases, White can capture the blocking piece on the next move, resulting in checkmate.
           - If 1... Cf8, then 2. Qxf8#.
           - If 1... Ch8, then 2. Qxh8#.
           - If 1... Bh8, then 2. Qxh8#.
       - Since all of Black's responses to 1. Qe8+ lead to mate on the next move, it is a forced mate in 2.

    3. Result:
       The minimal number of moves for White to win is 2.
