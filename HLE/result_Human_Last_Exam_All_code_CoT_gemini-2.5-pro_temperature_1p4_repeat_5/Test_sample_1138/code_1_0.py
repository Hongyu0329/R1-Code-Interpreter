    print("This property is known as 'strong unforgeability'. However, standard ECDSA is malleable. Given a valid signature (r, s), an adversary can compute a second valid signature (r, -s mod n) for the same message with near-certainty (probability 1).")

    print("An existential forgery vulnerability (which the question asks us to assume) does not imply that the secret key itself can be recovered. Key recovery is a much stronger type of attack than forgery. Therefore, this statement is TRUE.")

    print("C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.")
    print("This statement is about the existence of a scheme with a particular property within the set of 'existentially forgeable schemes'. An 'existentially forgeable' scheme is simply one that is not secure against existential forgery.")
    print("A scheme vulnerable to 'universal forgery' (where an attacker can sign any chosen message m) would be an example that fits this description. Since such insecure schemes can be constructed (or may exist due to flaws), the statement that they exist 'for some' schemes is TRUE.")

    print("Analysis of Option D:")
    print("D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.")
    print("This statement makes a claim about message recovery holding true for 'all' existentially forgeable schemes. This is incorrect. Firstly, signature schemes are not designed to hide the message `m`, which is a public input to the verification algorithm. Secondly, we can easily imagine a broken (and thus forgeable) scheme where the message is trivially recoverable from the signature. Because this property does not hold for 'all' schemes in the class, the statement is FALSE.")
