    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script to systematically find and count all true boolean expressions of exactly length 5.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Generate all possibilities:** I will create all possible strings of length 5 using the given symbols `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`.\n2.  **Filter and Evaluate:** For each generated string, I will perform the following steps:\n    *   Transform the string into a Python-evaluatable format. This involves replacing `T` with `True`, `F` with `False`, `&` with `and`, `|` with `or`, and `!` with `not`. The operator precedence in Python (`not`, `and`, `or`) matches the one specified in the problem (`!`, `&`, `|`).\n    *   Use a `try-except` block to safely evaluate the string. This will filter out any syntactically incorrect expressions.\n    *   If the expression evaluates successfully to the boolean value `True`, I will add it to a set to store all unique solutions.\n3.  **Classify and Count:** After finding all valid expressions, I will classify them based on their main operator structure (`(A)`, `!A`, `A&B`, `A|B`) to understand how the total number is formed.\n4.  **Display the Result:** Finally, I will print the count for each category and the final sum, showing the composition of the total number of true expressions, as requested.\n\nThis method is robust because it checks every single possibility, ensuring no valid expression is missed.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all true boolean expressions of length 5 using the specified symbols.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    valid_true_expressions = set()\n\n    # 1.
