    "Based on information from drug identification resources, I will provide a Python script to display the different numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule.\n2.  Identify the specific numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these numbers in variables.\n4.  The script will then print out each number, clearly stating which dosage it corresponds to.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_numbers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the numerical imprints for Teva brand\n    fluoxetine capsules at 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Imprint number for the 10mg capsule\n    imprint_10mg = 3105\n    \n    # Imprint number for the 20mg capsule\n    imprint_20mg = 3106\n    \n    # Print the results as requested\n    print(\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is:\")\n    print(imprint_10mg)\n    print(\"\\nThe number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is:\")\n    print(imprint_20mg)\n\nfind_imprint_numbers()\n```\n<<<The numbers are 3105 for the 10mg capsule and 3106 for the 20mg capsule.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
