    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating N (guaranteed correct guesses in the
    simultaneous scenario) and M (guaranteed correct guesses in the sequential
    scenario), and then finding their difference.

    The problem is interpreted as having 2 hat types, based on the phrasing
    "either black and yellow or blue and white".

    # For a 2-type problem, this is partitioning by even and odd indices.

    # One person speaks first. They can use their guess to encode information
    # about the hats they see. This information allows the other people (listeners)
    # to deduce their own hat color with 100% certainty.
    # The speaker is not guaranteed to be correct, but all listeners are.

    # --- Calculate the Difference ---
    difference = M - N
