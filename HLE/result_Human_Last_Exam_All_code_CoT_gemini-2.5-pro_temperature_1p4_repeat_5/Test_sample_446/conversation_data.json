    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor, we need to analyze their sequences.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Recognize the Core Motif:** Integrin receptors are famous for binding to a specific three-amino-acid sequence: RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). We'll first confirm that all options contain this motif.\n2.  **Evaluate Flanking Residues:** Since all choices contain 'RGD', the binding affinity and specificity are heavily influenced by the amino acids surrounding this core motif.\n3.  **Identify Known Binding Sequences:** We will reference well-known biological data. The sequence 'RGDSP', which is derived from the protein fibronectin, is a classic, high-affinity binding sequence for several integrin types (like α5β1 and αVβ3).\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will write a script to check which of the provided peptides contains this well-established 'RGDSP' motif. The peptide containing this sequence is the most likely to have been found to bind effectively in an in vitro assay.\n\nThe Python script below will simulate this process by checking the list of peptides against a \"database\" of known high-affinity motifs.\n\n```python\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of peptides to identify the one most likely to bind an integrin receptor.\n    \n    This is based on the principle that while the 'RGD' motif is essential,\n    flanking sequences are critical for high-affinity binding.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
