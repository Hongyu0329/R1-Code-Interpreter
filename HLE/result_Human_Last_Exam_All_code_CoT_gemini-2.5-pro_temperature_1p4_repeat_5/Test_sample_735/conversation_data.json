    "To find the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3, I will write a Python script to perform a systematic search.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define a Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including when `x` and `y` are the same element), their product `x*y` is not in `S`.\n2.  **Define Maximality**: A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the new set `S âˆª {g}` is no longer product-free.\n3.  **Systematic Search**: The script will iterate through a comprehensive list of non-isomorphic finite groups up to a reasonable order (e.g., order 12).\n4.  **Implementation**: For each group, the script will:\n    a. Generate all subsets of size 3.\n    b. Check if a subset is product-free.\n    c. If it is, check if it's maximal.\n    d. If a group contains at least one such set, it's added to a list of qualifying groups.\n5.  **Tooling**: The `sympy` library in Python will be used for group representations and operations.\n6.  **Final Count**: The script will output the total number of unique (non-isomorphic) groups found.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.groups import (\n    PermutationGroup,\n    CyclicGroup,\n    DihedralGroup,\n    SymmetricGroup,\n    AlternatingGroup,\n)\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.group_constructs import DirectProduct\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_3(group):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = group.elements\n    identity = group.identity\n\n    # A product-free set cannot contain the identity element, so we can search\n    # through non-identity elements.
