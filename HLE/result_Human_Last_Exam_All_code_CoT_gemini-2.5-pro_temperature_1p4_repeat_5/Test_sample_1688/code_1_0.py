# The problem statement describes a hypothetical scenario where an adversary has complete knowledge of a cryptographic system.
# This includes the protocol, the system architecture, and, crucially, the encryption keys.
# The core function of encryption is to make data unintelligible to anyone who does not possess the correct key.
# Let's represent this relationship:
# Ciphertext = Encrypt(Plaintext, Key)
# Plaintext = Decrypt(Ciphertext, Key)
# If an adversary knows the Ciphertext, the Decryption algorithm (which is part of the public protocol), and the Key, they can compute the Plaintext.
# All modern and theoretical cryptographic systems rely on the secrecy of the key.
# A: Quantum Encryption - Still requires a secret key.
# B: Fast Key Rotation - Mitigates damage, but doesn't secure data if the current key is known.
# C: Perfect Forward Secrecy - Protects past data, but not current data if the ephemeral session key is known.
# D: Quantum Key Distribution - Aims to prevent the key from being known in the first place. It doesn't help if the key is already known.
# E: Quantum Random OTP - The one-time pad (the key) must be secret. If it's known, the system is broken.
# F: This choice correctly states that if an adversary has complete knowledge, including the keys, security is theoretically impossible.
# The fundamental assumption of cryptography is that the key is secret. If that assumption is violated, security is lost.

# The correct choice is F.
print("If an adversary possesses the encryption key, along with the algorithm and the ciphertext, they have all the necessary components to reverse the encryption and retrieve the original plaintext.")
print("The other options describe methods to protect keys or limit the damage of a key compromise, but none can maintain security once a key is known.")
print("Therefore, maintaining security in a system where the encryption keys are known to the adversary is theoretically impossible.")
print("The correct choice is F.")
