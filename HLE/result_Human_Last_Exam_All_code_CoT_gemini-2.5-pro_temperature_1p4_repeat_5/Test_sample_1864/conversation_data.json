    "For a successful multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls. These controls ensure the instrument is set up correctly, compensation for spectral overlap is accurate, and gates for sorting are drawn correctly.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the essential controls you will need:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1):** This sample contains only the streptavidin beads without any fluorophores. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and helps in setting the voltage for the forward and side scatter channels, as well as defining the negative population in your fluorescence channels.\n\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5):** To correct for spectral spillover (where the signal from one fluorophore bleeds into another's detector), you need a separate control for each fluorophore used in your panel. Each of these controls will have beads stained with only one of the five fluorophores.\n\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate sort gates. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except* for one. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from all other fluorophores into the channel of interest, allowing for precise identification of the positive population. You will need one FMO control for each of the five channels you are analyzing.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of essential controls by summing these individual requirements.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of distinct fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    print(f\"Calculating controls for a {num_channels}-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
