    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the great icosahedron and what its \"outer-hull\" represents.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** The object in question is the great icosahedron, which is a non-convex star polyhedron.\n2.  **Understand \"Outer-Hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" or the set of \"visible triangles from the outside\" refers to the convex hull of the polyhedron. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points of the object.\n3.  **Determine the Convex Hull:** For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids.\n4.  **Analyze the Surface:** The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n5.  **Find the Minimal Triangulation:** The question asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate this surface. Since the surface is already made up of triangles, the minimal number is simply the number of faces on the icosahedron.\n6.  **Conclusion:** A regular icosahedron has 20 faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate its surface is 20.\n\nThe following Python code will state this conclusion and print the final number.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its \"outer-hull\",\n# or the shape visible from the outside, is its convex hull.\n# The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n# A regular icosahedron is a platonic solid whose surface is composed\n# of triangular faces. The task asks for the minimal number of triangles\n# to triangulate this surface. Since the surface is already made of triangles,\n# the answer is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\n# The number of faces on a regular icosahedron is a well-known property.\nnumber_of_triangles = 20\n\n# We form the final \"equation\" by simply stating the result.\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"The surface of a regular icosahedron consists of 20 triangles.\")\nprint(\"Final number of triangles needed: {}\".format(number_of_triangles))\n```\n<<<20>>>"
