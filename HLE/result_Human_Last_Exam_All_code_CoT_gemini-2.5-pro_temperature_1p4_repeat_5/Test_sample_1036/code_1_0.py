# The problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, ..., 100)
# such that n gives different remainders when divided by each of k = 2, 3, ..., 100.

# Let r_k = n mod k. The set R = {r_2, r_3, ..., r_100} must contain 99 distinct values.
# Through combinatorial analysis of the constraints 0 <= r_k < k, we found that
# the set of remainders R must be one of the 100 sets S_j = {0, 1, ..., 99} \ {j}
# for j = 0, 1, ..., 99.

# For each possible set of remainders S_j, we need to count the number of ways
# to assign them to r_2, ..., r_100. This is the number of bijections
# sigma: {2, ..., 100} -> S_j such that sigma(k) < k for each k.
# Let this count be C(S_j). Each such assignment corresponds to a unique n.

# The total number of solutions is the sum of C(S_j) over all possible j.
# We found that the number of assignments C(S_j) is given by:
# C(S_0) = 1
# C(S_1) = 1
# C(S_j) = 2**(j-1) for j = 2, 3, ..., 99.

# The total count is C(S_0) + C(S_1) + sum(C(S_j) for j=2 to 99).
c_s0 = 1
c_s1 = 1
sum_others = sum(2**(j - 1) for j in range(2, 100))

# The sum can be calculated as a geometric series:
# sum_{j=2}^{99} 2^(j-1) = 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^98
# This is equal to (2 * (2^98 - 1)) / (2 - 1) = 2^99 - 2.
calc_sum = 2**99 - 2

# Total number of solutions = c_s0 + c_s1 + calc_sum
total = c_s0 + c_s1 + calc_sum
