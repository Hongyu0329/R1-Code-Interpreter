# The C program is incorrect due to a mathematical error in its Taylor series implementation

# This Python script provides a more accurate calculation using floating-point
# arithmetic from the 'math' library and also calculates the memory usage of its variables.

# --- Inputs from the problem ---
angle_deg = 40
distance_m = 100

# --- Accurate Calculation ---
# 1. Convert angle from degrees to radians
angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)

# 2. Calculate the tangent of the angle
tangent_val = math.tan(angle_rad)

# 3. Calculate the height
height_m = distance_m * tangent_val

# --- Memory Calculation ---
# Calculate the memory size of each variable in bytes and sum them up for 'z'

    sys.getsizeof(angle_deg) +
    sys.getsizeof(distance_m) +
    sys.getsizeof(angle_rad) +
    sys.getsizeof(tangent_val) +
    sys.getsizeof(height_m)
)

# --- Output ---
# The accurate height 'o' is the calculated height rounded to the nearest integer.
height_o = round(height_m)

# Print the final equation with the value of each variable, as requested.
