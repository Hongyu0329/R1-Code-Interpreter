    "In this chess puzzle, my task is to find the best move for White.\n\n**Position:**\nFEN: `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`\n\n**My Step-by-Step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** I'll start by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses for both White and Black. White's most significant asset is the passed pawn on d6, which is very close to promotion. Black's queen on c5 is its most active piece, and its primary job is to stop that pawn.\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves:** I will consider several possible moves for White and determine their outcomes assuming optimal play from Black.\n    *   **Qxc5+**: A queen trade might seem good, but I'll analyze the resulting pawn endgame. If Black plays `...Kxc5`, White is losing. If Black plays `...bxc5`, it's a draw. Since Black will choose the best response, this move is not optimal.\n    *   **Other Queen Moves**: I'll look at moves that maintain the pressure.\n3.  **Identify the Winning Move:** The move `Qe2` appears to be the strongest. It creates a dual threat: attacking the weak c6-pawn and preparing to advance the d6-pawn. This concept is known as \"overloading\" the defending piece (in this case, Black's queen). I'll confirm that this move leads to a winning endgame for White by exploring Black's likely responses.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** Finally, I'll write a Python script that states and explains the winning move, fulfilling the user's request for a coded solution. The code will also explicitly output the number contained in the move notation, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The chess position is given by the FEN: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1.\n# White's goal is to capitalize on the advanced d-pawn.\n\n# A direct trade like 1. Qxc5+ leads to a losing or drawn endgame for White.\n\n# The winning move is 1. Qe2. This move is powerful because it overloads\n# the black queen. The queen on c5 cannot simultaneously defend the c6-pawn\n# and prevent the d6-pawn from advancing to d7.\n\n# This multi-pronged attack forces Black into a position where they will\n# lose material or allow a queen promotion, leading to a win for White.\n\n# Let's define the components of the move.\nwinning_move_piece = 'Q'\nwinning_move_destination = 'e2'\nwinning_move_number = 2\n\n# The final move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)\nfinal_move = winning_move_piece + winning_move_destination\n\nprint(\"Analysis complete. The best move has been identified.\")\nprint(f\"The optimal move for White is: {final_move}\")\nprint(f\"The number '2' in the final move '{final_move}' represents the rank the piece moves to.\")\n```\n<<<Qe2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
