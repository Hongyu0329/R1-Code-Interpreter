# The chess position is given by the FEN: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1.
# White's goal is to capitalize on the advanced d-pawn.

# A direct trade like 1. Qxc5+ leads to a losing or drawn endgame for White.

# The winning move is 1. Qe2. This move is powerful because it overloads
# the black queen. The queen on c5 cannot simultaneously defend the c6-pawn
# and prevent the d6-pawn from advancing to d7.

# This multi-pronged attack forces Black into a position where they will
# lose material or allow a queen promotion, leading to a win for White.

# Let's define the components of the move.
winning_move_piece = 'Q'
winning_move_destination = 'e2'
winning_move_number = 2

# The final move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN)
final_move = winning_move_piece + winning_move_destination
