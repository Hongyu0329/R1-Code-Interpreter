    "Of course. This is a classic example of a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction followed by an electrophilic quench. Here is a Python script that walks through the logic to determine the final product.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents:** I will identify the key functional groups on the starting molecule, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, and the roles of the reagents (sec-BuLi, TMEDA, and methyl iodide).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction in Step 1:** I will explain the principle of Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM). Both the amide and amino groups are directing groups. I'll determine the most likely site for deprotonation by the strong base (sec-BuLi) by considering the cooperative effect of these two groups.\n3.  **Determine the Reaction in Step 2:** I will describe how the organometallic intermediate formed in step 1 acts as a nucleophile and reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide.\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:** By combining the results of the two steps, I will construct the name of the final compound and print it. The script will explicitly state the numbers used in the final name as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of a two-step organic reaction\n    using chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Task: Identify the chemical compound ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with 1) sec-BuLi/TMEDA in THF, then 2) methyl iodide.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1: Lithiation with sec-BuLi and TMEDA]\")\n    print(\"Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\")\n    print(\"This molecule has two key functional groups on the benzene ring:\")\n    print(\"  - A N,N-diethylamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)2] at position 1.\")\n    print(\"  - A dimethylamino group [-N(Me)2] at position 3.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nReagents: sec-BuLi is a strong base, and TMEDA is a chelating agent.\")\n    \n    explanation_step1 = \"\"\"\n    These reagents perform a 'Directed ortho-Metalation' (DoM), where a proton\n    on the ring is removed. The position of removal is directed by the functional\n    groups, which are called Directing Metalation Groups (DMGs).\n\n    - The amide group at position 1 directs the base to remove a proton from either position 2 or 6.\n    - The amino group at position 3 directs the base to remove a proton from either position 2 or 4.\n\n    Both groups direct the reaction to position 2. This 'cooperative effect' makes the\n    proton at position 2 the most acidic. Therefore, the sec-BuLi selectively\n    removes the proton at position 2, replacing it with a lithium atom.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation_step1))\n    print(\"Intermediate formed: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Quench\n    print(\"[Step 2: Reaction with Methyl Iodide]\")\n    print(\"The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 1 is a strong nucleophile (a carbanion at position 2).\")\n    print(\"Methyl iodide (CH3I) is an electrophile.\")\n\n    explanation_step2 = \"\"\"\n    The nucleophilic carbon at position 2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group of\n    methyl iodide.
