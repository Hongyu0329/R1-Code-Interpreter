    This problem asks for the fundamental group of a specific topological space.
    Let's break down the construction of the space and identify its fundamental loops.

    1.  The space is constructed from two pairs of pants. A pair of pants is topologically a sphere with three holes.
    2.  Sewing the leg openings of one pair to the corresponding leg openings of the other creates a double torus (genus-2 surface) with two boundary components (the two waistbands).
    3.  Finally, these two waistbands are identified to a single point, which we'll call 'p'. This point 'p' is the base point for our loops.

    The fundamental group is the set of all non-equivalent loops starting and ending at 'p'. Let's identify the primary loops:
    - There are two "tunnels" created by sewing the leg openings.
    - There are two "bodies" corresponding to the two original pairs of pants.

    This structure gives rise to four independent loops:
    1.  A loop starting at 'p', going through the first pair of pants to encircle the first tunnel and returning. Let's call its generator 'g1'.
    2.  A loop starting at 'p', going through the first pair of pants to encircle the second tunnel and returning. Let's call its generator 'g2'.
    3.  A loop starting at 'p', going through the second pair of pants to encircle the first tunnel and returning. Let's call its generator 'g3'.
    4.  A loop starting at 'p', going through the second pair of pants to encircle the second tunnel and returning. Let's call its generator 'g4'.

    These four loops are independent. For example, a loop through the first pair of pants cannot be continuously deformed into a loop through the second pair of pants. A loop around one tunnel cannot be deformed into a loop around the other.

    Therefore, the fundamental group is the free group on four generators. Each generator corresponds to the group of integers, Z. The group operation is the free product, denoted by '*'.

    # The fundamental group is the free product of the groups of the four independent generators.
    # The final equation represents the structure of this group.

    print(f"Each generator corresponds to a copy of the integers, Z.")
    print(f"The resulting group is the free product of these four copies.")
    print(f"Final Answer Equation: {g1} * {g2} * {g3} * {g4}")
