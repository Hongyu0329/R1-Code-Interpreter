    # (a) Is the pair (g1, g2) irreducible?
    # No. The conditions for irreducibility are not always met. Reducibility occurs
    # under specific geometric conditions (U1=F2 or U2=F1), but it's possible
    # to construct pairs for which these conditions do not hold.

    # (b) Which of the following cause the reducibility?
    # For a (e1, e2)-stingray duo with d = e1 + e2, the vector space V decomposes as
    # V = U1 (+) U2. Under this condition, the group <g1, g2> is reducible if and
    # only if U1 is g2-invariant or U2 is g1-invariant.
    # U1 is g2-invariant <=> U1 is a subspace of F2, which implies U1 = F2 (dim match). This is (2).
    # U2 is g1-invariant <=> U2 is a subspace of F1, which implies U2 = F1 (dim match). This is (3).
    # Furthermore, the condition V = U1 (+) U2 implies that F1_intersect_F2 = {0},
    # so (1) cannot happen for a duo.
    # Therefore, reducibility is caused by (2) or (3).

    # The proportion of irreducible duos among all duos is P(irreducible | duo).
    # A duo is reducible if U1=F2 or U2=F1. Let A be U2=F1, B be U1=F2.
    # P(reducible) = P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersect B).
