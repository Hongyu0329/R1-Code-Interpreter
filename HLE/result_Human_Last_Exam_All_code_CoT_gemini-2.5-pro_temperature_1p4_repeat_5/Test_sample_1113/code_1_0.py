# The condition for the chain to lose contact is z_tip(t) = l_c.
# z_tip(t) = z_joint(t) + z_arm(t)
# z_joint(t) = (R * sin(alpha) * sin(omega*t) + R * sin(alpha)) + h * cos(alpha)
# z_arm(t) = r * (-sin(omega*t)*cos_alpha + (cos(omega*t)**2)*sin_alpha)
#
# Since omega = 1, t represents the angle theta. Let s = sin(t).
# The equation becomes a quadratic in s: a*s^2 + b*s + c = 0
# where:
# z_tip(s) = (R*sin_alpha*s + R*sin_alpha + h*cos_alpha) + r*(-s*cos_alpha + (1-s^2)*sin_alpha)
# (R*sin_alpha + h*cos_alpha + r*sin_alpha) + s*(R*sin_alpha - r*cos_alpha) - r*sin_alpha*s^2 = l_c
# a*s^2 + b*s + c_term = 0, where a, b, c_term are coefficients.

# Let's verify our coefficients lead to that.
# Multiply our equation by -1/a_coeff
# s^2 + (b_coeff/a_coeff)s + (c_coeff/a_coeff) = 0
# b_coeff/a_coeff = (R*s_a - r*c_a)/(-r*s_a) = -R/r + c_a/s_a = -10/0.25 + sqrt(3)/0.5 = -40 + 2*sqrt(3).
