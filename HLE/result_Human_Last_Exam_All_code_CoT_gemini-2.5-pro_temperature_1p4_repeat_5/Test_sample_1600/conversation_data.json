    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the specific mathematical sequence for `a(n)`. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams depends on the physical process. The numbers for the electron propagator (self-energy) and the photon propagator (vacuum polarization) are different.\n\n*   For the **electron propagator**, the sequence of the number of diagrams `a(n)` at order `2n` begins: **1, 2, 10, 74, ...** for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`\n*   For the **photon propagator**, the sequence begins: **1, 2, 8, 46, ...** for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`\n\nThe term \"electron or the photon propagators\" in the question is ambiguous. I will proceed with the sequence for the electron propagator, which is a canonical and widely cited example in QED. The problem asks for `a(3)`, which corresponds to the number of diagrams at order `2*3 = 6`. This value is the third term in the sequence.\n\nThe following Python code defines a function that contains these known values and retrieves `a(3)`.\n\n```python\ndef get_qed_propagator_diagrams_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator\n    in QED at order 2n. The values are from established calculations in physics.\n    The sequence a(n) corresponds to order 2n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary stores the known values for a(n) for the electron propagator.\n    # a(1) is for order 2, a(2) for order 4, a(3) for order 6, and so on.\n    known_values = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 10,\n        4: 74,\n        5: 706\n    }\n    \n    if n in known_values:\n        return known_values[n]\n    else:\n        return \"The value for the requested n is not available in this simplified lookup.\"\n\ndef solve_for_a3():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the value of a(3) for the given problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    order = 2 * n\n    result = get_qed_propagator_diagrams_count(n)\n    \n    print(f\"The problem asks for a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\")\n    print(f\"We are looking for a({n}), which corresponds to diagrams of order 2*{n} = {order}.\")\n    print(f\"Using the known sequence for the electron propagator, we find the result:\")\n    \n    # Final output showing the numbers in the equation\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_for_a3()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
