    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve this question, followed by the Python code.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the plot and characters of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The question asks to identify a specific character who expresses a particular sentiment: being ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves. This poignant detail is mentioned by one of the characters reflecting on their disconnection from Earth. I will go through the main characters: Kris, Hari, Snaut, Sartorius, and Gibarian. The statement is made in a video message left for the protagonist, Kris Kelvin. The character who recorded this message before his death is Dr. Gibarian.\n\nI will now write a Python script that will print out the question, the answer choices, and then select and print the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the answer to a trivia question\n    about the 1972 movie \"Solaris\".\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'E'\n    \n    print(\"Question:\")\n    print(question)\n    print(\"\\nAnswer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in answer_choices.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n        \n    # The character who says this is Dr. Gibarian, in the video message he leaves for Kris Kelvin.\n    # In his final testament, he reflects on humanity's purpose in space and expresses shame for not having appreciated simple, earthly things more.\n    \n    correct_character_name = answer_choices[correct_answer_key]\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe character ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is {correct_answer_key}: {correct_character_name}.\")\n\nsolve_solaris_question()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
