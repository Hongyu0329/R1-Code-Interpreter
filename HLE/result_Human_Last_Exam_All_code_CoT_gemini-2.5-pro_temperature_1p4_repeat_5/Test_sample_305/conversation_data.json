    "To determine the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we will use a computational approach. We will systematically generate all possible commutative operations and then test each one for the associative property.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the Set**: We will represent the set with 3 elements as `S = {0, 1, 2}`.\n2.  **Generate Commutative Operations**: A binary operation can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (Cayley table). For the operation to be commutative, this table must be symmetric. This means we only need to define the values for `x * y` where `x <= y`. For a set of size 3, this corresponds to 6 entries: `0*0`, `0*1`, `0*2`, `1*1`, `1*2`, and `2*2`. Since each result can be any of the 3 elements, there are a total of `3^6 = 729` unique commutative operations.\n3.  **Test for Associativity**: For each of the 729 commutative operations, we will check if it is also associative. The associative property states that `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all `x, y, z` in the set `S`. We will verify this for all `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` combinations of `(x, y, z)`.\n4.  **Count the Valid Operations**: A counter will be used to keep track of the number of operations that satisfy both commutativity and associativity.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# The size of the set\nn = 3\nelements = range(n)\n\n# A counter for operations that are both commutative and associative\nassociative_commutative_count = 0\n\n# A commutative operation on n elements is defined by the n*(n+1)/2 entries\n# on and above the main diagonal of its Cayley table.\nnum_defining_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n# Iterate through all 3^6 = 729 possible commutative operations.\n# Each 'op_values' tuple represents one unique commutative operation.\n# It specifies the results for (0*0, 0*1, 0*2, 1*1, 1*2, 2*2).\nfor op_values in itertools.product(elements, repeat=num_defining_entries):\n    \n    # Construct the full 3x3 Cayley table for the current operation\n    table = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    k = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            # Fill the upper triangle of the table from op_values\n            table[i][j] = op_values[k]\n            # Enforce commutativity by making the table symmetric\n            table[j][i] = op_values[k]\n            k += 1\n\n    # Check if the current operation is associative\n    is_associative = True\n    # We must check (x*y)*z == x*(y*z) for all x, y, z in the set\n    for x in elements:\n        for y in elements:\n            for z in elements:\n                # Calculate the left-hand side: (x*y)*z\n                xy_result = table[x][y]\n                lhs = table[xy_result][z]\n                \n                # Calculate the right-hand side: x*(y*z)\n                yz_result = table[y][z]\n                rhs = table[x][yz_result]\n                \n                if lhs != rhs:\n                    is_associative = False\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        if not is_associative:\n            break\n            \n    # If the operation was found to be associative, increment our counter\n    if is_associative:\n        associative_commutative_count += 1\n\nprint(f\"The total number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is: {associative_commutative_count}\")\n\n<<<24>>>"
