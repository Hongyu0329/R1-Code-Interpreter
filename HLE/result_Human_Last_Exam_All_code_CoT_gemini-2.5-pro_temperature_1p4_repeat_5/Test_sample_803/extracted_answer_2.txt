The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the generalized dihedral groups $\text{Dih}(A)$, where $A$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$. An abelian group $A$ of order $q^m$ is a direct product of cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_{q^{k_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q^{k_r}}$ where $\sum k_i = m$. The number of non-isomorphic choices for $A$ is the number of integer partitions of $m$. For each choice of $A$, the group $\text{Dih}(A) = A \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ (where the action is inversion, $a \mapsto a^{-1}$) is a solution.
