    1. The poem sets a scene of dead moths in a display case ('oval frame', 'inventory of eyes and dust'). This points to a scientific collection.
    
    2. 'caught behind silvered dislocation' describes the state of the moths as preserved specimens, trapped behind aged, tarnished glass and dislocated from life.
    
    3. The phrase in question comments on this situation:
       - 'discipline': This refers not to the moths' behavior, but to the scientific discipline (like entomology) responsible for their collection and preservation.
       - 'logic': The purpose or reasoning behind this discipline is to preserve the moths for study.
       - 'strange tarnished': This logic is described as 'strange' because it involves killing a creature to preserve it, and 'tarnished' because the preservation is flawed, leading to decay ('dust') and a loss of the creature's vitality.
       
    4. Conclusion: The phrase means that the scientific methodology for preserving specimens is inherently flawed because it results in a decayed, lifeless artifact, not a perfectly preserved creature. This directly matches choice B.
