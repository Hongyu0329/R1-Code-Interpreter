print("The incorrect statement is B because the historian R. A. Markus, a prominent Augustinian scholar,")
print("did not ignore Augustine's thoughts on predestination and grace when discussing freedom.")
print("In fact, these concepts are integral to his analysis of Augustine's 'asymmetrical' view of freedom,")
