# Plan:
# 1. Analyze each statement to determine its correctness based on principles of LLM inference.
# 2. Store the letters corresponding to the true statements.
# 3. Sort the letters lexicographically.
# 4. Print the final result as a comma-separated string.

# --- Analysis ---
# A: Correct. The final pool for sampling is the intersection of the sets of tokens selected by top-k and nucleus sampling. This intersection is by definition the most restrictive outcome.
# B: False. Beam search with beam width b=1 is equivalent to greedy decoding regardless of ties, assuming a deterministic tie-breaking rule (which is standard).
# C: Correct. Temperature τ > 1 flattens the probability distribution. This lowers the probabilities of the top tokens, meaning more tokens must be included to reach the cumulative probability threshold p.
# E: Correct. When a distribution is truncated and then re-normalized, the relative probability ratios of the remaining tokens are preserved. For any two remaining tokens i and j, their new ratio is (p_i/Z) / (p_j/Z) = p_i/p_j, where Z is the normalization constant.
# F: False. A counterexample can be constructed. If nucleus(p=0.9) selects a set with mass 0.91 (excluded mass 0.09), a top-k setting with a smaller k could select a set with mass 0.8 (excluded mass 0.2), violating the "can never exceed" clause.
# G: False. The order of operations matters. Applying nucleus sampling to a top-k filtered set (which is first re-normalized) is not the same as applying top-k to a nucleus-filtered set.
# H: False. Greedy decoding produces a single output (zero diversity). Beam search produces 'b' outputs, which represents an increase in diversity.
# I: False. Temperature τ < 1 makes the distribution sharper ("peakier"), which increases the likelihood of multiple beams following the same high-probability path and converging. It does not guarantee they will be different.
# J: False. Length normalization helps mitigate a model's bias towards shorter sequences but does not "completely eliminate" other issues like repetition or convergence, often termed the "beam curse".
# K: False. A repetition penalty selectively reduces the probability of specific tokens. Lowering temperature affects the entire distribution, typically making the most likely token even more likely. They are not equivalent.
# L: False. Nucleus sampling with p=1 considers the entire vocabulary. This is identical to standard multinomial sampling, irrespective of any ties in probabilities.
# M: False. In practice, high-performance computing libraries (e.g., cuDNN) use non-deterministic algorithms for operations like matrix multiplication on GPUs to improve speed. `torch.manual_seed()` alone is not sufficient to guarantee bit-for-bit determinism.
# O: Correct. Different GPU architectures (e.g., A100 vs. V100) have different hardware for floating-point operations. This can lead to small numerical differences that accumulate and can alter the final path taken by beam search.
# P: Correct. MoE models may drop tokens if an expert's capacity is exceeded. This process can be non-deterministic, leading to a different forward pass and different output logits across runs, which in turn affects the nucleus sampling set.
# Q: False. Even with deterministic routing and constant attention, non-deterministic floating-point arithmetic in other parts of the model (e.g., feed-forward layers) can lead to different outputs.
# R: Correct. Padding sequences to different lengths within a batch can change the dimensions of the tensors being processed. This can cause the GPU to use different underlying kernels or scheduling, leading to small numerical differences.
# S: False. The entropy of a mixture of distributions can be higher than the entropy of any individual component distribution.
# T: False. Quantization introduces errors that can alter the logits. This can, and often does, change the relative ranking of tokens, not just the effective probability mass.
# W: Correct. The final distribution from an MoE model is a mixture of the expert's output distributions. The entropy of a mixture is generally higher than the average entropy of its components. Higher entropy is analogous to a higher "effective temperature".
# X: Correct. The summation in the attention mechanism's softmax is not guaranteed to be performed in the same order on a parallel device like a GPU. Due to the non-associativity of floating-point addition, this leads to numerical differences.
# Y: Correct. Activation checkpointing saves memory by re-computing activations. This re-computation is another forward pass, which is subject to the same sources of numerical non-determinism as the original pass.
