    # Step 1 & 2: Determine the minimal possible cardinality of X.
    # The set X contains the cardinalities of all Maximal Almost Disjoint (MAD) families.
    # A cardinality kappa of a MAD family must satisfy omega_1 <= kappa <= 2^omega.
    # We want to find the minimal possible value for |X| across all consistent models of ZFC.
    # |X| is minimal if all MAD families have the same cardinality.
    # It is consistent with ZFC that the minimal cardinality of a MAD family ('a') is equal to 2^omega.
    # For example, if we take a model where the Continuum Hypothesis holds (2^omega = omega_1),
    # then any MAD family must have size omega_1. In this model, X = {omega_1}, so |X| = 1.
    # It is consistent (by Easton's theorem) to have a model where 2^omega = omega_1 and 2^(omega_1) = omega_3.
    # So, a model exists where |X| is 1. This is the minimum possible, since X cannot be empty.
    min_cardinality_of_X = 1

    # Step 3: Determine the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    # To maximize |X|, we need to maximize the number of distinct possible cardinalities for MAD families.
    # These cardinalities are between omega_1 and 2^omega.
    # The given assumption is 2^(omega_1) = omega_3.
    # Since omega < omega_1, it must be that 2^omega <= 2^(omega_1), so 2^omega <= omega_3.
    # To maximize the "room" for cardinalities, we should consider a model where 2^omega is as large as possible,
    # i.e., 2^omega = omega_3.
    # In such a model, the possible cardinalities of MAD families are a subset of the cardinals between omega_1 and omega_3.
    # These cardinals are {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}. There are 3 of them.
    # So, the maximum possible size of X is at most 3.
    # It is a known deep result in set theory (e.g., from constructions by Shelah) that it is consistent
    # with ZFC to have models where 2^omega = omega_3 and there exist MAD families of sizes
    # omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3 all in the same model.
    # In such a model, X = {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}, so |X| = 3.
    # This is therefore the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    max_cardinality_of_X = 3

    # Step 4: Calculate the difference.
    difference = max_cardinality_of_X - min_cardinality_of_X

    # Print the explanation and the final equation.
    print("This problem is about the possible number of different sizes of maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families.")
