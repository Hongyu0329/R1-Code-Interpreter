    """
    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning for solving the quantum logic problem.
    It demonstrates why choice C is the correct answer by applying principles of quantum logic
    to the given propositions.
    
    Propositions:
    a: momentum p is in [0, +1/6]
    b: position x is in [-1, 1]
    c: position x is in [-1, 3]
    
    Logical symbols:
    ∧ : AND (conjunction)
    ∨ : OR (disjunction)
    ¬ : NOT (negation)
    → : Implies
    ↔ : Is equivalent to
    ⊥ : False/Contradiction
    ⊤ : True/Tautology

    print("\nStep 1: Evaluate the relationships between propositions b and c.")
    print("  - Proposition 'b' (particle in [-1, 1]) is a more specific case of 'c' (particle in [-1, 3]).")
    print("  - Therefore, if 'b' is true, 'c' must be true. This means `b → c`.")
    print("  - From this, we can simplify the OR operation: `b ∨ c` is logically equivalent to `c`.")
    print("  - The right-hand side of the equivalence `a ∧ (b ∨ c)` simplifies to `a ∧ c`.")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluate conjunctions of position and momentum propositions (e.g., a ∧ c).")
    print("  - Proposition 'a' concerns momentum in the interval [0, +1/6].")
    print("  - Proposition 'c' concerns position in the interval [-1, 3].")
    print("  - The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states we cannot know both position and momentum perfectly.")
    print("  - A stronger result (the Paley-Wiener theorem) implies a quantum state cannot be confined to BOTH a finite position interval AND a finite momentum interval.")
    print("  - Therefore, the proposition `a ∧ c` (being in both bounded regions) is impossible.")
    print("  - In logic, an impossible proposition is a contradiction, denoted as `⊥` (False).")
    print("  - So, the entire right-hand side `a ∧ c` evaluates to `⊥`.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate the left-hand side of the equivalence `¬(a ∧ b) → (a ∧ c)`.")
    print("  - First, evaluate `a ∧ b`. For the same reason as in Step 2, `a ∧ b` is also impossible.")
    print("  - `a ∧ b = ⊥`.")
    print("  - We already know from Step 2 that `a ∧ c = ⊥`.")
    print("  - Substituting these into the expression gives: `¬(⊥) → ⊥`.")

    print("\nStep 4: Simplify the resulting expression `¬(⊥) → ⊥`.")
    print("  - `¬(⊥)` (negation of False) is `⊤` (True).")
    print("  - The expression becomes `⊤ → ⊥`.")
    print("  - Using the definition of material implication (`P → Q` is `¬P ∨ Q`), this is `¬⊤ ∨ ⊥`.")
    print("  - `¬⊤` is `⊥`, so the expression is `⊥ ∨ ⊥`, which evaluates to `⊥`.")
    print("  - So, the entire left-hand side evaluates to `⊥`.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final conclusion.")
    print("  - The left-hand side evaluates to `⊥`.")
    print("  - The right-hand side evaluates to `⊥`.")
    print("  - The full statement is `⊥ ↔ ⊥`.")
    print("  - Two statements that are both False are logically equivalent. Therefore, the expression is a tautology (`⊤`, True).")
    print("  - This makes statement C a universally true 'observable' within this logical framework.")
