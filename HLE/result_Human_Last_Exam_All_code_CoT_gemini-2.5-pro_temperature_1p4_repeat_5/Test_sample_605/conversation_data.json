    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau Link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted as c(X), for a Calabi-Yau threefold defined as a hypersurface in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$ is calculated using the formula:\n    $$ c(X) = \\frac{d^3}{\\prod_{i=1}^5 w_i} $$\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its weighted degree, `d`, must be equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient space. This is known as the Calabi-Yau condition. We are given the weights $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n3.  **Address the Polynomial:** The provided polynomial is $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$. For a polynomial to be quasi-homogeneous, all its monomial terms must have the same weighted degree. Checking the degrees of the terms with the given weights reveals that most terms have a degree of 225, but the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a degree of 224. This is very likely a typo in the problem statement. The calculation of the invariant does not depend on the specific form of the polynomial, but only on its degree `d` and the weights `w_i`. The Calabi-Yau condition ($d = \\sum w_i = 225$) and the degree of most terms confirm that the intended degree is $d = 225$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** We will substitute the values of the degree `d` and the weights `w_i` into the formula and simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n5.  **Python Script:** I will provide a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out each step of the process.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient projective space P^4(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The Calabi-Yau condition states that the degree d is the sum of the weights.\n    d = sum(weights)\n\n    # Numerator of the invariant formula is d^3.\n    numerator = d**3\n\n    # Denominator of the invariant formula is the product of the weights.\n    denominator = 1\n    for w in weights:\n        denominator *= w\n\n    # To simplify the fraction, find the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    simplified_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\n    simplified_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant is c(X) = d^3 / (w1 * w2 * w3 * w4 * w5)\")\n    print(f\"The weights are w = {tuple(weights)}\")\n    print(\"The degree d is the sum of the weights (Calabi-Yau condition):\")\n    weight_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"d = {weight_sum_str} = {d}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the numerator and denominator:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = d^3 = {d}^3 = {numerator}\")\n    weight_prod_str = \" * \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"Denominator = {weight_prod_str} = {denominator}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The invariant as a fraction is:\")\n    print(f\"c(X) = {numerator} / {denominator}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Simplifying the fraction gives the final result:\")\n    print(f\"c(X) = {simplified_numerator} / {simplified_denominator}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n<<<6075/62524>>>\n```"
