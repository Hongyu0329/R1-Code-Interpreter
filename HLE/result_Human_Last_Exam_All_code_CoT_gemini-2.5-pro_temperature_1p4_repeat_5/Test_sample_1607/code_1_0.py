  # Analysis of each statement:
  # A: False. Generators can have continuous spectra (e.g., momentum).
  # B1: False. The premise [τ,H]=0 is not physically realized for H=T+V.
  # B2: False. Incorrect scaling factors in the exponents.
  # C: False. The condition is both necessary and sufficient.
  # D: True. Follows from [τ,H]=0.
  # E: True. Definition of the angular momentum operator as a generator of rotations.
  # F: True. This is the statement of Noether's theorem in quantum mechanics.
  # G: True. Generators of unitary groups must be Hermitian. The premise is a tautology.
  # H: False. An unbounded operator can have a discrete spectrum (e.g., harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian).
  # I: True. Consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
  # J: True. Follows from [S,H]=0.
