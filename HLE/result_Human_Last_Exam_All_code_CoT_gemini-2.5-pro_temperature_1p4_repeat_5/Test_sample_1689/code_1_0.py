    # The clinical presentation strongly suggests allergic contact dermatitis from clothing (textile dermatitis).
    # Key clues are the onset of the rash after starting a new workout regimen (implying new clothes)
    # and the distribution of the rash (sparing the axillary vault, which points away from deodorant and towards clothing).

    # The question asks for the best next step in DIAGNOSIS.

    # Let's evaluate the choices:
    # A. Skin biopsy: An invasive procedure, not the first choice for a classic presentation of contact dermatitis.
    # B. KOH preparation: Tests for fungus. While a possibility in skin folds, the pattern is more classic for contact dermatitis.
    # C. Topical steroid: This is a TREATMENT, not a diagnostic test.
    # D. Patch test: This is the gold-standard test to confirm a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis and identify the specific allergen.

    # Therefore, the patch test is the most logical and appropriate next step to confirm the suspected diagnosis.
