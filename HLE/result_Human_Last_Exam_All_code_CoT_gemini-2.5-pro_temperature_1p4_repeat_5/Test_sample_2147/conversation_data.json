    "My plan is to first identify the historical context of Pavel Milyukov's statement. He was a prominent figure in early 20th-century Russia, and his criticisms were often directed at contemporary artistic and literary movements. The term \"X-Ys\" likely refers to a compound name for artists or writers of a specific school he disapproved of. I will create a Python script that stores the two parts of this name in variables, combines them, and prints the full term along with a brief explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term 'X-Y' denounced by Pavel Milyukov.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Russia,\n    # was a historian and politician who also wrote on culture.\n    # In a famous critique of contemporary modernist art movements, he accused them\n    # of being elitist, morbid, and detached from social reality.\n    \n    # The term 'X' in \"X-Ys\"\n    x = \"Symbolists\"\n    \n    # The term 'Y' in \"X-Ys\"\n    y = \"Decadents\"\n    \n    # The combined term\n    combined_term = f\"{x}-{y}\"\n\n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov denounced the artistic movements of his time, which he considered a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n    print(f\"The term X-Y he used refers to: {combined_term}\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_riddle()\n```\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
