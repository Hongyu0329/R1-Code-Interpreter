    "Answering this question requires combining a key theorem about partially ordered sets with a computational number theory problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question using poset theory:** The question asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains. According to the dual of Dilworth's Theorem (Mirsky's Theorem), a set can be partitioned into *k* antichains if and only if the longest chain it contains has a length of at most *k*. Therefore, the problem is to find the largest subset of `S = [1, 823564528378596]` that does not contain any chain of length 21.\n\n2.  **Connect chains to number properties:** In the divisor poset, a chain is a sequence `x_1, x_2, ..., x_m` where `x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_m`. This implies that `Ω(x_1) < Ω(x_2) < ... < Ω(x_m)`, where `Ω(x)` is the number of prime factors of `x` counted with multiplicity.\n\n3.  **Formulate a strategy:** A large set with no chain of length 21 can be constructed by taking the union of 20 \"layers\" `L_k = {x ∈ S | Ω(x) = k}`. A famous conjecture in combinatorics (the Erdos-Sperner property for this poset) states that the largest such set is indeed the union of the 20 most populated layers `L_k`.\n\n4.  **Reduce to a counting problem:** The task is now to find the sizes of all layers `|L_k|` for `k = 0, 1, ...`, identify the 20 largest, and sum their sizes. The maximum value for `k` is `floor(log2(823564528378596)) = 49`. This gives 50 layers in total (`L_0` to `L_49`). A more straightforward approach is to calculate the sizes of the `50 - 20 = 30` *least* populated layers, sum them, and subtract this sum from the total number `N = 823564528378596`.\n\n5.  **Identify the smallest layers:** The distribution of `|L_k|` is known to be small at the tails (for very small and very large *k*). `L_0` contains only the number 1, and the layers for `k` close to 49 will contain very few numbers. The 30 smallest layers are thus expected to be `L_0` and `L_21, L_22, ..., L_49`.\n\n6.  **Implement the computation:** The core of the solution is a function to compute `|L_k|` for a given `k` and `N`. This is a non-trivial number theory counting problem. It can be solved using a recursive algorithm with memoization (dynamic programming). This function will count the number of integers up to `N` with exactly `k` prime factors. The script will calculate the sizes of the 31 layers from the tails (`L_0` and `L_20` to `L_49`), identify the 30 smallest among them, and perform the final calculation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.
