    Analyzes the properties of the proposed Quaternion RoPE and identifies the true statements.

    The function evaluates each statement from A to N based on quaternion mathematics.
    It collects the letters corresponding to the true statements and prints them as a sorted string.

    # Analysis of each statement:
    # A) False. The inner product ⟨R_m(q), R_n(k)⟩ = ⟨q, R_{n-m}(k)⟩, which depends on q, k, and n-m, not just |m-n|.
    # B) False. Quaternion multiplication is not commutative, so the equality R_m(q)R_n(k) = R_{m+p}(q)R_{n+p}(k) doesn't hold.
    # C) True. The property R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}, essential for relative positioning, only holds if the rotation axis u is fixed for all positions.
    # D) False. The position m is a scalar, so this scheme encodes 1D relative positions, not 3D.
    # E) True. |R_m(v)| = |R_m| * |v|. Since R_m is a unit quaternion (|R_m|=1), the norm is preserved. |R_m(v)| = |v|.
    # F) True. Scalar multiplication is commutative and associative with quaternion multiplication, so R_m(αv) = R_m*(αv_q) = α*(R_m*v_q) = αR_m(v).
    # G) True. The rotation R_m is an isometry, which preserves inner products and thus orthogonality.
    # H) True. The composition R_m ∘ R_n corresponds to the quaternion product R_m * R_n, which equals R_{m+n}.
    # J) True. The expression is (R_m*R_n - R_n*R_m)v. Since R_m and R_n commute (they share the same rotation plane), the result is 0, which is a purely imaginary quaternion.
    # K) False. The real part of the rotated vector is a mix of all original components and is not preserved. Re(R_p*v) = v_0*cos(pθ) - <u,v_vec>*sin(pθ).
    # L) True. The 4x4 matrix for left multiplication by p=a+... has 'a' on its diagonal four times. For R_m, a=cos(mθ), so the trace is 4cos(mθ).
    # M) False. The commutator [R_m, R_n] is zero for any fixed axis u, not only for a specific one.
    # N) False. For a unit quaternion v, |R_m(v)| = |v| = 1 for all m. The limit is 1.
