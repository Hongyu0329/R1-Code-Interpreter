    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n**1. Initial Factorization**\n\nFirst, we express the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ in the form $H(s) = D_{0}^{-1}(s) N_{0}(s)$ by finding a common denominator for each row of $H(s)$.\n\n*   For the first row, $H_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, the least common denominator is $d_1(s) = s+1$. This gives the row vector $\\frac{1}{s+1}\\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n*   For the second row, $H_2(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, the least common denominator is $d_2(s) = s^2-1$. This gives the row vector $\\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nCombining these, we get an initial factorization with:\n$D_{0}(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N_{0}(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**2. Coprimality Check**\n\nA pair of polynomial matrices $(D, N)$ is left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. We only need to check this condition at the roots of $\\det(D_0(s))$.\n$\\det(D_0(s)) = (s+1)(s^2-1) = (s+1)^2(s-1)$. The roots are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nLet's form the matrix $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, we test the rank at $s=-1$:\n\\[\n[D_0(-1) \\quad N_0(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe second row is just -1 times the first row, so the rows are linearly dependent. The rank of this matrix is 1, not 2. Therefore, the factorization $(D_0, N_0)$ is **not** left coprime.\n\n**3. Extracting the Common Divisor**\n\nThe linear dependence at $s=-1$ (where Row 1 + Row 2 = 0) indicates a common left divisor containing the factor $(s+1)$. We can eliminate this common divisor using elementary row operations.\n\nLet's perform the unimodular operation $R_2 \\to R_2 + R_1$ on the matrix $[D_0(s) \\quad N_0(s)]$. The new second row is:\n$R'_2(s) = [s+1, s^2-1, (s-1)+2, s+1] = [s+1, (s+1)(s-1), s+1, s+1]$.\nAs we can see, every element in this new row is divisible by $(s+1)$. We can extract this common factor by replacing the new second row with $R''_2(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} R'_2(s) = [1, s-1, 1, 1]$.\n\nThis procedure gives us a new row-reduced matrix that represents the coprime factorization:\n$[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**4. Final Coprime Factorization**\n\nFrom the reduced matrix, we can identify the final coprime matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe can verify that this pair is indeed coprime by checking the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ at the roots of $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) - 0 = s^2-1$. The roots are $s=1$ and $s=-1$. At both points, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has a rank of 2, confirming the factorization is left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines these matrices using `sympy` and prints them.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbolic variable 's'\ns = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n# Define the left coprime matrices D(s) and N(s)\nD = sympy.Matrix([\n    [s + 1, 0],\n    [1, s - 1]\n])\n\nN = sympy.Matrix([\n    [s - 1, s + 1],\n    [1, 1]\n])\n\n# Print the results in a clear format\nprint(\"The left coprime factorization is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere D(s) is:\")\nsympy.pretty_print(D)\n\nprint(\"\\nAnd N(s) is:\")\nsympy.pretty_print(N)\n\n# Verify the result by calculating D^-1 * N\nH_calculated = D.inv() * N\nH_simplified = sympy.simplify(H_calculated)\n\nprint(\"\\nVerification: D(s)^-1 * N(s) simplifies to:\")\nsympy.pretty_print(H_simplified)\n\n# Also printing the original H(s) for comparison\nH_original = sympy.Matrix([\n    [(s - 1)/(s + 1), 1],\n    [2/(s**2 - 1), 0]\n])\nprint(\"\\nOriginal H(s):\")\nsympy.pretty_print(H_original)\n\n```\n<<<s**2 - 1>>>"
