    "Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, the palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass of the brain, which controls visceral functions and locomotion. The primary brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish like the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*) are the **giant fiber lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\n*   **Giant Fiber Lobes:** These are located at the very posterior end of the brain mass. They are responsible for initiating the powerful, all-or-nothing jet propulsion escape reflex by sending signals down giant axons to the mantle muscles.\n*   **Fin Lobes:** These are located posterolaterally (to the back and sides) of the palliovisceral lobe. They control the undulatory movements of the lateral fins, which the cuttlefish uses for stable, slow, and precise locomotion.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the giant fiber lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
