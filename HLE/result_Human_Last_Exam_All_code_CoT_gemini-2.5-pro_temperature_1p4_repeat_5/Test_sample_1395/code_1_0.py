# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A map of countries is a planar graph. By the Four-Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# The intricate borders of the Asian continent before 1991 required 4 colors.
chi_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before the dissolution (chi_before) was: {chi_before}")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# The dissolution created new states in Central Asia. We can find a subgraph that requires 4 colors.
# Uzbekistan is bordered by 5 countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan).
# These neighbors form a 5-cycle (an odd cycle). A central node (Uzbekistan) connected to an
# odd cycle of neighbors forms a wheel graph that requires 4 colors.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after the dissolution (chi_after) is: {chi_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
# This is the difference between the 'after' and 'before' chromatic numbers.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The incremental change delta_soviet = {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine the change in planarity, beta.
# A country map graph is planar by definition. The dissolution of a country into
# smaller countries is a graph operation that preserves planarity.
# Since the planarity of the Asian country graph did not change, beta = 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta is: {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
