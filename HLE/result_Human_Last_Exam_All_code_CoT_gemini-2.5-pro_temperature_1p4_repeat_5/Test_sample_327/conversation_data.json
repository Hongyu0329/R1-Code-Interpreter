    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can use a standard algorithm that converts a dyadic rational number into its corresponding Hackenbush stalk representation. This representation consists of a sequence of red and blue pieces stacked on top of each other. The value of such a stalk is given by the formula $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{s_k}{2^k}$, where $n$ is the number of pieces, and $s_k$ is $+1$ if the $k$-th piece from the ground is blue and $-1$ if it is red.\n\nMy plan is to implement an algorithm that finds this sequence of signs ($s_k$) for the given number.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Start with the target value, $x = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  Iteratively determine the color of each piece from the ground up. In each step `k`:\n    a. Determine the sign of the current value $x$. If it's positive, the $k$-th piece is Blue (sign = +1). If it's negative, the piece is Red (sign = -1).\n    b. Update the value for the next step using the formula: $x_{new} = 2 \\times x_{old} - \\text{sign}$.\n3.  Continue this process until the value becomes 0. The total number of iterations is the number of pieces required.\n4.  The script will print each step of the calculation and then construct the final equation, showing how the sum of the piece values equals the original fraction.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of red or blue pieces to represent a fraction in\n    Red-Blue-Hackenbush and displays the process.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 13\n    den = 16\n    \n    target_fraction = fractions.Fraction(num, den)\n\n    print(f\"Finding the Hackenbush representation for the number {target_fraction}.\")\n    print(\"The method is to find the sign sequence s_k for k=1, 2, ...\")\n    print(f\"such that {target_fraction} = s_1/2 + s_2/4 + s_3/8 + ...\\n\")\n\n    current_val = target_fraction\n    pieces = []\n    piece_count = 0\n\n    while current_val != 0:\n        piece_count += 1\n        \n        # Determine the sign and color for the current piece\n        if current_val > 0:\n            sign = 1\n            color = \"Blue\"\n        else:\n            sign = -1\n            color = \"Red\"\n        \n        pieces.append({'sign': sign, 'color': color})\n        \n        print(f\"Step {piece_count}:\")\n        print(f\"  Current value is {current_val}.
