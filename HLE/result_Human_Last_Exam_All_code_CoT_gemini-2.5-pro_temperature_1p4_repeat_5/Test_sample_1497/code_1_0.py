# The following code prints the solution based on the physical analysis of the violin waveform equation.

# 1. Identify the parameter group for each variation:
#    - Variation (1) sul ponticello: Affects string harmonic content -> ν -> group ii
#    - Variation (2) bridge mute: Affects body resonance -> a_m, f_m. A mute damps higher frequencies -> group iv
#    - Variation (3) helium: Affects speed of sound, thus air resonance frequencies -> f_m -> group iii
#    - Variation (4) different start note: The start frequency F is changed -> group i
groups = ['ii', 'iv', 'iii', 'i']

# 2. Identify the direction of change for the last parameter of the group for variation (2).
#    - Variation (2) corresponds to group iv: (μ, a_2, f_2). The last parameter is f_2.
#    - A mute adds mass to the bridge, which lowers its resonant frequency.
direction = 'down'

# 3. Combine the parts into the final answer string.
# The phrase "output each number in the final equation" means to print the
# components of the final answer string, including the Roman numerals.
final_answer_string = ",".join(groups) + "," + direction

# 4. Print the final result.
print(final_answer_string)
