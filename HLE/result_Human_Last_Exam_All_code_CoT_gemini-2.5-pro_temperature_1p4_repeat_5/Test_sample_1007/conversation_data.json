    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the definition of each ballet step provided in the answer choices. The key is to determine if the leg configuration, including which foot is in front, is the same at the beginning and the end of the movement.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** An *entrechat* is a jump where the feet cross in the air. The number indicates the number of crossings. An even-numbered *entrechat* (like two, four, or six) starts in fifth position and lands in fifth position **with the same foot in front**. Therefore, the start and end positions are identical.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word *changé* means \"changed\". This step starts in fifth position, opens to second, and closes back to fifth position, but with the **opposite foot in front**. The position changes.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble\". The dancer slides one foot out, jumps, and brings the legs together in fifth position. In a standard assemblé that travels (e.g., *assemblé dessus*), the foot that starts in back will land in front. The position changes.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding step where *derrière* means \"behind\". Starting from fifth, the back foot leads, and the front foot closes *behind* it. This changes which foot is in front.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative jump. While it can be performed in various ways, the standard school version ends with the feet having switched places from their starting fifth position. The position changes.\n\nBased on this analysis, *Entrechat six* is the only step that finishes in the same position it started. The following Python code will programmatically find and print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'position_change': False,\n            'description': 'Starts and ends in fifth position with the same foot in front.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'position_change': True,\n            'description': 'Ends with the opposite foot in front (due to \\'changé\\').'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Assemblé',\n            'position_change': True,\n            'description': 'Typically changes which foot is in front when traveling.'\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Glissade derrière',\n            'position_change': True,\n            'description': 'The front foot closes behind, changing the position.'\n        },\n        'E': {\n            'name': 'Gargouillade',\n            'position_change': True,\n            'description': 'Typically results in the feet switching their front/back placement.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_letter = None\n    \n    print(\"Finding the ballet step with the same start and end leg position:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for letter, info in steps_data.items():\n        if not info['position_change']:\n            correct_answer_letter = letter\n            print(f\"Correct Answer Found: [{letter}] {info['name']}\")\n            print(f\"Reason: {info['description']}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Analyzed: [{letter}] {info['name']}\")\n            print(f\"Reason: Position changes. {info['description']}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    if correct_answer_letter:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The only step that ends in the same leg position as it started is '{steps_data[correct_answer_letter]['name']}'.\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
