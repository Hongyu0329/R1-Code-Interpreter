    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional infinite potential well (a \"1D box\"). This probability is determined by the particle's wavefunction, ψ(x).\n2.  **State the Formula:** The probability (P) of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is calculated by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval:\n    P = ∫ |ψₙ(x)|² dx (from x₁ to x₂)\n3.  **Define the Wavefunction:** For a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wavefunction is:\n    ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n    This means the probability density function is:\n    |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)\n4.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   Quantum number: n = 2\n    *   Interval start: x₁ = 0.495a\n    *   Interval end: x₂ = 0.505a\n5.  **Set up the Integral:** The integral we need to solve is:\n    P = ∫ (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx (from 0.495a to 0.505a)\n6.  **Solve Using Python:** This integral can be solved analytically, but it's more efficient and less error-prone to use numerical integration.\n    *   For the calculation, we can set the box length `a = 1`. The `a` terms will cancel, yielding a dimensionless probability value, which is correct. The interval then becomes 0.495 to 0.505.\n    *   I will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is a powerful tool for numerical integration in Python.\n    *   The final script will define the constants, set up the probability density function, perform the integration, and print the result along with the equation being solved.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the constants for the problem.\nn = 2\nx1_factor = 0.495\nx2_factor = 0.505\n\n# For the numerical calculation, we can set the length of the box 'a' to 1.\n# The result is a dimensionless probability, as the 'a' dependence cancels out.\na = 1.0\nx1 = x1_factor * a\nx2 = x2_factor * a\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function |ψ(x)|² as a Python function.\n# The function is (2/a) * sin²(n*pi*x/a).\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# 3. Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad.\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error. We only need the result.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Print the final result, showing the equation being solved as requested.\nprint(f\"The probability (P) is found by integrating the probability density function |ψ_n(x)|².\")\nprint(f\"For n={n}, the integral to solve is:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1_factor}a to {x2_factor}a of (2/a) * sin²({n}πx/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nAfter performing the integration, the result is:\")\nprint(f\"Probability = {probability}\")\n\n```\n<<<6.579737424684941e-06>>>"
