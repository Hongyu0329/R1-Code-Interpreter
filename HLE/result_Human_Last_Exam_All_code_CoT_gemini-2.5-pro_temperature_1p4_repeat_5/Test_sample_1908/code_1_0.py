    This function solves the mathematical problem regarding the minimal number of complements for a topology.

    Problem Summary:
    Let X be a set of cardinality c (the continuum) and T be a topology on X, where T is neither trivial nor discrete.
    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology on X.
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {emptyset, X}.
    The goal is to find the minimum possible number of complements that T can have.

    Reasoning:
    The solution constructs a specific topology T on X and demonstrates that it has exactly one complement.
    This proves that the minimum possible number of complements is at most 1.
    Since a topology with complements must have at least one, the minimum number is exactly 1.

    The chosen topology is the "included point topology" T_a for a fixed point a in X.
    T_a = {U subset X | a is in U} U {emptyset}.
    This topology is neither trivial nor discrete.

    Its unique complement S_a is found to be:
    S_a = P(X \ {a}) U {X} (the power set of X without point 'a', plus the set X itself).

    1. T_a intersect S_a = {emptyset, X} because any non-trivial set in S_a does not contain 'a',
       while any non-trivial set in T_a must contain 'a'. The only set in S_a containing 'a' is X.

    2. T_a U S_a generates the discrete topology because every singleton set {x} is open
       in the generated topology:
       - If x = a, {a} is in T_a.
       - If x != a, {x} is in S_a.

    Since a valid topology with exactly one complement has been found, the minimum possible number of complements is 1.
