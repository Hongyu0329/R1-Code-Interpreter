    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g - 4$.\n\n2.  **Recall the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M^n$ and $N^m$ that admit a Riemannian metric of non-positive sectional curvature, the simplicial volume of their product is:\n    $\\|M^n \\times N^m\\| = \\binom{n+m}{n} \\|M^n\\| \\|N^m\\|$\n    where $\\binom{n+m}{n}$ is the binomial coefficient. A surface $\\Sigma_g$ admits a hyperbolic metric (and thus a non-positive curvature metric) if and only if its genus $g > 1$.\n\n3.  **Apply these formulas to the specific case.**\n    *   Our surfaces are $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. Since both genera (31 and 17) are greater than 1, they both admit hyperbolic metrics, and the product formula can be used.\n    *   The dimension of each surface is 2, so $n=2$ and $m=2$.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the simplicial volume of each surface:\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n    *   Next, we'll calculate the binomial coefficient:\n        *   $\\binom{n+m}{n} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n    *   Finally, we multiply these values together to find the total simplicial volume.\n        *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# The dimension of any surface is 2\nn = 2\nm = 2\n\n# Calculate the simplicial volume of the first surface, ||Sigma_31||\n# The formula for a surface with genus g > 1 is 4g - 4\nsv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\n\n# Calculate the simplicial volume of the second surface, ||Sigma_17||\nsv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n)\n# For this case, it is C(2+2, 2) = C(4, 2)\nbinomial_coeff = math.comb(n + m, n)\n\n# Calculate the final simplicial volume of the product space\n# ||Sigma_31 x Sigma_17|| = C(4, 2) * ||Sigma_31|| * ||Sigma_17||\ntotal_sv = binomial_coeff * sv1 * sv2\n\n# Print the final equation with all intermediate values\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_31 x Sigma_17 is calculated using the product formula:\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_31 x Sigma_17|| = C({n+m}, {n}) * ||Sigma_{g1}|| * ||Sigma_{g2}||\")\nprint(f\"First, ||Sigma_{g1}|| = 4*{g1} - 4 = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"Second, ||Sigma_{g2}|| = 4*{g2} - 4 = {sv2}\")\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient C({n+m}, {n}) is {binomial_coeff}.\")\nprint(f\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\nprint(f\"Result = {binomial_coeff} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
