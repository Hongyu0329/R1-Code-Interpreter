    Finds a connected group of stones and its liberties starting from a given coordinate.
    
    This function uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all stones of the same
    color connected to the starting stone, and all adjacent empty points (liberties).

    Args:
        r (int): The starting row (1-19).
        c (int): The starting column (1-19).
        board (dict): A dictionary representing the board state, mapping (row, col) to 'B' or 'W'.
        visited (set): A set of coordinates that have already been visited to avoid redundant searches.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - set: The coordinates of all stones in the found group.
            - set: The coordinates of all liberties for this group.
