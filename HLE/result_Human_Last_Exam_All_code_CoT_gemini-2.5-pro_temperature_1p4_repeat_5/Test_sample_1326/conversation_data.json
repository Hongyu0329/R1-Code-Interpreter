    "Of course, I can help you solve this problem. Here is my plan to calculate the integral:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The problem asks for the definite integral of a piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n    *   For $0 \\le x \\le 3$, $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$.\n    *   For $3 \\le x \\le 5$, $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+ \\cos x}$.\n2.  **Split the Integral:** Since the function definition changes at $x=3$, we must split the integral into two parts:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+ \\cos x} dx $$\n3.  **Evaluate Part 1:** The first integral is a simple polynomial integral:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{16} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - 0 = \\frac{81}{16} = 5.0625 $$\n4.  **Evaluate Part 2:** The second integral can be solved analytically. We can simplify the term $\\frac{1+\\sin x}{1+\\cos x}$ using half-angle identities, which reveals that the integrand is of the special form $e^x(f(x) + f'(x))$, where $f(x) = \\tan(x/2)$. The antiderivative of this form is $e^x f(x)$.\n    $$ \\int \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+ \\cos x} dx = \\int e^x \\left(\\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right) dx = e^x \\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) $$\n    Evaluating the definite integral from 3 to 4:\n    $$ \\left[ e^x \\tan\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\right]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5) $$\n5.  **Sum the Parts:** The total integral is the sum of the results from Part 1 and Part 2.\n    $$ \\text{Total Integral} = 5.0625 + (e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)) $$\n6.  **Code the Solution:** I will now write a Python script to compute the numerical value of this expression. The script will calculate each part separately, then add them together, and print the final equation with all the computed values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the first part of the integral\n# Integral from 0 to 3 of (2*x^3)/8 dx = [x^4 / 16] from 0 to 3\nintegral_part1 = (3**4) / 16\n\n# Calculate the second part of the integral\n# The integral of e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) is e^x * tan(x/2)\n# We evaluate this from 3 to 4. Note that math.tan expects radians.\nterm1_part2 = math.exp(4) * math.tan(4 / 2) # e^4 * tan(2)\nterm2_part2 = math.exp(3) * math.tan(3 / 2) # e^3 * tan(1.5)\nintegral_part2 = term1_part2 - term2_part2\n\n# Calculate the total integral\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of two parts, split at x=3.\")\nprint(f\"Part 1: The integral from 0 to 3 evaluates to {integral_part1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Part 2: The integral from 3 to 4 evaluates to {integral_part2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1:.4f} + ({integral_part2:.4f}) = {total_integral:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4596>>>"
