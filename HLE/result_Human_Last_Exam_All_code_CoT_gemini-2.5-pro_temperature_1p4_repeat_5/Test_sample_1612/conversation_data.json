    "To determine the total number of MLB batting Triple Crown winners, we need to count the instances in both the American League (AL) and the National League (NL) and then sum them up. A player wins the batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in the same season.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a list containing all the instances of a player winning the Triple Crown, including their name, year, and league.\n2.  Count the number of winners from the American League.\n3.  Count the number of winners from the National League.\n4.  Add these two counts together to get the total number of Triple Crown wins in MLB history.\n5.  Print the breakdown and the final equation showing the sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crowns():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the number of times the MLB batting Triple Crown has been won.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data source: A comprehensive list of MLB Batting Triple Crown winners.\n    # A player wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.\n    triple_crown_instances = [\n        # American League Winners\n        {\"year\": 1909, \"name\": \"Ty Cobb\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1933, \"name\": \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1934, \"name\": \"Lou Gehrig\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1942, \"name\": \"Ted Williams\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1947, \"name\": \"Ted Williams\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1956, \"name\": \"Mickey Mantle\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1966, \"name\": \"Frank Robinson\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1967, \"name\": \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        {\"year\": 2012, \"name\": \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"league\": \"AL\"},\n        \n        # National League Winners\n        {\"year\": 1878, \"name\": \"Paul Hines\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1894, \"name\": \"Hugh Duffy\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1922, \"name\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1925, \"name\": \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1933, \"name\": \"Chuck Klein\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n        {\"year\": 1937, \"name\": \"Joe Medwick\", \"league\": \"NL\"},\n    ]\n\n    al_count = sum(1 for winner in triple_crown_instances if winner['league'] == 'AL')\n    nl_count = sum(1 for winner in triple_crown_instances if winner['league'] == 'NL')\n    total_count = len(triple_crown_instances)\n\n    print(\"Counting the MLB Batting Triple Crown winners by league:\")\n    print(f\"American League winners: {al_count}\")\n    print(f\"National League winners: {nl_count}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal number of Triple Crown wins in MLB history is the sum of both leagues:\")\n    print(f\"{nl_count} + {al_count} = {total_count}\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crowns()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
