    "The user is asking to identify the product of a chemical reaction.\n\n**1. Reaction Analysis:**\nThe reaction is between 1,3-butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a substituted alkene, the dienophile). This is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Diene:** 1,3-butadiene (`CH2=CH-CH=CH2`)\n*   **Dienophile:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (`CF2=CCl2`)\n\n**2. Mechanism:**\nIn this reaction, a new six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative) is formed. Three pi bonds (two from the diene, one from the dienophile) are broken, and two new sigma bonds and one new pi bond are formed.\n\n**3. Regiochemistry:**\nBecause the dienophile is unsymmetrical (`CF2` on one side, `CCl2` on the other), two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) can be formed. The outcome depends on which end of the diene attacks which end of the dienophile.\n\n*   **Product A:** Forms `4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene`.\n*   **Product B:** Forms `4,4-difluoro-5,5-dichlorocyclohexene`.\n\nThe major product is typically determined by electronic effects, specifically the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. In `CF2=CCl2`, the LUMO is predicted to have a larger coefficient on the carbon atom bearing the two chlorine atoms. Therefore, the reaction is expected to favor the formation of the product where the terminal carbons of the diene bond to align with this orbital preference, leading to one major product.\n\n**4. Plan:**\nI will provide a Python script that uses the cheminformatics library RDKit to model this reaction. The script will:\n1.  Define the reactant molecules using their SMILES representation.\n2.  Define the general Diels-Alder reaction using SMARTS.\n3.  Execute the reaction to generate all possible products (the two regioisomers).\n4.  Calculate the molecular formula for the reactants and products to display the balanced reaction equation.\n5.  For each product isomer, print its structure (as a SMILES string) and its IUPAC name.\n6.  Indicate the major product based on the regioselectivity rules.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the RDKit library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install rdkit\")\n    exit()\n\ndef predict_diels_alder_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the product(s) of the Diels-Alder reaction between\n    1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
