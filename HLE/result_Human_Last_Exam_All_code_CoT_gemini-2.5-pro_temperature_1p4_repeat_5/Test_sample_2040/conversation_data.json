    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to analyze their physical properties. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The key requirement for a material to exhibit this effect in its bulk form is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion, i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that formalizes this analysis. The script will:\n1.  Define the material in question (boron nanosheets).\n2.  State the known crystallographic symmetry of its common, stable forms (centrosymmetric).\n3.  Check this property against the requirement for SPDC.\n4.  Print a step-by-step conclusion based on the physical principles. The relevant \"equation\" here is that the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is 0 for centrosymmetric materials.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_spdc_potential():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential for a material to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    based on its crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define material and its known properties\n    material_name = \"Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\"\n    \n    # Common, stable phases of free-standing borophene are known to have a crystal\n    # structure with a center of inversion.\n    crystal_symmetry = \"Centrosymmetric\"\n\n    # Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n    # The strength of this effect is determined by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, χ⁽²⁾.\n    # For a material to exhibit a bulk second-order effect, it must be non-centrosymmetric.\n    # In a centrosymmetric material, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ tensor is entirely zero by symmetry.\n    chi_2_value_for_centrosymmetric = 0\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    print(f\"Analysis for: {material_name}\")\n    print(\"=\" * 40)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the physical requirement for SPDC.\")\n    print(\"  - SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect.\")\n    print(\"  - A non-zero bulk second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is required.\")\n    print(\"  - This requires the material's crystal structure to be non-centrosymmetric.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Determine the relevant property of {material_name}.\")\n    print(f\"  - Common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are {crystal_symmetry}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Apply the physical principle.\")\n    if crystal_symmetry == \"Centrosymmetric\":\n        print(f\"  - For a {crystal_symmetry} material, the governing equation for the bulk second-order susceptibility is:\")\n        print(f\"    χ⁽²⁾ = {chi_2_value_for_centrosymmetric}\")\n        print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n        print(\"Because the common forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order\")\n        print(\"nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.
