    "To answer this question, I will retrieve the specific anatomical information from my knowledge base, which is based on paleontological studies of *Irritator challengeri*. I will then create a Python script that stores this number in a variable and prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The scientific literature describing the skull of Irritator challengeri,\n# specifically the paper by Sues et al. (2002), notes the features of the lacrimal bone.\n# This script stores and prints the number of depressions found within the lacrimal recess.\n\n# Number of depressions in the lacrimal recess\nnum_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the result in a descriptive sentence.\nprint(f\"The number of depressions the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains is: {num_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
