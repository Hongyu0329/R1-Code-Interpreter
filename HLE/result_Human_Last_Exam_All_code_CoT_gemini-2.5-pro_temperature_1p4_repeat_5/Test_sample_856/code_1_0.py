# The main argument
# A finite group G can be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold only if
# all of its abelian subgroups are cyclic.
# This implies that for any odd prime p, the Sylow p-subgroups of G must be cyclic.
#
# Let's check this for a group G of order 10!.
# The order of a Sylow 5-subgroup of G is 5^2 = 25.
# A group of order p^2 (for a prime p) is always abelian.
# There are only two groups of order 25: the cyclic group C_25 and the direct product C_5 x C_5.
# If the Sylow 5-subgroup is C_5 x C_5, it is an abelian subgroup that is not cyclic.
# This would violate the condition, so G could not be a fundamental group of a 3-manifold.
#
# Therefore, for a group G of order 10! to be a candidate, its Sylow 5-subgroup must be cyclic (C_25).
#
# A key, non-trivial result from group theory is that no group of order 10! can have a cyclic Sylow 5-subgroup.
# To illustrate why this is plausible, consider the symmetric group S_10, which has order 10!.
# A Sylow 5-subgroup of S_10 can be generated by two disjoint 5-cycles, for example,
# a = (1 2 3 4 5) and b = (6 7 8 9 10).
# Since these permutations are disjoint, they commute, and the subgroup they generate is C_5 x C_5, which is not cyclic.
# While other groups of order 10! exist, it turns out that none of them possess a cyclic Sylow 5-subgroup.
#
# Since any group of order 10! must contain a non-cyclic abelian subgroup (namely, a Sylow 5-subgroup
# isomorphic to C_5 x C_5), no group of order 10! can be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.
#
# Therefore, the number of such manifolds is 0.
