    "This sequence is quite complex and does not follow a single, simple mathematical rule throughout. There are several possible interpretations for the pattern. One of the simplest interpretations that applies to some elements in the sequence is adding the sum of the digits of the current number to get the next number.\n\nFor example:\n- The first number is 1014. The sum of its digits is 1+0+1+4 = 6. The next number is 1014 + 6 = 1020. This matches the sequence.\n- Another number in the sequence is 1584. The sum of its digits is 1+5+8+4 = 18. The next number is 1584 + 18 = 1602. This also matches the sequence.\n\nAlthough this rule is not consistent for all elements, it is a common type of pattern in such puzzles. I will apply this rule to find the next number after 2352.\n\n1.  **Start with the last number:** 2352\n2.  **Calculate the sum of its digits:** 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12\n3.  **Add the sum to the last number:** 2352 + 12 = 2364\n\nThe next number in the sequence is 2364.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the sum of the digits\n    of the last number to itself.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_number = 2352\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the digits of the last number\n    s = str(last_number)\n    digits = [int(d) for d in s]\n    digit_sum = sum(digits)\n    \n    # Calculate the next number\n    next_number = last_number + digit_sum\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    # \"2352 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 2364\"\n    equation_parts = [str(last_number), \" + \"]\n    equation_parts.extend([d + \" + \" for d in s])\n    # remove the last \" + \"\n    equation_str = \"\".join(equation_parts)[:-3]\n    equation_str += f\" = {next_number}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The last number is {last_number}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of its digits is {' + '.join(s)} = {digit_sum}.\")\n    print(f\"The next number is calculated as: {last_number} + {digit_sum} = {next_number}.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\nsolve()\n<<<2364>>>\n```"
