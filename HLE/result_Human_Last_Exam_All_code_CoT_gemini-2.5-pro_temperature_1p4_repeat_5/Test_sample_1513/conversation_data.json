    "This is a geographical trivia question that I can solve by breaking down the clues provided.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues**: I will identify the key geographical and naming constraints from the user's question.\n    *   It's an island town.\n    *   It's extremely remote (more than 500 km from another inhabited island).\n    *   It's situated on a bay.\n    *   This bay was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town, the bay, and the caldera all share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates**: I will consider some of the world's most remote inhabited islands and check if they fit all the criteria.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is extremely remote. However, it is not on a bay named after the town, nor is the town situated directly in a caldera.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: This island is volcanic and extremely remote (the nearest inhabited land, the Pitcairn Islands, is over 2,000 km away). The main town is Hanga Roa, which sits on Hanga Roa Bay. The bay is nestled between two of the island's main volcanoes, Terevaka and Rano Kau. This fits all the clues.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Answer**: Based on the evaluation, Hanga Roa on Easter Island is the correct answer. The town is Hanga Roa, on Hanga Roa Bay, on the remote volcanic island of Rapa Nui.\n\nI will now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
