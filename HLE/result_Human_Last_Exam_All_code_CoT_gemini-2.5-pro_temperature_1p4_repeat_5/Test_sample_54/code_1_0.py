#
# Step 1: Analyze the computational model (Transformer with float activations).
# A transformer that processes an input of length 'n' has a number of parameters
# and computational steps that are polynomial in 'n'.
# The activations and weights are floating-point numbers, which have a fixed precision (e.g., 32 or 64 bits).
#
# Step 2: Relate the model to Boolean circuits.
# Any function that uses a fixed number of arithmetic operations on fixed-precision numbers
# can be simulated by a Boolean circuit.
# The size of the simulating circuit is polynomial in the number of operations and the precision of the numbers.
# Since the transformer's size is poly(n) and precision is constant, the resulting circuit's size is also poly(n).
#
# Step 3: Identify the corresponding complexity class.
# A formal language is in the class P/poly if there exists a family of circuits {C_n},
# where each C_n has a size polynomial in 'n', such that C_n decides the language for all inputs of length 'n'.
# This exactly matches our situation. The trained transformer for a given input length 'n'
# can be compiled into the circuit C_n.
#
# Step 4: Final Conclusion.
# The upper bound on the circuit complexity class for the described models is P/poly.
# The details "average-hard-attention" and "saturated" activations do not grant computational
# power beyond this class, as they are still implementable within this framework.

# Final Answer:
complexity_class = "P/poly"

# The problem asks to output the final "equation". In this context, it refers to the name of the complexity class.
# There are no numbers in this symbolic answer, so we print the symbols that form the name.
print(f"The complexity class is: {complexity_class}")
