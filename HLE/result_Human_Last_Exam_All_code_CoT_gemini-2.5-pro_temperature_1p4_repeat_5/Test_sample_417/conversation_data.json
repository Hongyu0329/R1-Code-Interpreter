    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure for symmetry and count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule's name indicates a central benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, and three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry means the three large arms are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the signals from the central methyl groups and add them to the signals from a single arm.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The three methyl groups on the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single peak.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm:** We will analyze one `[((4S,7R)-...)-methyl]` arm to count its unique proton signals.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-) Linker:** This group connects the central ring to the large heterocyclic substituent. This substituent is chiral. Protons in a -CH2- group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent, giving two separate signals.\n    *   **Chiral Moiety:** The `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` group is a rigid, chiral structure derived from camphor. Due to its rigidity and lack of internal symmetry, we expect protons that are not interchangeable through bond rotation to be chemically distinct.\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor-derived skeleton. They are all in different chemical environments (one bridgehead, two gem-dimethyl) and will produce three distinct signals.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The indazole system contains a pyrazole ring, which has one C-H proton. This will produce one signal.\n        *   **Saturated Skeleton Protons:** The remaining bicyclic frame contains a bridgehead C-H group (one signal) and two -CH2- groups. The two protons within each -CH2- group are diastereotopic (endo/exo), leading to 2 + 2 = 4 signals.\n\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of signals from the core and one arm.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of signals based on this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule by analyzing its structure.\n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Count signals from the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n    # The three methyl groups are equivalent due to C3 rotational symmetry.\n    signals_core = 1\n    print(f\"Analysis of the central core:\")\n    print(f\"The molecule has C3 symmetry, making the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring equivalent.\")\n    print(f\"Number of signals from core = {signals_core}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Count signals from one of the three identical arms.\n    # The three arms are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.
