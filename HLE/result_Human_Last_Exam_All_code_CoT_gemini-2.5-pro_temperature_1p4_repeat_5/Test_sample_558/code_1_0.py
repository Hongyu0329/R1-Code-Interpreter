# This script solves a multi-step opera trivia question by laying out the deductive reasoning.

# Step 1: Identify the opera based on the clue about Marietta Alboni at La Scala.
opera_name = "La Favorite"
alboni_year = 1843
print(f"Step 1: Identifying the Opera")
print(f"The opera revived at La Scala in {alboni_year} with Marietta Alboni in the title role (LÃ©onor) was Gaetano Donizetti's '{opera_name}'.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Identify the relevant Metropolitan Opera production featuring Enrico Caruso.
caruso_met_year = 1905
print(f"Step 2: Identifying the Caruso Production")
print(f"Enrico Caruso performed in this opera at the Metropolitan Opera. The last production of his era was in {caruso_met_year}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Calculate the timeframe for the new New York City production.
time_gap_years = 70
earliest_revival_year = caruso_met_year + time_gap_years
print(f"Step 3: Calculating the Revival Year")
print(f"The new production occurred more than {time_gap_years} years after the Caruso-era production.")
print(f"The calculation for the minimum time is: {caruso_met_year} + {time_gap_years} = {earliest_revival_year}.")
print(f"Therefore, the revival we are looking for took place after {earliest_revival_year}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 4: Pinpoint the specific production and identify the singer for the bass role.
revival_year = 1978
revival_company = "New York City Opera"
bass_role = "Balthazar"
bass_singer = "James Morris"
print(f"Step 4: Identifying the Singer")
print(f"A notable revival, the first in New York City for decades, was staged by the {revival_company} in {revival_year}.")
print(f"The principal bass role in '{opera_name}' is {bass_role}.")
print(f"The singer who performed this role in the {revival_year} production was:")
