    "In the context of the renormalization group, we can calculate the critical exponent for specific heat, α, using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method works by performing a perturbative expansion in the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d_c` is the upper critical dimension and `d` is the spatial dimension.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify parameters**: For many common statistical models like the Ising model, the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4. The problem specifies the spatial dimension `d = 3`. We will therefore have `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n2.  **Assume a model**: The formula for the exponent depends on the number of components `n` of the order parameter. The most common and fundamental case is the Ising model, which corresponds to `n=1`. We will use this value.\n3.  **Apply the formula**: The first-order ϵ-expansion for the specific heat exponent α in an n-component model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Calculate the value**: We will substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula to find the numerical value for α.\n5.  **Generate Python code**: The code will perform these calculations and print the equation with all the numerical values substituted, showing the step-by-step evaluation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the 3D Ising universality class.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the epsilon expansion\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension\n    n = 1  # Number of order parameter components (n=1 for the Ising model)\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # The formula for alpha to the first order in epsilon is:\n    # α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    numerator_val = 4 - n\n    denominator_val = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n    # Calculate alpha as a fraction for precision\n    alpha_frac = sympy.Rational(numerator_val, denominator_val) * epsilon\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_frac)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α for d=3 using the ϵ-expansion.\")\n    print(\"We assume the system is in the Ising universality class (order parameter components n=1).\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The spatial dimension is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"Thus, ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe first-order expansion formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values n=1 and ϵ=1:\")\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator_val} / (2 * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator_val} / {denominator_val} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_frac}\")\n    print(f\"\\nAs a decimal, the value is approximately: {alpha_float:.4f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_specific_heat_exponent()\n    # The final answer in fraction form is 1/6\n    final_answer = 1/6\n    # To conform to the output format, we can output the float value\n    # print(f'<<<{final_answer:.4f}>>>')\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
