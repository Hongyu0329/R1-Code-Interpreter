# The problem is to find the minimal resources needed for a Local Hidden Variable (LHV)
# model to simulate the correlations of a singlet bipartite quantum state.
# The allowed resources are non-signaling PR-Boxes (p) and classical communication in bits (c).

# Step 1: State the known theoretical result for communication.
# According to the Toner-Bacon protocol, the correlations of a singlet state
# can be perfectly simulated using an LHV model if one bit of classical
# communication is allowed from one party to the other.
# So, the required communication cost, if used alone, is 1 bit.
communication_cost_alone = 1.0

# Step 2: State the known theoretical result for PR-Boxes.
# It has been shown that for this task, 1 bit of communication is equivalent to
# 1 PR-box. They are interchangeable resources.
# Therefore, the simulation can also be achieved with 1 PR-box and no communication.
pr_box_cost_alone = 1.0

# Step 3: Formulate the trade-off equation.
# Since the resources are interchangeable, there is a linear trade-off.
# The sum of the average number of PR-boxes (p) and the average number of
# communication bits (c) must equal a total cost.
# The total minimal resource cost is the value determined above.
total_minimal_cost = 1.0

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The equation represents all possible minimal strategies. For example, one could use
# 0.5 PR-boxes and 0.5 bits of communication on average.
print("To simulate the correlations of a singlet state with an LHV model, the required average resources are:")
print("p = average number of PR-Boxes")
print("c = average number of communication bits")
print("")
print("The minimal resources must satisfy the trade-off equation:")
print(f"p + c = {total_minimal_cost}")
print("")
print(f"The minimal average resource cost (the value on the right side of the equation) is {total_minimal_cost}.")

# Final numerical answer for the minimal average cost
# <<<1.0>>>
