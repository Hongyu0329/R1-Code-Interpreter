# For the transition from J = 0 to J = 1:
# The energy shift (ΔE) is calculated as: ΔE = -4 * D * (J+1)³
# ΔE = -4 * 7.0787e-27 J * (0+1)³ = -2.8315e-26 J
# In quecto-electronvolts, this is: -1.7673e+23 qeV

# For the transition from J = 1 to J = 2:
# The energy shift (ΔE) is calculated as: ΔE = -4 * D * (J+1)³
# ΔE = -4 * 7.0787e-27 J * (1+1)³ = -2.2652e-25 J
# In quecto-electronvolts, this is: -1.4138e+24 qeV
