    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve, which has the general form `x = A*cos(at)` and `y = B*sin(bt)`. In this specific case, `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, and `b=5`.\n\n2.  **Use the standard formula:** There is a well-known formula for the number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve, which depends on the parameters `a` and `b`.\n\n3.  **Check the conditions for the formula:** For a Lissajous curve with `a` and `b` being integers, the number of self-intersection points `N` can be calculated if `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). The specific formula depends on the parity of `a` and `b`.\n    *   `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   The greatest common divisor `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, so they are coprime.\n    *   Both `a` and `b` are odd numbers.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula:** For a Lissajous curve where `a` and `b` are coprime and both are odd, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n    `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the values of `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out the steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(\"The curve is a Lissajous curve defined by x = cos(a*t) and y = sin(b*t).\")\n    print(f\"For the given curve, the parameters are a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the number of self-intersections, we first check if 'a' and 'b' are coprime.\")\n    \n    # Simple GCD check for explanation\n    import math\n    if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:\n        print(f\"The greatest common divisor of {a} and {b} is 1, so they are coprime.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The parameters a={a} and b={b} are not coprime.
