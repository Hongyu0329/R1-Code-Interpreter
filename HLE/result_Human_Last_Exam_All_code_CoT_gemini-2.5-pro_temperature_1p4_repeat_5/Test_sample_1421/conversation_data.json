    "The formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism is a cornerstone of many-body quantum field theory. It expresses the thermal partition function `Z` as an integral over all possible configurations of fermionic fields, represented by anti-commuting Grassmann numbers.\n\nHere is the plan to construct the python code to display the formula:\n1.  Define the partition function `Z` as a path integral over Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄`.\n2.  Define the core of the integral, which is the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, `exp(-S_E)`.\n3.  Define the Euclidean action `S_E` itself, which is an integral of the Lagrangian density over imaginary time `τ` (from 0 to `β`) and space `x`.\n4.  Specify the crucial anti-periodic boundary condition for the fermionic fields in the imaginary time direction, which arises from the trace operation in the quantum statistical definition of `Z`.\n\nThis code will print the complete formula step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the\n    imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Using Unicode characters for mathematical symbols to make the formula clear.\n    integral_symbol = \"\\u222B\"\n    d_symbol = \"D\"\n    psi_bar_symbol = \"\\u03C8\\u0304\"  # psi with a bar over it\n    psi_symbol = \"\\u03C8\"\n    exp_symbol = \"exp\"\n    beta_symbol = \"\\u03B2\"\n    tau_symbol = \"\\u03C4\"\n    partial_symbol = \"\\u2202\"\n    mu_symbol = \"\\u03BC\"\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a functional path integral over Grassmann fields.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Step 1: Print the overall structure of the partition function Z\n    print(\"1.
