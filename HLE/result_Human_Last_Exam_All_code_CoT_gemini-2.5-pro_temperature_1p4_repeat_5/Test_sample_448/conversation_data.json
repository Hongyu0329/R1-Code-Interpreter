    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\nFirst, I will identify all the naturally occurring noble gases. Then, I will gather data on their abundance. The question asks for the abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, which includes the crust, mantle, core, and atmosphere. For most noble gases, the vast majority of their inventory is in the atmosphere or the mantle. For Radon, which is radioactive, its abundance is determined by the decay rate of its parent elements (Uranium and Thorium) in the Earth's crust and mantle.\n\nI will write a Python script to store these abundance percentages. The script will then process this data to identify the gas with the lowest percentage and print the result. This approach directly answers the question using a coded solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its estimated percentage\n    of all terrestrial matter by mass.\n    The year 2002 is specified, but these abundances are stable over long timescales.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data represents estimated mass percentage in all terrestrial matter (crust, mantle, core, atmosphere).\n    # These are estimations based on geochemical models.\n    # For instance, Radon's abundance is calculated from the secular equilibrium\n    # with its parent element, Uranium, in the Earth's mantle and crust.\n    noble_gas_abundances = {\n        'Argon (Ar)': 6.6e-4,     # Dominated by radiogenic 40-Ar from Potassium-40 decay\n        'Neon (Ne)': 3.3e-8,\n        'Krypton (Kr)': 2.2e-10,\n        'Xenon (Xe)': 2.2e-11,    # Rarest stable noble gas\n        'Radon (Rn)': 4.4e-18     # Rarest noble gas overall due to its short half-life\n    }\n    \n    # We omit Helium as its abundance is highly variable and complex due to\n    # production from radioactive decay and loss to space, but it is significantly\n    # more abundant than Xenon or Radon.\n\n    print(\"Abundance of noble gases as a percentage of all terrestrial matter (by mass):\")\n    for gas, percentage in noble_gas_abundances.items():\n        # Using sys.stdout.write to avoid scientific notation for some numbers if not needed\n        # but here we format it consistently for clarity.\n        print(f\"- {gas}: {percentage:.1e} %\")\n\n    # Find the rarest gas by finding the minimum percentage\n    rarest_gas = min(noble_gas_abundances, key=noble_gas_abundances.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundances[rarest_gas]\n\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas is {rarest_gas.split(' ')[0]}.\")\n    \n    # The final output requires printing the numbers in the final equation.\n    # Here, the \"equation\" is the comparison leading to the answer.\n    print(f\"Its percentage of all terrestrial matter is {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e} %.\")\n    print(\"This is calculated by comparing the abundances of all noble gases:\")\n    \n    # Building a string to show the comparison, e.g., 4.4e-18 < 2.2e-11 < ...\n    sorted_gases = sorted(noble_gas_abundances.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])\n    comparison_str = \" < \".join([f\"{val:.1e} % ({key.split(' ')[0]})\" for key, val in sorted_gases])\n    \n    print(comparison_str)\n    \nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
