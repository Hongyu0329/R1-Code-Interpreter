    This function calculates the sum based on the reasoning outlined above.
    The set S contains pairs (n, m).
    For each n >= 1, we concluded there are two possible values for m:
    m = 0 and m = (3**n + (-1)**n) / 2.
    This means for each n, there are two pairs in S.
    
    The sum is sum_{(n, m) in S} (1 / 4**n).
    This can be rewritten as sum_{n=1 to infinity} (number of m values for n) * (1 / 4**n).
    Since the number of m values is 2 for each n, the sum is:
    
    Sum = 2 * sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)**n
    
    This is a geometric series with a = 1/4 and r = 1/4.
    The sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r).
    Sum = 2 * ( (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) )
