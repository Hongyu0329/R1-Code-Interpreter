    # The boundary value problem u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0 with u(0)=u(1)=0 can be
    # transformed into an integral equation u = T(u). The Banach fixed-point
    # theorem can be applied if we find a complete metric space M where T
    # is a contraction mapping from M to M.

    # We define M as a closed ball of radius R in the space of continuous
    # functions C[0, 1] that satisfy the boundary conditions:
    # M = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and sup_{x∈[0,1]} |u(x)| ≤ R}
    
    # This set M is a complete metric space. We need to find a suitable R > 0.
    
    # Condition 1: T must be a contraction on M.
    # This requires the contraction constant k < 1. For this problem, the
    # constant is bounded by k ≤ exp(R) / 8.
    # So, we must have exp(R) / 8 < 1, which simplifies to R < ln(8).
    
    # Condition 2: T must map M to itself (T(M) ⊆ M).
    # This requires ||Tu|| ≤ R for all u in M. This leads to the condition
    # exp(R) / 8 ≤ R.
    
    # We need to choose an R that satisfies both R < ln(8) and R ≥ exp(R) / 8.
    # Let's test the value R = 1.
    # For R = 1, ln(8) ≈ 2.079, so 1 < ln(8) is true.
    # For R = 1, exp(1) / 8 ≈ 2.718 / 8 ≈ 0.34, so 1 ≥ 0.34 is also true.
    # Therefore, R = 1 is a valid choice.
    
    # The final definition for the set M with R = 1 is:
    set_definition = "M = { u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and sup_{x∈[0,1]} |u(x)| ≤ 1 }"
