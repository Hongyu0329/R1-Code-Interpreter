    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will use Python to perform the calculation. The `NumPy` library is excellent for matrix operations, but to fulfill the requirement of showing the calculation step-by-step, I will implement the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix manually.\n2.  The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, using cofactor expansion along the first row, is:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  The Python script will define the matrix, plug the values into this formula, and print out each step of the calculation, including the initial formula with all numbers substituted.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the final determinant value.\n\nThe information regarding the \"Markov quiver\" and \"m_{1/2} = 13\" is treated as context, as the primary task is the calculation for the explicitly provided matrix `A`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant_and_show_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of a given 3x3 matrix and prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given matrix A\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # Unpack the matrix elements for clarity in the formula\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # The determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix via cofactor expansion is:\n    # det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\n    # Calculate the sub-determinants (minors of the first row elements)\n    sub_det_1 = e * i - f * h\n    sub_det_2 = d * i - f * g\n    sub_det_3 = d * h - e * g\n\n    # Calculate the full determinant using the formula\n    determinant = a * sub_det_1 - b * sub_det_2 + c * sub_det_3\n\n    print(\"The given matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe determinant is calculated using the formula for cofactor expansion along the first row:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + {c}(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the value of each sub-determinant:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}({sub_det_1}) - ({b})({sub_det_2}) + {c}({sub_det_3})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Perform the multiplications:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a * sub_det_1} - ({b * sub_det_2}) + ({c * sub_det_3})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Compute the final result:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a * sub_det_1 - b * sub_det_2 + c * sub_det_3}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {determinant}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\ncompute_determinant_and_show_steps()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
