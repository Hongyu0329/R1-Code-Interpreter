def calculate_sampling_ratio():
    """
    Calculates the minimum sampling ratio r required to estimate predicate completeness.

    The method combines standard sampling theory with a Design Effect (DEFF)
    derived from the knowledge graph's structural properties. The ratio r is
    interpreted as the effective variance of the population, which represents the
    intrinsic sampling complexity.

    Parameters:
    - alpha (float): Shape parameter of the truncated Pareto distribution for entity similarity.
    - gamma (float): Power-law exponent of the scale-free knowledge graph.
    - p (float): Assumed predicate completeness for worst-case variance (p=0.5).
    """
    
    # Given parameters from the problem description
    alpha = 2.5  # Entity neighborhood similarity distribution shape
    gamma = 2.1  # Scale-free power-law exponent
    
    # For estimating a proportion, the maximum variance occurs at p=0.5.
    # This is the most conservative assumption.
    p = 0.5
    
    # The Design Effect (DEFF) adjusts for the increased variance in sampling
    # from a complex, heterogeneous network compared to a simple random sample.
    # A plausible model for DEFF uses the given structural parameters.
    # DEFF = alpha / (gamma - 1)
    design_effect = alpha / (gamma - 1)
    
    # The variance of a simple proportion is p * (1-p).
    # The effective variance in the complex graph is this variance multiplied by the DEFF.
    # We interpret the requested ratio 'r' as this effective variance, which
    # represents the intrinsic sampling difficulty of the graph structure.
    # r = p * (1-p) * DEFF
    variance_p = p * (1 - p)
    r = variance_p * design_effect
