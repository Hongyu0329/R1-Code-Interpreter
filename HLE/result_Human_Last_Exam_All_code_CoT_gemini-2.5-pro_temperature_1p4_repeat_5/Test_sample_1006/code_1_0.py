# The user wants me to solve a topology problem and provide the answer as a Python script.
# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact topological space X with specific properties.

# Let's outline the reasoning within this script's comments.

# 1. Analyze the properties of X.
#    - Property (1): X is a compactification of the long ray R = [0, \omega_1).
#    - Property (2): Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to X.

# 2. Relate to the Stone-Čech Compactification.
#    - Property (2) is the defining universal property of the Stone-Čech compactification, denoted βR.
#    - This implies that any such space X must be homeomorphic to βR.

# 3. Identify βR.
#    - A key theorem in topology states that any continuous function from the long ray R to the real numbers is "eventually constant".
#    - This means for any such function f, there's a point α < \omega_1 after which f is constant.
#    - This constant value is the natural candidate for the function's value at the "end" of the long ray.
#    - Consider the "long line" L* = [0, \omega_1], which is the compactification of R formed by adding a single endpoint ω_1.
#    - The "eventually constant" property ensures that every bounded continuous function on R extends uniquely and continuously to L*.

# 4. Uniqueness.
#    - Since L* satisfies the defining property of βR, it must be homeomorphic to βR.
#    - Therefore, any space X satisfying the given properties must be homeomorphic to L*.

# 5. Final Count.
#    - Since all such spaces X must belong to the same homeomorphism class as L*, there is only one such class.
#    - The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# The problem asks to output the final answer.
# It also mentions "output each number in the final equation", which is slightly ambiguous here as there's no equation.
# I will print the final numerical answer.
