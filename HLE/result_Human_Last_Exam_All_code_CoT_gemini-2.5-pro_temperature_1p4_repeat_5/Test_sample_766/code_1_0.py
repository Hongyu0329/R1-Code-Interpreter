    """
    Analyzes crystallographic data to find a mistake based on symmetry rules.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Some space groups require molecules to be on special symmetry positions
       if the number of formula units (Z) is less than the number of general positions.
    2. For space groups P-1 and P21/c, such a special position is an inversion center.
    3. A molecule can only be on an inversion center if it is centrosymmetric.
    4. For a molecule to be centrosymmetric, all its atom counts must be even,
       with the rare exception that one atom of one element lies on the center itself.
    5. The problem states "One number has been altered". We look for a case where a single
       number change would fix the inconsistency. A formula with one odd atom count fits this,
       while a formula with two or more odd atom counts does not.
