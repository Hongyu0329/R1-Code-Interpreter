    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that identifies and displays the specific verses from the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  I will first identify the start and end verse (bayt) numbers in the poem where the 25 mentioned prophets are listed by name.\n2.  I will then create a Python script to store these verse numbers and their corresponding Arabic text.\n3.  The script will print a clear answer stating the range of the verses.\n4.  To provide full context, the script will then display each verse number along with its Arabic text and an English translation.\n\n```python\n# The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi\n# This script identifies and displays the verses (bayt) that list the names of the Prophets.\n\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies, prints, and explains the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The enumeration of the 25 prophets begins at bayt 29 and ends at bayt 32.\n    start_bayt = 29\n    end_bayt = 32\n\n    # A dictionary mapping the verse number to its Arabic text.\n    verses = {\n        29: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ * صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        30: \"لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        31: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        32: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\"\n    }\n    \n    # English translations for additional clarity.\n    translations = {\n        29: \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with * Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\",\n        30: \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, * Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub, follow in their footsteps.\",\n        31: \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa and al-Yasa', * Dhul Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman, followed.\",\n        32: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, * 'Isa, and Taha (the Seal), so leave deviation.\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the direct answer\n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"The specific verses are as follows:\\n\")\n\n    # Loop through the verses from start to end and print each one with its number and text.\n    # The numbers in the final output are 29, 30, 31, 32.\n    for i in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        print(f\"Bayt {i}:\")\n        print(f\"   Arabic:      {verses[i]}\")\n        print(f\"   Translation: {translations[i]}\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_prophet_verses()\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 32>>>\n```"
