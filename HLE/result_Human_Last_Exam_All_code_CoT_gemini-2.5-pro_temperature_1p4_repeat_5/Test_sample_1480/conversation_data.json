    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership grade.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Inputs:** We are given two values:\n    *   The firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   The membership grade in the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\n2.  **Choose a T-Norm:** A t-norm is a type of fuzzy logic operator used for intersection. The problem specifies using \"a t-norm\" but not which one. The most common t-norm is the **minimum (min)** operator, so we will use that for this calculation. The rule activation level will be the minimum of the two given values.\n\n3.  **Perform Calculation:**\n    *   `activation_level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   `activation_level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Generate Code:** Write a Python script to define the input variables, perform the `min` calculation, and print the complete equation with the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy set using a t-norm.\n\n    The problem provides the firing strength from the antecedent (Phi_k) and\n    the membership grade from the consequent (mu_G). The rule activation level\n    is found by applying a t-norm to these two values. We will use the\n    most common t-norm, the minimum operator.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G = 0.9\n\n    # The t-norm operation (minimum)\n    # Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers and the result\n    print(f\"min({phi_k}, {mu_G}) = {activation_level}\")\n\nsolve_rule_activation()\n<<<0.7>>>\n```"
