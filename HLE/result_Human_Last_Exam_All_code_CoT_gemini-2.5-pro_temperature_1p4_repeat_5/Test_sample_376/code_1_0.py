# Step 1: Define the weights for each gene as per the problem description.
# The weights for tumor suppressors (TSG) are for a 'lost copy'.
# A functional loss from a repressor is equivalent to a lost copy.
# The problem states the impact on clonal expansion. Losing a TSG promotes expansion,
# so its contribution should be positive.
tsg_d_weight_per_lost_copy = 0.6
tsg_b_weight_per_lost_copy = 0.7

# Other gene weights are not used as their copy numbers are normal.
# oncogene_a_weight = 0.5
# oncogene_c_weight = 0.4
# oncogene_e_weight = 0.3
# tsg_f_weight = -0.5

# Step 2: Analyze the effect of the repressor of tumor suppressor protein.
# The repressor is overexpressed on chromosomes 1 and 2, affecting the TSGs on them.
# We assume overexpression causes a functional loss equivalent to 1 copy.

# On chromosome 1, Tumor Suppressor D is repressed.
tsg_d_functional_loss_copies = 1
tsg_d_score_contribution = tsg_d_functional_loss_copies * tsg_d_weight_per_lost_copy

# On chromosome 2, Tumor Suppressor B is repressed.
tsg_b_functional_loss_copies = 1
tsg_b_score_contribution = tsg_b_functional_loss_copies * tsg_b_weight_per_lost_copy

# Step 3: Note on other gene copy numbers.
# All specified genes (A, B, C, D, E, F) have normal copy numbers.
# Therefore, their score contribution from direct Copy Number Variation (CNV) is 0.
# The total score is only affected by the repressor's actions.
other_genes_score_contribution = 0

# Step 4: Calculate the total clonal expansion score.
total_score = tsg_d_score_contribution + tsg_b_score_contribution + other_genes_score_contribution

# Step 5: Print the final equation and result.
print("Calculating the Clonal Expansion Score:")
print("The score is based on events that promote cancer growth.")
print("1. Direct gene copy number changes: All specified genes have normal copy numbers, so their contribution is 0.")
print("2. Repressor of tumor suppressor protein is overexpressed on chromosomes 1 and 2.")
print("- This causes a functional loss of Tumor Suppressor D on Chromosome 1.")
print("- This causes a functional loss of Tumor Suppressor B on Chromosome 2.")

print(f"Clonal Expansion Score = (Score from TSG D loss) + (Score from TSG B loss)")
