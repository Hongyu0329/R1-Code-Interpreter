    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will calculate the total number of squares located on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard. This is the perimeter of the board.\n2.  Next, I will determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares so that no two bishops attack each other. Bishops attack along diagonals. A highly effective strategy is to place bishops on the two outer vertical files (the 'a' file and the 'h' file).\n3.  Placing bishops on these two files provides 8 squares on each, for a total of 16 positions. I'll then identify any attacking pairs. A bishop on corner `a1` attacks corner `h8`, and a bishop on `a8` attacks `h1`. These are the only two attacks.\n4.  To ensure no bishops are attacking each other, one bishop from each of these two attacking pairs must be removed. This reduces the maximum number of bishops to 16 - 2 = 14.\n5.  Finally, the number of empty edge squares is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops placed. The Python code below will execute this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A standard chessboard has 8 squares per side.\n    side_length = 8\n    \n    # 1. Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # Formula: 4 sides * length_of_side - 4 corners (to avoid double-counting).\n    total_edge_squares = (side_length * 4) - 4\n    \n    # 2. Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # A good strategy is to place bishops on the two side files ('a' and 'h').\n    # This gives 8 squares on file 'a' and 8 on file 'h'.\n    squares_on_side_files = side_length * 2\n    \n    # However, bishops on a1 and h8 attack each other, and bishops on a8 and h1 attack each other.\n    # This creates 2 pairs of mutually attacking bishops.\n    attacking_pairs = 2\n    \n    # To have a valid placement, we must remove one bishop from each attacking pair.\n    # So, the maximum number of bishops we can place is:\n    max_bishops = squares_on_side_files - attacking_pairs\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the number of edge squares without bishops.\n    empty_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops\n    \n    # 4. Print the final equation showing each number.\n    print(f\"Total edge squares: {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"Maximum non-attacking bishops on the edge: {max_bishops}\")\n    print(\"The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops} = {empty_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
