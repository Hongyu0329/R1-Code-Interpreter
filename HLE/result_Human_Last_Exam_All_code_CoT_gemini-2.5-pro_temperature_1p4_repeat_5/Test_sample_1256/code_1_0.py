    # We can test the trivial solution where all x_i = 1.
    # Plugging this in gives: sum(a_i) - 1 = S - 1, which simplifies to S - 1 = S - 1.
    # This identity holds true. The solution (1, 1, ..., 1) is always valid.
    # For N=1, this solution is monochromatic. Therefore, Rad_2(S-1) = 1.

    # Part (b): For c = 2S-2, can Rad_2(c) equal 2? If not, what is its value?
    # Based on a known theorem for 2-distributable sets (for S >= 2), Rad_2(c) for c=2S-2 is 2S-1.
    # For the Rado number to be 2, we would need 2S-1 = 2, which implies S = 1.5.
    # Since S (the sum of integers) must be an integer, this is not possible.
    # For the case S=1, the Rado number is 1, not 2.
    # Thus, the value cannot be 2.
