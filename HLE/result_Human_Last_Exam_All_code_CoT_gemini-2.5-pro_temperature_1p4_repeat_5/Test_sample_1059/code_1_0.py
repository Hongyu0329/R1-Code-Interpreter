    This function determines which of the given sets are necessarily 'closepact'.

    Based on topological principles, a subset of reals or complex numbers is 'closepact'
    (a property equivalent to being H-closed) if and only if it is compact.
    A subset of reals or complex numbers is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

    The analysis for each option is as follows:
    A. R: Not bounded. Not compact.
    B. Z: Not bounded. Not compact.
    C. A finite set: Closed and bounded. Compact.
    D. {1/n | n in Z*}: Not closed (limit point 0 is missing). Not compact.
    E. A set of points in a Cauchy sequence in Q: Not necessarily closed (may converge to an irrational). Not necessarily compact.
    F. A set of points in a bounded monotonic sequence: Not necessarily closed (limit point may be missing). Not necessarily compact.
    G. A bounded monotonic sequence plus its limit: Closed and bounded. Compact.
    H. A convergent sequence plus its limit: Closed and bounded. Compact.
    I. An open interval: Not closed. Not compact.
    J. A closed interval: Closed and bounded. Compact.
    K. A bounded measurable set: Not necessarily closed (e.g., an open interval). Not necessarily compact.
    L. A bounded non-measurable set: Cannot be closed, otherwise it would be compact and thus measurable. Not compact.
    M. The Cantor Set: Closed and bounded. Compact.

    The correct options are those that are necessarily compact.
