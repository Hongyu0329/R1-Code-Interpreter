# The problem consists of two independent matrix equations. We will solve for the first coordinates of X1 and X2 separately and then sum them up.

print("Step 1: Analyze the first equation to find the possible values for the first coordinate of X1.")
# The first equation is:
# [[5, 0], [0, -5]] * X1^2 + X1^2 * [[6, 0], [0, 6]] = [[-53/12, 0], [0, 0]]
# This is a Sylvester equation of the form A*Y + Y*B = C, with Y = X1^2 and B = 6*I.
# It simplifies to (A + 6*I)*Y = C.
# ( [[5, 0], [0, -5]] + [[6, 0], [0, 6]] ) * X1^2 = [[-53/12, 0], [0, 0]]
# [[11, 0], [0, 1]] * X1^2 = [[-53/12, 0], [0, 0]]
# Since the matrices are diagonal, we only need to consider the diagonal elements.
# Let the (1,1) element of X1^2 be y1_11.
# 11 * y1_11 = -53/12
y1_11 = -53 / (12 * 11)
print(f"The (1,1) element of X1^2 is -53/132, which is approximately {y1_11:.4f}.")

# As reasoned in the plan, the first coordinate of X1, let's call it x1_11, satisfies x1_11^2 = y1_11.
x1_sol1 = cmath.sqrt(y1_11)
x1_sol2 = -x1_sol1
print(f"The possible values for the first coordinate of X1 are {x1_sol1} and {x1_sol2}.")


print("\nStep 2: Analyze the second equation to find the possible values for the first coordinate of X2.")
# The second equation is:
# [[4, 0], [0, -5]] * X2^2 + X2^2 * [[6, 0], [0, 6]] = [[-3/11, 0], [0, 0]]
# Using the same logic: (A + 6*I)*Y = C with Y = X2^2.
# ( [[4, 0], [0, -5]] + [[6, 0], [0, 6]] ) * X2^2 = [[-3/11, 0], [0, 0]]
# [[10, 0], [0, 1]] * X2^2 = [[-3/11, 0], [0, 0]]
# Let the (1,1) element of X2^2 be y2_11.
# 10 * y2_11 = -3/11
y2_11 = -3 / (11 * 10)
print(f"The (1,1) element of X2^2 is -3/110, which is approximately {y2_11:.4f}.")

# The first coordinate of X2, x2_11, satisfies x2_11^2 = y2_11.
x2_sol1 = cmath.sqrt(y2_11)
x2_sol2 = -x2_sol1
print(f"The possible values for the first coordinate of X2 are {x2_sol1} and {x2_sol2}.")


print("\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of the first coordinates of all solutions.")
# The "solutions" are all possible matrices X1 and X2. We sum up all possible first coordinate values we found.
total_sum = x1_sol1 + x1_sol2 + x2_sol1 + x2_sol2

# Displaying the final summation equation with all the numbers.
print("The sum is calculated as follows:")

# Since the sum is 0j, we can simply output 0.
