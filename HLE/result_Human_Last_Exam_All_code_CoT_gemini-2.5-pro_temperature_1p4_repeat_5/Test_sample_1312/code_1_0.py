    print("3. Let's evaluate the most likely options:")
    print("   - Multigene families (D) and Polyploidy (E) offer redundancy. If one gene copy is damaged, another can perform the function. This helps, but it's a passive defense.")
    print("   - A 'Chromosomal Inversion' (B) is a segment of DNA that has been flipped. This structural change suppresses recombination within the inverted region.")
    print("4. This suppression of recombination is the key. It allows a set of beneficial alleles that work well together to become 'locked' in place. This linked block of genes is often called a 'supergene'.")
    print("5. By creating a supergene, an inversion ensures that this advantageous combination of alleles is inherited as a single unit, preventing recombination from breaking it up. This directly compensates for the inability to effectively assemble and maintain favorable gene combinations in a low-recombination environment.")
