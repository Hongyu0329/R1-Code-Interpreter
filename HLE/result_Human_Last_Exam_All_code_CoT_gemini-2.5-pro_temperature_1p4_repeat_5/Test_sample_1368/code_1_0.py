def solve_construction():
  """
  This function determines and prints the shortest sequence of commands
  to construct a square inscribed in a circle given the center and one
  point on the circumference.
  
  The steps are:
  1. (L)ine: Draw a line through the center and the given point to create the first diameter.
  2. (C)ircle: Draw a circle centered at one end of the diameter with the diameter's length as the radius.
  3. (C)ircle: Draw a second circle centered at the other end of the diameter with the same radius.
  4. (L)ine: Draw a line between the intersection points of the two new circles. This line is the second, perpendicular diameter.
  
  The sequence of commands is LCCL.
