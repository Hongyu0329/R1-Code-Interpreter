# The maximal entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) is found by constructing an explicit case
# that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the theoretical upper bound.

# Based on the analysis, the maximum entropy is achieved when:
# - s1 and s2 are independent random bits, so H(s1)=1 and H(s2)=1.
# - x = s1, y = s2, z = s1 XOR s2.
# For this construction, the joint entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) simplifies to H(s1,s2).

H_s1 = 1
H_s2 = 1

# Since s1 and s2 are independent, their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies.
H_s1_s2 = H_s1 + H_s2

# The maximal entropy H(x,y,z,s1,s2) is equal to H(s1,s2) for our construction.
H_max = H_s1_s2
