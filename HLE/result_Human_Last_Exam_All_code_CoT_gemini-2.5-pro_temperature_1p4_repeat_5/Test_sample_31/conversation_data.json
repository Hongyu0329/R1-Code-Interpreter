    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of side-sticker colors you need to see to guarantee you can distinguish any of the 21 PLL cases from all the others. This is equivalent to finding the size of the smallest set of sticker positions whose color values, taken together, form a unique signature for each PLL case.\n\nMy plan is to demonstrate that 4 stickers are not sufficient by providing a concrete counterexample. I will show that two different PLL cases, the **T-Perm** and the **Ga-Perm**, can produce the exact same color pattern on a specific set of 4 stickers. This proves that you cannot *always* identify the PLL case with only 4 stickers. Then, I will show that by adding a fifth sticker to the set, the ambiguity between these two cases is resolved. This provides strong evidence that 5 is the minimum number of stickers required.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan. It will:\n1.  Define the sticker colors for a solved cube's last layer.\n2.  Define the resulting sticker colors after a T-Perm and a Ga-Perm are applied.\n3.  Select a set of 4 sticker positions to observe.\n4.  Print the color patterns for both PLLs using these 4 stickers, showing they are identical.\n5.  Add a 5th sticker to the set of observed positions.\n6.  Print the new color patterns for both PLLs, showing they are now different.\n7.  Conclude the minimum number of stickers required.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_pll_stickers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to\n    unambiguously identify any PLL case by demonstrating a conflict with 4\n    stickers and its resolution with 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let the colors be Green (Front), Red (Right), Blue (Back), Orange (Left).\n    # There are 12 non-top-facing stickers in the last layer.\n    # We define the sticker state for T-Perm and Ga-Perm.
