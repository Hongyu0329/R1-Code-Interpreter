    This function demonstrates the calculation for measuring the cost of gene flow in yeast,
    following the methodology described in the best answer choice.
    
    The key is to compare the fitness of hybrids (from gene flow) not to the original parents,
    but to offspring from within-strain mating (the 'no gene flow' control). This isolates
    the cost of outbreeding from the cost of meiosis.

    # Fitness is a relative measure of reproductive success.
    # We assume higher values mean better fitness (e.g., faster growth rate).
    
    # Fitness of offspring from within-strain mating (the proper control).
    # This group undergoes meiosis but without gene flow from another strain.
    # It serves as our reference fitness, so we set it to 1.0 for calculation,
    # or use its measured value as the denominator.
    # Let's say its measured growth rate is 0.95 arbitrary units.
    fitness_no_gene_flow = 0.95

    # This group experiences both meiosis and gene flow.
    # Let's say its measured growth rate is lower due to outbreeding depression.
