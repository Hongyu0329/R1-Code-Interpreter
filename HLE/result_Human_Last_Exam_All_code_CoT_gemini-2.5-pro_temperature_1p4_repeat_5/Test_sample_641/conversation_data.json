    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group Parameters:** We are working with the group PSU(n, q) where n = 4 and q = 997.\n2.  **Understand Involutions in PSU(n, q):** An involution in PSU(n, q) is an element `gZ` that is not the identity and for which `(gZ)^2` is the identity. Here, `Z` is the center of the special unitary group SU(n, q). This condition implies `g` is not in `Z` and `g^2` is in `Z`.\n3.  **Characterize the Center `Z`:** The center of SU(n, q), `Z(SU(n, q))`, has an order of `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`, so `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. This means the center `Z` consists of two elements: the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n4.  **Count Pre-images in SU(4, 997):** We need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g` is not central and `g^2` is either `I` or `-I`.\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = I`**: These are the non-central involutions in SU(4, 997). Let the number of these be `N1`.\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = -I`**: These are the quasi-involutions in SU(4, 997). Let the number of these be `N2`. (It can be shown that none of these are central).\n5.  **Use Known Formulas for N1 and N2:** From the theory of finite groups, there are established formulas for these quantities:\n    *   The number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q) is `N1 = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n    *   For `n=4` and `q â‰¡ 1 (mod 4)` (which holds for q=997), the number of elements `g` with `g^2 = -I` is `N2 = q^5 * (q^3 + 1) * (q^4 - 1)`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The elements counted in `N1` and `N2` form pairs `{g, -g}` which correspond to a single involution in PSU(4, 997). Therefore, the total number of involutions is `(N1 + N2) / 2`.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to compute `N1`, `N2`, and the final result using `q=997`. The script will print the final equation showing all the components.\n\n```python\n# The prime field order is q=997. The group is PSU(4, 997).\nq = 997\n\n# N1 is the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q).\n# An involution is an element g != I such that g^2 = I.\n# The formula for this number is q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1).\nn1 = q**4 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)\n\n# N2 is the number of quasi-involutions in SU(4, q).\n# A quasi-involution is an element g such that g^2 = -I.\n# For n=4 and q=1(mod 4), the formula is q^5 * (q^3 + 1) * (q^4 - 1).\nn2 = q**5 * (q**3 + 1) * (q**4 - 1)\n\n# The total number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is the sum of involutions\n# coming from both types of elements, divided by the order of the center (which is 2).\n# This gives the final formula: (N1 + N2) / 2.\ntotal_involutions = (n1 + n2) // 2\n\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The final equation is (n1 + n2) / 2 = total_involutions.\nprint(f\"({n1} + {n2}) // 2 = {total_involutions}\")\n\n```\n<<<48714083313364917992909400877983636284>>>"
