    "To determine how many times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality in \"The Chameleon\", I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Obtain the Text**: First, I'll use the full text of Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon\".\n2.  **Identify Key Phrases**: The descriptions of the coat are not just mentions; they are actions that signify Otchumyelov's changes in mood and authority. I will identify the specific, distinct phrases where he interacts with his coat (an overcoat/greatcoat) as his opinion on the situation shifts.\n3.  **Count Occurrences**: I will write a Python script to count the number of times each of these key phrases appears in the text.\n4.  **Calculate Total**: The script will sum these counts to get the total number of descriptions.\n5.  **Display the Result**: Finally, the code will print out each individual count in an equation that adds up to the total, showing the breakdown of the descriptions.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described\n    in a way that symbolizes his changing state of mind in Chekhov's \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekhov\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman stalks after him, his sieve laden to the brim with confiscated gooseberries. There is silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.\n\n    \"So you bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! ah . . . ah!\"\n\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of a dog's yelping and the shout of \"Don't let go!\" are heard once more. Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard.\n\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour . . .\" says the policeman.\n\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his half-drunken face there is a look of terror, as though he were saying: \"I'll pay you out!\" and the very finger has the look of a flag of victory. In this man Otchumyelov recognises Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy, with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes.\n\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you here for? Why are you waving your finger . . . ? Who was it holloed?\"\n\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour . . .\" Hryukin begins, coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood with Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no rhyme or reason, bit my finger. . . . You must excuse me, I am a working man. . . . Mine is fine work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, may be. . . . It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast. . . . If everyone is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living. . . .\"\n\n    \"H'm! Very good . . .\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. \"Very good. . . . Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson! Yeldyrin,\" cries the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad. . . . Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm! Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad. . . . There seems to be a wind getting up. . . . I am cold. . . . You take it to the General's and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street. . . . It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigar in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal. . . . And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own fault you know. . . . You must have been larking about with it. . . .\"\n\n    \"He put a cigarette in its face, your honour, for a joke, and it snapped at him. . . .\"\n\n    \"That's a lie! I didn't see you, so you couldn't have seen it. . . .\"\n\n    \"He did, on my honour,\" says the policeman.\n\n    \"I know your honour. I was watching from the tavern next door. He was playing the fool with the dog.\"\n\n    \"That's so. . . .\"\n\n    \"You're lying! a squib! If I'd wanted to play the fool I'd have taken a better dog than that! The General's! If this were the General's dog it would have a collar on it!\"\n\n    \"The General has none of that sort,\" observes the policeman, with deep conviction.\n\n    \"You are sure of that?\"\n\n    \"Quite sure, your honour.\"\n\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no shape. . . . A low creature. And to keep a dog like that! . . . where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop. . . . We must give them a lesson! It is high time. . . .\"\n\n    \"Yet maybe it is the General's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face. . . . I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n\n    \"H'm! . . . take off my coat, Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . . There's one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\" Otchumyelov turns to Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know you fellows! You're a set of devils!\"\n\n    \"He had a nail in his hand, and he ran it into the dog's leg,\" says a man in the crowd.\n\n    \"You're a liar, you one-eyed devil! What do you mean by it? If you're blind why did you say anything? Are you going to answer for your words? If the police discover that you've been lying you'll be arrested!\"\n\n    \"He's the General's cook, he'll know.\"\n\n    \"And is the cook here? Let him come here, my good man. So this is not the General's dog? But the General's cook says it's not ours.\"\n\n    \"Ask his cook,\" says the policeman. \"Prohor, come here, my dear man, and look at this dog. . . . Is it one of yours?\"\n\n    \"What an idea! We have never had a dog like that in our lives!\"\n\n    \"There's no need to waste time in asking,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking about it. . . . Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is. . . . It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor went on. \"It belongs to the General's brother, who came the other day. Our General doesn't care for borzoys. His brother does.\"\n\n    \"You don't say the General's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" inquires Otchumyelov, and his whole face is irradiated with a smile of tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I didn't know! Has he come on a visit?\"\n\n    \"Yes.\"\n\n    \"Well, I never. . . . He couldn't stay away from his brother. . . . And there I didn't know! So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha. . . . Come, why are you shivering? Rrr . . . Rrr . . . The rogue's angry . . . a nice little pup.\"\n\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n\n    \"I'll make you pay for this yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Using case-insensitive matching for robustness.\n    # The phrases are chosen to be unique actions representing a shift in mindset.\n    phrases_to_count = {\n        \"initial\": r\"wearing a new overcoat\",\n        \"put_on\": r\"help me on with my coat\",\n        \"take_off_1\": r\"take off my coat\", # This will match his first removal of the coat.

Wearing it initially.\n    # 2. Putting it on when he thinks the dog is the General's.\n    # 3. Taking it off when he reconsiders.\n    # 4.
