    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, I'll find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode. According to the game's data, this is **3640 HP**.\n2.  **Understand Health Scaling:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each player in a multiplayer world. The health increases by a specific percentage for each player after the first one. This value is **35% (or 0.35)** per additional player.\n3.  **Address the \"Infinite Players\" Constraint:** The user's request for an \"infinite number of players\" would mathematically result in infinite health. However, the game itself has a hard-coded limit for the maximum number of players it can handle in a world. This limit, defined in the source code as `Main.maxPlayers`, is **255**. For a \"theoretical maximum\" within the game's own architecture, we should use this value.\n4.  **Construct the Formula:** The formula to calculate the total health is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + (Number of Players - 1) * 0.35)`\n5.  **Calculate and Present:** I will write a Python script that uses these values to calculate the final health and print out the full equation with all the numbers involved, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n    \n    This is based on the game's hard-coded maximum player limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base health for Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    base_health = 3640\n    \n    # The game's hard-coded maximum player limit (Main.maxPlayers)\n    num_players = 255\n    \n    # Health increase factor per player after the first in Expert Mode\n    health_increase_factor = 0.35\n    \n    # The multiplier is 1 (for the first player) + the bonus from all additional players\n    health_multiplier = 1 + (num_players - 1) * health_increase_factor\n    \n    # Calculate the final maximum health\n    max_health = base_health * health_multiplier\n    \n    # The game stores health as an integer, so we'll convert the final result.\n    final_health_int = int(max_health)\n    \n    # Print the full equation as requested\n    print(\"Theoretical Maximum Health Calculation for Eye of Cthulhu (Expert Mode):\")\n    print(f\"{base_health} * (1 + ({num_players} - 1) * {health_increase_factor}) = {final_health_int}\")\n\ncalculate_terraria_boss_health()\n<<<327236>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the source code of the video game Terraria, in Expert Mode what is the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu given an infinite number of players?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
