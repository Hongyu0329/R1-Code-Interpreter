    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions of its heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The size, shape, and chemical properties of these core residues dictate the packing efficiency and, consequently, the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Register:** A coiled-coil sequence has a repeating 7-residue pattern. There are 7 possible ways to align this pattern (or \"register\") with the given sequence. I will write a script to test all 7 registers and score them based on the hydrophobicity of the residues that fall into the core `a` and `d` positions. The register that places the most hydrophobic residues in the core is considered the most likely.\n2.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the best register is identified, I will examine the specific sequence of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions.\n3.  **Apply Packing Rules:** Based on established principles of coiled-coil stability, I will predict the oligomeric state. The key factors are:\n    *   The preference of Î²-branched residues like Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position for forming trimers.\n    *   The effect of polar residues like Serine (S) in the hydrophobic core, which can disrupt lower-order structures or specifically promote higher-order oligomers.\n4.  **Conclude and Output:** The script will weigh these factors to determine the most probable oligomeric state and print the final number.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence.\n\n    The prediction is based on two main steps:\n    1. Finding the most likely heptad repeat register by maximizing core hydrophobicity.\n    2.
