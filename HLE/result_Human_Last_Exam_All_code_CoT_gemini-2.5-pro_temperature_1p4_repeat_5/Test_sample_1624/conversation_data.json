    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question in topology. I will first outline the logical steps to arrive at the solution, and then I will provide a Python script that prints out this reasoning.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the given properties of the space `X` and its subset `U`**. We are given that `X` is a connected metric space and `U` is a dense open subset where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  **Deduce the properties of `U`**. The condition on `U` implies it's a 1-dimensional topological manifold. A key property of manifolds is that they are second-countable, which in turn means they are separable (i.e., they have a countable dense subset).\n3.  **Extend the properties of `U` to `X`**. Since `U` is dense in `X` and `U` itself has a countable dense subset, `X` must also have a countable dense subset. This means `X` is a separable metric space.\n4.  **Bound the cardinality of `X`**. A separable metric space can have a cardinality of at most $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). This is because every point in the space is a limit of a sequence from the countable dense set, and there are only $c$ such sequences.\n5.  **Conclusion**. Since the cardinality of `X` is at most $c$, there is indeed an upper bound. The Python script will print these steps to make the reasoning clear.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step reasoning to answer the question\n    about the cardinality of the metric space X.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Reasoning ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1] Analyze the subset U.\")\n    print(\"We are given that U is an open subset of X, and every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"This means U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"An important property of any manifold is that it is second-countable, which means it has a countable basis for its topology.\")\n    print(\"A second-countable space is always separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset.
