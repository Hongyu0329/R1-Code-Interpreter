    "My plan to solve this problem involves two parts as requested: writing a Python script to solve the \"Xenia and the Beginner Mathematician\" problem, and calculating the memory usage for a highly efficient C program that does the same.\n\n### Python Solution Plan\n\n1.  **Read Input**: The input is a single line string representing a sum, like `\"3+2+1\"`. I'll read this using the `input()` function.\n2.  **Extract Numbers**: The numbers in the sum are separated by `+` symbols. I will use the `split('+')` string method to get a list of the numbers (which will be represented as strings). For `\"3+2+1\"`, this will result in `['3', '2', '1']`.\n3.  **Sort Numbers**: Xenia can only calculate sums where the numbers are in non-decreasing order. I will sort the list of numbers. Python's default `sorted()` function works perfectly for this, as sorting single-digit strings lexicographically is the same as sorting them numerically. The list `['3', '2', '1']` becomes `['1', '2', '3']`.\n4.  **Reconstruct and Print Sum**: Finally, I will join the sorted numbers back into a single string with `+` signs in between. The `'+'.join()` method is ideal for this. The list `['1', '2', '3']` becomes the string `\"1+2+3\"`. This resulting string will be printed as the final output.\n\n### C Program Memory Calculation Plan\n\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, I will avoid storing the entire input string.\n1.  **Read and Count**: I'll read the input character by character using `getchar()`. I will use a small integer array of size 4, `counts[4]`, to store the frequency of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4').\n2.  **Analyze Memory Usage**: I'll calculate the total memory required for the variables in this C program.\n    *   An integer array to hold the counts: `int counts[4];` (4 integers).\n    *   A variable to hold the character from `getchar()`: `int c;`.\n    *   Loop counters for printing: `int i, j;`.\n    *   A flag to manage printing the `+` sign correctly: `int first_term;`.\n3.  **Calculate Total**: Assuming a standard 32-bit system where an `int` takes 4 bytes, the total memory is: `(4 * 4) + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32` bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# Read the sum from the input as a string\ns = input()\n\n# Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of numbers (as strings)\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single-digit,\n# default string sort works correctly.\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted numbers back into a string with '+' as the separator\nsorted_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum\nprint(sorted_sum)\n```\n<<<32>>>"
