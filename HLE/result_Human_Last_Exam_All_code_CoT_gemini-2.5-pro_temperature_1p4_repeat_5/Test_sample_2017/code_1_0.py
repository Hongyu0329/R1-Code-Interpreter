w1 = "εἶμαι"
c1 = "εἰμί"
p1 = "KoineByzantineDemotic"

# For Passage 2:
# The non-classical word (W2) is 'νηός'.
# The correct classical version (C2) is 'νεώς'.

w2 = "νηός"
c2 = "νεώς"
p2 = "Homeric"

# The final answer is formatted as a single comma-separated string.
final_answer = f"{w1},{c1},{p1},{w2},{c2},{p2}"
