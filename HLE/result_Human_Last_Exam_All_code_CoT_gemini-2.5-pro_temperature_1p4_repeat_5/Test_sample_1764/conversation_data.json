    "An isometric embedding is a function $f$ from an ultrametric space $X$ to a Banach space $B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for any two points $x, y$ in $X$, the distance $d(x, y)$ is equal to the norm of the difference of their images in $B$, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B$.\n\nTo find the smallest possible number of such embeddings, we need to consider the properties of the spaces $X$ and $B$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the effect of the structure of the Banach space $B$ on the number of embeddings.** We will show that if we have one isometric embedding, we can often generate many more using the vector space operations in $B$.\n2.  **Identify the condition for a finite number of embeddings.** We will deduce that for the number of embeddings to be finite, the Banach space $B$ must be of a very specific, simple form.\n3.  **Identify the condition on the ultrametric space $X$ for an embedding to exist in this simple Banach space.**\n4.  **Construct an example.** We will find a specific pair $(X, B)$ that satisfies all the conditions and has a minimal, non-zero number of embeddings.\n5.  **Conclude the smallest possible number.** Based on the analysis, we determine the smallest integer that represents a possible number of embeddings.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning step-by-step to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    It does so by logically deducing the constraints on X and B\n    that lead to a minimal number of embeddings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the number of embeddings based on the properties of a Banach space.\")\n    print(\"Let f: X -> B be one isometric embedding.\")\n    print(\"A Banach space B is a vector space.
