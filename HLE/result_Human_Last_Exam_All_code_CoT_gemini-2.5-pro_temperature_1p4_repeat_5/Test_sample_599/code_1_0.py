# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# From the analysis, the sequence of segmented numbers corresponds to powers of two.
# The n-th segmented number is given by the formula 2^(n-1).

# The term number we want to find.
term_number = 50

# The base for the exponential calculation.
base = 2

# The exponent is calculated as term_number - 1.
exponent = term_number - 1

# Calculate the 50th segmented number.
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final result, showing the equation used for the calculation.
# This displays all the numbers involved in the final equation: the term number (50),
# the base (2), the numbers in the exponent calculation (50, 1), and the final result.
print(f"The equation for the {term_number}th segmented number is: {base}^({term_number}-1)")
print(f"This evaluates to: {base}^{exponent} = {result}")
