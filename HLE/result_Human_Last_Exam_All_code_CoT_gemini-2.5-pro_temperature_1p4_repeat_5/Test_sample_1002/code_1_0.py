# The problem asks for the value of the limit: lim_{m->inf} [ln f(m) / ln m].
# Based on known results in extremal combinatorics, the function f(m) has an asymptotic
# behavior of Theta(m^(k/(k+1))).
# The limit evaluates to the exponent of m, which is k / (k+1).

# The problem states k is an integer k >= 2, but does not specify its value.
# To provide a single numerical answer, we will use the smallest possible value, k=2.
k = 2

# Calculate the numerator and the denominator of the resulting fraction.
numerator = k
denominator = k + 1

# The final equation for the limit is numerator / denominator.
# As requested, we print each number in this final equation.
print("For k = 2, the final equation for the limit is 2/3.")
print(f"The numerator is: {numerator}")
print(f"The denominator is: {denominator}")

# Calculate and print the final result.
result_fraction = f"{numerator}/{denominator}"
result_float = numerator / denominator

print(f"The value of the limit is {result_fraction} or approximately {result_float}.")
