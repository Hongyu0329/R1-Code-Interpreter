    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan to Find Total Welfare\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:**\n    *   The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`). At this point, the supply price also equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D = P_E`).\n    *   I will find the equilibrium quantity `Q_E` by numerically solving the equation `Supply(Q) = Demand(Q)`, which is `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. I'll use Python's `scipy.optimize.fsolve` for this.\n    *   Once `Q_E` is found, I will calculate the equilibrium price `P_E` by plugging `Q_E` back into either the supply or demand function.\n\n2.  **Define Welfare Components:**\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price `P_E`, from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_E`. The formula is: `CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] D(Q) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)`.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price `P_E`. The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is only defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integration for the supply curve area will start from this minimum quantity. The formula is: `PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q_E] S(Q) dQ`.\n    *   **Total Welfare (TW):** This is the sum of consumer and producer surplus: `TW = CS + PS`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:**\n    *   I will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to perform the numerical integrations required to find the consumer and producer surplus.\n    *   Finally, I will sum CS and PS to get the total welfare and print all the results, including the intermediate values for equilibrium, in the format of their respective equations.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for market equilibrium, calculates consumer surplus,\n    producer surplus, and total welfare, and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

From analysis, the root is between 4 and 5.\n    initial_guess_q = 4.5\n    # Use fsolve to find the root Q_E\n    q_equilibrium = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_q)[0]\n    # Calculate P_E using the demand function\n    p_equilibrium = demand(q_equilibrium)\n\n    # 3.
