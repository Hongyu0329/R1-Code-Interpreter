    "My plan is to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) by consulting established entomological knowledge. I will then systematically evaluate each answer choice based on these facts to find the most accurate and comprehensive option.\n\n1.  **Establish Facts:** I will first access my knowledge base regarding the feeding habits of adult snakeflies. They are known to be predators, but some also consume other food sources.\n2.  **Evaluate Individual Choices:** I will check each of the basic food choices (A through E) for factual accuracy.\n    *   **A. Nectar:** I will verify if nectar is part of their diet.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** I will check if they eat pollen, and also consider the geographical specificity of Māhoe, a plant from New Zealand, where snakeflies are not native.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** I will verify if they are fungivores.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** I will verify if they are herbivores (leaf-eaters), again noting the New Zealand origin of the plant.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** I will check if they are predators of aphids, again noting the New Zealand context.\n3.  **Evaluate Combined Choices:** I will then analyze the combined options (F and G). A combined option is only correct if all its components are correct.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the evaluation, I will select the choice that best represents the recorded diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n5.  **Code Generation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this evaluation process, printing the reasoning and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans based on entomology.\n    # They are primarily predators and also consume sugary substances.\n    known_diet = {\n        \"predation\": \"Small, soft-bodied arthropods (e.g., aphids, mites)\",\n        \"supplemental\": \"Pollen and nectar\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices.\n    # Note: Māhoe, Karamū, and Totara are native to New Zealand, where snakeflies are not found.\n    # We will evaluate based on the food *type*, as the specific species might be illustrative.\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": {\"food\": \"Nectar\", \"type\": \"supplemental\", \"correct\": True},\n        \"B\": {\"food\": \"Māhoe pollen\", \"type\": \"supplemental\", \"correct\": True}, # Pollen is a known food source.\n        \"C\": {\"food\": \"Fungus\", \"type\": \"fungivory\", \"correct\": False},\n        \"D\": {\"food\": \"Karamū leaf tissue\", \"type\": \"herbivory\", \"correct\": False},\n        \"E\": {\"food\": \"Totara Aphids\", \"type\": \"predation\", \"correct\": True}, # Aphids are a known food source.\n        \"F\": {\"food\": \"A and E\", \"components\": [\"A\", \"E\"], \"correct\": None},\n        \"G\": {\"food\": \"D and E\", \"components\": [\"D\", \"E\"], \"correct\": None}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Evaluating diet of adult Raphidiopterans (Snakeflies):\")\n    print(f\"Known Primary Diet: {known_diet['predation']}\")\n    print(f\"Known Supplemental Diet: {known_diet['supplemental']}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Evaluate each choice and print the reasoning.\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Answer Choices ---\")\n    \n    # Evaluate simple choices\n    for key, data in choices.items():\n        if \"components\" in data:\n            continue\n        if data[\"correct\"]:\n            print(f\"Choice {key} ({data['food']}): Plausible.
