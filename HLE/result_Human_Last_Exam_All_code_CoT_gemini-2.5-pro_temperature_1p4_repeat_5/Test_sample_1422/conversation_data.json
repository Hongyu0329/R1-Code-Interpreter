    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Diagram Properties:** We'll consider the most common and simplest interacting scalar field theory, which is the **$\\phi^4$ theory**. In this theory, each interaction vertex connects four field lines. We'll use the topological formula that relates the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V) in a connected Feynman diagram.\n\n2.  **State the Topological Formula:** The number of loops in a connected diagram is given by:\n    `L = I - V + 1`\n\n3.  **Relate Internal Lines and Vertices:** To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we can consider the simplest type of diagram, a **vacuum diagram** (which has no external lines). In a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has 4 lines coming out. In a vacuum diagram, all these lines must be internal. The total number of \"line ends\" at all vertices is `4 * V`. Since each internal line connects two of these ends, we have `2 * I = 4 * V`, which simplifies to `I = 2 * V`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Number of Vertices:** By substituting the relationship `I = 2 * V` into the loop formula, we can find a direct connection between the number of loops and vertices:\n    `L = (2 * V) - V + 1`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `L = V + 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Vertices for Two Loops:** We are given that `L = 2`. We can now solve for V. The calculation is performed in the Python script below.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi^4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of loops given in the problem\n    L = 2\n\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop diagram, we proceed as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
