    print(f"Observation: {observation}\n")

    # Step 1: Analyze the Marangoni Force
    print("Step 1: Evaluate the Marangoni Force.")
    print("This force arises from a gradient in surface tension (γ) along the surface of the molten pool.")
    print("The flow direction is determined by the temperature coefficient of surface tension, dγ/dT.\n")

    # Step 2: Explain the two scenarios for Marangoni flow
    print("Step 2: Consider the two possible directions of Marangoni flow.")
    print("  - Case 1 (dγ/dT < 0): For most pure metals, surface tension decreases with temperature. The hot center has the lowest surface tension, so the flow is from the center outwards. This does NOT match the observation.")
    print("  - Case 2 (dγ/dT > 0): For alloys with surface-active elements (like sulfur in steel), surface tension can increase with temperature. The hot center has the highest surface tension, which pulls the surrounding liquid from the cooler edges inwards. This MATCHES the observation.\n")

    # Step 3: Relate the mechanism to the specific material
    print("Step 3: Connect the mechanism to 304 stainless steel.")
    print("304 stainless steel is an alloy that typically contains sufficient amounts of sulfur. Sulfur acts as a surfactant, reversing the sign of dγ/dT to be positive.")
    print("Therefore, for 304 stainless steel, the Marangoni force drives the surface flow inwards from the cooler periphery to the hotter center.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Briefly consider other forces
    print("Step 4: Evaluate other forces.")
    print("  - Arc Drag Force: Pushes liquid outwards from the center.")
    print("  - Lorentz Force: Creates a stirring action, generally pushing liquid down and outwards at the surface.")
    print("  - Arc Pressure: Pushes the surface down at the center.")
    print("None of these other forces explain an inward surface flow.\n")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: The inward flow is a direct result of the Marangoni force in a material with a positive temperature coefficient of surface tension.")
