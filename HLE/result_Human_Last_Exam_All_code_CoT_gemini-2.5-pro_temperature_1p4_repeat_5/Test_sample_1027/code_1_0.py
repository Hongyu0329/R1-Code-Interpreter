    # that place them in a version of Thompson's group F, specifically the group
    # of PL-homeomorphisms of the real line with dyadic breakpoints and slopes
    # that are powers of 2.

    # 2. We analyze the abelianization of G, which corresponds to H_1(G, Z).
    # A standard homomorphism Ab from F to Z^2 is given by the translation
    # behavior at +/- infinity: Ab(f) = (lim_{x->-inf}(f(x)-x), lim_{x->+inf}(f(x)-x)).
    # This map is surjective for F.

    # 3. We compute the image of the generators g and h under this map.
    # For g(x): lim_{x->-inf}(g(x)-x) = lim_{x->-inf}(x+1-x) = 1.

    # The Universal Coefficient Theorem states that H_k(G, R) is isomorphic to
    # H_k(G, Z) tensor R.
    # For k=31, H_31(G, Z) = 0.
