    The scene in question is from the 2006 Oscar-winning film 'The Departed'.
    
    Context:
    Sergeant Dignam (played by Mark Wahlberg) is aggressively trying to find the
    mole within the police unit. He lines up the officers, gives them each money
    for a bus ticket, and dismissively tells them to go home. One officer, Trooper
    Barrigan (played by James Badge Dale), makes the crucial mistake of politely
    saying "Thank you." This small act of courtesy is out of place for a hardened
    officer in that tense situation, instantly revealing to Dignam that Barrigan
    is an outsider and the likely mole.
