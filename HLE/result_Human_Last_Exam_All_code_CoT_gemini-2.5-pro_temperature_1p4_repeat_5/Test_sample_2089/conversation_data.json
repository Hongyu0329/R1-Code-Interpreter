    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the specific clues in your movie trivia question: an Oscar-nominated film, a character saying \"Thank you,\" and this act sealing their fate in a situation involving a bus. This combination of details points to a memorable scene in a specific film. I will identify the movie and the context of the scene.\n\nNext, I will create a Python script. This script will store the name of the movie in a variable and then use a `print()` function to display the answer clearly, explaining the context of the scene as described in the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_by_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the film based on the described scene and prints the answer.\n    The scene in question is from the 2006 Oscar-winning film 'The Departed'.\n    \n    Context:\n    Sergeant Dignam (played by Mark Wahlberg) is aggressively trying to find the\n    mole within the police unit. He lines up the officers, gives them each money\n    for a bus ticket, and dismissively tells them to go home. One officer, Trooper\n    Barrigan (played by James Badge Dale), makes the crucial mistake of politely\n    saying \"Thank you.\" This small act of courtesy is out of place for a hardened\n    officer in that tense situation, instantly revealing to Dignam that Barrigan\n    is an outsider and the likely mole.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"The Departed\"\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_by_scene()\n```\n<<<The Departed>>>"
