def solve_superintegrability_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the questions about the superintegrability
    of the given two-matrix model.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    For question (a):
    Superintegrability of a matrix model is defined by its partition function having
    an expansion in a basis of characters (Schur functions in this case),
    Z(t) = sum_lambda c_lambda * s_lambda(t).
    The problem provides that the partition function Z_{-n}(t) for n >= 2 has exactly
    this form. Therefore, for the case n = 3, the model is superintegrable by definition.

    For question (b):
    The construction of the partition function Z_{-n}(t) via an operator formalism relies
    on operators that generate the coefficients c_lambda. The dependence on 'n' in the
    coefficient is isolated in the term s_lambda(delta_{k,n}). This term corresponds
    to the specialization of the Schur function where the power sum p_n = 1 and others are zero.
    In the associated operator algebra, the operator that generates this term is linked to the
    n-th power sum symmetric function. For n = 4, this operator is denoted W_{-4}.
    The power sum functions (and their corresponding operators) are algebraically independent.
    This means the operator W_{-4} cannot be created from operators with a lower index
    (like W_{-1}, W_{-2}, W_{-3}). Hence, W_{-4} is a necessary and fundamental component for
    constructing Z_{-4}(t).

    The numbers involved in the reasoning are n, k, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
