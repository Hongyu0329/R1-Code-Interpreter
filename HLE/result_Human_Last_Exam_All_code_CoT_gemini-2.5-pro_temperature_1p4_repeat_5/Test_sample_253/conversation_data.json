    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Understand the Rule:** First, I need to understand how Rule 110 works. It's a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule \"110\" is the decimal representation of the binary sequence `01101110`, which defines the output for all 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods (from `111` down to `000`).\n\n2.  **Set Up the Simulation:**\n    *   I'll define the number of generations, which is 20.\n    *   I'll create a 1D array (a list in Python) to represent the cells. Its width needs to be large enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 generations without hitting the edges. A safe width would be `(2 * number_of_generations) + initial_pattern_width + padding`. For an initial pattern of one cell and 20 generations, a width of around 61 will be more than sufficient.\n    *   The initial state (generation 0) will be this array filled with zeros, with a single `1` placed in the exact center.\n\n3.  **Implement the Rule Logic:** I'll use a Python dictionary to act as a lookup table for Rule 110. The keys will be tuples representing the 3-cell neighborhoods (e.g., `(1, 0, 1)`), and the values will be the corresponding next state for the center cell (e.g., `1`).\n\n4.  **Run the Simulation:** I'll loop 20 times, once for each generation. In each loop, I will:\n    *   Create a new, empty array for the next generation.\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the current array (ignoring the fixed boundaries).\n    *   For each cell, I'll read its 3-cell neighborhood, look up the result in the Rule 110 dictionary, and write it to the new array.\n    *   After iterating through all cells, I will replace the old array with the newly computed one.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** After 20 loops, the array will hold the final pattern. The problem asks for the binary pattern, so I will trim the excess leading and trailing zeros from the array and then print the result as a single string of `0`s and `1`s.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef simulate_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script simulates the Rule 110 elementary cellular automaton.\n    It starts from a single cell in state 1 and applies the rule for 20 generations,\n    then prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    generations = 20\n    # The width of the cell grid must be large enough to contain the pattern's growth.\n    # The pattern grows at most one cell on each side per generation.\n    # A width of 2 * generations + 1 is the theoretical minimum.
