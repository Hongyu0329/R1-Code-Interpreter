# Define the variable r
r = sympy.Symbol('r')

# The problem is to find r_0 > 15 such that Phi(r_0) = 0.
# The equation is 4*r**3*Phi(r) + Phi((4*r+37)/(3-r))/r + Phi((3*r-37)/(r+4))/r - 9/r = 0.
# At r = r_0, Phi(r_0) = 0, so the equation simplifies to:
# Phi((4*r_0+37)/(3-r_0)) + Phi((3*r_0-37)/(r_0+4)) = 9.

# We hypothesize that r_0 is a special value that simplifies one of the arguments of Phi.
# Let's test if one of the arguments can be a simple integer, for example 1.
# Case 1: (4*r + 37)/(3-r) = 1
# 4*r + 37 = 3 - r
# 5*r = -34
# r = -34/5 = -6.8. This is not > 15.

# Case 2: (3*r - 37)/(r+4) = 1
eq = sympy.Eq((3*r - 37) / (r + 4), 1)

# Solve the equation for r
solutions = sympy.solve(eq, r)
r0 = solutions[0]

# Print the equation being solved
# To print the equation, we need to format it nicely.
# (3*r - 37)/(r+4) = 1  => 3*r - 37 = r + 4 => 2*r = 41 => r = 20.5
