    "This is a fascinating historical and literary question. Here is my plan to deduce the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The key clues are the connection to the poet Andrei Voznesensky, the phrase \"a joy-discovering sailor,\" the question about a lost grave, and the fact that the grave's location was found in the late 1980s.\n2.  **Connect Voznesensky to the Subject:** Andrei Voznesensky is famous for writing the lyrics/libretto for the Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This opera is about the tragic love story of a Russian explorer and a Spanish girl in California.\n3.  **Identify the \"Sailor\":** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the real-life historical figure Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and diplomat who undertook a voyage to Russian America (Alaska) and California in the early 1800s. This fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer.\n4.  **Verify the \"Lost Grave\" Clue:** Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his return journey. His original grave at the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed by the Soviets in the mid-20th century, and its exact location was lost. This historical fact directly corresponds to Voznesensky's poetic question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n5.  **Confirm the Timeline:** The efforts to find Rezanov's resting place and erect a new monument began in the late 1980s, which perfectly matches the final clue. A new monument was placed on the supposed site of his grave.\n6.  **Formulate the Script:** I will write a Python script to print this explanation and then state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The clues point to a specific historical figure celebrated by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    # 1. The poet Voznesensky is famous for the libretto of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n    # 2. The opera's protagonist is a Russian explorer, fitting the \"sailor\" description.\n    # 3. This man died in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was lost for many years, inspiring\n    #    the line about a missing grave.\n    # 4. Efforts to find and re-dedicate the grave began in the late 1980s.\n    \n    # This person is Nikolai Rezanov.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    \n    explanation = f\"\"\"\nThe person in question is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe clues connect to him in the following ways:\n- Andrei Voznesensky wrote the poetry for the famous rock opera 'Juno and Avos', which tells Rezanov's story.\n- Rezanov was a Russian diplomat and explorer who sailed to Alaska and California, matching the \"joy-discovering sailor\" description.\n- He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was destroyed after the Russian Revolution, and its location was lost for decades, which is why Voznesensky's poem asks about the location of his grave.\n- The site of his grave was rediscovered through historical investigation in the late 1980s.\n\nThe last name is:\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(last_name)\n\nsolve_historical_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
