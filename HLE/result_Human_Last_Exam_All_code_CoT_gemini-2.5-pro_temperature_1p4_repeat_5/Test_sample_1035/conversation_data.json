    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the sum of the number of vertices of bipartite graphs whose edges cover the complete graph $K_n$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$. The quantity to minimize is $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. The solution is given by a well-known result which provides both a constructive upper bound and a proven lower bound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant theorem:** The minimum total number of vertices required for a family of bipartite graphs to cover all edges of a complete graph $K_n$ is given by the formula $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n2.  **Set the value of n:** As given in the problem, $n = 35$.\n3.  **Calculate $\\log_2 n$:** Compute the base-2 logarithm of 35.\n4.  **Calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$:** Find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result from the previous step (the ceiling function).\n5.  **Compute the final result:** Multiply $n$ by the value calculated in step 4.\n6.  **Generate Python code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps and the final answer clearly, including the final equation as requested.\n\nThe Python code will carry out these steps and present the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bipartite_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The formula for the minimum total number of vertices is n * ceil(log2(n)).\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the problem and formula\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The formula for this minimum value is: n * ceil(log2(n))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate log2(n)\n    log2_n = math.log2(n)\n    print(f\"First, we calculate log2(n):\")\n    print(f\"log2({n}) â‰ˆ {log2_n:.4f}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate ceil(log2(n))\n    ceil_log2_n = math.ceil(log2_n)\n    print(f\"\\nNext, we find the ceiling of this value:\")\n    print(f\"ceil({log2_n:.4f}) = {ceil_log2_n}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Compute the final result\n    min_vertices = n * ceil_log2_n\n    print(\"\\nFinally, we compute the total minimum number of vertices using the formula:\")\n    # As requested, output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{n} * {ceil_log2_n} = {min_vertices}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_bipartite_covering()\n```\n<<<210>>>"
