# This script calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a
# smooth quintic hypersurface X in the complex projective space CP^3.
# The calculation is based on established results from algebraic topology.
#

# Step 1: Relate pi_3(X) to other homotopy groups.
# The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X) yields a
# short exact sequence for the free parts of the abelian groups involved:
# 0 -> Coker(pi_4(CP^3) -> pi_4(CP^3, X))_free -> pi_3(X)_free -> pi_3(CP^3)_free -> 0
# This implies that rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(pi_3(CP^3)) + rank(Coker(...)).

# Step 2: Determine the rank of pi_3(CP^3).
# The homotopy group pi_3(CP^3) is known to be isomorphic to the integers, Z.
# This can be seen from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3,
# which gives pi_3(CP^3) ~= pi_3(S^7) ~= Z.
rank_pi3_cp3 = 1

# Step 3: Determine the rank of the cokernel term.
# The rank of the cokernel is rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) - rank(im(pi_4(CP^3))).
# The group pi_4(CP^3) is isomorphic to Z_2, which is a torsion group and has rank 0.
# Thus, the rank of the cokernel is equal to the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).

# Step 4: Determine the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).
# By the Hurewicz theorem, the rank of a homotopy group of a highly connected
# pair equals the rank of the corresponding homology group.
# So, rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) = rank(H_4(CP^3, X)).
# By the Thom isomorphism, H_4(CP^3, X) is isomorphic to H_2(X).
# Therefore, rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) = rank(H_2(X)).

# Step 5: Determine the rank of H_2(X).
# The homology of X is related to the homology of CP^3 by a short exact sequence
# derived from the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and properties of the complement of X.
# 0 -> H_2(X) -> H_2(CP^3) -> H_1(CP^3 \ X) -> 0
# H_2(CP^3) is isomorphic to Z.
# H_1(CP^3 \ X) is isomorphic to Z/dZ where d is the degree of the hypersurface X.
# For a quintic hypersurface, d=5. So H_1(CP^3 \ X) is Z/5Z.
# The sequence is 0 -> H_2(X) -> Z -> Z/5Z -> 0.
# This implies that H_2(X) is the kernel of the surjection Z -> Z/5Z,
# which is isomorphic to Z. Therefore, H_2(X) is a free abelian group of rank 1.
rank_h2_x = 1

# Step 6: Sum the ranks to find the final answer.
# rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(pi_3(CP^3)) + rank(H_2(X))
final_rank = rank_pi3_cp3 + rank_h2_x
