    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can employ tools from algebraic topology, particularly the long exact sequence of a pair, the Hurewicz theorem, and the Lefschetz hyperplane theorems.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Utilize the Long Exact Sequence:** We will consider the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ and its long exact sequence in homotopy. This sequence connects the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Sequence:** We will show that the term $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ in the sequence is zero. This simplifies the sequence and establishes a direct relationship between $\\pi_3(X)$, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$, and $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Ranks:** The relationship derived is about the groups themselves, but it implies a simple additive relationship for their ranks (the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors in their abelianization). We will calculate the rank of each relevant group.\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is known.\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ can be found by relating it to a homology group using the Hurewicz theorem.\n    *   The rank of the resulting homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is related to the homology of $X$ itself via the Thom isomorphism.\n    *   Finally, the rank of the relevant homology group of $X$, $H_2(X)$, can be determined using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homology and properties of the complement $\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X$.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Result:** By summing the calculated ranks, we will arrive at the final rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe Python code below implements the final step of this plan, calculating the sum of the ranks derived from the theoretical analysis. The comments in the code briefly outline the justification for each number, following the plan above.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a\n# smooth quintic hypersurface X in the complex projective space CP^3.\n# The calculation is based on established results from algebraic topology.\n#\n\n# Step 1: Relate pi_3(X) to other homotopy groups.\n# The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (CP^3, X) yields a\n# short exact sequence for the free parts of the abelian groups involved:\n# 0 -> Coker(pi_4(CP^3) -> pi_4(CP^3, X))_free -> pi_3(X)_free -> pi_3(CP^3)_free -> 0\n# This implies that rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(pi_3(CP^3)) + rank(Coker(...)).\n\n# Step 2: Determine the rank of pi_3(CP^3).\n# The homotopy group pi_3(CP^3) is known to be isomorphic to the integers, Z.\n# This can be seen from the long exact sequence of the Hopf fibration S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3,\n# which gives pi_3(CP^3) ~= pi_3(S^7) ~= Z.\nrank_pi3_cp3 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Determine the rank of the cokernel term.\n# The rank of the cokernel is rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) - rank(im(pi_4(CP^3))).\n# The group pi_4(CP^3) is isomorphic to Z_2, which is a torsion group and has rank 0.\n# Thus, the rank of the cokernel is equal to the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).\n\n# Step 4: Determine the rank of pi_4(CP^3, X).\n# By the Hurewicz theorem, the rank of a homotopy group of a highly connected\n# pair equals the rank of the corresponding homology group.\n# So, rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) = rank(H_4(CP^3, X)).\n# By the Thom isomorphism, H_4(CP^3, X) is isomorphic to H_2(X).\n# Therefore, rank(pi_4(CP^3, X)) = rank(H_2(X)).\n\n# Step 5: Determine the rank of H_2(X).\n# The homology of X is related to the homology of CP^3 by a short exact sequence\n# derived from the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and properties of the complement of X.\n# 0 -> H_2(X) -> H_2(CP^3) -> H_1(CP^3 \\ X) -> 0\n# H_2(CP^3) is isomorphic to Z.\n# H_1(CP^3 \\ X) is isomorphic to Z/dZ where d is the degree of the hypersurface X.\n# For a quintic hypersurface, d=5. So H_1(CP^3 \\ X) is Z/5Z.\n# The sequence is 0 -> H_2(X) -> Z -> Z/5Z -> 0.\n# This implies that H_2(X) is the kernel of the surjection Z -> Z/5Z,\n# which is isomorphic to Z. Therefore, H_2(X) is a free abelian group of rank 1.\nrank_h2_x = 1\n\n# Step 6: Sum the ranks to find the final answer.\n# rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(pi_3(CP^3)) + rank(H_2(X))\nfinal_rank = rank_pi3_cp3 + rank_h2_x\n\nprint(f\"The rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) is the sum of two components:\")\nprint(f\"1. The rank of pi_3(CP^3), which is {rank_pi3_cp3}.\")\nprint(f\"2.
