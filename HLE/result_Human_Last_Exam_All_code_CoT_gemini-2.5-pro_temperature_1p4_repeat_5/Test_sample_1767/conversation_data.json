    "The task is to determine the Chern number of a junction formed by two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the key principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For non-interacting or weakly coupled systems, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is known as the additivity of the Chern number.\n2.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let C1 be the Chern number of the first insulator. C1 = 1.\n    *   Let C2 be the Chern number of the second insulator. C2 = 1.\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The total Chern number, C_total, is C1 + C2.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** C_total = 1 + 1 = 2.\n5.  **Create a Python script** that explains this principle, performs the calculation, and prints the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together\n# without significant interactions that would close and reopen the bulk band gap,\n# the Chern number of the resulting combined system is the sum of the\n# Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\n# Define the Chern number for the first insulator\nchern_number_1 = 1\n\n# Define the Chern number for the second insulator\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\nprint(\"The Chern number of the first insulator (C1) is: {}\".format(chern_number_1))\nprint(\"The Chern number of the second insulator (C2) is: {}\".format(chern_number_2))\nprint(\"\\nThe Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(\"Total Chern Number (C_total) = C1 + C2\")\n\n# Display the final calculation and result\nprint(\"C_total = {} + {} = {}\".format(chern_number_1, chern_number_2, total_chern_number))\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
