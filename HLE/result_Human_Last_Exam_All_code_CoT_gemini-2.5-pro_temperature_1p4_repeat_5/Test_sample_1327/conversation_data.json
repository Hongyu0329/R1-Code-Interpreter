    "To find the next number in the sequence, we first need to identify the pattern governing the relationship between the consecutive numbers.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  I will analyze the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  I will test a common pattern for such sequences, which is a recursive relationship of the form: `next_term = (a * current_term) + b`, where `a` is a constant multiplier and `b` is a value that might change. By inspection, `a=2` seems like a good candidate.\n3.  I will calculate the value of `b` for each step, creating a new sequence of these additive values. I will start from the second term, as the first term is often an exception in these puzzles.\n    *   For 23: `23 = (2 * 11) + 1`. The added value is 1.\n    *   For 51: `51 = (2 * 23) + 5`. The added value is 5.\n    *   For 119: `119 = (2 * 51) + 17`. The added value is 17.\n4.  This gives a secondary sequence of added values: {1, 5, 17, ...}.\n5.  I will then find the pattern within this secondary sequence by looking at the differences between its terms.\n    *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n6.  The differences are {4, 12, ...}, which is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (since 12 = 4 * 3).\n7.  I will use this ratio to predict the next difference (`12 * 3 = 36`).\n8.  I will use this next difference to predict the next term in the secondary sequence (`17 + 36 = 53`).\n9.  Finally, I will use this next additive value to calculate the missing number in the original sequence: `(2 * 119) + 53`.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this logic to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the given number sequence puzzle.\n    The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The original sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The original sequence is: {sequence}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find the pattern.
