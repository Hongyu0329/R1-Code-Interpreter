    White's Position:
    - A pawn on a7, one square from promotion (a massive threat).
    - A knight on d3 and a king on e3 supporting the center.

    Black's Position:
    - A knight on b6, the sole defender of the a8-queening square.
    - An active king on f5.

    White's objective is to overcome the defense of the a8-square or use the
    promotion threat to win material and the game.
    """

    # --- Move Evaluation ---
    move_analysis = """
    Evaluating the options:
    A. a8=Q: Good, but simplifies into a winning endgame that still requires precision.
       1. a8=Q Nxa8. White has traded his best piece (the a-pawn) for a knight.

    C. Kd4 / F. b4: Both are very strong preparatory moves that improve White's
       position and restrict Black's counterplay, leading to a win.

    B. Nc5: This is the most precise and powerful move. It creates a second,
       decisive threat. Black cannot defend against both threats simultaneously.
       - The original threat is the pawn promotion on the a8 square.
       - The new threat is the knight capturing the pawn on the e6 square.

    Let's see a sample line after 1. Nc5:
    If Black plays 1... Kg5 (to defend the e6-pawn with the king), White wins with:
    2. a8=Q  Nxa8
    3. Nxe6+
    White has successfully used the promotion threat to win Black's e6-pawn,
    leaving Black's knight stranded on a8 and the position is completely winning.

The winning formula for White is to combine threats.
The first threat is on the a-file, square 8.
The second threat is on the e-file, square 6.
