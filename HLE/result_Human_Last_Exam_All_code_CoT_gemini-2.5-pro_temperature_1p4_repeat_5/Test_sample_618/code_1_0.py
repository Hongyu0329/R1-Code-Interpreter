    This function explains and prints the general representation of the infinitesimal
    transformation on the variable x for the given heat equation.

    The heat equation is: u_t = u_{xx} + (k_1*ln(u) +k_2)u

    The infinitesimal transformation for x is given by:
    x* = x + epsilon * xi(t, x, u)

    Through Lie group analysis, we find the determining equations for the infinitesimals.
    Solving these equations reveals that xi depends only on t and x, and its form
    depends on whether the parameter k_1 is zero or not.
