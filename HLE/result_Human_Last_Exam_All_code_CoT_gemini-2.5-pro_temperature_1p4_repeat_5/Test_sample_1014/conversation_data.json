    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use a method called prime factorization by trial division.\n2.  The script will start by checking for the smallest prime factor, which is 2.\n3.  It will then iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on) up to the square root of the number.\n4.  Whenever a factor is found, the number is divided by that factor, and the factor is saved. This process is repeated until the number is no longer divisible by that factor.\n5.  If the number remaining after all these divisions is greater than 1, this remaining number is itself a prime factor.\n6.  Finally, I will construct the factorization equation and identify the largest number among all the found prime factors.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_factor(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factors of a number and prints the largest one,\n    along with the factorization equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_num = num\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle any factors of 2\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num = num // 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors from 3 upwards\n    i = 3\n    # We only need to check for factors up to the square root of the current number\n    while i * i <= num:\n        while num % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            num = num // i\n        i += 2\n        \n    # If the number that remains is greater than 1, it must be a prime factor itself.\n    if num > 1:\n        factors.append(num)\n        \n    # Print the prime factorization equation\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_num} is:\")\n    equation = f\"{original_num} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # Determine and print the largest prime factor from the list\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is {largest_prime}.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for numbers like 1, which have no prime factors.\n        print(f\"\\n{original_num} has no prime factors.\")\n\n# The number we need to analyze\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_factor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
