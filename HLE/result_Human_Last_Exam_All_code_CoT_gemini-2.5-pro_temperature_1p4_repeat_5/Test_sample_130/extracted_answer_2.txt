The edges undergo a process known as motion by mean curvature. This means they move and deform in a way that minimizes their total length over time. Sharp corners are rounded off, convex shapes shrink, and concave regions fill in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, any closed boundary will shrink and disappear, ultimately causing the image to become monochromatic (all 0s or all 1s).
