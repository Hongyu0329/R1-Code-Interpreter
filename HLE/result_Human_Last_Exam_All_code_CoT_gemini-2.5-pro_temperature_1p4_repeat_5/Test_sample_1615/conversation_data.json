    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_n$). The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, as we can always assign a unique color to each vertex. A graph requires exactly $n$ colors if and only if it is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Constraint:** The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This implies that its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number for $G$ is at most $n-1$.\n\n4.  **Verify the Upper Bound is Achievable:** To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum, we need to show that there exists a graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$. Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and adding one more vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has $n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is missing edges.\n    *   The complete subgraph $K_{n-1}$ by itself requires $n-1$ colors. The isolated vertex can reuse any of these colors.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of this entire graph is $n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the chromatic number cannot exceed $n-1$ and we have found a graph that achieves this value, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** A simple Python script will be written to calculate this value for $n=12345$ and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly\n    color a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # In graph theory, the chromatic number of a graph with n vertices is n\n    # if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # A complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n    # The problem specifies that our graph G is NOT the complete graph.\n    # Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than n.\n    # The highest possible integer value less than n is n - 1.\n\n    # We must confirm that a chromatic number of n-1 is achievable for a\n    # non-complete graph with n vertices.\n    # Consider a graph formed by a complete subgraph on (n-1) vertices (a K_{n-1})\n    # and one additional isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete,\n    # and requires n-1 colors for a proper coloring.\n\n    # Thus, the maximum number of colors that might be needed is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"For any graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph, the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
