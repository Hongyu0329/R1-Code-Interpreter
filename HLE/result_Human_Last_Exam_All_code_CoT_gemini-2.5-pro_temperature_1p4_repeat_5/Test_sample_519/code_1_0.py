    # Type: Deligne-Mumford stack (DM) (stabilizers are finite)
    # Separated: Yes (s)
    # Universally Closed: No (underlying space is not proper)

    # Type: Algebraic stack (A) (stabilizer is Gm, not finite)
    # Separated: Yes (s)
    # Universally Closed: No (infinitely many components, so not quasi-compact)

    # Dimension: genus of the curve = 7
