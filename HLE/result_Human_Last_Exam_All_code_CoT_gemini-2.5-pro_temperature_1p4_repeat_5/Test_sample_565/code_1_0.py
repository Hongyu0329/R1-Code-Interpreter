# My plan is to calculate the number of non-isomorphic vertex-transitive graphs
# on 8 vertices for degrees j=0, 1, 2, and 3. Then, I'll use the property that
# the number of such graphs of degree j is equal to the number of graphs of degree 7-j
# to find the remaining counts for j=4, 5, 6, and 7.

# Initialize a list to store the counts n_j for j = 0 to 7.
n = [0] * 8

# n_0: Degree 0. The only such graph is the empty graph on 8 vertices (8K_1).
n[0] = 1

# n_1: Degree 1. The only such graph is a perfect matching on 8 vertices (4K_2).
n[1] = 1

# n_2: Degree 2. The graphs are disjoint unions of cycles. For vertex-transitive
# graphs on 8 vertices, the possibilities are the 8-cycle (C_8) and two 4-cycles (2C_4).
n[2] = 2

# n_3: Degree 3. From the known classification of vertex-transitive graphs, there are
# three such graphs on 8 vertices: the cubical graph, the circulant graph C_8(1,4),
# and the disjoint union of two K_4 graphs (2K_4).
n[3] = 3

# Apply the complement rule n_j = n_{7-j}.
# n_4 is the number of graphs whose complement has degree 7-4=3.
n[4] = n[3]
# n_5 is the number of graphs whose complement has degree 7-5=2.
n[5] = n[2]
# n_6 is the number of graphs whose complement has degree 7-6=1.
n[6] = n[1]
# n_7 is the number of graphs whose complement has degree 7-7=0. The complement
# of the empty graph is the complete graph K_8.
n[7] = n[0]

# Print the final list of counts in the specified format.
# The problem requests the format [n_0, n_1, ..., n_7].
