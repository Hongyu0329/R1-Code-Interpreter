    # (a) Is the VEST problem, parameterised by k, still #W[2]-hard if we restrict S to the identity matrix
    # and require all T_i matrices to commute pairwise?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # The #VEST problem computes the sum over all k-sequences of matrix products.
    # If the matrices T_i commute, the sum of all products simplifies to the k-th power of the sum of the matrices.
    # Let T = T_1 + ... + T_m. The value to compute is v^T * T^k * S * v.
    # T^k can be computed efficiently using binary exponentiation in O(log k) matrix multiplications.
    # The entire problem is thus solvable in time polynomial in the input size and logarithmic in k.
    # This means the problem is in FPT (Fixed-Parameter Tractable).
    # An FPT problem cannot be #W[2]-hard, unless FPT = W[2], which is considered highly unlikely.
    answer_a = "No"

    # (b) Is VEST #W[1]-hard if T_i matrices are restricted to diagonal Z_2-matrices
    # with at most one non-zero entry on the diagonal?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Diagonal matrices are a specific type of matrices that always commute with each other.
    # Therefore, this is a special case of the scenario in part (a).
    # The same argument applies: the problem is in FPT because the matrices commute.
    # An FPT problem cannot be #W[1]-hard unless FPT = W[1].
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) If T_i are restricted to have only one non-zero entry in each row,
    # what is the complexity of the decision version of VEST?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Matrices with one non-zero entry per row do not commute in general.
    # The decision version of VEST asks if a sequence exists that results in a certain outcome.
    # This is a known type of reachability problem.
    # For this class of matrices (which includes permutation matrices), the problem is known to be W[1]-hard.
    # The hardness stems from the fact that matrix multiplication can simulate non-deterministic computations,
    # and the parameter k corresponds to the number of computation steps.
    answer_c = "W[1]-hard"
