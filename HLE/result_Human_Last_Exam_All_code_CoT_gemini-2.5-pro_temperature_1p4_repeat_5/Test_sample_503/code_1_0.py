# Define the parameters from the problem statement.
# We are looking for the number of internal adjunctions from [m] to [n].
m = 23
n = 37

# The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).
comb_n = n + m
comb_k = m

# Calculate the value of the binomial coefficient.
num_adjunctions = math.comb(comb_n, comb_k)

# Print the final equation, showing all the numbers involved.
