    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position**: First, I'll set up the chessboard according to the 34 moves provided. The final position is crucial for determining the next best moves. The board state is represented by the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) `4r1k1/5p1p/6p1/Q1pPn1K1/4P3/P4PP1/7r/3R4 b - - 1 34`. It is Black's turn to move.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate Moves**: I will look for forceful moves for Black, especially checks, as White's king is extremely exposed on g5. The most promising candidate moves that put the White king in immediate danger are:\n    *   `... h5+`\n    *   `... Rh5+`\n    *   `... Re5+`\n    *   `... Nf3+`\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves**: I'll evaluate each candidate move to see if it leads to a forced checkmate.\n    *   `... Rh5+`, `... Re5+`, or `... Nf3+` allow the White king to escape to a square where there is no immediate mate.\n    *   The move `... h5+` is the most powerful. It is a check, and it forces White to respond. White has only three legal moves for the king: `Kf4`, `Kf6`, and `Kh6`.\n\n4.  **Find the Mating Sequence**: I will analyze Black's response to each of White's possible moves after `... h5+`.\n    *   If White plays `35. Kf4`, Black responds with `35... Rf2#` (checkmate).\n    *   If White plays `35. Kf6`, Black responds with `35... Rh6#` (checkmate).\n    *   If White plays `35. Kh6`, Black responds with `35... Re6#` (checkmate).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since every possible reply by White to `34... h5+` results in checkmate on Black's next move, this is a forced mate in 2. This is the shortest possible mating sequence as there is no mate in 1. I will select one of these variations to present as the solution.\n\n6.  **Format the Output**: I will provide a Python script that prints the selected mating sequence in standard algebraic notation, without move numbers, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.pgn\nimport io\n\ndef find_and_print_mating_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies and prints the shortest mating sequence for the given chess position.\n    The plan is to:\n    1.
