    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\psi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the induced maps on homotopy groups $\\psi_*: \\pi_k(\\text{source}) \\to \\pi_k(\\text{target})$.\n\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $n$-connected if $f_*: \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(B)$ is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and an epimorphism (a surjection) for $k = n$. We need to find the largest such $n$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the source and target spaces in terms of familiar topological spaces.\n2.  Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i \\le k$.\n3.  Calculate the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups for both the source and target spaces.\n4.  Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group. This map relates the Samelson product in the source to the Whitehead product, which gets identified with the fundamental class in the target. It is known to be an isomorphism.\n5.  Based on the map's behavior on $\\pi_k$, determine the connectivity. The connectivity will be $n$ if the map on $\\pi_k$ is an isomorphism for $k<n$ and surjective for $k=n$.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n1.  **Spaces:**\n    *   Let the source be $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   Let the target be $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since the smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, the target is $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of Spaces:**\n    *   **Source A:**\n        *   The $n$-sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n        *   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ decreases connectivity by 1. So, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-1-1)=2$-connected.\n        *   Similarly, $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-1-1)=4$-connected.\n        *   For a $p$-connected space $X$ and a $q$-connected space $Y$, the smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n        *   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1. So, the source $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. This means $\\pi_k(A) = 0$ for $k \\le 8$.\n    *   **Target B:**\n        *   The target $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$. The space $S^{10}$ is $(10-1)=9$-connected.\n        *   Looping decreases connectivity by one, so $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected. This means $\\pi_k(B)=0$ for $k \\le 8$.\n\n3.  **Analysis of $\\pi_k$ for $k \\le 9$:**\n    *   For $k \\le 8$, both $\\pi_k(A)$ and $\\pi_k(B)$ are the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. The map between them is necessarily an isomorphism.\n    *   Now, let's examine $k=9$.\n        *   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies, giving $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The lowest dimensional cell in $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is of dimension $(4-1)+(6-1)=8$. Thus, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $\\psi_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This map is known to be an isomorphism, as it relates the fundamental Samelson product in the source to the fundamental class in the target.\n    *   Since the map is an isomorphism on $\\pi_k$ for all $k \\le 9$, the map is at least 10-connected.\n\n4.  **Analysis of $\\pi_{10}$ and Conclusion:**\n    *   To be 10-connected, the map $\\psi_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ must be an epimorphism.\n    *   Let's compute these groups:\n        *   $\\pi_{10}(A) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The 9-skeleton of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to its 8-skeleton, which is $S^8$. Therefore, $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_9(S^8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n        *   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. This is a stable homotopy group of spheres, $\\pi_{11-10}^S = \\pi_1^S$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   So, $\\psi_{10,*}: \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. For the map to be 10-connected, this must be surjective (and hence an isomorphism). However, this map fails to be an isomorphism because it does not preserve the higher-order structures (related to Toda brackets). The map is actually the zero map.\n    *   Since $\\psi_{10,*}$ is not an epimorphism, the map is not 10-connected by definition.\n    *   Let's recheck the definition of n-connectivity. Some authors define n-connectedness as having $\\pi_k$ iso for $k \\le n$. Others use $k < n$ and epi at $n$. Using the standard definition ($\\pi_k$ is an iso for $k<n$ and an epi for $k=n$), since $\\psi_*: \\pi_k \\to \\pi_k$ is an isomorphism for $k \\le 9$, the map is $n$-connected for all $n \\le 10$. The connectivity is the largest such $n$. We need to check $\\pi_{10}$. As argued, this map is not epi. So the connectivity is exactly 10. Let's calculate $m+n$.\n    \nLet $m=4$ and $n=6$. The connectivity of this specific map is known to be $m+n$.\n\n```python\n# The dimensions of the spheres in the problem definition\nm = 4\nn = 6\n\n# The connectivity of the source space, Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n)\n# Connectivity of Omega S^m is m-2\n# Connectivity of Omega S^n is n-2\n# Connectivity of the smash product is (m-2) + (n-2) + 1 = m+n-3\n# Connectivity of the suspension is (m+n-3)+1 = m+n-2\nconnectivity_source = m + n - 2\nprint(f\"Let m={m} and n={n}.\")\nprint(f\"The source space Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) is {connectivity_source}-connected.\")\n\n# The connectivity of the target space, Omega(S^m wedge S^n) = Omega(S^{m+n})\n# Connectivity is (m+n)-2\nconnectivity_target = m + n - 2\nprint(f\"The target space Omega(S^{m} wedge S^{n}) is {connectivity_target}-connected.\")\n\n# The map is an isomorphism on pi_k for k <= m+n-1\niso_up_to = m + n - 1\nprint(f\"The map is an isomorphism on homotopy groups up to dimension {iso_up_to}.\")\n\n# The connectivity of the map is the largest n such that pi_k is an\n# isomorphism for k < n and an epimorphism for k = n.\n# Since the map is an isomorphism for k <= m+n-1 = 9, it is at least 10-connected.\n# At dimension m+n=10, the map is from Z_2 to Z_2, which is not an epimorphism.\n# Thus, the connectivity is m+n.\nconnectivity_map = m + n\nprint(f\"The map is an epimorphism on pi_{m+n-1}, but not on pi_{m+n}.\")\nprint(f\"The connectivity of the map is m + n = {m} + {n} = {connectivity_map}.\")\n```\n<<<10>>>"
