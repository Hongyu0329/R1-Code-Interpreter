    "My plan is to identify the radical for the Japanese character 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn transcription.\n\n1.  **Identify the character:** The character is 謄.\n2.  **Determine the radical:** The character 謄 is composed of two parts: a left side and a right side. The radical is the classificatory component, which for this character is the part on the left: 言. This radical relates to speech, words, or language.\n3.  **Find the Japanese name for the radical:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, its specific name is ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Transcribe the name into Hepburn:** The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Create a Python script:** The script will simply print this information in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji '謄' and prints its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言.\n    # When used as the left part of a character (hen), its name is ごんべん.\n    # The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu/radical for the character '{kanji}' is {radical_name_hepburn}.\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
