    "This is a historical question that requires looking up information from historical records rather than performing a calculation. I will search through historical data and present the answer in a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the history of the town of Bártfa (Bardejov), focusing on its governance in the 15th century.\n2.  Identify historical records, such as town chronicles or lists of officials, to find the name of the judge (in Hungarian: bíró, in German: Richter) for the year 1461.\n3.  Once the name is found, I will create a simple Python script.\n4.  The script will store the year and the judge's name in variables.\n5.  It will then print a sentence stating who the judge was in that specific year, fulfilling the request to use code to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    judge_name = \"Mikuláš Polner\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in the year {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa()\n```\n<<<Mikuláš Polner>>>"
