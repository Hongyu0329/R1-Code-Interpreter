    The key information is found in the Le Monde press article from 2011, which discusses the restored version of the film broadcast on Arte.
    The article explicitly mentions a scene added back into the film's ending.

    The original French text states:
    '...la restauration de la fondation Murnau rétablit un élément fondamental : la vengeance accomplie, Etzel, le roi des Huns, soulève au-dessus du carnage environnant son fils, qu\\'il a eu avec Kriemhild.'

    This translates to:
    '...the restoration by the Murnau Foundation re-establishes a fundamental element: the revenge accomplished, Etzel, the king of the Huns, lifts his son, whom he had with Kriemhild, above the surrounding carnage.'

    This description directly matches the following answer choice:
    D. A shot of Etzel lifts his infant son amidst the carnage.
