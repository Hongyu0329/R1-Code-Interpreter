# Based on the mathematical derivation, the expression to be calculated simplifies considerably.
# The original expression is (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15.
# Our derivation shows that ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# Substituting this into the expression, the fraction term (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1)
# becomes (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1), which simplifies to 1.
# So, the final calculation is 1 + 10^15.

# Define the numbers in the final simplified equation.
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15

# Calculate the result of the expression.
result = term1 + term2

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
