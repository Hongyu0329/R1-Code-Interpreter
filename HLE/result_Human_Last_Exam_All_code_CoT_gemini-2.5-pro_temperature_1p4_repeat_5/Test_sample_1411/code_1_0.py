    This function solves the user's query about the text on Steve McQueen's watch.
    
    Plan:
    1. Identify the watch: The prompt refers to Steve McQueen's iconic watch with a date window, which is the Heuer Monaco from the film 'Le Mans'.
    2. Examine the dial: The date window on this watch is at the 6 o'clock position.
    3. Interpret "directly above": Since no text is immediately touching the top of the date window, this is interpreted as the text at the top of the dial (12 o'clock), which is the brand name.
    4. Identify the text: The brand name on the watch is "HEUER".
    5. Format the output: Convert the identified text to all lower case.

    answer = text_on_watch.lower()
