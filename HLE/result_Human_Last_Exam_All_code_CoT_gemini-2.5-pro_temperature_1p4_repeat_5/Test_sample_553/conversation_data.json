    "This is a music theory question. To answer it, I need to access my knowledge base of The Beatles' discography and the chord progressions used in their songs.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the request**: The user is asking for a specific Beatles song that begins with a distinct chord change: from the tonic chord (the \"home\" chord of the key, represented by the Roman numeral I) to the minor fifth chord (a minor chord built on the 5th note of the scale, represented by 'v').\n2.  **Translate the theory**: In a major key, the standard chord on the 5th degree is major (V). A I -> v progression is unusual and creates a distinct, somewhat melancholic or soulful sound. For example, in the key of G Major, the tonic (I) is a G Major chord. The fifth note is D, so the minor fifth chord (v) would be D minor. The progression would be G Major -> D minor.\n3.  **Scan for candidates**: I will mentally review famous Beatles song intros to find a match for this I -> v pattern.\n    *   \"Help!\" (A -> C#m -> F#m...) is I -> iii -> vi. No.\n    *   \"A Hard Day's Night\" (Gsus4/D...). No.\n    *   \"Michelle\" has a famous C -> Gm progression (\"I want you...\"), which is I -> v in the key of C, but this happens in the bridge, not the start of the song.\n    *   \"Got to Get You Into My Life\" starts with a powerful brass fanfare. Let's analyze its chords.\n4.  **Confirm the match**: The song \"Got to Get You Into My Life\" is in the key of G Major. The opening brass section plays the progression G -> Dm7 -> C. The first two chords are G Major (the tonic, I) and D minor 7th (the minor fifth, v7). This is a perfect match for the user's query.\n5.  **Construct the code**: I will write a Python script that states the answer and explains the music theory behind it, as requested. The code will print the song title, the key, and the specific chords that form the I -> v progression, including their numerical degrees to satisfy the prompt's constraints.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song that starts with a I -> v chord progression\n    and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Got to Get You Into My Life\"\n    key = \"G Major\"\n    \n    # In the key of G Major:\n    # The tonic chord (I) is G Major. The Roman numeral is I, representing the 1st degree.\n    tonic_chord_name = \"G Major\"\n    tonic_degree = 1\n    \n    # The minor fifth chord (v) is a minor chord built on the 5th degree of the scale.\n    # The 5th degree is D, so the chord is D minor.\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"D minor\"\n    minor_fifth_degree = 5\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: '{song_title}'\")\n    print(f\"This progression happens in the opening brass fanfare of the song.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The song's key: {key}\")\n    print(\"The musical 'equation' for the chord progression is:\")\n    \n    # The final output needs to include the numbers from the 'equation'\n    print(f\"Chord 1 (Tonic): {tonic_chord_name} (Degree: {tonic_degree})\")\n    print(f\"Chord 2 (Minor Fifth): {minor_fifth_chord_name} (Degree: {minor_fifth_degree}, minor quality)\")\n    \nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Got to Get You Into My Life>>>"
