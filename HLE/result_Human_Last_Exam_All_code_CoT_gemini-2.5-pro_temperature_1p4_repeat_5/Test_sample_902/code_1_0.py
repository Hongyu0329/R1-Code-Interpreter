The question is whether a program 'P' exists that can compute `def_superfast(10000)`.
The answer is no. Such a program is impossible to create due to fundamental limits in computer science. Here is the reasoning:

Step 1: Analyzing the Function's Goal
For n=10000, the function is defined as:
1.  Consider all possible Python programs with source code shorter than 10000 characters.
2.  Find the largest integer that any of these programs can return. This is `Huge_int`.
3.  The function's output should be `Huge_int + 1`.

Step 2: The Halting Problem
To find `Huge_int`, a master program 'P' would need to test every potential program string. However, some of these programs contain infinite loops (e.g., `x = 1; while x > 0: x += 1`). If 'P' tries to run such a program to see its output, 'P' itself will get stuck and never finish. To avoid this, 'P' would need to be able to predict if a program will halt or loop forever without running it. This is the "Halting Problem," which Alan Turing proved is impossible to solve with a general algorithm.

Step 3: The Self-Referential Paradox
Even if we could magically solve the Halting Problem, a deeper paradox exists.
-   Let's assume our program 'P' *does* exist and can compute the final number. Let's call this number 'S'.
-   We can certainly write the source code for 'P' to be less than 10000 characters long.
-   By definition, `S = Huge_int + 1`. This means 'S' is larger than the output of *any* program shorter than 10000 characters.
-   But our program 'P' is itself a program shorter than 10000 characters, and it outputs the number 'S'.
-   This leads to a contradiction: The output 'S' must be larger than the output of program 'P' (which is 'S'). This means `S > S`, which is a logical impossibility.

Conclusion:
The premise that a program 'P' to compute `def_superfast(10000)` can exist leads to a logical contradiction. Therefore, no such program can exist. The value it attempts to describe is uncomputable.

The final equation is symbolic, as its components cannot be computed:
"""
    print(explanation)
    # The user asked to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # Since they are uncomputable, we present them symbolically.
    print("def_superfast(10000) = Huge_int + 1")
