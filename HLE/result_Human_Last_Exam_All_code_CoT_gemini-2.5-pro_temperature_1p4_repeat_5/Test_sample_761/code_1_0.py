    # Provide the reasoning.

    print("\n1. Different Monomers (Building Blocks):")
    print("   - Polysaccharides are polymers made of simple sugar units called 'monosaccharides' (e.g., glucose, fructose).")
    print("   - Polynucleotides (like DNA and RNA) are polymers made of 'nucleotides'. A nucleotide is a far more complex monomer consisting of three separate parts: a phosphate group, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogenous base.")
    
    # Reason 2: Different chemical linkage in the backbone.
    print("\n2. Different Backbone and Linkage:")
    print("   - In polysaccharides, the monosaccharide units are linked directly to each other via 'glycosidic bonds' to form a sugar chain.")
    print("   - In polynucleotides, the backbone is a repeating 'sugar-phosphate backbone'. The nucleotides are joined by 'phosphodiester bonds', which link the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar of the next.")
          
    # Concluding summary.
    print("\nIn summary: Although both contain sugar components, the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases in polynucleotides, and the completely different type of chemical bond (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic) that forms the polymer backbone, makes them structurally distinct molecules.")
