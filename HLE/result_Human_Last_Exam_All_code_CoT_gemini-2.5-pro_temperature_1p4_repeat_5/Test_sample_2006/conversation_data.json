    "This riddle is a multi-step puzzle. Here is the thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Title**: The title, \"The Bays,\" is a homophone for \"The B's.\" This suggests the goal is to solve for a variable, which we'll call `B`. The plural \"B's\" hints that there might be more than one solution, a common outcome when solving polynomial equations.\n\n2.  **Formulate an Equation**: The haiku's three lines can be interpreted as clues for the coefficients of a quadratic equation, `aB² + bB + c = 0`, which has two roots (our two \"B's\").\n    *   **a = 1**: The third line, \"A divine one yields,\" gives us our first coefficient. \"A...one\" points to the number 1.\n    *   **b = -8**: The first line, \"An August tempest,\" gives us the second. \"August\" is the 8th month, and a \"tempest\" is a violent, negative event, implying the coefficient is -8.\n    *   **c = 15**: The second line, \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change,\" gives us the third. We take the number \"fifteen\".\n\n3.  **Solve for \"The B's\"**: This gives us the equation `1B² - 8B + 15 = 0`. Solving this equation yields two roots for B. This can be solved by factoring `(B - 3)(B - 5) = 0`, which gives the solutions `B = 3` and `B = 5`.\n\n4.  **Find the Final Answer**: The prompt asks for a single answer, \"in alphabetical order\". We take our two numerical solutions, 3 and 5, and sort them to get `[3, 5]`. The first one in the list is 3. The third letter of the alphabet is C.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to solve the riddle.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle presented in the haiku \"The Bays\".\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. The title \"The Bays\" implies we are solving for \"The B's\", the roots of an equation.\n    2. The haiku provides coefficients for a quadratic equation (a*B^2 + b*B + c = 0).\n       - a = 1, from \"A divine one yields\".\n       - b = -8, from \"An August tempest\" (August is the 8th month, tempest implies a negative).\n       - c = 15, from \"Twice fifteen...\".\n    3. The equation is B^2 - 8B + 15 = 0. We solve for the roots B.\n    4. The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\", so we sort the roots and\n       select the first one.\n    5. The final answer is the letter of the alphabet corresponding to that number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coefficients derived from the haiku\n    a = 1\n    b = -8\n    c = 15\n\n    print(\"The riddle suggests a quadratic equation based on its clues.\")\n    print(\"The derived equation is:\")\n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"{a}*B^2 + ({b})*B + {c} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    discriminant = (b**2) - (4*a*c)\n\n    # Check if the equation has real roots\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"The equation has no real roots.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the two solutions (the \"B's\")\n    root1 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n    root2 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\n    # The \"B's\" are the integer values of the roots\n    b_solutions = sorted([int(root1), int(root2)])\n\n    print(f\"The solutions, or 'The B\\'s', are: {b_solutions[0]} and {b_solutions[1]}\")\n    print(f\"In alphabetical (numerical) order, the solutions are: {b_solutions}\")\n\n    # Per the instructions, we take the first answer in alphabetical order\n    numerical_answer = b_solutions[0]\n    print(f\"The first answer in the ordered list is: {numerical_answer}\")\n\n    # Convert the number to the corresponding letter (A=1, B=2, C=3...)\n    final_answer = chr(ord('A') + numerical_answer - 1)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The {numerical_answer}rd letter of the alphabet is the final answer.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer}\")\n\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
