    Solves the riddle presented in the haiku "The Bays".

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The title "The Bays" implies we are solving for "The B's", the roots of an equation.
    2. The haiku provides coefficients for a quadratic equation (a*B^2 + b*B + c = 0).
       - a = 1, from "A divine one yields".
       - b = -8, from "An August tempest" (August is the 8th month, tempest implies a negative).
       - c = 15, from "Twice fifteen...".
    3. The equation is B^2 - 8B + 15 = 0. We solve for the roots B.
    4. The question asks for the answer "in alphabetical order", so we sort the roots and
       select the first one.
    5. The final answer is the letter of the alphabet corresponding to that number.
