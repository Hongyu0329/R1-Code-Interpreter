# The dimension of the log blowup can be determined by translating the problem
# from log geometry into standard algebraic geometry.

# Step 1: Identify the ambient space and its dimension.
# The log structure is given by the monoid M = N^3. This corresponds to the
# ring of functions k[x, y, z], whose spectrum is the 3-dimensional affine space, A^3.
# The rank of the lattice associated with the monoid N^3 is 3.
dim_ambient_space = 3
print(f"The log structure given by the monoid N^3 corresponds to an ambient space of dimension {dim_ambient_space}.")
print(f"This space is the 3-dimensional affine space, A^3.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Identify the center of the blowup.
# The log ideal I is generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0). In the ring k[x, y, z],
# these correspond to the monomials 'x' and 'y'.
# The blowup is performed along the subvariety Z defined by the ideal (x, y).
ideal_generators = ["x", "y"]
print(f"The log ideal corresponds to the ideal I = ({', '.join(ideal_generators)}) in the coordinate ring of A^3.")
print("The center of the blowup, Z, is the subvariety where the ideal's generators are all zero.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Use the property of blowups to determine the dimension.
# The blowup of an irreducible variety X along a proper subvariety Z, denoted Bl_Z(X),
# is birational to X and thus has the same dimension as X.
# dim(Bl_Z(X)) = dim(X)
print("The dimension of the log blowup is the dimension of the blowup of A^3 along Z.")
print("A blowup does not change the dimension of the ambient space.")
print("Therefore, the following equation holds:")
print(f"Dimension of Log Blowup = Dimension of A^3")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 4: State the final dimension.
final_dimension = dim_ambient_space
print("The final dimension is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Dimension of Log Blowup = {final_dimension}")
