    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Here is the step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution using a Python script.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Toroidal Board:** A 5x5 toroidal board is a grid where the edges wrap around. This means that calculations for rows and columns are done modulo 5. A queen at position `(r1, c1)` attacks a queen at `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Row attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal attack:** On a toroidal board, this corresponds to two conditions:\n        1.  `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n        2.  `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n\n2.  **Use a Backtracking Algorithm:** The problem asks for the number of combinations of 4 squares on the 25-square board that satisfy the non-attacking condition. Since the board size is small, we can use a backtracking search to explore all possibilities systematically.\n\n3.  **Implement the Search:**\n    *   We'll create a recursive function that tries to place queens one by one.\n    *   To avoid counting the same arrangement multiple times (e.g., placing queens at A then B vs. B then A), we'll linearize the board into 25 squares (indexed 0 to 24) and only place the next queen at an index greater than the previously placed one.\n    *   The recursive function, let's call it `solve(queens_to_place, start_index, placements)`, will work as follows:\n        *   **Base Case:** If `queens_to_place` is 0, we have successfully placed all 4 queens. We increment our solution counter.\n        *   **Recursive Step:** Iterate through each square from `start_index`. For each square, check if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (doesn't attack any queens in the current `placements`).\n        *   If it's safe, add the new position to `placements` and make a recursive call to place the next queen: `solve(queens_to_place - 1, current_index + 1, placements)`.\n        *   After the call returns, we \"backtrack\" by removing the queen we just placed. This allows the algorithm to explore other branches of the search tree.\n\n4.  **Final Code:** The logic will be encapsulated in a Python script. This script will set up the initial parameters (5x5 board, 4 queens), run the backtracking search, and print the final count in a descriptive sentence as requested.\n\n```python\nclass ToroidalNQueens:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on an N x N toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, n, k):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the solver.\n        :param n: The size of the board (n x n).\n        :param k: The number of queens to place.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.n = n\n        self.k = k\n        self.count = 0\n        self.board_size = n * n\n\n    def _is_safe(self, r1, c1, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r1, c1) is safe with respect to already placed queens.\n        A queen at (r1, c1) attacks (r2, c2) if:\n        - r1 = r2 (same row)\n        - c1 = c2 (same column)\n        - (r1 - c1) % n = (r2 - c2) % n (same diagonal)\n        - (r1 + c1) % n = (r2 + c2) % n (same anti-diagonal)\n        \"\"\"\n        for r2, c2 in queens:\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                return False\n            if (r1 - c1) % self.n == (r2 - c2) % self.n:\n                return False\n            if (r1 + c1) % self.n == (r2 + c2) % self.n:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def _solve_recursive(self, queens_to_place, start_index, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        The recursive backtracking function to find valid placements.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if all queens are placed, we found a valid solution.\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            self.count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Optimization: if remaining squares are not enough to place remaining queens\n        if self.board_size - start_index < queens_to_place:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all squares on the board starting from 'start_index'\n        for i in range(start_index, self.board_size):\n            r = i // self.n\n            c = i % self.n\n\n            # If it's safe to place a queen here\n            if self._is_safe(r, c, queens):\n                # Place the queen\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recur for the next queen, starting from the next square\n                self._solve_recursive(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                queens.pop()\n\n    def find_solutions(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Public method to start the search and return the total count.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.count = 0\n        if self.k == 0:\n            return 1\n        if self.k > self.board_size:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Start the recursive search\n        self._solve_recursive(self.k, 0, [])\n        return self.count\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n# Define the problem parameters\nN_board_size = 5\nK_queens = 4\n\n# Create a solver instance and run the calculation\nsolver = ToroidalNQueens(n=N_board_size, k=K_queens)\nresult = solver.find_solutions()\n\n# Print the final result including the numbers from the problem statement\nprint(f\"On a {N_board_size}x{N_board_size} toroidal board, {K_queens} non-attacking queens can be placed in {result} ways.\")\n```\n<<<250>>>"
