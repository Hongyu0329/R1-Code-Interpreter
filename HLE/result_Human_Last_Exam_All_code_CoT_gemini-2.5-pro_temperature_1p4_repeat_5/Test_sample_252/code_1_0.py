    # The problem asks for the minimum number of physical diffraction grating
    # components required to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (X, Y, lambda)
    # from a single 2D image.

    # This technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).
    # CT requires multiple "projections" from different angles to reconstruct a 3D volume.
    # In CTIS, a projection is a spectrally dispersed image of the scene.

    # A single 1D grating only disperses light along one axis, providing projections
    # from only one direction. This is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.

    # A single 2D grating, however, is a single physical component that disperses light
    # into a 2D pattern of diffraction orders. Each order represents a projection
    # from a unique angle. Capturing these multiple projections simultaneously on
    # one sensor (a single image) provides the necessary data for reconstruction.
