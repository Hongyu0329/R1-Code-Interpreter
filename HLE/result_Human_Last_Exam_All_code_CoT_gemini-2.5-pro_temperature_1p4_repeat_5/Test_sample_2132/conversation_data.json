    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction and Product**: The Favorskii rearrangement is a reaction of an α-halo ketone (a ketone with a halogen on the adjacent carbon) with a base. In this case, 2-chlorocyclohexanone reacts with a base to form a ring-contracted product. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Formula**: The chemical formula for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is **C6H10O2**.\n3.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity**: The Böttcher Molecular Complexity index (CI) is calculated based on the number and types of non-hydrogen atoms (skeletal atoms) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    `CI = N_skeletal * log2(N_skeletal) - Σ [n_i * log2(n_i)]`\n    Where:\n    *   `N_skeletal` is the total number of skeletal atoms.\n    *   `n_i` is the number of atoms of element type `i`.\n4.  **Calculate the Complexity**:\n    *   For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2), the skeletal atoms are Carbon (C) and Oxygen (O).\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms (`n_C`) = 6.\n    *   Number of Oxygen atoms (`n_O`) = 2.\n    *   Total skeletal atoms (`N_skeletal`) = 6 + 2 = 8.\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n        `CI = 8 * log2(8) - (6 * log2(6) + 2 * log2(2))`\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result along with the full equation showing the substituted values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the product and its skeletal atoms.\n    # The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2).\n    # The skeletal (non-hydrogen) atoms are 6 carbons and 2 oxygens.\n    n_C = 6  # Number of Carbon atoms\n    n_O = 2  # Number of Oxygen atoms\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of skeletal atoms (N_skeletal).\n    N_skeletal = n_C + n_O\n\n    # Step 3: Define the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula.\n    # CI = N_skeletal*log2(N_skeletal) - SUM(n_i * log2(n_i))\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate each term of the formula.\n    log2_N = math.log2(N_skeletal)\n    log2_C = math.log2(n_C)\n    log2_O = math.log2(n_O)\n\n    term1 = N_skeletal * log2_N\n    term_C = n_C * log2_C\n    term_O = n_O * log2_O\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final complexity index.\n    complexity = term1 - (term_C + term_O)\n\n    # Step 6: Print the results and the equation.\n    print(\"The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2).\")\n    print(\"\\nBöttcher Molecular Complexity Calculation:\")\n    print(\"Formula: CI = N_skeletal * log2(N_skeletal) - (n_C * log2(n_C) + n_O * log2(n_O))\")\n    print(f\"\\nValues:\")\n    print(f\"  n_C (Carbon atoms) = {n_C}\")\n    print(f\"  n_O (Oxygen atoms) = {n_O}\")\n    print(f\"  N_skeletal (Total skeletal atoms) = {N_skeletal}\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with all numbers substituted\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{N_skeletal} * log2({N_skeletal}) - ({n_C} * log2({n_C}) + {n_O} * log2({n_O}))\")\n    print(f\"= {N_skeletal:.3f} * {log2_N:.3f} - ({n_C:.3f} * {log2_C:.3f} + {n_O:.3f} * {log2_O:.3f})\")\n    print(f\"= {term1:.3f} - ({term_C:.3f} + {term_O:.3f})\")\n    print(f\"= {term1:.3f} - {term_C + term_O:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"= {complexity:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is {complexity:.3f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bottcher_complexity()\n\n```\n<<<6.490>>>"
