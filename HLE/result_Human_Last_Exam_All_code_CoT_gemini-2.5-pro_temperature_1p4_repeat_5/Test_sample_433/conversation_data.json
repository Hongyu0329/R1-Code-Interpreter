    "The task is to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule after it has been opened in a sterile environment and present this information using a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first identify the standard guidelines that define the BUD for sterile products. The primary source for this information in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically chapter <797> on sterile compounding.\n2.  According to USP <797>, a single-dose container, such as an ampule, that is opened in a sterile environment (defined as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air environment) must be used within 12 hours.\n3.  I will create a Python script that defines variables for the container type, the environment, and the BUD in hours.\n4.  The script will then use an f-string to construct a clear, informative sentence stating this rule.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the resulting sentence, explicitly including the number `12` as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    opened in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters based on the query\n    container_type = \"single-dose container ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n    \n    # The BUD according to USP <797> guidelines\n    bud_in_hours = 12\n    \n    # The \"equation\" here is simply stating the resulting number for the BUD.\n    # The final output will explicitly show the number 12.\n    print(f\"For a {container_type} opened in a {environment}, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is up to {bud_in_hours} hours after the time of puncture.\")\n    print(f\"The final number for the BUD is: {bud_in_hours}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<Up to 12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
