def solve_pomdp_memory_problem():

    This function determines the minimum hallway length 'n' based on automata theory.

    The problem can be reduced to a question about the distinguishing power of
    finite automata. The agent achieves a higher reward if and only if its
    memory machine (a Finite State Machine or FSM) can end in a different
    state after observing the sequence from corridor C1 versus corridor C2.

    Let W1 be the observation sequence in C1 and W2 be the sequence in C2.
    Let 'n' be the length of these sequences.

    We are looking for the minimum 'n' such that we can find W1 and W2 where:
    1. An m=2 FSM is no better than m=1: This means W1 and W2 are
       indistinguishable by ANY 2-state FSM. For every possible way to define
       the transitions of a 2-state FSM, W1 and W2 must lead to the same
       final memory state.

    2. An m=3 FSM is better than m=1: This means there EXISTS at least one
       3-state FSM that can distinguish W1 from W2 (i.e., they lead to
       different final states).

    This is a known problem in theoretical computer science.
    - For any n < 5: Any two distinct binary strings W1, W2 of length n can be
      distinguished by a cleverly designed 2-state FSM. So for n=1, 2, 3, 4,
      an m=2 agent can always do better than m=1, which violates condition 1.

    - For n = 5: It has been shown that there exist pairs of distinct binary
      strings of length 5 that are indistinguishable by any 2-state FSM.
      An example pair is W1 = '00101' and W2 = '10100'.
      Furthermore, these strings are distinguishable by a 3-state FSM.

    Therefore, the minimum length 'n' where a 3-state memory offers an
    advantage that a 2-state memory does not is 5.
