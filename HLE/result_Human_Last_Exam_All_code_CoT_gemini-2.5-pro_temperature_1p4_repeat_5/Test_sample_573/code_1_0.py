    Calculates the number of n-simplices for N=200, k=13, and n<=5.

    An n-simplex in N_â€¢(Z_N)_k/ corresponds to a non-decreasing sequence of
    n+1 integers (x_0, ..., x_n) where k <= x_0 <= ... <= x_n <= N.

    This is a combinatorial problem of choosing n+1 numbers from the set
    {k, k+1, ..., N} with replacement.
    The size of this set is M = N - k + 1.
    The number of n-simplices is given by the multiset coefficient C(M + (n+1) - 1, n+1),
    which simplifies to C(M + n, n+1).
