    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we first need to understand the frequency of the sound produced by muscle contractions and then compare it to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the frequency range of sound produced by human muscle twitches.** This sound, known as mechanomyography (MMG), is a very low-frequency vibration.\n2.  **Gather the approximate hearing frequency ranges for each animal** listed in the answer choices (Human, Dog, Bat, Whale, Herring).\n3.  **Compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range.** The animal whose hearing range best covers the low-frequency sound of a muscle twitch is the most likely candidate.\n4.  **Write a Python script** to display these frequency ranges, perform the comparison, and print a conclusion.\n\nThe sound from a human muscle twitch is extremely faint and occurs at a very low frequency, typically between 5 Hz and 30 Hz. Now let's analyze the hearing capabilities of the given animals.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a given list is most likely to hear a human muscle twitch\n    by comparing their hearing ranges to the twitch's frequency.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    # It's a very low-frequency and faint sound.\n    muscle_twitch_freq_low = 5  # in Hertz (Hz)\n    muscle_twitch_freq_high = 30 # in Hertz (Hz)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the hearing capabilities of different animals.\")\n    print(f\"The sound frequency of a human muscle twitch is very low, around {muscle_twitch_freq_low} Hz to {muscle_twitch_freq_high} Hz.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate hearing ranges for the animals.\n    # Note: These are typical ranges and can vary.\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        \"A.
