    "This problem requires interpreting terms from arithmetic geometry and topology. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Terms**: The question involves specialized terms. Based on the context of squarefree numbers $(N)$ and covolume $(V)$, a standard interpretation comes from the theory of Shimura curves.\n    *   **N**: A squarefree natural number, interpreted as the discriminant of an indefinite quaternion algebra over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **V**: The covolume of a Fuchsian group, interpreted as the hyperbolic area of the associated Shimura curve, denoted $X(N)$. The area is related to the discriminant by the formula $V = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\phi(N)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n    *   **$k_{k,\\infty}$**: This non-standard notation is interpreted as a measure of the maximum \"size\" of the space. A plausible candidate for this is the **diameter** of the Shimura curve $X(N)$, equipped with its natural hyperbolic metric.\n\n2.  **Relate Geometric Quantities**: The goal is to find an upper bound for the diameter in terms of the area $V$. We can do this by using the genus of the surface as an intermediary.\n    *   The genus $g$ of the Shimura curve $X(N)$ is related to its discriminant for large $N$ by the approximation $g \\approx \\frac{\\phi(N)}{12}$.\n    *   Using the formula for the area, we can express the genus in terms of $V$: $g \\approx \\frac{1}{12} \\left(\\frac{6V}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{V}{2\\pi}$.\n\n3.  **Apply a Known Theorem**: We use a known result from Riemannian geometry that bounds the diameter of a hyperbolic surface in terms of its genus. A suitable result is Zograf's inequality, which states that for a surface $S$ of genus $g \\ge 2$:\n    $$ \\text{diameter}(S) \\le 2 \\operatorname{arccosh}(6g - 5) $$\n\n4.  **Combine and Finalize**: By substituting the expression for the genus $g$ in terms of the area $V$ into Zograf's inequality, we obtain the final formula for the upper bound.\n    $$ k_{k,\\infty} \\le 2 \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(6\\left(\\frac{V}{2\\pi}\\right) - 5\\right) = 2 \\operatorname{arccosh}\\left(\\frac{3V}{\\pi} - 5\\right) $$\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: The final step is to create a Python script that presents this formula and, as requested, explicitly prints the integer constants that appear in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The relationship between the maximum norm (interpreted as diameter) and the covolume (area)\n# is derived from established theorems in geometry for hyperbolic surfaces.\n# The final formula for the upper bound is:\n# k_k_inf <= 2 * arccosh((3*V / pi) - 5)\n# This formula is valid for sufficiently large V, where the underlying genus is at least 2.\n\nprint(\"The equation for the upper bound is: k_k,inf <= 2 * arccosh((3*V / pi) - 5)\")\n\n# As requested by the prompt, we output each number that appears in this final equation.\nprint(\"\\nThe integer constants in this equation are:\")\n\nnum1 = 2\nnum2 = 3\nnum3 = 5\n\nprint(num1)\nprint(num2)\nprint(num3)\n```\n<<<2*arccosh((3*V/pi)-5)>>>"
