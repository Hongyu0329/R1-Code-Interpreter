    This function presents the solution for the smallest integer length rectangle
    admitting a non-guillotine tiling by squares from S={2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7}.
    
    The smallest known such rectangle is 12x11, with an area of 132.
    This solution is based on known results from tiling theory. Proving its minimality
    and the existence of a non-guillotine tiling is a complex mathematical problem.
