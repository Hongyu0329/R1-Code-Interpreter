    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button, we need to consult a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening range chart for a 100BB rake-free cash game. Here is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position and Action:** The button (BTN) is the most profitable position in poker. You are last to act post-flop, which gives you a significant informational advantage. Because of this, you can profitably play a very wide range of hands. An open-raise to 2.5x is a standard size.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Suited Hands:** Suited hands are particularly valuable because they can make flushes, which are very strong hands. This added \"equity\" from the flush potential means that even suited hands with low-ranking cards are often profitable to play, especially from a late position like the button.\n\n3.  **Consult a GTO Range:** GTO solvers have calculated the optimal pre-flop strategies for these common scenarios. For a 100BB, 2.5x open from the button, the standard GTO range is extremely wide, often including 40-50% of all possible starting hands.\n\n4.  **Identify the Suited Jacks:** The possible suited jack hands are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n5.  **Determine the Cutoff:** In virtually all standard GTO button opening ranges for this scenario, *all* suited Jack combinations are considered profitable opens. Their ability to make strong flushes and straights (or at least strong top pairs) outweighs their weakness when they don't connect with the board. Since all of them are considered standard open-raises, the \"worst\" one is simply the one with the lowest kicker card.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The weakest hand in the suited jack category is Jack-Two suited. Therefore, J2s is the worst suited jack you should still open from the button.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game.\n\n    Based on standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop charts for a 100BB, 2.5x open-raise from the button,\n    the opening range is very wide.
