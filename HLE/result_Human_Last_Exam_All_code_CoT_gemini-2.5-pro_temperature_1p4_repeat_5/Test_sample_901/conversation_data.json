    "Of course. Here is the analysis of the reaction and the identification of its product, presented as a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Substrate**: We'll start by examining the starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. We need to determine the spatial relationship (cis/trans) between the bromo and methyl groups and then find the most stable chair conformation.\n2.  **Consider the Reaction Conditions**: The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and sterically bulky base. This strongly suggests an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n3.  **Apply E2 Reaction Rules**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement. We will analyze the chair conformation of the substrate to see which protons can be eliminated.\n4.  **Determine Regioselectivity**: When more than one type of proton can be eliminated, we must determine which elimination is preferred. The bulky base will preferentially remove the least sterically hindered proton, leading to the Hofmann (less substituted) product.\n5.  **Identify the Final Product**: Based on which proton is removed, we will draw the resulting alkene and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\nHere is the Python code that walks through these steps to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with\n    potassium tert-butoxide to identify the major organic product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the reaction of {substrate} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Substrate's Conformation ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyzing the Substrate\")\n    print(\"The (1S,2R) stereochemistry means the bromo and methyl groups are 'trans' to each other on the cyclohexane ring.\")\n    print(\"The E2 elimination reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be in an axial position.\")\n    print(\"This means the reaction must proceed through the chair conformation where:\")\n    print(\"  - Bromine (at C1) is axial.\")\n    print(\"  - The methyl group (at C2) is equatorial.\")\n    print(\"(Note: This is also the most stable conformer, as the bulky methyl group prefers the equatorial position).\")\n          \n    # --- Step 2: Apply E2 Reaction Rules (Find available protons) ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identifying Protons for Elimination\")\n    print(\"For the E2 reaction, a proton on a carbon adjacent to C1 must be anti-periplanar (i.e., also axial and trans) to the axial Bromine.\")\n    print(\"We check the two adjacent carbons, C2 and C6:\")\n    print(\"  - At C2: The methyl group is equatorial, so the hydrogen on C2 is axial.
