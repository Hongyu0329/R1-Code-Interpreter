    "My plan is to first understand and deconstruct the provided SKI combinator expression. I will break it down into more manageable parts by identifying standard combinators like `I` (identity), `K` (constant), and `S` (substitution), as well as compositions that represent Church numerals and arithmetic operations like the successor function (`SUCC`).\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   Let `C_n` be the Church numeral for the integer `n`.\n    *   `I` is `C_1`.\n    *   `SUCC` (the successor combinator) is `S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n    *   `S(I)(I)` reduces to `C_2` (`S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`).\n\n2.  **Simplify Sub-Expressions:** The main expression contains two key arguments:\n    *   Argument 1: `K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))` simplifies to `K(SUCC(C_1))`, which is `K(C_2)`.\n    *   Argument 2: `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` simplifies to `SUCC(C_2)`, which is `C_3`.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct and Evaluate:** Substituting these back, the expression becomes:\n    `S(I)( S(I)( S(I)(K(C_2)) )(C_3) )`\n\n4.  **Apply Reduction Rules:**\n    *   Let's evaluate the inner part first: `T = S(I)( S(I)(K(C_2)) )(C_3)`. Given that SKI application is left-associative, this is parsed as `( (S I) (S I (K C_2)) ) C_3`.\n    *   Let's find `F = S I (K C_2)`. For any argument `x`, `F x = I x (K C_2 x) = x (C_2)`. So, `F = Î»x. x C_2`.\n    *   Next, let's find `G = (S I) F`. For any argument `y`, `G y = I y (F y) = y (F y) = y (y C_2)`.\n    *   Now, we apply `G` to `C_3`: `T = G C_3 = C_3 (C_3 C_2)`.\n    *   In Church numeral arithmetic, `C_m C_n` represents multiplication, `C_{m*n}`. So `C_3 C_2 = C_6`.\n    *   Therefore, `T = C_3(C_6) = C_{3*6} = C_{18}`.\n\n5.  **Final Step:** The entire expression is `S(I)(T)`, which is `S(I)(C_{18})`.\n    *   Let's see what `S(I)(C_{18})` represents. Applied to `f` and `x`:\n        `S(I)(C_{18}) f x = I f (C_{18} f) x = f (f^18 x) = f^19 x`.\n    *   This is the definition of `C_{19}`. So, the Church integer `n` is 19.\n\nNow I will write the Python code to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n), where n is a Church integer\n# represented by a complex SKI combinator expression.\n\n# Our logical derivation, breaking down the SKI expression step-by-step,\n# reveals that the expression simplifies to the Church numeral for 19.\n\n# Step 1: Define the integer n based on the derivation.\nn = 19\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the base-2 logarithm of n.\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation showing all the numbers involved, as requested.\nprint(f\"The church integer is n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is log_2({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<4.247927513443585>>>"
