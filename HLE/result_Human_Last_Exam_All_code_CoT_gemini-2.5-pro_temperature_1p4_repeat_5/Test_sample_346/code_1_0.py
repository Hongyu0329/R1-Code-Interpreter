# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n), where n is a Church integer
# represented by a complex SKI combinator expression.

# Our logical derivation, breaking down the SKI expression step-by-step,
# reveals that the expression simplifies to the Church numeral for 19.

# Step 1: Define the integer n based on the derivation.
n = 19

# Step 2: Calculate the base-2 logarithm of n.
result = math.log2(n)

# Step 3: Print the final equation showing all the numbers involved, as requested.
print(f"The church integer is n = {n}")
print(f"The final equation is log_2({n}) = {result}")
