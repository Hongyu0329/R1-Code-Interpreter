    # --- Step 2: Analyze each property ---

    # Property 1: Zero tunneling
    # Reasoning: In the infinite time limit, the system settles into a "dark state"
    # that is immune to the loss mechanism. This means the state has no doubly-occupied sites.
    # Real particle tunneling that would create a doubly-occupied site is suppressed by a
    # quantum Zeno-like effect, effectively freezing charge transport.
    # Therefore, the property "Zero tunneling" holds true.
    true_properties.add(1)
    analysis_report.append("Property 1 (Zero tunneling): TRUE")

    # Property 2: Zero particles
    # Reasoning: The system does not necessarily decay to the vacuum state. Instead,
    # the dissipative evolution purifies the system into the ground state of an effective
    # Hamiltonian within the subspace of single occupancies. This final state is generally
    # a non-empty many-body state.
    # Therefore, the property "Zero particles" is false.
    analysis_report.append("Property 2 (Zero particles): FALSE")

    # Property 3: Zero losses
    # Reasoning: The final state is, by definition, a steady state reached at t -> infinity.
    # In any steady state of a dissipative system, the process causing the dissipation
    # must have ceased. The final state has no double occupancies, so no more particles can be lost.
    # Therefore, the property "Zero losses" must be true.
    true_properties.add(3)
    analysis_report.append("Property 3 (Zero losses): TRUE")

    # Property 4: Spin entanglement
    # Reasoning: Within the dark state manifold, virtual tunneling processes give rise to an
    # effective superexchange interaction between spins. The dissipative dynamics drives
    # the system to the ground state of this effective model. For interacting spins, such a
    # many-body ground state (e.g., an anti-ferromagnet) is highly entangled.
    # Therefore, the property "Spin entanglement" holds true.
    true_properties.add(4)
    analysis_report.append("Property 4 (Spin entanglement): TRUE")
    
    # Property 5: Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations
    # Reasoning: The superexchange interaction, arising from virtual hopping of fermions,
    # is of the form J_ex * (S_i . S_j). This coupling favors anti-parallel alignment
    # of neighboring spins, leading to anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) correlations in the final state.
    # Therefore, the property "Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations" is true.
    true_properties.add(5)
    analysis_report.append("Property 5 (Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations): TRUE")
    
    # Property 6: Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations
    # Reasoning: As explained for property 5, the emergent spin-spin interaction favors
    # anti-ferromagnetic correlations. Ferromagnetic correlations would require a different
    # interaction mechanism.
    # Therefore, the property "Ferromagnetic-like spin correlations" is false.
