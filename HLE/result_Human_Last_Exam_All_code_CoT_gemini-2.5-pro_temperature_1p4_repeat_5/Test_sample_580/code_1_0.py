        "1. The patient's presentation of sciatica-like pain (L4-S1 distribution) with an unremarkable X-ray points towards a soft-tissue cause like piriformis syndrome rather than a primary spinal bone issue.",
        "2. Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis muscle, located in the buttock, compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve.",
        "3. The question asks for a confirmatory test while the patient is in the left decubitus position (lying on the left side) with the affected right leg on top and extended.",
        "4. The primary function of the piriformis muscle is the external rotation of the femur (thigh bone).",
        "5. Therefore, applying resistance against the patient's attempt at external rotation will cause the piriformis muscle to contract forcefully.",
        "6. If this contraction reproduces the patient's specific sciatic pain, it strongly supports the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome.",
        "7. The other actions test different muscle groups or movements: Abduction (gluteus medius), Adduction (adductor group), Flexion (iliopsoas), etc. Resisted External Rotation is the most specific test for piriformis muscle engagement in this context."
