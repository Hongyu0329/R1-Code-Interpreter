# 1. Define the chemical formula of a representative nanocar molecule.
# Based on a known synthesis, the chassis is C96H92, and the four fullerene wheels are C60 each.
# Total Carbons = 96 (chassis) + 4 * 60 (wheels) = 336
# Total Hydrogens = 92 (from the chassis)
nanocar_carbons = 336
nanocar_hydrogens = 92

# 2. Understand the "perfluoro-" prefix.
# This prefix means all hydrogen atoms in the parent molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms.
# So, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.
perfluoronanocar_fluorines = nanocar_hydrogens

# 3. Print the explanation and the final result.
print(f"A representative nanocar molecule has the chemical formula C{nanocar_carbons}H{nanocar_hydrogens}.")
print("The prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.")
print(f"\nTo create a perfluoronanocar, we replace the {nanocar_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms.")
print(f"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is equal to the original number of hydrogen atoms.")
print(f"\nFinal count: {nanocar_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms = {perfluoronanocar_fluorines} fluorine atoms")
