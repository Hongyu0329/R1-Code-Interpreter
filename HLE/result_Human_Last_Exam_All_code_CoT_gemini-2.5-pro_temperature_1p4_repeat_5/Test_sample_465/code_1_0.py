def solve_chromatic_roots_question():
    """
    This function determines the true statements about chromatic and orbital chromatic roots
    and prints the final answer as a sorted string.
    
    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A. True. Real orbital chromatic roots are indeed bounded by the greatest real chromatic root of the original graph.
    B. True. Chromatic polynomials can have complex roots (e.g., C4 graph).
    C. False. All real chromatic roots are non-negative.
    D. True. For certain graphs, the golden ratio squared (a non-integer) is a chromatic root.
    E. False. Chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).

    The set of true statements is {A, B, D}.
