    "The user wants to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) for the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system is the toric code, a topological quantum error-correcting code. Its properties, like ground state degeneracy, depend on the topology of the surface it's defined on.\n2.  **Determine the Topology:** The problem specifies `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. When the genus (`g`) of the surface is not specified, it is standard to assume a sphere (`g=0`) with holes. The answer choices do not depend on `g`, reinforcing this assumption.\n3.  **Source of Degeneracy:** The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits is determined by the number of independent logical operators that are not trivial and commute with the Hamiltonian.\n4.  **Logical Operators and Boundaries:** The presence of different types of boundaries affects what kinds of logical operators can exist.\n    *   **Rough boundaries** are associated with the condensation of electric charges (`e`-anyons). They affect `Z`-type logical operators. With `m` rough boundaries on a plane, one can define a set of logical operators that effectively describe the fusion channels of these `e`-anyons. This leads to a degeneracy of `2^(m-1)` (for `m >= 1`).\n    *   **Smooth boundaries** are associated with the condensation of magnetic fluxes (`m`-anyons). They affect `X`-type logical operators. Similarly, `n` smooth boundaries on a plane lead to a degeneracy of `2^(n-1)` (for `n >= 1`).\n5.  **Calculate Total Degeneracy:** The logical operators associated with rough boundaries are independent of those associated with smooth boundaries. Therefore, the total ground space degeneracy is the product of the degeneracies from each type of boundary.\n    *   GSD = (Degeneracy from `m` rough holes) Ã— (Degeneracy from `n` smooth holes)\n    *   Assuming `m >= 1` and `n >= 1`, this becomes:\n        GSD = `2^(m-1) * 2^(n-1)`\n        GSD = `2^((m-1) + (n-1))`\n        GSD = `2^(m+n-2)`\n6.  **Match with Options:** This formula, `2^(m+n-2)`, matches option B. It's important to note that this formula is valid when at least one of each type of hole is present (`m>=1` and `n>=1`). For edge cases where `m=0` or `n=0`, the formula changes. However, among the choices provided, this is the formula that describes the general case with both types of boundaries and is the most plausible intended answer.\n7.  **Create Python Code:** I will write a Python script that takes example values for `m` and `n` (where `m>=1` and `n>=1`), calculates the exponent and the final degeneracy, and prints out the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(m, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes on a planar surface.\n\n    The formula GSD = 2^(m + n - 2) is used, which is valid for m>=1 and n>=1.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (must be >= 1).\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (must be >= 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    if m < 1 or n < 1:\n        print(\"This formula is intended for cases where m>=1 and n>=1.\")\n        print(f\"The provided values are m={m}, n={n}.\")\n        # Handle specific edge cases for a more complete answer.\n        if m + n == 0:\n            degeneracy = 1 # Sphere\n            print(\"GSD for a sphere (m=0, n=0) is 1.\")\n        elif m >= 1 and n == 0:\n            degeneracy = 2**(m - 1) if m > 0 else 1\n            print(f\"GSD for m={m}, n=0 is {degeneracy}.\")\n        elif n >= 1 and m == 0:\n            degeneracy = 2**(n - 1) if n > 0 else 1\n            print(f\"GSD for m=0, n={n} is {degeneracy}.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the exponent for the general formula\n    exponent = m + n - 2\n    \n    # Calculate the ground space degeneracy\n    degeneracy = 2**exponent\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\n    print(f\"Calculating the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) for:\")\n    print(f\"m = {m} (rough holes)\")\n    print(f\"n = {n} (smooth holes)\")\n    print(\"\\nUsing the formula for the general case (m>=1, n>=1):\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({m} + {n} - 2)\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^{exponent}\")\n    print(f\"GSD = {degeneracy}\")\n\n# --- Example Execution ---\n# You can change these values to see the result for different numbers of holes.\nnum_rough_holes = 3\nnum_smooth_holes = 4\n\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(num_rough_holes, num_smooth_holes)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
