    "If the Norse had never invaded, the modern word for \"sister\" would have evolved from the native Old English word, rather than being replaced by the Old Norse one. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine what that word would be:\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** Our modern word \"sister\" comes directly from the Old Norse word `systir`, which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers between the 7th and 12th centuries.\n\n2.  **Find the original Old English word:** The native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for sister was `sweostor`. This is the word that would have continued to evolve in the absence of Norse influence.\n\n3.  **Trace the word's evolution:** We can see how `sweostor` evolved by looking at its usage in Middle English. It naturally changed to `suster`. This form was common and can be found in major Middle English texts like Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\".\n\n4.  **Project to Modern English:** The word `suster` was in direct competition with the Norse-derived `sister`. Eventually, `sister` won out and became the standard. However, if that competition had never existed, `suster` would have been the word to continue into Modern English. Therefore, the likely Modern English word would be \"suster\".\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this explanation and the resulting word.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the hypothetical Modern English word\n    for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir\".\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n\n    # The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # This evolved into \"suster\" in Middle English.\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n\n    # Without Norse influence, this would be the likely modern word.\n    modern_english_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"If the Norse had never invaded the Anglo-Saxons, the word for 'sister' would not come from Old Norse 'systir'.\")\n    print(f\"Instead, it would have evolved from the native Old English word, which was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"By the Middle English period, '{old_english_word}' had naturally evolved into '{middle_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Without competition from the Norse word, the most likely Modern English word would therefore be '{modern_english_word}'.\")\n\nfind_alternate_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
