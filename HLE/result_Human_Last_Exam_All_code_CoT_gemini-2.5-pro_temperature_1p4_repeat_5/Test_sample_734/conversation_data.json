    "The user is asking for the name of a specific Christian theologian known for developing a particular set of theological and philosophical concepts. The core of the question is to identify the person who created a framework to explain how events like the virgin birth could occur, and how nature itself might have changed after the Fall, by positing changes or exceptions to the \"laws of nature.\"\n\nHere is my plan to answer the question:\n1.  Identify the key concepts: \"specialized terminology,\" \"changes in the laws of nature,\" \"virgin birth,\" and \"the Fall.\"\n2.  Search through historical Christian theology for a figure who systematically addressed these topics together.\n3.  The most prominent figure who fits this description is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), which are latent potentialities embedded by God in creation from the beginning.\n4.  According to Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature's order, but the activation by God of one of these pre-ordained potentialities that lies outside the *usual* course of nature. Similarly, changes to the natural world at the Fall could be explained as the unfolding of these embedded \"reasons.\"\n5.  I will create a Python script that prints the name of this theologian as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Christian theologian\n    who developed a framework for understanding alterations in natural law.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The theologian in question is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the concept of\n    # \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales) to explain how God could bring about\n    # events that seem to contravene the normal course of nature (like the virgin birth)\n    # without violating the ultimate order God established at creation. These \"reasons\"\n    # are potentialities embedded in creation from the beginning.\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, is: {theologian_name}\")\n\nsolve_theology_question()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
