    Analyzes the stability operator L to determine the number of its positive eigenvalues.

    The plan is based on the spectral theory of differential operators.
    1. The operator L is defined on a non-compact manifold. Its L^2 spectrum is analyzed.
    2. We use separation of variables u(rho, omega) = f(rho) * Y_k(omega), reducing the PDE to a family of ODEs for each spherical harmonic mode k.
    3. Each ODE corresponds to a Sturm-Liouville operator L_k on the infinite domain rho in (-inf, +inf).
    4. The potential for each operator L_k vanishes at infinity. For such operators, the essential spectrum begins at 0.
    5. A fundamental result of spectral theory is that for such operators, there are no L^2-integrable eigenfunctions for any positive eigenvalue lambda > 0.
       Solutions for lambda > 0 are oscillatory and not square-integrable, representing scattering states rather than bound states (eigenfunctions).
    6. Therefore, the operator L has no positive eigenvalues.
