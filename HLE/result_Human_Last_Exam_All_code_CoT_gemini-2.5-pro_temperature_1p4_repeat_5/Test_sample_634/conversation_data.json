    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This method is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers and involves reducing a stacked matrix of P1 and P2 using elementary row operations.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  Define the two matrices, P1 and P2.\n2.  Create a stacked matrix M by placing P2 on top of P1. This is generally easier when P2 has polynomials of a lower degree.\n    M = [P2; P1]\n3.  Apply elementary row operations to M. An elementary row operation consists of replacing a row `Ri` with `Ri - q*Rj`, where `q` is a polynomial. The goal is to transform the matrix M into the form `[G; 0]`, where G is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix.\n4.  The resulting non-zero matrix G at the top will be a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n**Initial Matrices:**\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M.**\nM =\nR1: [s, 0]\nR2: [-s - 1, 1]\nR3: [s^2 + s, -s]\nR4: [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the bottom part (P1) using the top part (P2).**\nThis is equivalent to finding the remainder of P1 right-divided by P2.\n- Replace R3 with `R3 - (s+1)*R1`:\n  [s^2+s, -s] - (s+1)*[s, 0] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, -s - 0] = **[0, -s]**\n- Replace R4 with `R4 + s*R1`:\n  [-s^2-1, s^2] + s*[s, 0] = [-s^2-1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = **[-1, s^2]**\n\nThe matrix is now:\nR1: [s, 0]\nR2: [-s - 1, 1]\nR3': [0, -s]\nR4': [-1, s^2]\n\n**Step 3: Continue the reduction.**\nThe problem is now to find the GCRD of P2 and the new remainder matrix R = [[0, -s], [-1, s^2]]. We continue reducing the current 4x2 matrix. Let's pivot on R4' because it has a constant `-1` which is convenient.\n- Swap R1 with R4' and multiply the new R1 by -1.\nR1'': [1, -s^2]\nR2'': [-s - 1, 1]\nR3'': [0, -s]\nR4'': [s, 0]\n\n- Use the new pivot row R1'' to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n- Replace R2'' with `R2'' + (s+1)*R1''`:\n  [-s-1, 1] + (s+1)*[1, -s^2] = [0, 1 + (s+1)(-s^2)] = **[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]**\n- Replace R4'' with `R4'' - s*R1''`:\n  [s, 0] - s*[1, -s^2] = [0, 0 - s(-s^2)] = **[0, s^3]**\n\nThe matrix is now:\nR1''': [1, -s^2]\nR2''': [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\nR3''': [0, -s]\nR4''': [0, s^3]\n\n**Step 4: Reduce the second column.**\nWe now have three rows with a non-zero element only in the second column. We can use polynomial division (via row operations) to find their greatest common divisor.\nThe polynomials are `1 - s^3 - s^2`, `-s`, and `s^3`. The GCD of these is 1. We can perform row operations to get a row `[0, 1]`.\n- Let's use R3''' (`[0, -s]`) to simplify R2'''. Polynomial division gives `1 - s^3 - s^2 = (s^2 + s)*(-s) + 1`.\n- Replace R2''' with `R2''' - (s^2 + s)*R3'''`:\n  [0, 1-s^3-s^2] - (s^2+s)*[0, -s] = [0, 1-s^3-s^2 + s^3+s^2] = **[0, 1]**\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[1, -s^2]\n[0, 1]\n[0, -s]\n[0, s^3]\n\n**Step 5: Final reduction (back substitution).**\n- Use the row `[0, 1]` to eliminate the second element in all other rows.\n- Replace R1 with `R1 + s^2*R2`: [1, -s^2] + s^2*[0, 1] = **[1, 0]**\n- Replace R3 with `R3 + s*R2`: [0, -s] + s*[0, 1] = **[0, 0]**\n- Replace R4 with `R4 - s^3*R2`: [0, s^3] - s^3*[0, 1] = **[0, 0]**\n\nThe final non-zero rows are `[1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reduction of the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` results in `[I; 0]`, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Therefore, the greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) is determined through the Euclidean algorithm\n# for polynomial matrices. The calculation shows that the GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n# This means the matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nGCRD = np.identity(2, dtype=int)\n\n# The final GCRD matrix G is:\n# G = [[1, 0],\n#      [0, 1]]\n\n# We will now print the elements of the resulting GCRD matrix.\n# Each line represents a row of the matrix.\nfor row in GCRD:\n    # Each number in the final equation is an element of the matrix.\n    print(*row)\n\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
