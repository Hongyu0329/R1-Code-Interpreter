    "My analysis indicates that the user's question is based on a misunderstanding. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan was born with the name \"Azikiwe\"; it is one of his middle names. It is not a name he adopted or began to use at a specific point in his public life. Therefore, there is no single year to identify for this event.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that explains this context to the user, as a direct calculation or search for a specific year is not applicable.\n\n```python\ndef find_identification_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's question about the year\n    Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The premise of the question is based on a misunderstanding.\n    # \"Azikiwe\" is the birth middle name of the former Nigerian President.\n    # His full name has always been Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    # There was no single event or year where he began identifying with this name,\n    # as it has always been part of his official identity.\n    # Therefore, we will print an explanation instead of a year.\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"There is no specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly \"\n        \"identified himself as 'Azikiwe'.\\n\"\n        \"'Azikiwe' is his given middle name from birth and has been part of his \"\n        \"full legal name throughout his life. He did not adopt the name at a \"\n        \"later date, so a specific year of 'identification' does not exist.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_identification_year()\n```\n<<<There is no specific year for this event, as \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's birth name, not a name he adopted later.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
