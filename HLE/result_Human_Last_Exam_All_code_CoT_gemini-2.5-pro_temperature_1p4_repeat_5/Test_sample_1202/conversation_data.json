    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  I will first define the biological requirements based on the user's question. The question asks for a mechanism that explains both the *retention* (keeping the extra gene copy) and the *divergence* (the two copies becoming different) of duplicated genes.\n2.  Next, I will create a data structure (a Python dictionary) to represent each answer choice. For each choice, I will include its name and a boolean evaluation of whether it explains retention and divergence.\n3.  I will then write a Python script that programmatically filters these choices. The script will iterate through the options and select only those that satisfy *both* conditions (retention and divergence).\n4.  The script will print its analysis for each option, showing why each is accepted or rejected based on the criteria.\n5.  Finally, from the valid candidates, the script will select the most fitting answer. Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid mechanisms, but neofunctionalization represents the evolution of a completely new function, which is a powerful and classic model for why duplicated genes are retained and diverge to create evolutionary novelty. The script will use this reasoning to make a final selection and print the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms of gene duplication to find the one best explaining\n    both retention and divergence of the duplicates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mechanisms and their properties.\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"Gene conversion\",\n            \"description\": \"A process that makes homologous DNA sequences identical.\",\n            \"explains_retention\": False, # Does not provide a selective advantage to keep both copies.\n            \"explains_divergence\": False # Actively works against divergence by homogenizing sequences.\n        },\n        'B': {\n            \"name\": \"Pseudogenization\",\n            \"description\": \"A process where one gene copy becomes non-functional.\",\n            \"explains_retention\": False, # This is a mechanism for gene loss, not retention.\n            \"explains_divergence\": True  # The non-functional copy diverges due to neutral mutations.\n        },\n        'C': {\n            \"name\": \"Neofunctionalization\",\n            \"description\": \"One copy keeps the original function while the other evolves a new, beneficial function.\",\n            \"explains_retention\": True,  # Both copies are retained by natural selection for their functions.\n            \"explains_divergence\": True  # The acquisition of a new function is a form of divergence.\n        },\n        'D': {\n            \"name\": \"Subfunctionalization\",\n            \"description\": \"The original gene's multiple functions are partitioned between the two new copies.\",\n            \"explains_retention\": True,  # Both copies are now required to perform the ancestral functions.\n            \"explains_divergence\": True  # Copies diverge as they specialize and lose complementary functions.\n        },\n        'E': {\n            \"name\": \"Adaptive radiation\",\n            \"description\": \"A macro-evolutionary process of rapid species diversification.\",\n            \"explains_retention\": False, # Operates at the species level, not the gene level.\n            \"explains_divergence\": False # Not a mechanism of gene divergence.\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing choices for a mechanism that explains both RETENTION and DIVERGENCE of duplicated genes:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 2: Filter for mechanisms that meet both criteria.\n    valid_candidates = []\n    for option, details in mechanisms.items():\n        is_valid = details[\"explains_retention\"] and details[\"explains_divergence\"]\n        print(f\"Option [{option}] {details['name']}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Explains Retention? {details['explains_retention']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Explains Divergence? {details['explains_divergence']}\")\n        if is_valid:\n            print(\"  - Result: This is a valid candidate.\\n\")\n            valid_candidates.append(option)\n        else:\n            print(\"  - Result: Rejected.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Valid candidates that explain both retention and divergence:\", valid_candidates)\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 3: Select the best answer from the valid candidates.\n    # Both C and D are strong models.
