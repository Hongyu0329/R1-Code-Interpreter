    "This is a line of Plautine Latin, likely a trochaic septenarius, a common meter in Roman comedy. Scanning Plautus can be complex due to sound changes and metrical rules that differ from classical poetry. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Syllabify the line**: Break the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" into its constituent syllables. The total syllable count is 15, which fits a trochaic septenarius (`L S L S L S L || L S L S L S L`).\n2.  **Determine Syllable Quantity**: I will determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard rules:\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (this rule works across word boundaries).\n    *   Special Plautine rules like *brevis brevians* (iambic shortening) will be applied, where a word with a Short-Long pattern (like `tĭbī`) is scanned as Short-Short (`tĭbĭ`).\n3.  **Group into Feet**: I will group the syllables into seven trochaic feet (`L S`). I'll allow for common substitutions:\n    *   **Spondee**: `L L`\n    *   **Resolved Trochee**: `S S S` (replaces `L S`)\n    *   Other variations that, while irregular, are found in Plautus.\n4.  **Construct the Code**: The Python code will print the final scansion, with each foot separated by a space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n*   **Line**: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   **Syllables & Quantities**:\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t` from `tibi`). **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: `tĭbī` shortens to `tĭbĭ`. Both are short. **S S**\n    *   `be-ne`: `bĕnĕ`. Both short. **S S**\n    *   `es-se`: `esse`. First syllable `es-` is long by position. Second is short. **L S**\n    *   `so-li`: `sōlī`. Both are long by nature. **L L**\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (followed by `s` from `sibi`). **L**\n    *   `si-bi`: `sĭbī` shortens to `sĭbĭ`. Both are short. **S S**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by `m` from `male`). **L**\n    *   `ma-le`: `măle`. Both are short. **S S**\n*   **Sequence**: `L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n*   **Grouping into Feet**:\n    1.  `et ti`: `L S` (Trochee)\n    2.  `bi be ne`: `S S S` (Resolved Trochee)\n    3.  `es se`: `L S` (Trochee)\n    4.  `so li`: `L L` (Spondee)\n    5.  `quom si`: `L S` (Trochee)\n    6.  `bi sit`: `S L` (Iamb - an irregular but possible substitution)\n    7.  `ma le`: `S S` (Pyrrhic - also irregular)\n\nThe final scansion reflects the complexities and irregularities often found in early Latin verse.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of a line from Plautus.\n    L = Long Syllable\n    S = Short Syllable\n    Feet are separated by spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    scansion = \"L S  S S S  L S  L L  L S  S L  S S\"\n    \n    # Print the original line\n    print(f\"Line: {line}\")\n    \n    # Print the scansion with feet clearly represented\n    print(f\"Scansion: {scansion}\")\n    \n    # To fulfill the final output format requirement, we print the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The 'equation' here is the scansion itself.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    \n    syllables_by_foot = scansion.split('  ')\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    word_syllables = [\n        \"et\", \"ti\", \"bi\", \"be\", \"ne\", \"es\", \"se\", \"so\", \"li\", \n        \"quom\", \"si\", \"bi\", \"sit\", \"ma\", \"le\"\n    ]\n    \n    # This is a representation to show which parts of the line correspond to the scansion.\n    # It's a symbolic equation.\n    \n    # Foot 1: et ti -> L S\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[0]} {word_syllables[1]} -> {syllables_by_foot[0]}\")\n    # Foot 2: bi be ne -> S S S\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[2]} {word_syllables[3]} {word_syllables[4]} -> {syllables_by_foot[1]}\")\n    # Foot 3: es se -> L S\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[5]} {word_syllables[6]} -> {syllables_by_foot[2]}\")\n    # Foot 4: so li -> L L\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[7]} {word_syllables[8]} -> {syllables_by_foot[3]}\")\n    # Foot 5: quom si -> L S\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[9]} {word_syllables[10]} -> {syllables_by_foot[4]}\")\n    # Foot 6: bi sit -> S L\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[11]} {word_syllables[12]} -> {syllables_by_foot[5]}\")\n    # Foot 7: ma le -> S S\n    equation_parts.append(f\"{word_syllables[13]} {word_syllables[14]} -> {syllables_by_foot[6]}\")\n\n    final_equation_string = \" | \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # Re-printing the final scansion clearly as the 'equation'\n    print(scansion.replace(\"  \", \" | \"))\n\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S  S S S  L S  L L  L S  S L  S S>>>"
