    "My plan is to solve the equation by first converting the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n1.  **VIII** translates to **8**.\n2.  **CCC** translates to **300**.\n3.  **CCXIII** translates to **213**.\n\nThen, I will perform the calculation based on the translated equation: `8 / 300 - 213`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the final equation and its solution.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Get value of the current symbol\n        s1 = roman_map[s[i]]\n\n        if (i + 1) < len(s):\n            # Get value of the next symbol\n            s2 = roman_map[s[i + 1]]\n\n            # Compare symbols\n            if s1 >= s2:\n                # Value of current symbol is greater or equal to the next symbol\n                result = result + s1\n                i = i + 1\n            else:\n                # Value of current symbol is less than the next symbol\n                result = result + s2 - s1\n                i = i + 2\n        else:\n            result = result + s1\n            i = i + 1\n    return result\n\n# The Roman numerals from the equation\nroman_a = \"VIII\"\nroman_b = \"CCC\"\nroman_c = \"CCXIII\"\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to integers\nnum_a = roman_to_int(roman_a)\nnum_b = roman_to_int(roman_b)\nnum_c = roman_to_int(roman_c)\n\n# Calculate the result\nsolution = (num_a / num_b) - num_c\n\n# Print the equation with modern numbers and the solution\nprint(f\"The equation is: {num_a} / {num_b} - {num_c} = {solution}\")\nprint(f\"The original Roman numeral equation was: {roman_a} / {roman_b} - {roman_c}\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {solution}\")\n\n```\n<<<-212.97333333333333>>>"
