    "This problem is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Board Size**: The chessboard is 16x16, so N = 16.\n2.  **Re-frame the Problem**: The condition that no queen (white or black) can attack any other queen means we are looking for the maximum number of non-attacking queens we can place on a 16x16 board.\n3.  **Apply N-Queens Knowledge**: For any N x N board (where N > 3), the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is N. Therefore, for a 16x16 board, we can place a maximum of 16 non-attacking queens.\n4.  **Formulate the Equation**: The total number of queens is given as `m` white queens plus `m` black queens, which is `2m`.\n5.  **Solve for m**: We set the total number of queens equal to the maximum possible, which gives us the equation `2m = 16`. Solving for `m` will give us the answer.\n6.  **Generate the Code**: The Python code will perform this calculation and print out the reasoning and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the size of the chessboard.\n    n = 16\n\n    # Step 2: The maximum number of non-attacking queens on an n x n board is n.\n    total_queens = n\n\n    # Step 3: The total number of queens is m white + m black, so total = 2 * m.\n    # We need to solve the equation: 2 * m = n\n    m = total_queens // 2\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The problem is to place 'm' white and 'm' black queens on a {n}x{n} board with no attacks.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to the N-Queens problem, where the maximum number of non-attacking queens on an NxN board is N.\")\n    print(f\"For a {n}x{n} board, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens is {total_queens}.\")\n    print(\"\\nSince the total number of queens is m + m, we have the following equation:\")\n    print(f\"m + m = {total_queens}\")\n    print(f\"2 * m = {total_queens}\")\n    print(f\"m = {total_queens} / 2\")\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the maximum number m is {m}.\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
