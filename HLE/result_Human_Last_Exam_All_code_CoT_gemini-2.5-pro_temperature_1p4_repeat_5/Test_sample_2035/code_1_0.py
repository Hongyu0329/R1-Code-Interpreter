# Step 1: Define problem parameters
n = 4048

# Step 2: Analyze the condition for the existence of real solutions.
# For the system to have real solutions for the initial values x_i^0, the term
# (x_i^0)^2 must be non-negative for all i=1,...,n.
# The solvability conditions lead to the requirement that for all i:
# (sum_{j=1 to n} alpha_j^2) - (n-1)*alpha_i^2 >= 0.
#
# Given alpha_i = sqrt(i), we have alpha_i^2 = i.
# The sum is the sum of integers from 1 to n: n*(n+1)/2.
# So the condition is: n*(n+1)/2 - (n-1)*i >= 0.
#
# This inequality is most likely to fail when i is largest, so we check the worst case, i=n.

# Calculate sum of alpha_j^2 from j=1 to n, which is sum of j from 1 to n.
sum_alpha_sq = n * (n + 1) // 2

# Check the condition for the most restrictive case, i = n.
i_check = n
# The value inside the parenthesis from the formula for (x_i^0)^2
condition_numerator = sum_alpha_sq - (n - 1) * i_check
