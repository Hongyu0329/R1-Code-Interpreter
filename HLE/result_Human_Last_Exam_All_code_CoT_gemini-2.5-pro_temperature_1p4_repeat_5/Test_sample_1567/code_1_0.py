    This function determines the maximal k based on the provided theorem.
    
    Theorem: For a d-dimensional controlled random walk (d>=3) with k measures:
    - If k <= d-1, the walk is always transient.
    - If k >= d, there exist measures for which the walk can be made recurrent.

    The question asks for the maximal k such that for ANY choice of k measures,
    and for ANY dimension d>=3, the walk is guaranteed to be transient.

    This means we need to find the maximal k such that the condition k <= d-1
    holds for all d >= 3.

    # the minimum value of (d - 1) for d >= 3.
