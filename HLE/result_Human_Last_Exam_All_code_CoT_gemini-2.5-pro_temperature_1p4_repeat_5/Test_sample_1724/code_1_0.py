    This function calculates and prints the third term of the nonlinear frequency correction
    for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, based on the Poincar√©-Lindstedt perturbation method.

    The frequency expansion is given by:
    omega = omega_0 + epsilon * omega_1 + epsilon^2 * omega_2 + ...

    Through perturbation analysis, it is found that omega_1 = 0 and omega_2 is given by:
    omega_2 = - (sqrt(3*gamma)/16) * (6*gamma**2 + 5*gamma + 14)

    The problem asks for the "3rd term" of the correction. This is interpreted as the
    third term in the expanded expression for omega_2.
