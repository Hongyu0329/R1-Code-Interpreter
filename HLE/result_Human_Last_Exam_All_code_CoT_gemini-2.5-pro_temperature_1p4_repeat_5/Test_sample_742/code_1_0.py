    print("The answer requires understanding the domains and tools of both Gödel's proof and QM.")
    print("\n--- Part 1: Gödel's Ontological Proof ---")
    print("Domain: Metaphysics and Formal Logic.")
    print("Mathematical Tools: Modal Logic (specifically, the S5 system). This is a logic that deals with concepts of possibility and necessity.")
    print("Core Idea: The proof defines a 'God-like entity' as one that possesses all 'positive properties'. It then uses a set of axioms within modal logic to argue that if the existence of such an entity is even possible, then it must exist necessarily.")
    print("Nature of Proof: It is an 'a priori' argument, meaning it is based on definitions, axioms, and logical deduction, not on empirical evidence or observations of the physical world.")

    print("\n--- Part 2: The Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics ---")
    print("Domain: Physics.")
    print("Mathematical Tools: Linear algebra over complex numbers, Hilbert spaces, operators, and differential equations (like the Schrödinger equation).")
    print("Core Idea: QM describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It uses state vectors (wavefunctions) to represent physical systems and operators to represent measurable quantities (observables) like position, energy, and spin.")
    print("Nature of Theory: It is a physical theory, meaning it is built to describe and predict the outcomes of experiments. Its validity rests entirely on its correspondence with observed reality.")

    print("\n--- Part 3: The Fundamental Incompatibility ---")
    print("The two systems are fundamentally incommensurable for this task. Using QM to prove Gödel's argument would be a category error, like trying to prove the Pythagorean theorem using the rules of football.")
    print("\nKey reasons for this incompatibility include:")
    print("1. Mismatched Concepts: QM has no mathematical objects that correspond to Gödel's concepts. There is no such thing as a 'positive property' operator in a Hilbert space, nor is there a state vector for 'necessary existence'.")
    print("2. Different Definitions of 'Possibility':")
    print("   - In Gödel's modal logic, 'possible' means 'logically conceivable' or 'not self-contradictory within the system'.")
    print("   - In QM, 'possible' refers to a potential outcome of a measurement, with a specific probability calculated from the wavefunction.")
    print("3. Different Goals: Gödel's proof aims to establish a metaphysical truth through pure reason. QM aims to model physical reality.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is designed to describe the physical, observable universe. It is not equipped to handle the abstract, metaphysical concepts and logical axioms of Gödel's ontological proof.")
    print("Therefore, it is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the mathematics of quantum mechanics.")
