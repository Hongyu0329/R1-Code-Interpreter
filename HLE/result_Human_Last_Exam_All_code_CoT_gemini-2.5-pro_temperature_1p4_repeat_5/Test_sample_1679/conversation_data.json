    "To identify the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture that features a Luxor Obelisk, we need to cross-reference two pieces of information: the chronological list of Best Picture winners and which of those films depict either the Place de la Concorde in Paris or the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n\nMy plan is to codify this research into a Python script.\n1.  First, I will create a data structure containing a list of films that are relevant to the query. Each film's entry will include its title, the year it won the award, and a confirmation of whether it depicts one of the obelisks.\n2.  The script will then iterate through this data, which is sorted by year.\n3.  It will check each film to find the first one that both won Best Picture and contains a scene with a Luxor Obelisk.\n4.  Finally, it will print the title and year of the winning film.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    This function simulates the research process by using a pre-compiled list of\n    films relevant to Paris, Egypt, and the Best Picture award.
