    # Subject: "The conversation", Object: "playful"

    # We evaluate combinations based on common knowledge and the context provided.

    # Analysis of new plausible sentences:
    # - "Our Tuna is playful." -> This is true by common knowledge, as cats are often playful.
    #   (Subject from sentence 4, Object from sentence 2)
    # - "Our Tuna contains fish." -> This is highly plausible and can be considered true in this context,
    #   as cats often eat fish.
    #   (Subject from sentence 4, Object from sentence 3)
    #
    # Other combinations are rejected:
    # - "Satyendranath Bose is a Bengalese." -> False. He was a Bengali (person), not a Bengalese cat.
    # - "The conversation contains fish." -> Meaningless. An abstract concept cannot contain a physical object.
    # - "Satyendranath Bose is playful." -> Plausible, but not a known fact. We will be strict with our definition of "true".
