    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$. This allows us to decompose the character group into a product of character groups for each prime power factor.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a *primitive* Dirichlet character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$, corresponding to the prime power factors $p_i^{a_i}$ of $N$. In our case, this means $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_q$ is a primitive character modulo $q$.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character:** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n4.  **Counting Primitive Characters for each Factor:** For each prime power factor $q$, we need to find the number of primitive characters modulo $q$ whose orders are divisors of 6. Let's denote the number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of size $n$ as $\\phi(k)$ (Euler's totient function), provided $k|n$.\n\n    *   **For $q=4=2^2$**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. The only primitive character has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice. Number of choices: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   **For $q=9=3^2$**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The primitive characters are those whose orders do not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6. Number of choices: $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   **For $q=7$**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The possible orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. Number of choices: $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    *   **For $q=11$**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose orders divide 6. The only such order is 2. Number of choices: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   **For $q=13$**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose orders divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. Number of choices: $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We need to find the number of combinations of these primitive characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    *   Any choice of a primitive character modulo 4 must have order 2. So, the lcm will be a multiple of 2.\n    *   Any choice of a primitive character modulo 9 must have an order that is a multiple of 3 (either 3 or 6). So, the lcm will be a multiple of 3.\n    *   Therefore, the lcm of the orders of any valid combination of component characters will be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n    *   Furthermore, since the order of each component character is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n    *   Combining these, the lcm is always exactly 6.\n    *   Thus, we just need to multiply the number of available choices for each factor.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Factor the conductor N into its prime power components.\")\n    factors_str = \"2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\"\n    factors_vals = \"4 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13\"\n    print(f\"N = 36036 = {factors_str} = {factors_vals}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: For each prime power factor q, find the number of primitive characters modulo q\")\n    print(\"whose order divides 6.\\n\")\n\n    # For q = 4\n    # The group of characters mod 4 is cyclic of order phi(4)=2.
