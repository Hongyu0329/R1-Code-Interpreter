# Given parameters
c = 0.85  # Confidence of the discriminatory pattern
s = 0.12  # Support of the discriminatory pattern
c_prime = 0.78  # Confidence of the contradictory anti-correlation
beta = 0.23  # Bottleneck coefficient of the hourglass structure

# --- Explanation of the model ---
# The minimum evidence ratio (E_r) required to confirm the violation is calculated by
# comparing the strength of the counter-evidence (c') to the strength of the primary
# evidence (c * s), which is discounted by the bottleneck coefficient (beta).
#
# A low beta indicates a strong bottleneck, suggesting the local finding is less
# reliable. Therefore, the adjusted evidence for the violation is (c * s * beta).
#
# The formula is E_r = c' / (c * s * beta)

# --- Calculation ---
evidence_for_violation_raw = c * s
adjusted_evidence_for_violation = evidence_for_violation_raw * beta
e_r = c_prime / adjusted_evidence_for_violation
