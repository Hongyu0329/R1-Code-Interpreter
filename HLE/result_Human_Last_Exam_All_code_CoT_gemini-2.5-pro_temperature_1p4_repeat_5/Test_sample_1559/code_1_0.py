# Based on the analysis, the input to the final Gate C is the classical bit 1.
# Rule (R3) for Gate C requires a quantum state, so we convert the bit 1 to the state |1⟩.
# The state |1⟩ can be written in the computational basis as 0|0⟩ + 1|1⟩.

# Define the amplitudes for the state |1⟩.
# alpha is the amplitude of the |0⟩ component.
alpha = 0
# beta is the amplitude of the |1⟩ component.
beta = 1

# Gate C's formula uses the squared magnitudes of the amplitudes.
alpha_sq = abs(alpha)**2
beta_sq = abs(beta)**2

# Apply the formula from rule (R3) to calculate the final classical bit.
final_output = (alpha_sq * 0) + (beta_sq * 1)

# As requested, we print the final equation showing each number involved in the calculation.
# This represents the application of the quantum-classical translation function.
