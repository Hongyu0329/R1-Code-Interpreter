    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\". With 10 total nodes, the most symmetric and standard configuration is two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5).\n2.  **Calculate Edges in Each Component**:\n    *   I will calculate the number of edges within each 5-node complete graph. The formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with `m` nodes is `m * (m - 1) / 2`.\n    *   The number of bottleneck edges is 1.\n3.  **Calculate Total Edges**: The total number of edges in the barbell graph is the sum of the edges in the two cliques plus the one bottleneck edge.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" implies that any edge in the graph can be chosen with equal probability. Therefore, the probability of sampling the specific bottleneck edge is the number of bottleneck edges (1) divided by the total number of edges in the graph.\n5.  **Generate and Display the Code**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result, including the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the graph parameters\ntotal_nodes = 10\nnum_cliques = 2\n\n# For a standard, symmetric barbell graph, the nodes are split equally between the cliques.\nnodes_per_clique = total_nodes // num_cliques\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of edges in each component\n# The number of edges in a complete graph (clique) with 'm' nodes is m * (m - 1) / 2\nedges_in_clique1 = nodes_per_clique * (nodes_per_clique - 1) // 2\nedges_in_clique2 = edges_in_clique1  # The cliques are identical\n\n# The two cliques are connected by a single bottleneck edge.\nbottleneck_edges = 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of edges in the graph\ntotal_edges = edges_in_clique1 + edges_in_clique2 + bottleneck_edges\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the probability\n# In uniform sampling, the probability of picking any single edge is 1 / (total number of edges).\nnumerator = bottleneck_edges\ndenominator = total_edges\nprobability = numerator / denominator\n\n# Final Output: Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(f\"A barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes consists of two {nodes_per_clique}-node complete graphs connected by a bridge.\")\nprint(f\"Number of edges in the first clique: {edges_in_clique1}\")\nprint(f\"Number of edges in the second clique: {edges_in_clique2}\")\nprint(f\"Number of bottleneck edges: {bottleneck_edges}\\n\")\nprint(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the number of bottleneck edges divided by the total number of edges.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"P(bottleneck) = {numerator} / ({edges_in_clique1} + {edges_in_clique2} + {bottleneck_edges}) = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<<<0.047619047619047616>>>"
