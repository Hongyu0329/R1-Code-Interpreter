# --- Plan Step 1 & 2: Calculate the time dilation factor 'f' ---

# Constants in SI units
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
c = 299792458    # Speed of light (m/s)

# Exoplanet Pandora's orbital parameters converted to SI units
# Orbital radius a = 100,000,000 km
a = 100_000_000 * 1000  # meters
# Orbital period T = 800 Earth days
T = 800 * 24 * 60 * 60  # seconds

# Calculate the mass of the black hole (Pegasi) using Kepler's Third Law
# T^2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * M)  =>  M = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2)
M = (4 * math.pi**2 * a**3) / (G * T**2)

# Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (rs)
# rs = 2 * G * M / c^2
rs = (2 * G * M) / (c**2)

# Distance 'd' from the event horizon for the calculation
d = 13 * 1000  # 13 km in meters

# Calculate the time dilation factor 'f'
# f = sqrt(d / (rs + d))
f_raw = math.sqrt(d / (rs + d))

# Round f to 3 decimal places as required by the problem
f_rounded = round(f_raw, 3)

# --- Plan Step 3: Calculate the memory usage 'z' ---

# The most memory-efficient C program would only store the pre-computed
# result in a single variable to be printed.
# The `printf("%f", ...)` function requires a `frac` type variable.
# According to the Bagua specification:
# - signed char (n): 2 trits
# - unsigned wchar (d): 4 trits
# - signed char (e): 2 trits
z = 2 + 4 + 2  # Total memory usage in trits

# --- Plan Step 4: Output the results as requested ---
