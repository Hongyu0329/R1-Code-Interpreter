    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of order 10 that can be formed from two non-commuting variables, X and Y. This number corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree 10 in the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the degree of the terms (in this case, 10).\n*   `k` is the number of generators (in this case, 2, for X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive integers `d` that divide `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nWe will write a Python script to perform this calculation for `n=10` and `k=2`. The script will:\n1.  Define a function to compute the Möbius `μ(d)`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`.\n3.  Apply Witt's formula by summing the terms for each divisor.\n4.  Print out each step of the calculation, including the formula and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of a number as a dictionary.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Möbius function μ(n).\n    μ(1) = 1\n    μ(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    μ(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve_bch_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion and prints the detailed steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is calculated using Witt's formula.\")\n    print(\"This formula gives the dimension of the degree-n component of the free Lie algebra on k generators.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Witt's Formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{{d|n}} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\\n\")\n    \n    # Find divisors of n\n    divisors = sorted([d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0])\n    \n    print(f\"For our case, n = {n}, k = {k}.\")\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of {n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Build the equation parts for printing\n    symbolic_terms = []\n    numeric_terms_expanded = []\n    numeric_terms_simple = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_value = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term_value\n        \n        symbolic_terms.append(f\"μ({d})*({k}^({n}/{d}))\")\n        numeric_terms_expanded.append(f\"({mu_d})*({k**power})\")\n        numeric_terms_simple.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Print step 1: The symbolic formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute n, k, and the divisors into the formula.\")\n    equation_step1 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * (\" + \" + \".join(symbolic_terms) + \")\"\n    print(equation_step1)\n    \n    # Print step 2: The formula with calculated values for μ(d) and k^(n/d)\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate μ(d) and k^(n/d) for each divisor d.\")\n    equation_step2 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * (\" + \" + \".join(numeric_terms_expanded) + \")\"\n    print(equation_step2.replace('+ (-', '- (')) # for cleaner display\n\n    # Print step 3: The formula with evaluated terms\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Evaluate each term in the sum.\")\n    simple_sum_str = \" \".join(f\"- {s[1:]}\" if s.startswith('-') else f\"+ {s}\" for s in numeric_terms_simple).lstrip('+ ')\n    equation_step3 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ({simple_sum_str})\"\n    print(equation_step3)\n    \n    # Print step 4: The sum of the terms\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the total sum inside the parenthesis.\")\n    equation_step4 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ({total_sum})\"\n    print(equation_step4)\n    \n    # Print step 5: The final result\n    final_result = total_sum // n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Perform the final division.\")\n    equation_step5 = f\"L_{k}({n}) = {final_result}\"\n    print(equation_step5)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {final_result}.\")\n\nsolve_bch_problem()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
