    "To answer this question, I will first identify the specific 1905 paper being referenced, which is \"On the movement of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid demanded by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\" Then, I will access historical and scientific records to determine which scientist's lectures and foundational work Einstein referenced or built upon for this paper.\n\nSince the request requires a code block, I will write a simple Python script. The script will store the name of the scientist in a variable and then use a `print` function to output the answer in a clear, complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose\n    lectures and work were foundational to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper\n    on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scientist in question is Ludwig Boltzmann, whose work on statistical\n    # mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases was a direct precursor to\n    # Einstein's analysis.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the foundational work and concepts from the lectures of: {scientist_name}\")\n\nfind_cited_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
