    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Quantum Numbers:** For a **p-electron**, the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l` is 1. For any electron, the spin quantum number `s` is 1/2.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is found by combining `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Numbers (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `J^2` operator are given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the `J_z` operator are given by `m_jħ`.\n5.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script that calculates and prints all possible `j` and `m_j` values, and then uses them to explicitly show the calculation for each corresponding `J^2` and `J_z` eigenvalue. The output will present the results in a clear, step-by-step manner.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    We will use atomic units where ħ (h-bar) is 1, but we will show it in the formulas for clarity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1.0  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # Spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is l = {int(l)}.\")\n    print(f\"The spin quantum number is s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1.0)\n\n    print(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j) are: {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    \n    final_answer_parts = []\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, find m_j and calculate the eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"Analyzing the state with j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate and display the eigenvalue for J^2 = j(j+1)ħ²\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"  - The eigenvalue of the J^2 operator is j(j+1)ħ².\")\n        print(f\"    Calculation: {j} * ({j} + 1)ħ² = {j_squared_eigenvalue}ħ²\\n\")\n\n        # Determine the possible m_j values, which range from -j to j in integer steps.\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        \n        # Display the eigenvalues for J_z = m_jħ\n        print(f\"  - For this j, the possible m_j quantum numbers are: {', '.join(map(str, m_j_values))}.\")\n        print(f\"  - The corresponding eigenvalues of the J_z operator are m_jħ.\")\n        \n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n        # Build the final summary answer string\n        part = (f\"For j={j}, the J^2 eigenvalue is {j_squared_eigenvalue}ħ^2 and the J_z eigenvalues are \"\n                f\"{{{', '.join(map(str, m_j_values))}}}ħ.\")\n        final_answer_parts.append(part)\n\n    # Combine parts for the final answer\n    final_answer = \" \".join(final_answer_parts)\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n\n# Run the function\nsolve_spin_orbit_eigenvalues()\n```"
