    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\nFirst, I will outline the theoretical background for the problem.\n1.  I will start from the functional integral representation of the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field at a finite temperature `T`.\n2.  I will write down the standard Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`.\n3.  The action `S[ϕ]` is quadratic in the field `ϕ` and can be expressed in a compact form as `S[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`, where `( , )` denotes an inner product and `D` is a differential operator.\n4.  By comparing the standard form of the action with its compact representation, I will identify the operator `D`.\n5.  Finally, I will write down the explicit expression for the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)`, which is the quantity you're asking for.\n\nAfter this explanation, I will provide a Python script that prints this final mathematical expression in a clear format, as requested.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\nIn finite-temperature quantum field theory, physical quantities are calculated in Euclidean spacetime where the imaginary time coordinate `τ` is periodic with period `β = 1/T`. The partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is given by a functional integral over all field configurations:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`\n\nThe Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m` is:\n\n`S[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x [ ½ (∂_μ ϕ)² + ½ m² ϕ² ]`\n\nHere, `d⁴x = dτ d³x` is the integral over 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime, and `(∂_μ ϕ)²` is shorthand for `(∂_μ ϕ)(∂_μ ϕ)`, summed over `μ = 0, 1, 2, 3`, where `x₀ = τ`.\n\nTo find the operator `D`, we can rewrite the kinetic term using integration by parts. Assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity and are periodic in `τ`, the boundary terms are zero:\n\n`∫ d⁴x (∂_μ ϕ)² = ∫ d⁴x [-ϕ (∂_μ∂_μ) ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x [-ϕ □_E ϕ]`\n\nwhere `□_E = ∂_μ∂_μ = ∂²/∂τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator (the 4D Laplacian).\n\nSubstituting this back into the action, we get:\n\n`S[ϕ] = ½ ∫ d⁴x [-ϕ □_E ϕ + m² ϕ²] = ½ ∫ d⁴x ϕ (-□_E + m²) ϕ`\n\nThis action is written in the general quadratic form `S[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`. The inner product in this context is defined as `(f, g) = ∫ d⁴x f(x)g(x)`. By comparing the two forms, we can identify the operator `D` acting on the field `ϕ` as:\n\n`Dϕ = (-□_E + m²) ϕ`\n\nThe question asks for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` (more commonly written as `(ϕ, Dϕ)`). Using our definition, this is:\n\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) (Dϕ)(x) = ∫ d⁴x ϕ (-□_E + m²) ϕ`\n\nThis is exactly twice the action, `2S[ϕ]`. We can also express this without the `□_E` operator by reversing the integration by parts:\n\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ d⁴x [ (∂_μ ϕ)² + m² ϕ² ]`\n\nExpanding the summed term `(∂_μ ϕ)²` gives the final explicit form.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the result.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the final expression for the inner product\n    (phi, D_phi) for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature\n    field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    expression = \"(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫d⁴x [ 1*(∂_τ ϕ)² + 1*(∇ϕ)² + 1*m²ϕ² ]\"\n\n    print(\"In the functional integral representation of the partition function, the action S[ϕ] is often written as S[ϕ] = 1/2 * (ϕ, Dϕ).\")\n    print(\"The inner product you asked for, (ϕ, Dϕ), is therefore equal to 2*S[ϕ].\")\n    print(\"\\nIts explicit form is:\")\n    print(expression)\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(\"  - (ϕ, Dϕ): The inner product.\")\n    print(\"  - ∫d⁴x: The integral over Euclidean spacetime (from τ=0 to β, and over all 3D space).\")\n    print(\"  - (∂_τ ϕ)²: The square of the derivative of the field ϕ with respect to imaginary time τ.\")\n    print(\"  - (∇ϕ)²: The square of the spatial gradient of the field ϕ.\")\n    print(\"  - m: The mass of the scalar particle.\")\n    print(\"  - ϕ²: The square of the field ϕ.\")\n    print(\"  - The numbers '1' are the coefficients for each term in the integrand.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_inner_product_expression()\n```\n<<<(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫d⁴x [ (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]>>>"
