# The problem asks for the dimension of the ninth cohomology group of a space M,
# which is the complement of a particular arrangement of 36 subspaces in H^4.
# H^9(M, Q) is the quantity we want to find the dimension of.
#
# As detailed in the reasoning:
# 1. By Alexander Duality, dim H^9(M) is equal to dim H_tilde_5(Union of spheres).
# 2. A spectral sequence argument can be used to compute this homology.
# 3. This specific arrangement of 36 hyperplanes is related to the root system of
#    the exceptional Lie group E_6. The complement of the reflection hyperplanes
#    for the Weyl group W(E_6) has known Betti numbers.
# 4. For the W(E_6) arrangement, the Betti numbers b_i are non-zero only for i
#    in {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23}.
# 5. In particular, the Betti number b_9 is 0.
#
# This implies that H^9 of the complement space is trivial.
# Hence, its dimension is 0.
