    # The problem asks for the upper-bound for ||B * Q_{0, M}||_inf, which can be
    # expressed as F * sqrt(N). We need to find the factor F.
    # Based on the provided context and known theorems for products of 
    # inhomogeneous stochastic matrices, we can derive this bound.

    # 1. The bound on the product of stochastic P matrices gives a term: C_0 * gamma^M * sqrt(N)
    #    where C_0 > 0 and 0 < gamma < 1 are constants related to graph ergodicity.

    # 2. The diagonal D matrices introduce a multiplicative factor. This factor can be 
    #    bounded using the given condition that beta > 0.
    #    The condition implies that product_{t=0 to M}(1 + c*delta_t) is bounded above by 1/beta.

    # 3. Combining these gives the bound: (C_0 * gamma^M / beta) * sqrt(N).
    
    # 4. The factor of sqrt(N) is therefore C_0 * gamma^M / beta.

    # We will represent the final equation and its components symbolically.
