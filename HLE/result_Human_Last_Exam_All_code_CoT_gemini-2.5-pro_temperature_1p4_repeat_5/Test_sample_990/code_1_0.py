    This function calculates the time it takes for a raindrop with increasing mass to fall a certain height.
    
    The derivation shows that under the given conditions, the raindrop experiences a constant acceleration
    that is independent of the densities of the raindrop (rho) and the micro-droplets (Rho).

Step-by-step solution:

1.  Let m(t) be the mass of the raindrop and v(t) be its velocity. The equation of motion for a body accreting mass that is initially at rest is given by Newton's second law, where the external force equals the rate of change of momentum: F_ext = d(p)/dt.

2.  The only external force is gravity, F_ext = m(t)g. The momentum is p = m(t)v(t).
    Therefore, mg = d(mv)/dt = m(dv/dt) + v(dm/dt).

3.  The mass m is related to the raindrop's radius r and its own density ρ by the formula:
    m = ρ * (4/3) * π * r^3

4.  The raindrop accumulates mass by sweeping through the atmosphere containing micro-droplets of spatial density Rho. The rate of mass increase dm/dt is Rho multiplied by the volume swept per unit time, which is the cross-sectional area A = πr^2 times the velocity v.
    So, dm/dt = Rho * π * r^2 * v.

5.  By expressing r in terms of m, we can show that dm/dt = C * m^(2/3) * v, where C is a constant that depends on ρ and Rho.

6.  Substituting this into the equation of motion from Step 2 gives:
    mg = m * a + v * (C * m^(2/3) * v), where a = dv/dt is the acceleration.

7.  Dividing by m and testing a solution with constant acceleration (v=at), it can be rigorously shown that the equation simplifies to:
    g = a + 6a = 7a

8.  This confirms that the raindrop falls with a constant acceleration a = g/7. Notably, the constants C, ρ, and Rho cancel out, making the acceleration independent of these densities.
