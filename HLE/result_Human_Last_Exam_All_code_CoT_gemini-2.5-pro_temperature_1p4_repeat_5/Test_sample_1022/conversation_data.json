    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Use the Künneth Formula**: For bounded cohomology with real coefficients, a Künneth-type formula relates the cohomology of a product of groups to the cohomology of its factors. For the dimensions, the formula is:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n    In our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and we are interested in the degree $n=4$.\n\n2.  **Determine the dimensions for Thompson's group T**: A key result in the field, established by Burger and Monod, states that the comparison map from bounded cohomology to ordinary cohomology is an isomorphism for Thompson's group T. Furthermore, the ordinary cohomology of T with real coefficients is known to be trivial in positive degrees (i.e., its dimension is 0). This implies:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (as for any non-trivial group).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all degrees $k > 0$.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula**: We substitute these dimensions into the Künneth formula for $n=4$:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\n    This sum expands to five terms:\n    *   For $(p,q)=(0,4)$: $\\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n    *   For $(p,q)=(1,3)$: $\\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n    *   For $(p,q)=(2,2)$: $\\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n    *   For $(p,q)=(3,1)$: $\\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n    *   For $(p,q)=(4,0)$: $\\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$\n\n4.  **Calculate the total dimension**: The sum of all these terms is $0+0+0+0+0=0$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the steps.\n\n```python\ndef get_dim_hb_T(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the dimension of the k-th bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group T\n    with trivial real coefficients, dim H_b^k(T; R).\n    \n    A known result is that dim H_b^k(T; R) is 1 for k=0 and 0 for k > 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    elif k > 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return 0 # Cohomology is 0 for negative degrees\n\ndef compute_dim_product_cohomology(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the n-th bounded cohomology group of T x T\n    using the Künneth formula.
