    print("Answer: No.")
    print("Justification: The Mountain Pass Theorem guarantees the existence of a critical point, but this point is not necessarily a 'ground state' (a solution with the lowest possible energy). Proving the existence of a ground state requires further steps, such as minimizing the functional on the Nehari manifold and showing that the minimum is achieved.")

    print("\n(c) If r_1 + r_2 lies in the range (2, 2s), does the minimisation of J_t over P(a,b) yield a unique solution?")
    print("Answer: No.")
    print("Justification: For coupled systems of nonlinear equations, the uniqueness of minimizers is a very strong property that is often not true. The interaction between components can lead to multiple distinct solutions (e.g., via symmetry breaking). The given condition on r1+r2 is typically a condition for the *existence* of a minimizer (a form of sub-criticality), not its uniqueness.")
