    This function provides the common name and the year it was coined
    for the bee genus "Perdita".

    The information is based on research into entomological literature.
    - Common Name: "Fairy bees" is the widely accepted common name for the genus Perdita,
      due to their small size and often iridescent appearance.
    - Year Coined: Pinpointing the exact first use of a common name is difficult.
      However, a significant published use can be found in the 1994 book
      "Insects of the Southwest" by Floyd Werner and Carl Olson, solidifying
      its use in formal guides.
