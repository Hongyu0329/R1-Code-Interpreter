An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a point that satisfies `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`. The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem under the following conditions:
1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces (e.g., the set of real numbers `R`, or `R^n`).
2.  **Contraction Mapping**: The operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))` must be a contraction mapping on the product space `X × Y × Z`. A sufficient condition for this is that `F`, `G`, and `H` are Lipschitz continuous with respect to their arguments with constants (`α_i`, `β_i`, `γ_i`) such that the overall contraction factor `k` is less than 1. Specifically:
    - `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁*d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃*d_Z(z₁, z₂)`
    - `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, u₁), G(y₂, x₂, u₂)) ≤ β₁*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂*d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₃*d_Y(u₁, u₂)`
    - `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁*d_Z(z₁, z₂) + γ₂*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃*d_X(x₁, x₂)`
    The condition for contraction is `k = max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`.
