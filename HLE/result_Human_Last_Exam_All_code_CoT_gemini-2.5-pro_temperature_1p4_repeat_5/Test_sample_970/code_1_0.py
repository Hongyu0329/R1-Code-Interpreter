def solve():
    """
    This function determines the necessary assumptions and formats the answer
    in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Assumption (a) is necessary because the total expected information gain is
        bounded by the prior entropy. If the prior entropy is infinite, the sum
        of information gains can be infinite, and the terms are not guaranteed
        to go to zero.
    2.  Assumption (b) is necessary because the agent-environment interaction
        creates a feedback loop. Without regularity conditions on the state space
        and dynamics (like finiteness/compactness and smoothness), the agent's
        posterior beliefs may never stabilize, leading to a perpetual non-zero
        information gain.
    3.  Assumptions (c), (d), and (e) are sufficient under certain circumstances
        but are not necessary for the general case. (d) restricts the problem to
        i.i.d. data. (c) is an overly strong stability condition. (e) requires
        perfect learning, whereas information gain can cease even with residual
        uncertainty (a stabilized posterior).

    Therefore, the necessary assumptions are 'a' AND 'b'.

    In CNF, 'A AND B' is written as a conjunction of clauses: (A) AND (B).
    Applying the specified formatting rules (alphabetical ordering of clauses and
    literals, parentheses around clauses, brackets around the expression),
    we get the final answer.

    # The final expression is (a) AND (b)
    clause1 = "(a)"
    clause2 = "(b)"

    # Clauses are ordered alphabetically
    final_expression = f"[{clause1} AND {clause2}]"

    print(final_expression)
