    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial concept in quantum field theory that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams in the perturbative expansion of Green's functions. It is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which is the number of ways the vertices and lines can be permuted without changing the diagram's overall structure.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the symmetry factor for the specified diagram:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Diagram's Structure:** The diagram consists of two vertices and four field contractions (propagators) that connect these two vertices. All four propagators start at one vertex and end at the other.\n\n2.  **Identify Symmetries from Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. If we swap their positions, the diagram remains unchanged because the four connecting lines will still connect the same two points. The number of ways to permute these two vertices is 2! (2 factorial).\n\n3.  **Identify Symmetries from Line Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the vertices are also indistinguishable (assuming they correspond to the same type of field). Therefore, we can permute these four lines among themselves in any way without altering the diagram. The number of ways to permute these four lines is 4! (4 factorial).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor, S, is the product of the number of vertex permutations and line permutations, as these are independent symmetry operations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n\n    # Number of identical lines (propagators) connecting the vertices\n    num_lines = 4\n\n    # The symmetry factor includes permutations of indistinguishable vertices.\n    # For 2 vertices, this is 2!\n    vertex_permutations = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # The symmetry factor also includes permutations of indistinguishable lines.\n    # For 4 lines connecting the same two vertices, this is 4!\n    line_permutations = math.factorial(num_lines)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetries.\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_permutations * line_permutations\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor for a diagram with 2 vertices and 4 connecting lines.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1.
