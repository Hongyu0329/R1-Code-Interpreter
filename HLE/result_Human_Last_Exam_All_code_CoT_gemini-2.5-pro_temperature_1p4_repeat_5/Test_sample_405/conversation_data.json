    "My plan is to identify the main allotropes of phosphorus and their distinct colors. I will then write a Python script that lists these colors, counts them, and presents the total in a simple equation format as requested.\n\nThe main, well-established allotropes of phosphorus have the following colors:\n1.  **White Phosphorus:** Can also appear yellowish, so we'll count this as one color category (white/yellow).\n2.  **Red Phosphorus:** The color is red, sometimes purplish-red. We'll count this as a second distinct color.\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus. This is a distinct violet or purple color.\n4.  **Black Phosphorus:** Similar in appearance to graphite, this allotrope is black.\n\nThese are four distinct colors. The script will list these, then show the sum `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the common allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The distinct colors of the main phosphorus allotropes\n    colors = {\n        \"White (or yellow)\": 1,\n        \"Red\": 1,\n        \"Violet\": 1,\n        \"Black\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in the main allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color_name in colors.keys():\n        print(f\"- {color_name}\")\n\n    total_colors = len(colors)\n    \n    # Creating the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * total_colors\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nCounting these distinct colors gives the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
