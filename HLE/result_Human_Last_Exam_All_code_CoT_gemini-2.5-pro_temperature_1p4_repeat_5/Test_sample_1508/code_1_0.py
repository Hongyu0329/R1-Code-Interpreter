    # --- Part (a) ---
    # We test the claim: "if s > floor(n/2), the polynomials can always be made linearly dependent".
    # We will attempt to find a counterexample.
    # Let n=3. Then floor(n/2) = 1. We need s > 1, so let's choose s=2.
    # Let the set of intersection sizes be L = {0, 1}.
    #
    # Now, let's define an ordered L-intersecting family F of subsets of {1, 2, 3}.
    # Let F_1 = {3} and F_2 = {1, 2, 3}.
    # We check if F = {F_1, F_2} is a valid family:
    # 1. Intersection: |F_1 intersect F_2| = |{3}| = 1. Since 1 is in L, it is L-intersecting.
    # 2. Ordered: Let the special element be n=3.
    #    - n is in F_1 and F_2. So r=2. This part of the condition holds.
    #    - |F_1| = 1 and |F_2| = 3. Since 1 <= 3, the size ordering |F_i| <= |F_j| for i < j holds.
    # The family is valid. Now we construct the polynomials.
