    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we first need to understand the relationship between wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups.\n\nThere are 17 wallpaper groups in total. Each is associated with one of the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups. The \"order\" of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains (like rotations or reflections).\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify which of the 10 crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The two such groups are:\n    *   **Point group 2 (or C₂):** Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   **Point group m (or Cₛ):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n2.  List all wallpaper groups that correspond to point group 2.\n3.  List all wallpaper groups that correspond to point group m.\n4.  Sum these counts to get the total number.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this lookup and calculation for you.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the number of wallpaper groups\n    with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mapping of each wallpaper group to its corresponding point group.\n    wallpaper_to_point_group = {\n        'p1': '1',\n        'p2': '2',\n        'pm': 'm',\n        'pg': 'm',\n        'cm': 'm',\n        'p2mm': '2mm',\n        'p2mg': '2mm',\n        'p2gg': '2mm',\n        'c2mm': '2mm',\n        'p4': '4',\n        'p4mm': '4mm',\n        'p4gm': '4mm',\n        'p3': '3',\n        'p3m1': '3m',\n        'p31m': '3m',\n        'p6': '6',\n        'p6mm': '6mm'\n    }\n\n    # The order (number of symmetry operations) for each point group.\n    point_group_orders = {\n        '1': 1,\n        '2': 2,\n        'm': 2,\n        '2mm': 4,\n        '3': 3,\n        '3m': 6,\n        '4': 4,\n        '4mm': 4,\n        '6': 6,\n        '6mm': 6\n    }\n\n    groups_with_pg_2 = []\n    groups_with_pg_m = []\n\n    # Iterate through all wallpaper groups to find those with a point group of order 2.\n    for group, pg in wallpaper_to_point_group.items():\n        if point_group_orders.get(pg) == 2:\n            if pg == '2':\n                groups_with_pg_2.append(group)\n            elif pg == 'm':\n                groups_with_pg_m.append(group)\n\n    count_pg_2 = len(groups_with_pg_2)\n    count_pg_m = len(groups_with_pg_m)\n    total_count = count_pg_2 + count_pg_m\n\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are '2' (rotation) and 'm' (reflection).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group '2': {count_pg_2}\")\n    print(f\"They are: {', '.join(groups_with_pg_2)}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group 'm': {count_pg_m}\")\n    print(f\"They are: {', '.join(groups_with_pg_m)}\\n\")\n    print(\"To find the total, we sum the counts from each point group:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {count_pg_2} + {count_pg_m} = {total_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is: {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_groups()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
