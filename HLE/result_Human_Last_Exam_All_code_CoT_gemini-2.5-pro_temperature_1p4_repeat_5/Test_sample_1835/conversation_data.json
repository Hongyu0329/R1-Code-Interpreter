    "Here is a Python script that models this philosophical concept.\n\nMy plan is to represent concepts from the proposition as Python functions and data structures.\n1.  I will define a predicate 'F' (e.g., `is_red`) as a function and a singular term 'a' (e.g., an apple) as a data object.\n2.  I will demonstrate that understanding the proposition 'Fa' means being able to apply the function `F` to the object `a`.\n3.  I will then define the concept of universal quantification '∀' (for all) as a higher-order function that can accept any predicate as an input.\n4.  Finally, following the logic of the Generality Constraint, I will show that since the predicate 'F' and the quantifier '∀' are understood as independent, recombinable concepts, they can be combined to form the new, understandable proposition '∀x(Fx)'.\n\nThe code will conclude by printing the structure of this new proposition, identifying each of its logical components as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_with_code():\n    \"\"\"\n    Models Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the components for the proposition 'Fa'.\n    # 'a' is a singular term, representing a specific object.\n    a = {\"name\": \"this particular apple\", \"properties\": [\"is_red\", \"is_fruit\"]}\n\n    # 'F' is a predicate.
