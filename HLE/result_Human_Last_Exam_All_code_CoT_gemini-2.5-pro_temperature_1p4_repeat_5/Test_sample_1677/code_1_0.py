# Plan:
# 1. Identify the incorrect or inappropriate statements among the given options (A, B, C, D, E).
#    - A is incorrect: The 18-year-old population decline has been sharp, not moderate.
#    - C is inappropriate: The number of adult learners is too small to be a primary driver of the overall trend.
#    - D is incorrect: The relationship described between different types of institutions is a mischaracterization.
# 2. Collect the letters of the incorrect/inappropriate options. Result: ['A', 'C', 'D'].
# 3. Sort them alphabetically (they are already in order).
# 4. Join them with a comma for the final output string.

# The incorrect or inappropriate options are A, C, and D.
incorrect_options = ["A", "C", "D"]

# The options are already in alphabetical order.
final_answer_string = ",".join(incorrect_options)

print(f"The incorrect or inappropriate options are: {final_answer_string}")
print("<<<A,C,D>>>")
