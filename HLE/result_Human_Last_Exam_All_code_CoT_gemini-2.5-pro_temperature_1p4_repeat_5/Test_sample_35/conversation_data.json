    "To determine the correct hand to shove all-in with, we need to analyze the situation from a poker strategy perspective, specifically using the concept of Expected Value (EV). A shove is profitable if its EV is greater than the EV of folding (which is zero).\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Define the Scenario**: We are UTG+1 with a 16 big blind (bb) stack near the money bubble. The pot contains blinds and antes, which we can estimate as 2.5bb (1bb from the Big Blind, 0.5bb from the Small Blind, and 1bb from antes).\n2.  **Estimate Opponent Behavior**: Because we are near the money bubble, our opponents will play very cautiously and will only call our all-in with a very strong range of hands. A reasonable estimate for a calling range is `TT+` (pocket tens or better) and `AK`.\n3.  **Calculate Fold Equity**: We will calculate the probability that all 7 of our opponents fold to our shove, given their tight calling range. The profit from this is the 2.5bb already in the pot.\n4.  **Calculate Showdown Equity**: For the times we are called, we need to know our hand's equity (chance of winning) against the tight calling range.\n5.  **Calculate Expected Value (EV)**: We will use the following formula to calculate the EV for each hand option:\n    `EV = (Probability_Everyone_Folds * Pot_Won) + (Probability_We_Get_Called * EV_When_Called)`\n    Where `EV_When_Called` is `(Our_Equity * Total_Pot) - Amount_Risked`.\n\nA positive EV indicates a profitable shove. The script below will perform these calculations for each hand choice to find the best option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_shove_ev():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Expected Value (EV) of shoving all-in for different hands\n    in a specific poker tournament scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
