    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, we can use a computational approach. The problem is well-suited for a recursive (backtracking) algorithm.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem**: We need to find the number of paths of length 10 on a 2D grid starting from the origin `(0,0)`, such that the path never visits the same coordinate twice.\n2.  **Algorithm**: A recursive function will explore all possible paths. This function, let's call it `count_walks`, will keep track of the remaining steps, the current position, and the set of all points visited so far.\n3.  **Recursive Function Logic**:\n    *   **Base Case**: If there are no steps left (`steps_left == 0`), a valid 10-step path has been found, so we return 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: From the current position, we try moving in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, if the new position has not been visited before, we make a recursive call from that new position with one fewer step remaining. The total number of walks from the current position is the sum of the results from these recursive calls.\n4.  **Optimization**: This recursive process involves many repeated sub-problems. To avoid re-computing the same states, we will use memoization (caching). Python's `@functools.lru_cache` is ideal for this. The set of visited points must be converted to a `frozenset` to be compatible with the cache.\n5.  **Execution**: We'll start the process from the origin `(0,0)` with 10 steps to take. The script will then compute and print the final number.\n\n```python\nimport functools\nimport sys\n\n# For a walk of length 10, the recursion depth can be significant.\n# We increase Python's default recursion limit to prevent potential errors.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\ndef count_walks(steps_left, current_pos, visited_points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a grid.\n    This function is memoized using @lru_cache for performance.\n\n    Args:\n        steps_left: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n        current_pos: An (x, y) tuple for the current position.\n        visited_points: A frozenset of (x, y) tuples of previously visited points.\n                        A frozenset is used because it's hashable and can be cached.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one complete walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    x, y = current_pos\n    total_walks = 0\n\n    # Consider the four possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n    for dx, dy in moves:\n        next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n\n        # A walk is self-avoiding, so we can only move to an unvisited square.\n        if next_pos not in visited_points:\n            # Recursively call the function for the next step.\n            # We pass a new frozenset that includes the next position.\n            total_walks += count_walks(\n                steps_left - 1,\n                next_pos,\n                visited_points.union({next_pos})\n            )\n\n    return total_walks\n\n# The number of steps for the walk.\nn = 10\n\n# All walks start at the origin (0, 0).\nstart_pos = (0, 0)\n\n# The initial set of visited points contains only the starting position.\n# We use a frozenset to make it compatible with the cache.\ninitial_visited = frozenset([start_pos])\n\n# Calculate the total number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\nresult = count_walks(n, start_pos, initial_visited)\n\n# Print the final result, showing the numbers used in the \"equation\".\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<255572>>>"
