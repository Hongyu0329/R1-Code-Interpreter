    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\nThe problem is to find the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, $u^*$, in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four spatial dimensions. This is a classic problem in the study of critical phenomena and the renormalization group.\n\n**Step 1: The Renormalization Group and the Beta Function**\nThe behavior of a quantum field theory at different energy scales is described by the Renormalization Group (RG). The \"running\" of a coupling constant, let's call it $u$, with respect to an energy scale $\\mu$ is governed by the beta function, defined as $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$. To analyze the theory near four dimensions, we use dimensional regularization, setting the spacetime dimension to $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter. In $d \\neq 4$ dimensions, the coupling $u$ has a non-zero mass dimension. To work with a dimensionless coupling (which is conventional), we introduce the energy scale $\\mu$, which results in an explicit dependence on $\\epsilon$ in the beta function.\n\n**Step 2: The Beta Function for $\\phi^4$ Theory**\nThe beta function for the coupling $u$ in the $\\phi^4$ theory can be calculated using perturbation theory. To find the leading order quantum corrections, we compute the one-loop Feynman diagrams that contribute to the four-point vertex. In $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, the integrals associated with these loop diagrams are divergent. Dimensional regularization allows us to systematically handle these divergences, which manifest as poles in $1/\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 3: One-Loop Beta Function Expression**\nAfter performing the one-loop calculation and applying a renormalization scheme like Minimal Subtraction (MS), the beta function for the dimensionless coupling $u$ is found to be:\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3 u^2}{16 \\pi^2} + O(u^3)$\nThe first term, $-\\epsilon u$, comes from the classical (or engineering) dimension of the coupling constant. The second term, proportional to $u^2$, represents the leading quantum correction from the one-loop diagrams. The factor of 3 arises from the three possible ways to form a loop in the four-point vertex (the s, t, and u channels).\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Fixed Points**\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling, $u^*$, where the beta function vanishes, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. At a fixed point, the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale, and the theory becomes scale-invariant. To find the fixed points, we need to solve the equation:\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3 (u^*)^2}{16 \\pi^2} = 0$\n\n**Step 5: The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point**\nSolving the equation reveals two possible fixed points:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the trivial or Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a non-interacting theory.\n2.  $\\epsilon = \\frac{3 u^*}{16 \\pi^2}$: This gives a non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nSolving the second case for $u^*$ gives the desired leading-order expression:\n$u^* = \\frac{16 \\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon$\n\nThis fixed point is crucial as it governs the universal critical behavior of systems described by the $\\phi^4$ theory, such as the liquid-gas transition and uniaxial ferromagnets near their critical points. The expression is valid to leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final expression and its constituent numerical parts as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and displays the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for the equation.\n    u_star, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u^* epsilon pi')\n\n    # The fixed point equation is beta(u^*) = 0.\n    # At one-loop order, the beta function for the coupling u is:\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 * u**2) / (16 * pi**2)\n    # Setting this to zero for u = u_star gives the equation to solve.\n    fixed_point_eq = sympy.Eq(-epsilon * u_star + (3 * u_star**2) / (16 * pi**2), 0)\n\n    # Solve the equation for u_star.
