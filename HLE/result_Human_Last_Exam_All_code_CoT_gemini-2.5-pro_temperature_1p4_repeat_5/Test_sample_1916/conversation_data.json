    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the Problem:** The question asks for the number of categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism. A category with a single object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. The object is just a placeholder, and the morphisms from the object to itself form the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation.\n\n2.  **Monoid Properties:**\n    *   A monoid is a set `S` with an associative binary operation `∘` and an identity element `id`.\n    *   In our case, the set `S` of morphisms has 3 elements. Let's call them `{id, a, b}`.\n    *   One of these must be the identity morphism, `id`.\n    *   The composition operation `∘` must be **associative**: `(x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)` for all `x, y, z` in `S`.\n    *   The `id` element must be the **identity**: `id ∘ x = x` and `x ∘ id = x` for all `x` in `S`.\n\n3.  **Computational Approach:**\n    *   We can represent the morphisms as integers `{0, 1, 2}`, where `0` is the identity element (`id`).\n    *   The composition operation can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (a Cayley table).\n    *   The identity property fixes the first row and column of the table.\n    *   We only need to determine the four inner entries of the table: `a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, and `b∘b`. Each can be one of `{0, 1, 2}`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible tables.\n    *   We will generate all 81 tables and check each one for associativity.\n    *   **Isomorphism:** Two monoids are isomorphic if we can relabel the non-identity elements to turn one into the other. Here, that means swapping the labels of `a` and `b` (i.e., `1` and `2`). For each valid (associative) monoid, we will generate its \"twin\" by swapping `1` and `2`. To count only unique isomorphism classes, we'll convert each table and its twin to a canonical form (e.g., the lexicographically smaller of the two) and store these canonical forms in a set to eliminate duplicates.\n\n4.  **Execution:** The Python script will:\n    *   Iterate through all 81 possible ways to complete the multiplication table.\n    *   For each table, check the associativity property for all combinations of elements.\n    *   If a table is associative, find its canonical form to represent its isomorphism class.\n    *   Add this canonical form to a set to count the unique classes.\n    *   Finally, print the distinct tables found and the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object\n    and three morphisms.
