# Step 1: Calculate passes for multi-token answers.
# Each multi-token answer requires a separate forward pass. For an answer 'A',
# the model must process the input 'Prompt + A' to calculate the full conditional
# probability. Since the 4 multi-token answers are different, we need 4 distinct
# forward passes.
passes_for_multi_token = num_multi_token_choices

# Step 2: Calculate *additional* passes for single-token answers.
# The probability for a single-token answer 'C' is found by looking at the
# model's output distribution right after it processes the 'Prompt'.
# This calculation is already performed during the first forward pass for any
# of the multi-token answers (e.g., during the pass for 'Prompt + A').
# We can simply reuse that part of the computation.
# Therefore, no extra passes are needed for the single-token answers.
additional_passes_for_single_token = 0

# Step 3: Sum the passes to find the minimal total.
total_minimal_passes = passes_for_multi_token + additional_passes_for_single_token

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
