    "My plan is to identify the movie that contains the specific scene described. The key elements are:\n1.  A Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n2.  A teenage character.\n3.  A pink bicycle.\n4.  The character pedaling the bike directly *towards* an oncoming car.\n\nThis combination of elements points to a very specific scene in a popular 1980s horror film. I have identified the movie and will create a Python script to print its title, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking to identify a specific Hollywood film based on a scene description.\n# The scene involves a teenager on a pink bike riding towards an oncoming car.\n# This iconic scene occurs in the fourth installment of a famous horror franchise.\n\n# The film is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master' (1988).\n# The character is the protagonist, Alice Johnson.\n# In a dream sequence, she stands up to a threat by pedaling her pink bike into an oncoming car, causing a spectacular crash.\n\nmovie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master\"\n\nprint(f\"The film with the scene described is: {movie_title}\")\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
