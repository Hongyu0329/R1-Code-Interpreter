    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, $Q_{128}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, belongs to the family of groups $Q_{4n}$. Here, $4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. The group $Q_{128}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. It has a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ such that for some integer $k$, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on the exponent $k$:** We can analyze the structure of $G^k$ by considering two cases for the exponent $k$.\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is an odd number.**\n        For any odd $k$, it can be shown that the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $Q_{128}$ generates the entire group $Q_{128}$. This is because for an odd $k$, $\\gcd(k, 64)=1$, so the powers of $x$ generate the full cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$. The powers of the other elements (of the form $yx^i$) will fill out the rest of the group. Therefore, for any odd $k$, $(Q_{128})^k = Q_{128}$. This gives us **1** unique power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is an even number.**\n        For any even $k$, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $Q_{128}$ forms a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, it can be shown that $(Q_{128})^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups this form can produce.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups from Even Exponents:** The distinct subgroups are determined by the distinct possible values of $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$, where $k$ is an even integer. Since $k$ is even and 64 is a power of 2, their gcd must also be an even number. Furthermore, any gcd must be a divisor of 64. Thus, the possible values for $d$ are precisely the **even divisors of 64**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases: 1 (from odd exponents) + (number of even divisors of 64).\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the number of even divisors of 64 and add it to 1 to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n    # The group is Q_4n, so 4n = 128, which means n = 32.\n    # The maximal cyclic subgroup <x> has order 2n = 64.\n    cyclic_order = 64\n\n    # Case 1: k is odd\n    # For any odd exponent k, the power subgroup (Q_128)^k is Q_128 itself.\n    # This accounts for 1 unique power subgroup.\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n    print(f\"For any odd exponent k, the power subgroup is the group Q_{group_order} itself.\")\n    print(f\"Number of subgroups from odd k: {num_from_odd_k}\\n\")\n\n    # Case 2: k is even\n    # For any even exponent k, the power subgroup is <x^d>, where d = gcd(k, 64).\n    # The possible values of d are the even divisors of 64.\n    # We will now count the number of even divisors of 64.\n    print(f\"For any even exponent k, the power subgroups are cyclic subgroups of the form <x^d>,\")\n    print(f\"where d is an even divisor of {cyclic_order}.\")\n\n    even_divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, cyclic_order + 1):\n        if cyclic_order % i == 0:  # Check if i is a divisor\n            if i % 2 == 0:        # Check if the divisor is even\n                even_divisors.append(i)\n\n    num_from_even_k = len(even_divisors)\n    print(f\"The even divisors of {cyclic_order} are: {even_divisors}\")\n    print(f\"Number of subgroups from even k: {num_from_even_k}\\n\")\n\n    # Total number of power subgroups is the sum from both cases.\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n\n    # Output the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum from both cases.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {num_from_odd_k} + {num_from_even_k} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
