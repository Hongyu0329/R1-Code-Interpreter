    "For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$. This is because as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the denominator approaches zero only at $x=0$, causing the integrand to diverge at that point. The contribution from the region near $x=0$ will thus be the most significant.\n\nMy plan to find the analytical approximation is as follows:\n1.  **Approximate the denominator**: For small $x$, the polynomial $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is well-approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$, which is $9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n2.  **Simplify the integral**: We can approximate the integral by replacing the full polynomial with this dominant term. So, $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n3.  **Extend the integration limit**: For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integrand becomes negligible for larger $x$ much faster than when $\\epsilon=0$. The main contribution comes from a small region around $x=0$. Therefore, extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ will not significantly affect the result for the leading-order approximation. The integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n4.  **Solve the integral analytically**: This simplified integral is of a standard form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c x^p} dx$. It can be solved using a substitution and its solution is known in terms of the Gamma or Beta function. The result has the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^E$. The exponent is $E = (1-p)/p$ and the coefficient is $C = c^{-1/p} \\frac{\\pi/p}{\\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n5.  **Calculate the constants**: I will use a Python script to compute the numerical values for the coefficient $C$ and the exponent $E$ using $c=9.0$ and $p=5.0$. The script will then print the final analytical formula.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Identify parameters from the dominant term.\n# The integrand is 1 / (epsilon + 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0).\n# For x near 0, the term 9.0*x^5.0 dominates the polynomial part.\n# So, we have the form c*x^p.\nc = 9.0\np = 5.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the exponent for epsilon in the approximation.\n# The scaling law for the integral gives the exponent E = (1-p)/p.\nexponent = (1.0 - p) / p\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the coefficient of the approximation.\n# The coefficient C is given by the formula: c**(-1/p) * (pi/p) / sin(pi/p).\ncoefficient = (c**(-1.0 / p)) * (math.pi / p) / math.sin(math.pi / p)\n\n# Step 4: Output the final analytical formula with the calculated numbers.\nprint(\"The analytical approximation for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) approx C * epsilon^E\")\nprint(\"\\nBased on the analysis, the constants are:\")\nprint(f\"C = {c}^(-1/{p}) * (pi/{p}) / sin(pi/{p})\")\nprint(f\"E = (1-{p})/{p}\")\nprint(\"\\nNumerically, these are:\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient C = {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"Exponent E = {exponent}\")\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final approximate formula is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 {coefficient} * epsilon^({exponent})\")\n\n```\n<<<0.6888260331498353>>>"
