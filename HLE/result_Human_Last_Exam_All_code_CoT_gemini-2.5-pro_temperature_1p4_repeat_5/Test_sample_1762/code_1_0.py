    # The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a topological space X
    # with a specific set of properties.

    # Let's analyze the properties of X:
    # 1. X is a metric space.
    # 2. For any distinct x, y in X, there is a closed connected set K such that
    #    x is in the interior of K and K does not contain y. This property implies
    #    that X is a Hausdorff space and also locally connected.
    # 3. X is locally compact.
    # 4. X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R.

    # Let f: R -> X be the continuous bijection from the real line to X.

    # From property 4, we can deduce several key characteristics of X:
    # a) X is connected: It is the continuous image of a connected space (R).
    # b) X is separable: Let Q be the set of rational numbers, which is a countable
    #    dense subset of R. Then f(Q) is a countable subset of X. Since f is continuous,
    #    f(closure(Q)) is a subset of closure(f(Q)). This means f(R) is a subset of
    #    closure(f(Q)), so X is a subset of closure(f(Q)). Therefore, f(Q) is a
    #    countable dense subset, and X is separable.
    # c) Every point in X is a cut point that separates X into exactly two
    #    components. Let p be any point in X and let a = f^-1(p). The set R \ {a}
    #    has two connected components: (-infinity, a) and (a, infinity). Since f is
    #    a bijection, it maps these components to two disjoint connected sets whose
    #    union is X \ {p}. Thus, X \ {p} has exactly two connected components.

    # A classical theorem in topology (due to R.L. Moore) characterizes the real line.
    # It states that a metric space is homeomorphic to the real line R if and only if
    # it is connected, separable, locally connected, has more than one point, and
    # every point is a cut point.

    # Let's check if our space X satisfies all these conditions:
    # - Metric space: Yes, from property 1.
    # - Connected: Yes, from property 4.
    # - Separable: Yes, from property 4.
    # - Locally connected: Yes, from property 2.
    # - Every point is a cut point: Yes, from property 4.
    # - Has more than one point: Yes, property 2 refers to a "pair of distinct points".

    # Therefore, any space X that satisfies the given conditions must be
    # homeomorphic to the real line R. This means all such spaces belong to a
    # single homeomorphism class.

    # To be sure that such a space actually exists, we check if R itself satisfies
    # all the given properties.
    # - R is a metric space: Yes.
    # - Property 2 holds for R: For any x != y in R, the closed interval
    #   K = [x - |x-y|/2, x + |x-y|/2] is a closed, connected set containing x in
    #   its interior and not containing y. This holds.
    # - R is locally compact: Yes.
    # - R is a one-to-one continuous image of R: Yes, via the identity map.

    # Since R satisfies all conditions, and any space X satisfying the conditions
    # must be homeomorphic to R, there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.

    # The number of different homeomorphism classes is 1.
    number_of_classes = 1
    
    # The problem has no equation, so we will just print the final answer.
    print(f"The number of different homeomorphism classes for such X is: {number_of_classes}")
