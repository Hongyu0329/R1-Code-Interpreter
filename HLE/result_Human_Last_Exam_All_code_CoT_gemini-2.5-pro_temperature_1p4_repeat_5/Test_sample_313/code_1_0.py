# This script identifies two languages based on a set of linguistic clues.

# Identification of Language 'a'
# Clues: No 'k' or 'w' in the orthography, but 'à' is present. It is a recognized minority language.
# Reasoning: Scottish Gaelic's 18-letter alphabet excludes 'k' and 'w', uses the letter 'à',
# and it is a recognized minority language in Scotland. This fits the criteria perfectly.
language_a = "Scottish Gaelic"

# Identification of Language 'b'
# Clues: The letter combinations "ggj" and "skt" are very widely used. It is a recognized minority language.
# Reasoning: The "ggj" and "skt" consonant clusters are characteristic features of
# Northern Saami, which is a recognized minority language in several Nordic countries.
language_b = "Northern Saami"

# Printing the final answer
print("Based on the analysis of the clues:")
