    "My plan is to determine the most memory-efficient way to implement the solution in C. This involves identifying the essential variables needed to store the input and process it without creating unnecessary copies. I will then calculate the total memory in bytes that these variables occupy on a standard system.\n\n1.  **Input Storage:** The problem states the strings can have a length up to 100. In C, to store a string of 100 characters, we need a character array of size 101 to accommodate the terminating null character (`\\0`). We need two such arrays for the two input strings.\n2.  **Processing:** To compare the strings, we can iterate through them with a loop. This requires a single integer variable as a loop counter. We will compare characters at each position directly, converting them to lowercase \"on-the-fly\" using the `tolower()` function. This avoids allocating memory for new lowercase strings.\n3.  **Variable Memory Calculation:** I will calculate the memory for each variable based on standard data type sizes ( `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes on competitive programming platforms).\n4.  **Total Memory:** The total memory, `m`, will be the sum of the memory required for the two character arrays and the integer loop counter.\n\nI will now provide the calculation in the requested Python code block format.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify the necessary variables for a memory-efficient C solution.\n#    - Two char arrays for input strings (max length 100 + 1 for null terminator).\n#    - One integer for the loop counter.\n# 2. Calculate the memory in bytes for each variable.\n#    - sizeof(char) = 1 byte\n#    - sizeof(int) = 4 bytes (standard on most 32/64-bit systems)\n# 3. Sum the memory usage to find the total 'm'.\n\n# Memory for the first string buffer\n# char string1[101];\nmem_string1 = 101 * 1\n\n# Memory for the second string buffer\n# char string2[101];\nmem_string2 = 101 * 1\n\n# Memory for the loop counter variable\n# int i;\nmem_loop_counter = 4\n\n# Calculate the total memory 'm'\ntotal_memory = mem_string1 + mem_string2 + mem_loop_counter\n\nprint(\"The total memory 'm' is the sum of memory for all variables in the C program.\")\n# As requested, printing the final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"m = {mem_string1} bytes (for string 1) + {mem_string2} bytes (for string 2) + {mem_loop_counter} bytes (for the loop counter)\")\nprint(f\"m = {total_memory} bytes\")\n\n```\n<<<206>>>"
