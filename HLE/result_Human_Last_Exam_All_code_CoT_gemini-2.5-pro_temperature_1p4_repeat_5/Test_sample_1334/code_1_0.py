    Solves the theoretical questions about dessins d'enfants and group theory.
    
    (a) Determines if a minimal normal subgroup N must act semi-regularly on vertex and face sets for a smooth covering.
    (b) Determines if a quasi-simple group G must be perfect in the context of a smooth covering.
    (c) Identifies the possible types for a face-quasiprimitive group G with specific dessin properties.
    """
    
    # Part (a) Answer: True
    # Reason: The condition of a smooth covering implies that the cyclic subgroups generated by b, w, and bw intersect trivially with N.
    # This leads to the stabilizer of any vertex or face in N being trivial, which is the definition of a semi-regular action.
    
    # Part (b) Answer: True
    # Reason: By definition, a quasi-simple group G is a perfect group (G = G') where G/Z(G) is simple.
    # The information about the dessin is not needed to answer this question about the group's definition.
    
    # Part (c) Answer: HA, AS, TW, SD, CD, PA
    # Reason: The conditions imply G has a unique minimal normal subgroup. If G had two (or more) minimal normal subgroups,
    # the face-quasiprimitivity and unicellular quotient conditions would force G to be abelian.
    # The types HS and HC have at least two minimal normal subgroups which are non-abelian or non-simple in a way that
    # contradicts G being abelian. Therefore, only types with a single minimal normal subgroup are possible.
