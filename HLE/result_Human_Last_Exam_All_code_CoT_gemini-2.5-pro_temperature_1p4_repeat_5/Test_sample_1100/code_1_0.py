# The user wants python code based on the numbers in the text.
# The numbers are: 29 (age), 8 (years of history), 2 (drugs mentioned: antipsychotic and the one for side effects),
# 1 (monthly injection), and 1 (baby).
# I will create a simple equation using these numbers.

# Assign the numbers to variables for clarity
age = 29
history_years = 8
num_drugs = 2
monthly_injection = 1
baby = 1

# Perform a simple calculation
result = age - history_years - num_drugs - monthly_injection - baby

# Print the final equation with each number as requested.
print(f"The equation derived from the numbers in the text is:")
print(f"{age} - {history_years} - {num_drugs} - {monthly_injection} - {baby} = {result}")
