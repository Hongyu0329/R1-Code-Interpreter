# The reasoning above establishes that there is only one such class of spaces.
# The question is "How many homeomorphism classes... exist".
# The answer is an integer.

# Let's represent the logic in a simple calculation, as if it were a formula.
# We found that for an n-star graph, the disconnection number D is n + 1.
# We are given that the disconnection number D is 4.
# D = n + 1
# 4 = n + 1
# n = 4 - 1
# n = 3
# This implies that the 3-star graph is a solution.
# Our analysis suggests this is the only solution.
# So, the number of homeomorphism classes is 1.

number_of_classes = 1
