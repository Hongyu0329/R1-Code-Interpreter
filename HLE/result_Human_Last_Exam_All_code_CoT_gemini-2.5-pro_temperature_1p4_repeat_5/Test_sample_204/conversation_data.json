    "To find the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we will use the topological definition of the Hopf charge. The Hopf charge, H, is an integer that represents the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values of the mapping from R³ to the unit sphere S². Our vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)` is such a mapping.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Select two regular values on the sphere S²**. A convenient choice is the \"south pole\" `p1 = (0, 0, -1)` and an \"equatorial\" point `p2 = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  **Find the preimage of `p1`**. We will solve the equation `n(x,y,z) = p1` to find the set of points in R³ that map to the south pole. This set forms a curve, `C1`.\n3.  **Find the preimage of `p2`**. We will solve `n(x,y,z) = p2` to find its corresponding preimage curve, `C2`.\n4.  **Determine the linking number of `C1` and `C2`**. By analyzing the geometry of the two curves, we can determine if and how many times they link with each other. This linking number is the Hopf charge H.\n5.  **Write a Python script** that follows these analytical steps and prints the final result.\n\nThe calculation is primarily analytical, but the Python code will serve to document the process and present the final computed charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by finding the linking\n    number of the preimages of two regular points.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The vector field (nx,ny,nz) is defined by:\n    # f = atan2(y,x)\n    # r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)**2 + z*z)\n    # G = PI * exp(-10*r2)\n    # n = (sin(G)*cos(f), sin(G)*sin(f), cos(G))\n    # where PI is the mathematical constant pi.\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The Hopf charge H is the linking number of the preimages of two regular values.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the preimage C1 for the point p1 = (0,0,-1).\n    # n = (0,0,-1) implies cos(G) = -1, which means G = pi.\n    # G = pi * exp(-10*r2) = pi  =>  exp(-10*r2) = 1  =>  r2 = 0.\n    # r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)**2 + z*z) = 0\n    # This implies z=0 and (x*x+y*y-0.5) = 0.\n    # So, C1 is the circle: x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0.\n    print(\"Step 2: The preimage C1 for n=(0,0,-1) is the circle x^2+y^2=0.5 in the z=0 plane.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the preimage C2 for the point p2 = (1,0,0).\n    # n = (1,0,0) implies cos(G) = 0 and (cos(f)=1, sin(f)=0).\n    # f = 0 implies y = 0 and x > 0.\n    # cos(G) = 0 implies G = pi/2.\n    # G = pi * exp(-10*r2) = pi/2  =>  exp(-10*r2) = 0.5  =>  r2 = ln(2)/10.\n    # With y=0, r2^2 = (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2.\n    # So, C2 is the curve: (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2, for y=0 and x>0.\n    R_c2_sq = (np.log(2)/10)**2\n    print(f\"Step 3: The preimage C2 for n=(1,0,0) is the loop (x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = {R_c2_sq:.6f}, in the y=0 plane.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the linking number.\n    # Curve C1 is a circle of radius sqrt(0.5) in the xy-plane.
