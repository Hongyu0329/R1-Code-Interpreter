    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand:** The expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard form `f'(x)/f(x)`, whose integral is `ln(|f(x)|)`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln(|F₃(x)|)]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This gives `ln(|F₃(1)|) - ln(|F₃(0)|)`. I will first verify that `F₃(x)` is positive over the interval `[0, 1]` to remove the absolute value signs.\n3.  **Calculate Boundary Values:** I will calculate `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)` by substituting `x=0` and `x=1` into the defined function `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`.\n4.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   Let the value of the integral be `V`. Then `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n    *   I will calculate this value `V` using Python's `math` library.\n    *   Finally, I will compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer as requested.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the steps and the final result. The script will explicitly show the values of `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)` as part of the final equation's explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) from 0 to 1\n    and calculates the required value.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The functions are defined as:\n    # F₀(x) = x\n    # F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n    # F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    \n    # The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) dx is ln(F₃(x)).\n    # The definite integral from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate F₃(0)\n    # F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\n    f3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate F₃(1)\n    # F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    f3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the value of the integral V\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    # Note: math.log is the natural logarithm (ln)\n    V = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer\n    final_value = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the numbers in the final equation\n    print(\"The definite integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_at_0}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlugging these into the equation for V:\")\n    print(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\n    print(f\"V = {V}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinally, we calculate the requested value:\")\n    print(f\"10000 * V = {final_value}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is {closest_integer}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5496>>>\n```"
