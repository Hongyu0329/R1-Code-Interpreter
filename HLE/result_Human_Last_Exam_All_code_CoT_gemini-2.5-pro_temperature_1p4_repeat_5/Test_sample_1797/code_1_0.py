    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.
    
    A. Correct. Describes attack graphs as directed graphs and mentions valid analysis techniques like pathfinding.
    B. Correct. Accurately describes the state explosion problem and the potential for exponential growth.
    C. Incorrect. The attack graph *generation* problem itself is not generally considered NP-hard. Its complexity is typically polynomial in the size of the input configuration. The challenge is the potentially exponential *size* of the output graph and the complexity of certain *analysis* tasks on it.
    D. Correct. Real-world systems are dynamic, requiring incremental updates to the attack graph.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs are used with formal methods like model checking for security verification.

    The only incorrect statement is C.
