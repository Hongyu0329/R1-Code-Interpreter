    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer, followed by a Python script to calculate it for a specific case.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition**: First, let's define a Pauli channel, $\\Lambda$, which acts on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). Its operation on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger$\n    Here, the set $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ represents the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_{jk}$ are probabilities, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Rank of a Quantum Channel**: The rank of a quantum channel is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent it. For the Pauli channel above, a valid set of Kraus operators is $\\{K_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}\\}$. The rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of linearly independent operators in this set.\n\n3.  **Maximal Rank of the Pauli Channel**: Since the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ are inherently linearly independent, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators $\\{K_{jk}\\}$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$. To find the *maximal* possible rank, we must choose the probabilities such that the maximum number of them are non-zero. We can simply choose $p_{jk} > 0$ for all $d^2$ possible pairs of indices $(j,k)$. For example, we can set $p_{jk} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. This leads to $d^2$ non-zero Kraus operators. Thus, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n4.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel**: A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that a channel and its complementary channel have the same rank. If $\\Lambda$ is the original channel and $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is its complement, then:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the points above, the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the same as the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$. Therefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for an example dimension `d`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel\n    for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of the qudit system.

To maximize the rank, we can make all\n    # probabilities non-zero.
