# The analysis reveals a swap between two lines that disrupts the thematic
# and logical form of the poem, while preserving the strict end-word pattern
# of the sestina, making the error subtle.

# The first misplaced line is part of the concluding envoi.
line_number_1 = 74
line_text_1 = "Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music"

# This line has been swapped with a line from Stanza 6.
line_number_2 = 32
line_text_2 = "Have prayed me leave my strange exclaiming music,"

# Swapping them back resolves thematic issues in both locations.
# The "Long since" line moves to the "Long since" stanza, and the
# more summary-appropriate line moves to the envoi.

# The problem asks for the answer in the form of two line numbers.
