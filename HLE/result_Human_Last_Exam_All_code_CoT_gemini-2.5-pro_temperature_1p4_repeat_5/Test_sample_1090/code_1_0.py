# The patient's primary problem is a new, severe inability to ambulate after a period of critical illness and hospitalization.
# A key indicator of the underlying cause is his cardiovascular response to exertion.
# We can quantify this response by calculating the change in his heart rate when he attempts to stand.

# Patient's heart rate at rest.
resting_hr = 76 # beats/min

# Patient's heart rate upon attempting to stand.
standing_hr = 118 # beats/min

# Calculate the increase in heart rate.
hr_increase = standing_hr - resting_hr

# Print the analysis.
print("The patient's heart rate increases significantly upon attempting to stand, which is a classic sign of physical deconditioning.")
print("This, combined with his prolonged hospitalization and new knee contracture, makes functional decline the main issue to address.")
print("\nCalculation of Heart Rate Increase:")
# We will show the equation used for the final result.
print(f"{standing_hr} - {resting_hr} = {hr_increase}")
print(f"\nAn increase of {hr_increase} beats/min points to the need for intensive rehabilitation to restore strength and function.")
print("Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to focus on rehabilitation.")

# The final answer is determined by addressing the most pressing clinical problem, which is functional decline.
# Among possible interventions, aggressive rehabilitation is the most direct and necessary step.

# What is the single most appropriate next step in management of this patient?
# This will be enclosed in the special format as requested.
