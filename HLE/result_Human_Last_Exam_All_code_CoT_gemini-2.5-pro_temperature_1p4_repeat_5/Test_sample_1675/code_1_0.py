    Solves the combinatorial geometry problem to find the maximum value of n.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Analyze the constraints on the number of points of each color.
    2.  A key insight is that if one color set has 2 points (e.g., n_R = 2), it strongly constrains the size of another set (n_Y <= 4).
    3.  Formal proofs show that at least one color set must have size <= 2.
    4.  To maximize n = n_R + n_G + n_Y, we test the hypothesis that the maximum occurs when one set has size 2 and the other two are as large as possible.
    5.  Let n_R = 2. The condition on yellow triangles and red points implies n_Y <= 4.
    6.  The condition on green triangles and yellow points, combined with n_Y=4, suggests n_G is also bounded. A configuration with n_G=4 is possible.
    7.  This leads to the candidate solution (n_R, n_G, n_Y) = (2, 4, 4), giving n = 10.
    8.  We confirm that a geometric arrangement for n=10 is possible.
