    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. This means finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree:**\n    *   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   The fixed-point equation $h(x) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9. A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Constraints:**\n    *   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    *   Let's find the derivative of $h(x)$ using the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Since $g'(x)$ is always positive and $f'(y)$ is always positive for any input $y$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be strictly positive. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Relate to Rolle's Theorem:**\n    *   Let $P(x) = h(x) - x$. We want to find the maximum number of roots of $P(x)=0$.\n    *   By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $P(x)$, there must be at least one root of its derivative, $P'(x)$. This implies that the number of roots of $P(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of $P'(x)$.\n    *   The derivative is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. The roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h'(x) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum Number of Roots of $h'(x) = 1$:**\n    *   We need to determine the nature of $h'(x)$. It is a polynomial. To find the maximum number of times it can equal 1, we need to know its degree and how many local extrema it can have.\n    *   The number of local extrema of $h'(x)$ is limited by the number of roots of its derivative, $h''(x)$.\n    *   I will use a Python script to formalize the calculation of the degree of $h''(x)$.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the degree of $h''(x)$, we can determine the maximum number of roots for $h'(x)=1$, which in turn gives us the maximum number of roots for $P(x)=0$.\n\nHere is the Python code that walks through the degree calculations and the logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of fixed points for f(g(x))\n    based on the degrees of the derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We can represent polynomials by their degrees to analyze the structure of the problem.\n    class Polynomial:\n        def __init__(self, degree):\n            # A negative degree can represent the zero polynomial\n            self.degree = -1 if degree < 0 else degree\n        \n        def __mul__(self, other):\n            \"\"\"Multiplication of polynomials adds their degrees.\"\"\"\n            return Polynomial(self.degree + other.degree)\n            \n        def __add__(self, other):\n            \"\"\"\n            Addition of polynomials.
