# The ring is R = F_11, which is a field with q=11 elements.
# The R-module is M = (F_11)^3, a vector space of dimension n=3.
# We need to find the number of internal adjunctions from M to itself.
# Based on the definitions provided, an adjunction exists if and only if
# the 1-morphism L: M -> M is an isomorphism, with the other 1-morphism
# R being its inverse. The unit and counit 2-morphisms are then uniquely
# determined.
# Therefore, the task reduces to counting the number of automorphisms of M,
# which is the number of invertible 3x3 matrices with entries in F_11.
# This is the order of the general linear group GL(n, q) for n=3 and q=11.

# The formula for the order of GL(n, q) is:
# |GL(n, q)| = (q^n - q^0) * (q^n - q^1) * ... * (q^n - q^(n-1))

# Set the parameters for our problem
n = 3
q = 11

# Calculate the terms in the formula
term1 = q**n - q**0
term2 = q**n - q**1
term3 = q**n - q**2

# Calculate the final result
num_adjunctions = term1 * term2 * term3

# Print the calculation step by step
print(f"The number of adjunctions is given by the order of GL(3, 11).")
print(f"|GL(3, 11)| = ({q**n} - {q**0}) * ({q**n} - {q**1}) * ({q**n} - {q**2})")
print(f"             = {term1} * {term2} * {term3}")
print(f"             = {num_adjunctions}")
