    "To determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Mountains:** First, I'll compile a list of prominent mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the request. The key mountains are Mount Ida (near Troy), Mount Samothrace (where Poseidon watched the war), Mount Athos, and Mount Pelion.\n2.  **Find Elevations:** Next, I'll find the current official elevation for each of these mountains.\n    *   Mount Athos: 2,033 meters\n    *   Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey): 1,774 meters\n    *   Mount Pelion: 1,624 meters\n    *   Mount Samothrace (Fengari): 1,611 meters\n3.  **Compare and Identify the Tallest:** I will compare these elevations to find the highest peak among them.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary, iterates through them to find the maximum elevation, and prints the name and height of each mountain before declaring the tallest one as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus) and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of mountains mentioned in the Iliad (after Olympus):\")\n\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    max_elevation = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary to print each mountain and find the tallest\n    for name, elevation in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {elevation} meters\")\n        if elevation > max_elevation:\n            max_elevation = elevation\n            tallest_mountain_name = name\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest among these is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {max_elevation} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
