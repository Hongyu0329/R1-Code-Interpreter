# This problem is a theoretical question from the field of topology.
# The solution relies on established, non-trivial mathematical theorems rather than computation.
# The reasoning is as follows:
# 1. It is possible to construct a continuous function f: R -> R whose Stone-Cech
#    extension F has 0 fixed points in the remainder. For example, f(x) = -x.
# 2. According to a known theorem in the field, if the extension F has any
#    fixed points in the remainder, it must have at least two. The number of
#    fixed points cannot be one.
# 3. It has been shown that a function can be constructed (e.g., using almost
#    periodic functions) for which the extension F has exactly two fixed points
#    in the remainder.
#
# Combining these facts, the smallest possible NONZERO number of fixed points is 2.

smallest_nonzero_fixed_points = 2

# The prompt asks to output the final answer in an equation format.
print("Smallest_possible_nonzero_number_of_fixed_points = " + str(smallest_nonzero_fixed_points))
