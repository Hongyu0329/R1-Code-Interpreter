# The riddle describes the components of a Chinese character.
# The phrase "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke..." indicates 2 horizontal strokes.
num_horizontal = 2

# The phrase "...one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" indicates 2 vertical strokes.
num_vertical = 2

# The character formed by two horizontal strokes and two vertical strokes in a grid pattern
# is the character for "well".
final_character = "äº•"

# As requested, here is the final equation showing each number:
print(f"The description implies {num_horizontal} horizontal strokes + {num_vertical} vertical strokes.")
print(f"The resulting character is: {final_character}")
