    "Of course. The task is to find the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta) using the principles of large deviation theory (like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Foundation**: The core principle of large deviation theorems in this context is that the equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of microstates. This is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates.\n2.  **Setup the Optimization Problem**: We will maximize the entropy for a Bose gas subject to the relevant physical constraints. For a gas of photons, the particle number is not conserved, so the only constraint is a fixed total energy, $E$.\n3.  **Solve for the Equilibrium Distribution**: We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the particle distribution, $N_j$, that maximizes the entropy. This will yield the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n4.  **Calculate Mean Energy (E)**: Using the derived distribution and the density of states for photons in a three-dimensional volume, we will integrate over all energy levels to find the total mean energy, $E$, of the system. This result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy.\n5.  **Calculate Entropy (S)**: Finally, we will use the derived expression for energy and fundamental thermodynamic relations to find the equilibrium entropy, $S$.\n6.  **Python Implementation**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to symbolically represent and print the final, derived equations for both mean energy $E$ and entropy $S$, clearly showing all the constants and variables involved.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import init_printing, Integral, oo, pi, Symbol, Function, Eq, exp\n\ndef find_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses symbolic mathematics to derive and display the equilibrium\n    values for mean energy and entropy of a photon gas based on Bose-Einstein statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize pretty printing for mathematical formulas\n    init_printing(use_unicode=True)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define Symbols ---\n    # Define physical constants and variables as symbols for the equations.\n    k_B = Symbol('k_B')  # Boltzmann constant\n    T = Symbol('T')      # Absolute temperature\n    h = Symbol('h')      # Planck's constant\n    c = Symbol('c')      # Speed of light in vacuum\n    V = Symbol('V')      # Volume of the container\n    E = Symbol('E')      # Total mean energy of the system\n    S = Symbol('S')      # Total entropy of the system\n    epsilon = Symbol('epsilon', positive=True) # Energy variable for integration\n\n    print(\"--- Derivation of Equilibrium Values for a Photon Gas ---\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on maximizing entropy for a Bose gas with non-conserved particle number,\")\n    print(\"we first find the equilibrium distribution of photons over energy states.\")\n    print(\"This yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (where chemical potential is zero).\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
