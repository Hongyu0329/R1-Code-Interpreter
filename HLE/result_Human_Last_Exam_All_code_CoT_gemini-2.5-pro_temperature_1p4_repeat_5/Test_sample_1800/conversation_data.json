    "Here is my plan to address your request.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core scientific question. The \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis is not a single, universally fixed number but is determined experimentally and can vary based on the nanoparticle synthesis method, support material, and specific reaction conditions (like temperature and pressure).\n\nSecond, based on a review of scientific literature in my training data, I will identify a representative and commonly cited optimal ratio. Research often indicates that a low concentration of highly dispersed Ni on the Ceria support is most effective. A value of around 10 atomic percent Ni is frequently found to be a sweet spot, balancing high catalytic activity with resistance to deactivation (like sintering or coking).\n\nThird, I will write a Python script to present this information. The script will:\n1.  State the basis for the chosen ratio (literature consensus around 10 atomic percent Ni).\n2.  Define the parts of Nickel (Ni) and Cerium (Ce) based on this percentage (i.e., 10 parts Ni and 90 parts Ce).\n3.  Calculate the Ni/Ce molar ratio.\n4.  Print a clear, step-by-step explanation of the calculation, showing the numbers used in the equation as requested.\n5.  Output the final ideal ratio as a decimal.\n\nThis approach uses a script to answer your question, as requested, while grounding the answer in established scientific findings.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    based on values commonly reported in scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is determined experimentally.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
