    "My plan is to solve this riddle by following these steps:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle**: First, I will break down the user's question to identify the key elements. The question asks for a musical note corresponding to a specific range of colors on Newton's color circle.\n2.  **Identify the Colors**: The range is defined by two points:\n    *   The color created by mixing yellow and blue, which is green.\n    *   The color blue itself.\n3.  **Consult Newton's Mapping**: I will use the historical mapping proposed by Isaac Newton, which correlates the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a Western musical scale (diatonic scale).\n4.  **Map Colors to Notes**: I will find the specific musical notes that Newton assigned to the colors green and blue.\n5.  **Interpret the \"Range\"**: The question asks for the note of the \"range between\" green and blue. I will interpret this as the note that begins the \"blue\" section of the spectrum, as blue is explicitly mentioned as the endpoint of the range.\n6.  **Generate the Code**: I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps, explains the logic, and prints the final answer clearly, showing the components that lead to the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes.\n# Newton associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes\n# of a diatonic scale, commonly starting with Red as C.\ncolor_to_note_map = {\n    \"RED\": \"C\",\n    \"ORANGE\": \"D\",\n    \"YELLOW\": \"E\",\n    \"GREEN\": \"F\",\n    \"BLUE\": \"G\",\n    \"INDIGO\": \"A\",\n    \"VIOLET\": \"B\",\n}\n\n# Step 2: Identify the colors from the user's question.\n# The first color is the result of mixing yellow and blue.\ncolor1_name = \"GREEN\"\n# The second color is explicitly stated.\ncolor2_name = \"BLUE\"\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step derivation:\")\nprint(\"1. The first color in the range is the combination of yellow and blue, which is GREEN.\")\nprint(\"2. The second color defining the end of the range is BLUE.\")\n\n# Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes for these colors using the map.\nnote_for_green = color_to_note_map[color1_name]\nnote_for_blue = color_to_note_map[color2_name]\n\nprint(f\"3. According to Newton's mapping, GREEN corresponds to the note: {note_for_green}\")\nprint(f\"4. Similarly, BLUE corresponds to the note: {note_for_blue}\")\n\n# Step 4: Determine the single note for the specified range.\n# The question asks for the note for the \"range between\" green and blue.\n# On the circle, the color sequence is ...Green, Blue... and the note sequence is ...F, G...\n# Since the range ends with \"blue itself\", the note corresponding to blue is the most logical answer.\nfinal_answer = note_for_blue\n\nprint(\"5. The question asks for the note corresponding to the 'range between green and blue'.\")\nprint(\"   This range on the color/note circle starts with Green (F) and moves to Blue (G).\")\nprint(\"   The note representing the end of this range (Blue) is the answer.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\nprint(f\"Start of Range: GREEN -> Note {note_for_green}\")\nprint(f\"End of Range: BLUE -> Note {note_for_blue}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting Note: {final_answer}\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output\nprint(output)\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
