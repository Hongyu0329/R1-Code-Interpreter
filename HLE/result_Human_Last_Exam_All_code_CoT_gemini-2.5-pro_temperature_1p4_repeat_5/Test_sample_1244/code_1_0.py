# This script formalizes the answers based on the reasoning above.

# Part (a)
# An even unimodular lattice of rank n exists iff n is a multiple of 8.
# 12 is not a multiple of 8, so no such lattice exists.
answer_a = "No"

# Part (b)
# We test the vector x = (1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0).
x_dot_x = 6
# Check the condition x.x = 0 (mod 6)
norm_mod_6 = x_dot_x % 6
# The vector is compatible with the properties of the lattice L.
answer_b = "yes"

# Part (c)
# L is the Niemeier lattice with root system D_24. M = L intersect Z^24 = D_24.
index_Z24_M = 2
index_L_M = 2
# Since the indices are equal to 2, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.
# Farness cannot be 1 as L is even and Z^24 is odd.
