    # The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset
    # of a Hausdorff topological group G with cardinality c and a special property.

    # 1. Let H be the connected component of the identity in G. The properties of G
    #    imply that H must be an open subgroup. This means G is a disjoint union of
    #    countably many copies of H, and the cardinality of H must be c.

    # 2. The problem reduces to finding the maximum number of non-open components of an open
    #    subset of H. This requires H to be a connected but not locally connected group.

    # 3. An infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space, such as l_2(R), serves as a
    #    perfect example for H. Let's verify its properties:
    #    - It is a Hausdorff topological group (under vector addition).
    #    - Its cardinality is c (the continuum).
    #    - It satisfies the property: Any open ball's closure is convex, hence connected,
    #      and has a non-empty interior.
    #    - It is not locally connected, a key property of infinite-dimensional normed spaces.

    # 4. Mathematical results (e.g., by Karimov and Repovs) have shown that it is
    #    possible to construct an open subset of l_2(R) that decomposes into c
    #    (uncountably many) components, where each component has an empty interior
    #    and is therefore not an open set.

    # 5. Therefore, the largest possible number of non-open components is c, the
    #    cardinality of the continuum.

    # The final answer is the cardinal number c.
    # It is represented by the equation: c = 2^aleph_0.
    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.

    final_answer_symbolic = "c"
    equation = "c = 2^{\\aleph_0}"
