    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** The graph \\(G\\) is defined as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" (or join) of graphs, denoted by \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is a graph formed by taking disjoint copies of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) and adding an edge between every vertex of \\(G_1\\) and every vertex of \\(G_2\\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** I will use the well-known property that the chromatic number of a graph join is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). For our graph \\(G\\), which is the sum of three identical cycles \\(C_n\\), this means \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\(C_n\\) (assuming \\(n \\ge 3\\)) depends on the parity of \\(n\\):\n    *   If \\(n\\) is even, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\(n\\) is odd, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** To find the *maximal* chromatic number of \\(G\\), I need to find the case that maximizes \\( 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\). This occurs when \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is at its maximum value. The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3 (when \\(n\\) is odd).\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** The final calculation will be \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final equation and its result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the graph G and the 'sum' operation.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is the 'sum' of three cycles of length n.
