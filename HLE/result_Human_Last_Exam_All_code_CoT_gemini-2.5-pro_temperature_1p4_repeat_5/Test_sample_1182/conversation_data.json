    "To find the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow the standard procedure of resolving the singularities of the curve's model over the 2-adic integers.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the initial reduction:** The initial equation reduced modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, or $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This is a \"double line\", which is a highly singular configuration. The geometric genus of our curve is 2, while the genus of a line is 0, indicating a bad reduction.\n2.  **First transformation:** To resolve the \"thick\" singularity along the line $y=x$, we introduce a new variable $z$ such that $y = x + 2z$. Substituting this into the original equation and simplifying gives us a new model of the curve.\n3.  **Analyze the new special fiber:** Reducing the equation of the new model modulo 2 gives us the special fiber. We'll find that this special fiber is a singular curve with a node at the origin. Its arithmetic genus is 1. Since the genus dropped from 2 to 1, this configuration is not yet stable.\n4.  **Blow-up:** The singularity of the model needs to be resolved. This is achieved by blowing up the singular point. The special fiber of the blown-up model will consist of two components:\n    *   The *strict transform* of the nodal curve from the previous step.\n    *   The *exceptional divisor*, which is a projective line ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n5.  **Identify the stable reduction:** The calculation shows that the strict transform is a smooth elliptic curve (genus 1), and it intersects the exceptional divisor (a rational curve, genus 0) at two distinct points. This two-component curve has arithmetic genus $1+0+2-1=2$, which matches the original curve's genus. It only has ordinary double points (the intersection points) as singularities, so it is a stable curve. This is the stable reduction.\n6.  **Count the double points:** The number of double points is the number of intersection points between the components of the stable reduction.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out the final step of this plan: finding the number of intersection points by solving the relevant polynomial equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction\n    by finding the number of intersection points of its components.\n\n    The mathematical derivation proceeds as follows:\n    1. The original curve y^2 = 8*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 has a bad reduction mod 2.\n    2. A change of variable y = x + 2*z gives a new model whose special fiber is z^2 + x*z = x^3 + x^4.\n    3. This special fiber has a node at (0,0). Blowing up this point leads to the stable reduction.\n    4. The stable reduction consists of two components:\n        - An elliptic curve E': v^2 + v = u + u^2 (the strict transform)\n        - A rational line P^1: u = 0 (the exceptional divisor)\n    5. The double points of the stable reduction are the intersection points of E' and P^1.\n       To find them, we substitute u=0 into the equation for E'.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The final step of the mathematical derivation involves finding the number of intersection points\")\n    print(\"between the two components of the stable reduction: E' and P^1.\")\n    print(\"The components are given by the equations (in the field of characteristic 2):\")\n    print(\"E': v^2 + v - u - u^2 = 0\")\n    print(\"P^1: u = 0\")\n\n    u, v = sympy.symbols('u v')\n\n    # Equation of the elliptic curve component\n    elliptic_component = v**2 + v - u - u**2\n    \n    # Substitute u=0 to find intersections\n    intersection_equation = elliptic_component.subs(u, 0)\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting u=0 into the equation for E' gives the intersection equation:\")\n    # Format the equation for output.
