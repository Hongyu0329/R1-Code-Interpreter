    This function calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction
    by finding the number of intersection points of its components.

    The mathematical derivation proceeds as follows:
    1. The original curve y^2 = 8*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 has a bad reduction mod 2.
    2. A change of variable y = x + 2*z gives a new model whose special fiber is z^2 + x*z = x^3 + x^4.
    3. This special fiber has a node at (0,0). Blowing up this point leads to the stable reduction.
    4. The stable reduction consists of two components:
        - An elliptic curve E': v^2 + v = u + u^2 (the strict transform)
        - A rational line P^1: u = 0 (the exceptional divisor)
    5. The double points of the stable reduction are the intersection points of E' and P^1.
       To find them, we substitute u=0 into the equation for E'.
