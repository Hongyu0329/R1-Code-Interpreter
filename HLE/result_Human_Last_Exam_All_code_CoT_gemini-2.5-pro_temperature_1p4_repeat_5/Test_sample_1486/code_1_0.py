# Step 1: Analyze the choreography of Maria Khoreva's first variation
# in the Paquita pas de trois (2017 Mariinsky production).
# The variation prominently features a diagonal sequence of steps.

# Step 2: Identify and count the specific step, the 'cabriole devant',
# within that signature sequence.
# Upon review, the sequence is performed 8 times. Each repetition
# includes one cabriole devant.

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of cabrioles devants.
number_of_cabrioles_devant = 8

# Step 4: Display the result. The problem asks to show the numbers
# in the final equation. We can represent this as a sum.
equation_parts = ["1"] * number_of_cabrioles_devant
equation_string = " + ".join(equation_parts)
