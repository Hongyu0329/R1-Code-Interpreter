    Calculates the sum described in the problem statement.

    The problem asks for the sum over all natural dimensions d of a ratio.
    The ratio R(d) for a given dimension d is:
    R(d) = E[Volume(CH(S))] / E[Distance(p_i, p_j)]

    Let's break down the components:
    
    1. The set of points S is {O, p_1, ..., p_d}, where O is the origin and
       p_i is a random point sampled from the i-th orthogonal axis, constrained
       to the interval (-1, 1). So, p_i = r_i * e_i, with r_i ~ U(-1, 1).

    2. Numerator: Expected Volume E[V]
       - The volume V of the d-simplex with vertices O, p_1, ..., p_d is
         V = (1/d!) * |det(p_1, ..., p_d)|.
       - The matrix is diagonal with entries r_1, ..., r_d.
         So, V = (1/d!) * |r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_d|.
       - Since r_i are independent, E[V] = (1/d!) * E[|r_1|] * ... * E[|r_d|].
       - For r ~ U(-1, 1), E[|r|] = integral(|x| * (1/2) dx) from -1 to 1 = 1/2.
       - Therefore, the Numerator N(d) = (1/d!) * (1/2)^d.

    3. Denominator: Expected pairwise distance E[D]
       - There are C(d+1, 2) pairs of points in S.
       - Type 1: Pair (O, p_i). Distance is ||p_i|| = |r_i|.
         E[Distance(O, p_i)] = E[|r_i|] = 1/2. There are d such pairs.
       - Type 2: Pair (p_i, p_j) for i != j. Distance is ||p_i - p_j|| = sqrt(r_i^2 + r_j^2).
         The expected value E[sqrt(r_i^2 + r_j^2)] is a constant we call D_2.
         D_2 = (1/4) * integral over [-1,1]x[-1,1] of sqrt(x^2+y^2) dx dy.
         This integral evaluates to (1/3) * (sqrt(2) + asinh(1)).
         There are C(d, 2) = d*(d-1)/2 such pairs.
       - The total average expected distance is the weighted average:
         E[D] = (d * (1/2) + (d*(d-1)/2) * D_2) / (d*(d+1)/2)
              = (1 + (d-1) * D_2) / (d+1). This is the Denominator D(d).

    4. The Ratio R(d) = N(d) / D(d)
       R(d) = [ (1/d!) * (1/2)^d ] / [ (1 + (d-1) * D_2) / (d+1) ]
            = (d+1) / ( d! * 2^d * (1 + (d-1) * D_2) )

    The code below sums R(d) for d = 1, 2, ... until convergence.
