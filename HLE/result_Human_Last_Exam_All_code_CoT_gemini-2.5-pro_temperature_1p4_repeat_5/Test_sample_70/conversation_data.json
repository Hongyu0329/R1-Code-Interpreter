    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark, and then find African national flags with the same rank.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark:**\n    *   A flag can be represented as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color at a specific point.\n    *   The problem states we must assume values are chosen to *maximize* the rank. This means we assign a unique, independent numerical value to each color.\n    *   The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). With our assumption, this simplifies to counting the number of unique row patterns in the flag's design.\n    *   The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. If you draw horizontal lines across this flag, you will only ever encounter two distinct patterns:\n        1.  A line that passes through the red fields and the vertical part of the white cross (a `red-white-red` pattern).\n        2.  A line that forms the horizontal bar of the white cross (an `all-white` pattern).\n    *   Since there are exactly two unique row patterns, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze Flags of African Nations:**\n    *   We need to find African flags that also have exactly two unique row patterns.\n    *   **Flags with N horizontal stripes** (and no other elements) have N unique row patterns, so their rank is N. For example, Gabon (3 stripes) has a rank of 3.\n    *   **Flags with only vertical stripes** have only one row pattern, so their rank is 1. For example, Nigeria has a rank of 1.\n    *   **Flags with emblems, triangles, or diagonal elements** almost always have more than two row patterns. For example, a star in the middle of a plain field creates multiple new row patterns (one for each horizontal slice of the star), resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n    *   The search focuses on flags with very simple geometry. The structure that produces exactly two row patterns is a vertical bar at the hoist combined with two horizontal bars on the fly.\n\n3.  **Write Python Code to Present the Findings:**\n    *   The Python code will codify this analysis.\n    *   It will first state the rank of the Danish flag with its justification.\n    *   Then, it will define a list of African nations and the calculated rank of their flags based on the analysis of their row patterns.\n    *   Finally, it will iterate through this list and print the names of the countries whose flags have a rank of 2, explaining why.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_flags_with_matching_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies African flags with the same algebraic rank as the Danish flag.\n\n    The rank is determined by counting the number of unique horizontal patterns (row vectors)\n    in a flag's design, assuming colors are chosen to maximize the rank.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
