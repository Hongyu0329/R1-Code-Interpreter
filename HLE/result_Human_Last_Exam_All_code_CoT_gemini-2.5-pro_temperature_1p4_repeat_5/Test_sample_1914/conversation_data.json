    "This is a problem in enumerative category theory. A direct, from-scratch derivation is quite involved, so I will outline the established method for solving this and then use a Python script to present the breakdown and the final result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the building blocks:** A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have two identity morphisms, `id_A` and `id_B`. With a total of 4 morphisms, this leaves us with 2 other non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n2.  **Classify the structures:** The problem then becomes about classifying all the ways to assign a source and target to `f` and `g`, and then defining their composition rules in a way that satisfies the category axioms (associativity and identity). The number of possibilities is counted \"up to isomorphism\", meaning we don't distinguish between categories that are structurally identical but have different labels for their objects and morphisms.\n3.  **Divide and conquer:** A standard way to tackle this is to split the problem into two major cases:\n    *   **Disconnected Categories:** There are no morphisms between objects `A` and `B`. The category is effectively a disjoint union of two smaller categories, one for each object.\n    *   **Connected Categories:** There is at least one morphism with source `A` and target `B`, or source `B` and target `A`.\n4.  **Enumerate each case:**\n    *   **Disconnected Case:** We need to distribute the 4 total morphisms between the two objects. Since each must have at least an identity, the distributions are (3 morphisms at A, 1 at B) or (2 morphisms at A, 2 at B).\n        *   (3, 1): A category with 1 object and 3 morphisms is equivalent to a *monoid* of order 3. There are 5 such monoids up to isomorphism.\n        *   (2, 2): This combines two monoids of order 2. There are 3 ways to do this non-isomorphically.\n        *   This gives a total of `5 + 3 = 8` disconnected categories.\n    *   **Connected Case:** This part is more complex as it involves non-trivial composition rules between morphisms linking `A` and `B`. Detailed analysis, as found in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS A258169), shows there are 13 such connected categories. These include familiar structures like when `A` and `B` are isomorphic, as well as more complex preorder-like structures.\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from the disconnected and connected cases.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this step-by-step summary and compute the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories\n# with 2 objects and 4 morphisms by summarizing the known results\n# from enumerative category theory.\n\n# A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 total morphisms must have\n# two identity morphisms (id_A, id_B), leaving 2 non-identity morphisms.\n\n# We break down the problem into disconnected and connected cases.\n\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation for the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # 1.
