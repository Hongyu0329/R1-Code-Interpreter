    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  A separatrix in a 2D dynamical system is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. These are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n2.  First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting `d'(t) = 0` and `u'(t) = 0`.\n3.  Next, I will classify these equilibrium points by analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system at each point. This will allow me to identify any saddle points.\n4.  Once a saddle point is found, I will determine the equations for its stable and unstable manifolds. These manifolds are the separatrices of the system.\n5.  I will look for a simple invariant curve of the form `d = f(u)` that passes through the saddle point. An invariant curve is one where if a point starts on the curve, the trajectory generated by the system will remain on that curve.\n6.  By substituting `d = f(u)` and `d'(t) = f'(u)u'(t)` into the original system of differential equations, I can solve for the function `f(u)`. I will test a simple polynomial function.\n7.  The resulting equation that passes through the saddle point will be the equation of the separatrix.\n8.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the final equation, making sure to explicitly output the numerical coefficients and powers in the equation as requested.\n\nHere are the steps in detail:\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points**\nSet `d' = 0` and `u' = 0`:\nFrom `u'(t) = u^2(u - 1) = 0`, we get `u = 0` or `u = 1`.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute `u = 0` into the `d'` equation:\n    `2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0` => `2d^2 = 0` => `d = 0`.\n    This gives the equilibrium point `(0, 0)`.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute `u = 1` into the `d'` equation:\n    `2d^2 + (-3 + 5)d - 1(1 - 1)(1) = 0` => `2d^2 + 2d = 0` => `2d(d + 1) = 0`.\n    This gives `d = 0` or `d = -1`.\n    This gives the equilibrium points `(0, 1)` and `(-1, 1)`.\n\nThe system has three equilibrium points: `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(-1, 1)`.\n\n**2. Classify Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix `J(d, u)`:\n`J(d, u) = [[∂d'/∂d, ∂d'/∂u], [∂u'/∂d, ∂u'/∂u]]`\n`∂d'/∂d = 4d - 3u + 5u^2`\n`∂d'/∂u = (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3`\n`∂u'/∂d = 0`\n`∂u'/∂u = 3u^2 - 2u`\n\n*   At `(0, 1)`: `J(0, 1) = [[2, 1], [0, 1]]`. The eigenvalues are `λ₁ = 2` and `λ₂ = 1`. Both are positive, so `(0, 1)` is an unstable node.\n*   At `(-1, 1)`: `J(-1, 1) = [[-2, -6], [0, 1]]`. The eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -2` and `λ₂ = 1`. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, `(-1, 1)` is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Find the Separatrix**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point `(-1, 1)`. We search for an invariant curve `d = f(u)` that passes through `(-1, 1)`.\nLet's hypothesize a simple polynomial relationship and test it. Let's try `d = -u^2`.\nWe must verify if this curve is an invariant manifold of the system. If `d = -u^2`, then `d'(t) = -2u * u'(t)`.\nSubstitute `u'(t) = u^2(u-1)`:\n`d'(t) = -2u * (u^2(u - 1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3`.\n\nNow, we substitute `d = -u^2` into the original equation for `d'`:\n`d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)`\n`d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4`\n`d'(t) = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3`\n`d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3`\n\nSince both expressions for `d'(t)` are identical, the curve `d = -u^2` is an invariant manifold.\nFurthermore, we check if it passes through the saddle point `(-1, 1)`:\n`d = -1`, `u = 1` => `-1 = -(1)^2`, which is true.\nThus, the curve `d = -u^2` is a separatrix of the system (specifically, it is the unstable manifold of the saddle point).\n\n```python\n# The equation for the separatrix is of the form d = a * u**p.\n# Based on the analysis, we have found the values for the coefficient 'a' and the power 'p'.\n\na = -1\np = 2\n\n# We will now print the equation of the separatrix.\n# The code below explicitly states each number in the final equation.\n\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"d = ({a}) * u**({p})\")\n\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
