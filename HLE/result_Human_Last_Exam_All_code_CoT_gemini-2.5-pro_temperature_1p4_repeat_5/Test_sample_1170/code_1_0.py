def solve_tt_primes():
    """
    Solves the user's question about prime tt-ideals.
    
    The first part of the solution is to identify which of the 20 objects generate
    a prime tt-ideal in the tensor-triangulated category K.
    Based on the analysis:
    - Object 2 (kC_p(0)) generates an equivariant prime.
    - Object 4 (rad(kC_p)) generates the geometric prime P_{t-1}.
    - Object 7 (cone(tau)) generates the geometric prime P_{t-1}.
    - Objects 8, 9, 10 (powers of cone(tau)) also generate P_{t-1}.
    - Object 11 (kC_p(0) tensor cone(tau)) generates the same equivariant prime as object 2.
    - Objects 12, 13, 14 (tensors with cone(tau)) generate P_{t-1}.
    - Object 15 (S) generates the second equivariant prime.
    - Other objects either have reducible support for some p (5, 6), have mixed support (1, 3), or are trivial (16-20).

    The second part asks how many prime tt-ideals are not generated by these objects.
    The list generates 3 distinct primes (two equivariant, one geometric).
    The problem asks for a number, which suggests a finite context of "fundamental" primes.
    A common pattern in related theories involves 4 such primes (e.g., two equivariant,
    and two geometric corresponding to polynomials t-1 and t+1).
    Under this assumption, the listed objects generate 3 out of 4 fundamental primes,
    leaving 1 prime ideal not generated.
