    explanation = """
Based on linguistic analysis, the complexity of an individual word is most strongly and consistently predicted by a combination of features that describe its form, frequency, and meaning. Let's break down the options:

1.  **Core Predictors of Individual Word Complexity:**
    *   **Form/Structure:** `word length` and `syllable count` are classic measures. Longer words are generally more complex.
    *   **Frequency/Familiarity:** `word familiarity rating` is a direct measure of how often a word is encountered. It is one of the most significant predictors of processing difficulty.
    *   **Meaning:** `concreteness rating` measures whether a word refers to a tangible object or an abstract concept. Abstract words are more complex.

2.  **Evaluating Flawed Features in Other Options:**
    *   **'Number of unique words' (in choices A and C):** This is a feature of a *text* or *document* (lexical diversity), not a property of a single word. Therefore, it cannot predict the complexity of an individual word.
    *   **'Number of word categories' (in choices B and E):** This is a less standard and less impactful predictor compared to the core features mentioned above.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    Choice D, which includes `word length`, `word familiarity rating`, `syllable count`, and `concreteness rating`, is the only option that contains a complete set of the most well-established, primary, and word-specific predictors of lexical complexity.
