    "To find the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Kernel**: The kernel of the integral equation is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series into a polynomial form: `K(x, y) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ`. This shows that the kernel is separable (also known as a degenerate kernel).\n\n2.  **Convert to a System of Linear Equations**: Because the kernel is separable, the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. We assume the solution `u(x)` is a polynomial of degree `n-1`, `u(x) = Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} aᵢxⁱ`. By substituting this into the original equation and comparing coefficients of powers of `x`, we arrive at a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a₀, a₁, ..., aₙ₋₁`. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    `(I - λH)a = b`\n    where `I` is the identity matrix, `a` is the vector of coefficients `[a₀, ..., aₙ₋₁]ᵀ`, `b` is the vector `[1, 0, ..., 0]ᵀ`, and `H` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `Hᵢⱼ = 1 / (n - i + j)`, for `i, j` from 0 to `n-1`.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative, this system of equations fails to have a unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, i.e., `det(I - λH) = 0`. This condition implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `H`. Let `μ` be an eigenvalue of `H`. Then `λ = 1/μ`. For these values of `λ`, the equation either has no solution or infinitely many solutions. For this specific problem, it can be shown that the condition for having infinitely many solutions is not met, meaning for these specific `λ` values, there are no solutions.\n\n4.  **Compute the Eigenvalues**: The problem is now reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix `H`. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the problem, the solution will depend on `n`. We can write a Python script that takes `n` as a parameter, constructs the matrix `H`, computes its eigenvalues (`μ`), and then finds the corresponding values of `λ` by taking their reciprocals.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It is set for `n=3` as an example, but you can change the value of `n` to solve for other cases.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer parameter 'n' from the equation.
