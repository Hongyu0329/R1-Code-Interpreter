    Generates a symbolic Diophantine equation for a given logical proposition.

    This function does NOT generate the true, massive polynomial required by the MRDP
    theorem. Instead, it creates a representative, symbolic equation for demonstration
    purposes. The coefficients are derived from a hash of the proposition string to
    ensure that different propositions result in different-looking equations.

    The unsolvability of this symbolic equation over the natural numbers is
