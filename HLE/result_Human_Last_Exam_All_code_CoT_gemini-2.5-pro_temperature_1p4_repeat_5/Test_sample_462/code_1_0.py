# Define the side length of the large square
side_length = 20

# Step 1: Calculate the radius of the circles.
# The side of the square is composed of one radius, the diameter of a middle circle (which is 2 radii), and another radius.
# Or, more simply, two radii fit along one half of the side length.
# So, side_length = 4 * radius.
radius = side_length / 4

# Step 2: Consider the smaller square formed by the centers of the four circles.
# The side length of this inner square is the distance between the centers of two adjacent circles, which is 2 * radius.
inner_square_side = 2 * radius

# Step 3: Calculate the area of this inner square.
area_inner_square = inner_square_side ** 2

# Step 4: Calculate the area of the parts of the circles inside this inner square.
# Each of the four circles contributes a quarter of its area to the inner square.
# This is equivalent to the area of one full circle.
area_of_circle_parts = math.pi * radius**2

# Step 5: Calculate the area of the region between the circles.
area_between_circles = area_inner_square - area_of_circle_parts
