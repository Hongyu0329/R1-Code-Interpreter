# The biological answer is B. This is because (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal,
# an analog of the electrophile 4-HNE, activates the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway,
# leading to an INCREASE in the expression of the detoxification enzyme ALDH.
# A more potent electrophile ("4-OI") would cause a MORE significant increase.
# The key sensor protein in this pathway is Keap1.

# --- Calculation Task ---
# The following script calculates the volume of a stock solution required to treat
# cells with the specified 50 uM concentration, a common task in a cell biology lab.
# We will use the dilution equation: C1 * V1 = C2 * V2

# --- Parameters ---
# C1: Concentration of the stock solution. A common lab stock concentration is 10 mM.
stock_concentration_mM = 10
# C2: Desired final concentration in the cell culture.
final_concentration_uM = 50
# V2: Final volume of the cell culture media. A typical volume for a 10 cm dish is 10 mL.
final_volume_mL = 10

# --- Calculation ---
# First, we need to make the units consistent. Let's convert the stock concentration from mM to uM.
# 1 mM = 1000 uM
stock_concentration_uM = stock_concentration_mM * 1000

# Now, we solve for V1 (the volume of stock to add) using the formula V1 = (C2 * V2) / C1
# The result will be in mL.
required_volume_mL = (final_concentration_uM * final_volume_mL) / stock_concentration_uM

# Let's convert the volume to microliters (uL), which is a more practical unit for pipetting small volumes.
# 1 mL = 1000 uL
required_volume_uL = required_volume_mL * 1000

# --- Output ---
