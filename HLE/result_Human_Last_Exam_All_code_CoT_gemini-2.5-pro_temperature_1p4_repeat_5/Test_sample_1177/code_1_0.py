# The problem describes a scenario and asks to identify the correct legal conclusion
# regarding the transfer of risk from a seller (Jake) to a buyer (Luke).

# Let's analyze the key events and legal principles:
# 1. Contract Formation (June 2): Luke agrees to buy a specific MacBook Pro.
#    - The item is a "specific good".
#    - It is NOT in a "deliverable state" because Jake must first replace the screen.
#    - Luke pays the price of $1000.

# 2. Putting the Goods in a Deliverable State: Jake is contractually obligated to fix the screen.
#    - According to sale of goods principles, for specific goods that the seller must put into
#      a deliverable state, the property (and thus risk) does not pass until:
#      a) The seller does the required work.
#      b) The buyer receives notice that the work has been done.

# 3. Notice to the Buyer (June 5):
#    - Jake completes the repairs (or is about to).
#    - Jake sends Luke a text stating the laptop will be ready for pickup the next day (June 6).
#    - This action serves as "notice" to Luke that the goods are now in a deliverable state.

# 4. The Loss (Overnight June 5-6):
#    - After the work is done and notice is given, but before Luke takes possession, the laptop is destroyed by a flood.

# 5. Conclusion on Risk Transfer:
#    - Both conditions for the transfer of risk have been met as of June 5:
#      1. Jake put the laptop into a deliverable state by fixing the screen.
#      2. Jake gave Luke notice of this.
#    - Therefore, the risk of loss passed from Jake to Luke on June 5.
#    - The fact that the loss was due to a storm (an act of God) doesn't change who bears the risk.
#    - The fact that Luke hadn't physically picked up the laptop yet is also not the determining factor, as risk follows property, not necessarily possession.

# Based on this analysis, Jake is not required to return the money because the risk had already transferred to Luke.

# Evaluating the choices:
# A: Incorrect. The cause of loss doesn't change the contractual risk allocation.
# B: Correct. This accurately states that risk passed when Jake completed the repairs (putting the laptop in a deliverable state) and notified Luke.
# C: Incorrect. The notice via text was appropriate and acknowledged.
# D: Incorrect. Risk can pass before the buyer takes physical possession.
# E: Incorrect. Risk did not pass on June 2 because the laptop was not yet in a deliverable state.
