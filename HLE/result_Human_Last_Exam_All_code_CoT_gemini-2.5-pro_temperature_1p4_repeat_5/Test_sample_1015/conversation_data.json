    "The user is asking a knowledge-based question about ballet technique and requires the answer to be delivered via a Python script.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the characteristics of a cambré derrière in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods within the Python script. I'll store this information in a data structure like a dictionary.\n2.  Represent the multiple-choice options in a list.\n3.  The script will analyze these characteristics to identify the most fundamental difference. The primary distinction between the two styles in this specific movement is the use of the hips.\n4.  The script will then print an explanation of this key difference and identify the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    # Storing ballet knowledge in a dictionary\n    knowledge_base = {\n        \"Vaganova\": {\n            \"name\": \"Vaganova Method\",\n            \"cambré_derrière_technique\": \"The bend initiates from the upper back, keeping the chest open.
