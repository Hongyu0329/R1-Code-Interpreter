    This function identifies the statements about time that St. Bonaventure held to be true.

    St. Bonaventure's Arguments:
    1.  Theological Argument: The Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo requires a beginning of time.
    2.  Philosophical Argument vs. Aristotle: The world cannot be eternal, therefore Aristotle's position is incorrect.
    3.  Impossibility of an Actual Infinite: An eternal past would mean an actual, completed infinite number of events (e.g., days) has occurred, which is a metaphysical impossibility.
    4.  Impossibility of Traversing an Infinite: To reach the present moment from an eternal past would require traversing an infinite series, which is logically impossible.
    5.  Time as Sequential: His arguments presuppose that time is a succession of moments.

    Based on this, the correct options are:
    B) Directly opposes Aristotle.
    C) States the theological basis of his view.
    E) Affirms his use of philosophical arguments.
    G) Describes the "impossibility of an actual infinite" argument.
    H) Describes the "impossibility of traversing an infinite" argument.
    J) States the necessary premise that time is sequential.
