    Calculates and explains the minimum length of a 3-component nontrivial link (Borromean rings) on a 3D integer lattice.

    This problem is a known result in mathematical knot theory. The minimum length
    is not found by a simple calculation but by constructing and proving the optimality
    of a specific geometric configuration on the 3D lattice.

    The key findings are:
    1. The loops must be non-planar to weave correctly.
    2. The loops must not share any vertices.
    3. The minimal construction consists of three identical components.

    The established minimal length for each component is 10 edges.
