    print("Step 1: Understanding Ammonia (NH3) Tunneling")
    print("In a normal ammonia molecule, the nitrogen atom can be on one of two sides of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms.")
    print("The potential energy for the nitrogen atom's position has a 'double-well' shape with a finite energy barrier between the two sides.")
    print("Due to the principles of quantum mechanics, the nitrogen atom's wavefunction can penetrate this barrier, allowing it to 'tunnel' from one side to the other. This is known as ammonia inversion, a classic example of quantum tunneling.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Analyzing the Effect of Using Exotic Hydrogens")
    print("The proposed change is to replace the ordinary hydrogen nucleus (a spin-1/2 proton, which is a fermion) with a hypothetical spin-0 nucleus (which is a boson).")
    print("This change does NOT alter the mass or the electric charge of the nucleus.")
    print("The shape of the potential energy surface, including the double-well barrier, is determined by the electromagnetic forces between the electrons and the nuclei (defined by their charges and masses).")
    print("Therefore, the potential energy landscape that the nitrogen atom experiences remains unchanged.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Connecting the Change to the Tunneling Phenomenon")
    print("Since the potential energy barrier still exists and has the same shape, and the nitrogen atom is still a quantum particle, the fundamental conditions for tunneling are still met.")
    print("The change from fermions to bosons affects the symmetry requirements of the total molecular wavefunction under the exchange of identical hydrogen nuclei (as dictated by the Pauli Exclusion Principle). This would alter the allowed rotational-vibrational states and the corresponding spectroscopic selection rules.")
    print("However, it does not eliminate the tunneling mechanism itself.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("The ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-0 hydrogens would absolutely still exhibit tunneling.")
    print("The tunneling is a direct consequence of the molecular structure and potential energy surface, which are not affected by the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms.")
