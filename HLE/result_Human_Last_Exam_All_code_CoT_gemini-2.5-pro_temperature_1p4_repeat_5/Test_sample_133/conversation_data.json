    "An optimal move is one that leads to the fastest possible win. In Connect 4, this means a move that either wins immediately or creates a situation where a win is guaranteed on the next turn (a \"fork\" or \"double threat\").\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board**: First, I will represent the current game state in a 2D grid format to make it easier to analyze.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins (Win in 1 Move)**: I will examine every possible valid move for player 'O'. For each move, I'll check if placing a piece in that column results in 'O' getting four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins (Win in 2 Moves)**: If no immediate win is found, I will look for a move that creates a \"fork\". A fork is a move that creates two separate threats simultaneously. A threat is a line of three 'O's with a playable empty space to complete the four-in-a-row. Since the opponent ('X') can only block one threat per turn, 'O' can use the other threat to win on the subsequent move.\n4.  **Identify Optimal Moves**: I will analyze each valid move to see if it creates such a fork.\n    *   **The move `f4`**: Placing an 'O' in column 'f' drops it into row 4. This connects with the existing 'O's at `d4` and `e4`, forming a line of three: `O-O-O` from column `d` to `f`. This line has open, playable spaces at both ends: `c4` and `g4`.\n    *   This creates two winning threats for 'O' on the next turn: playing at `c4` or playing at `g4`.\n    *   Player 'X' can only block one of these threats in their turn. If 'X' plays in `c4`, 'O' wins by playing in `g4`. If 'X' plays in `g4`, 'O' wins by playing in `c4`.\n5.  **Final Validation**: I will check other potential moves to confirm that they do not create a similar guaranteed win. For instance, playing at `c4` also creates a line of three, but the space on one end (`b4`) is not immediately playable, so it only creates a single threat that 'X' can easily block.\n6.  **Conclusion**: The move `f4` is the only move that guarantees a win for 'O' on the next turn, making it the optimal move.\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic to find all such optimal moves.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Connect 4 puzzle to find the optimal moves for 'O'.\n    \"\"\"\n    board = [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    ]\n    player = 'O'\n    opponent = 'X'\n    rows, cols = 6, 7\n\n    def get_lowest_empty_row(board, col):\n        \"\"\"Finds the lowest empty row in a given column.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            if board[r][col] == '.':\n                return r\n        return -1\n\n    def get_valid_moves(board):\n        \"\"\"Gets all valid moves.\"\"\"\n        valid_moves = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            r = get_lowest_empty_row(board, c)\n            if r != -1:\n                valid_moves.append((r, c))\n        return valid_moves\n\n    def check_win(board, player):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the specified player has won.\"\"\"\n        # Check horizontal\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check vertical\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if all(board[r+i][c] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal (down-right)\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r+i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal (up-right)\n        for r in range(3, rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(board[r-i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def find_winning_spots(board, player):\n        \"\"\"Finds all spots where the player can play to win immediately.\"\"\"\n        winning_spots = set()\n        for r, c in get_valid_moves(board):\n            temp_board = copy.deepcopy(board)\n            temp_board[r][c] = player\n            if check_win(temp_board, player):\n                winning_spots.add((r, c))\n        return winning_spots\n\n    def to_connect4_notation(r, c):\n        \"\"\"Converts (row, col) to Connect 4 notation like 'a1'.\"\"\"\n        col_char = chr(ord('a') + c)\n        row_char = str(r + 1)\n        return f\"{col_char}{row_char}\"\n\n    # --- Main Logic ---\n\n    # Level 1: Find moves that win immediately.\n    winning_moves_now = find_winning_spots(board, player)\n    if winning_moves_now:\n        print(\", \".join(sorted([to_connect4_notation(r, c) for r, c in winning_moves_now])))\n        return\n\n    # Level 2: Find moves that create a fork (unblockable win in 2).\n    fork_moves = []\n    for r_move, c_move in get_valid_moves(board):\n        # Make the move for 'O' on a temporary board\n        board_after_O_move = copy.deepcopy(board)\n        board_after_O_move[r_move][c_move] = player\n\n        # Find where 'O' can win on the next turn\n        o_winning_spots = find_winning_spots(board_after_O_move, player)\n\n        # If there are fewer than 2 winning spots, it's not a fork.\n        if len(o_winning_spots) < 2:\n            continue\n\n        # Check if opponent can block one threat, but another remains.\n        can_be_blocked = False\n        for r_block, c_block in o_winning_spots:\n            # Simulate opponent blocking one of the threats\n            board_after_X_block = copy.deepcopy(board_after_O_move)\n            # The row to block might be different if the column isn't empty up to r_block\n            block_row_actual = get_lowest_empty_row(board_after_O_move, c_block)\n            if block_row_actual == -1: continue\n            \n            board_after_X_block[block_row_actual][c_block] = opponent\n\n            # Check if 'O' still has a winning move\n            if not find_winning_spots(board_after_X_block, player):\n                can_be_blocked = True\n                break\n        \n        if not can_be_blocked:\n            fork_moves.append((r_move, c_move))\n            \n    if fork_moves:\n        print(\", \".join(sorted([to_connect4_notation(r, c) for r, c in fork_moves])))\n        return\n\n    print(\"No optimal winning moves found.\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<f4>>>"
