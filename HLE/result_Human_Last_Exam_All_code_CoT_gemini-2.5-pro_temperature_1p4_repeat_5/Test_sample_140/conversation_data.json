    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We need to fit as many 9x1x1 blocks as possible into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume division (`15*15*15 / 9`) gives an upper limit but doesn't account for the rigid shape of the blocks, which causes packing inefficiencies.\n\n2.  **Greedy Packing Strategy:** I will use a greedy packing strategy, which involves filling the space in stages. At each stage, I will pack as many blocks as possible in one orientation and then analyze the leftover space for the next stage. This is a common and effective method for this type of problem.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n    *   **Stage 1:** Start with the 15x15x15 cube. Align the 9-unit side of the blocks along one of the cube's axes. This will fill a 9x15x15 volume, leaving a smaller rectangular block of space.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Take the leftover space from Stage 1. Re-orient the blocks to fit into this new, smaller space. Pack as many as possible, and calculate the next leftover space.\n    *   **Stage 3:** Repeat the process with the space left from Stage 2. The blocks will need to be re-oriented again to fit.\n    *   **Stage 4:** Check if any more blocks can fit into the final remaining space.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will perform the calculations for each stage, store the number of blocks added at each step, and then print the final sum as a full equation, along with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Dimensions ---\n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_len, block_w, block_h = 9, 1, 1\n\n    # Stage 1: Pack the initial 15x15x15 cube\n    # Orient blocks as 9x1x1 along one axis.\n    # We fit a layer of blocks that is floor(15/9) = 1 block deep.\n    # The layer is 15 blocks wide and 15 blocks high.\n    num_blocks_1 = math.floor(15 / block_len) * math.floor(15 / block_w) * math.floor(15 / block_h)\n    \n    # This leaves a 6x15x15 space (15-9=6).\n    \n    # Stage 2: Pack the remaining 6x15x15 space\n    # We must reorient the blocks. Place the 9-unit side along a 15-unit axis.\n    # We can fit floor(15/9)=1 column of blocks.\n    # The cross-section of this column is 6x15 blocks.\n    num_blocks_2 = math.floor(6 / block_w) * math.floor(15 / block_len) * math.floor(15 / block_h)\n\n    # This leaves a 6x6x15 space (15-9=6).\n\n    # Stage 3: Pack the remaining 6x6x15 space\n    # We again reorient the blocks. Place the 9-unit side along the last 15-unit axis.\n    # We can fit floor(15/9)=1 set of blocks deep.\n    # The face of this set is 6x6 blocks.\n    num_blocks_3 = math.floor(6 / block_w) * math.floor(6 / block_h) * math.floor(15 / block_len)\n    \n    # This leaves a 6x6x6 space, into which no 9-unit block can fit.\n    \n    # Calculate the total\n    total_blocks = num_blocks_1 + num_blocks_2 + num_blocks_3\n    \n    print(\"The total number of blocks is the sum of blocks from each stage of packing.\")\n    print(f\"Final Calculation: {num_blocks_1} + {num_blocks_2} + {num_blocks_3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
