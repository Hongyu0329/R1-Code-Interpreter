    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the group's structure and what a power subgroup is.\n\n### **Thinking Steps**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. The order of a semidihedral group is always a power of 2, so $|SD_{2^n}| = 2^n$. In this case, $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**: A \"power subgroup\" of a group G is a subgroup H that can be generated by a single element of G. In other words, $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**. So, the task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Group Structure**: The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has a presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. The group has two types of elements:\n    *   Those in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{r^0, r^1, ..., r^{255}\\}$, which has order $2^{n-1} = 256$.\n    *   Those of the form $sr^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$.\n\n4.  **Counting Strategy**: We can count the total number of cyclic subgroups by breaking them into categories that are easier to count and don't overlap.\n    *   **Category 1: Cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n        *   The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order $256 = 2^8$.\n        *   A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that the number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $p^k$ (where p is prime) is exactly $k+1$.\n        *   Here, $p=2$ and $k=n-1=8$. So, the number of subgroups is $8+1 = 9$.\n\n    *   **Category 2: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$.** These are not contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n        *   The order of these elements, $g = sr^i$, depends on whether $i$ is even or odd. It can be shown that $|g|=2$ if $i$ is even, and $|g|=4$ if $i$ is odd.\n        *   **Sub-category 2a (i is even):** There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $i$. Each element $sr^i$ with an even $i$ has order 2 and generates a distinct subgroup $\\{e, sr^i\\}$. This gives **128** unique cyclic subgroups.\n        *   **Sub-category 2b (i is odd):** There are 128 odd values for $i$. Each element $sr^i$ with an odd $i$ has order 4. The subgroup is $\\langle sr^i \\rangle$. It can be shown that $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^{i+128} \\rangle$. This means the 128 elements generate subgroups in pairs. The number of unique subgroups is the number of odd elements divided by 2, which is $128 / 2 = \\textbf{64}$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from these disjoint categories.\n    *   Total = (Subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$) + (Subgroups from $sr^i$ with even $i$) + (Subgroups from $sr^i$ with odd $i$)\n    *   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group has size 2^n. We find n.\n    # n = log2(group_size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group is SD_{group_size}, which corresponds to n={n}.\")\n    print(\"A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(\"We will count the cyclic subgroups by categorizing them.\\n\")\n\n    # Category 1: Cyclic subgroups within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>\n    # The order of <r> is 2^(n-1).
