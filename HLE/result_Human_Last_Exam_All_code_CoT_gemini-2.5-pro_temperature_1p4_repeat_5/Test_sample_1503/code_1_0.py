  """
  Provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the Pohozaev identity and related functionals.
  The reasoning for each answer is based on the properties of variational methods in PDEs.

  (a) The Pohozaev identity is a necessary, not sufficient, condition for a critical point.
  (b) Projecting a function onto the Pohozaev manifold via scaling is a standard technique that guarantees a unique scaling factor under general conditions.
  (c) The sign of this second derivative is a stability condition that depends on the specific parameters of the model (like the order of derivatives and the power of the nonlinearity), and is not fixed.
