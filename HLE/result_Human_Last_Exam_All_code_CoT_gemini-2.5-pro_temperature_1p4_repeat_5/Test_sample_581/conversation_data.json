    "Of course. Here is a Python script to determine the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the problem**: The script will start by defining a \"cap set\" in the context of the vector space $\\mathbb{F}_3^n$. A cap set is a subset of points where no three distinct points are collinear. The goal is to find the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension $n=8$. This size is often denoted as $r_3(8)$.\n2.  **Explore simple constructions**: A lower bound is established by constructing a cap set of a certain size. A common method is the product construction. We can combine known cap sets from smaller dimensions to get a baseline lower bound for dimension 8. For instance, we can combine a cap set from dimension 6 and dimension 2.\n3.  **State the record**: The cap set problem is a subject of ongoing mathematical research. The best-known bounds are often the result of complex constructions published in research papers. I will state the current record holder for the lower bound of $r_3(8)$ and its discoverers.\n4.  **Print the result**: The script will print the calculations from the simple construction and then present the best-known value, which corresponds to one of the multiple-choice options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and identifies the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set\n    in dimension 8 over the field of 3 elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
