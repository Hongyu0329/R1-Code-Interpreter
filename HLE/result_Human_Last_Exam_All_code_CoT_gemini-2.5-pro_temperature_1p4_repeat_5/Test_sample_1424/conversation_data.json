    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ (also known as the free propagator) describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. The functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ space.\n\nThe relationship is an inverse function. Specifically, the Green's function exhibits poles (divergences) when the probe energy $\\omega$ matches a single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The standard formula for the retarded Green's function is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the energy variable of the probe.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum $k$.\n*   $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$) that enforces causality by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by calculating the value of $G_0$ for given parameters and prints out the full equation with the numbers substituted in.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The energy/frequency variable.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        delta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for causality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    g0 = 1 / ((omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta)\n\n    # Print the context and parameters\n    print(\"The formula for the bare Green's function is: G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the given values:\")\n    print(f\"ω = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"ε_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"δ = {delta}\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with the numbers substituted in\n    print(\"\\nResulting equation:\")\n    # The following line explicitly prints each number in the equation\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + {delta}j)\")\n    \n    # Print the final numerical result, formatted to 4 decimal places\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated G_0 = {g0.real:.4f}{g0.imag:+.4f}j\")\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n# We demonstrate the calculation for a set of parameters.\n# Here, we choose a probing energy 'omega' that is very close to the\n# particle's energy 'epsilon_k', which should result in a large response (resonance).\nprint(\"--- Calculating for a near-resonance case ---\")\ncalculate_bare_greens_function(omega=3.05, epsilon_k=3.0, delta=0.1)\n\n```\n<<<$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$>>>"
