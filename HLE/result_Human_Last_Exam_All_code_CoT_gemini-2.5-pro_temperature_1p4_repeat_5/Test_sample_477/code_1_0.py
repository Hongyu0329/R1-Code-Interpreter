        "Step 1: The Problem of CTG Repeats": "In Myotonic Dystrophy, the expanded CTG repeat sequence in the DMPK gene is prone to further expansion in somatic cells over an individual's lifetime. This is called somatic instability.",
        "Step 2: The Expansion Mechanism": "During DNA replication or repair, the CTG repeats can form stable hairpin structures. These structures can cause the DNA polymerase to slip and synthesize extra copies of the repeat, creating an 'expansion intermediate'.",
        "Step 3: The Role of LIG1": "For this expansion to become permanent, the newly synthesized strand containing the extra repeats must be fully integrated. This process leaves a final nick in the DNA backbone. LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is the enzyme responsible for sealing this final nick.",
        "Step 4: The Impact of LIG1 Knockout": "If LIG1 is knocked out or its function is inhibited, it cannot seal the final nick. The expansion intermediate remains unligated and is not stabilized. The cell's repair systems may then remove the extra, unligated repeats or the entire intermediate may be degraded.",
        "Step 5: Conclusion": "Therefore, the absence of LIG1's activity prevents the successful completion of the expansion process. This results in a significant reduction in the frequency of new expansion events."
