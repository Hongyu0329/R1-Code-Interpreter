    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are brought into lateral contact with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction itself is not a well-defined integer in the same way as the bulk. Instead, the physics at the interface is characterized by the presence or absence of edge states, which is determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the two connecting regions.\n\nThe number of chiral edge states at the interface between two topological domains with Chern numbers C1 and C2 is given by the formula |C1 - C2|. In this case, with both insulators having a Chern number of 1, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the junction is necessarily trivial. Even when two Chern insulators have the same Chern number, they can belong to different topological phases if, for example, they possess an additional symmetry like inversion symmetry. In such cases, the interface between the two insulators can host gapless helical states, which consist of counter-propagating channels and are topologically protected as long as the underlying symmetry is preserved.\n\nTherefore, while the junction does not support a net chiral current (as indicated by the difference in Chern numbers being zero), it can still be a topologically non-trivial interface with its own unique transport properties, such as the presence of helical edge states, depending on the specific symmetries and topological classes of the two Chern insulators.\n\n<<<The Chern number of the junction is not a well-defined integer; however, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is 0.>>>"
