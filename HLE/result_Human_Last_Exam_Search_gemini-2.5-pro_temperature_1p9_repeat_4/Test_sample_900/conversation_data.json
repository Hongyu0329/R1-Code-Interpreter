    "**It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" steps performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo because the term does not refer to a single, standardized ballet step.**\n\nWhile Svetlana Gileva performed the role of the Jete Woman in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, the request to count \"pas de Balanchines\" cannot be accurately fulfilled. The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is a colloquialism within the dance world used to describe a movement or stylistic quality that is characteristic of the choreographer George Balanchine. It is not a formally recognized or codified step with a universal definition, unlike a *pirouette* or *grand jet√©*.\n\nGeorge Balanchine's influential style, often called the Balanchine technique, is known for its speed, neoclassical lines, syncopation, and unconventional use of the upper body. Dancers and choreographers may use the phrase \"pas de Balanchine\" to refer to a movement that embodies these qualities, such as a quick, off-balance lunge or a specific syncopated sequence. However, what one person considers a \"pas de Balanchine,\" another might not, making a quantitative count entirely subjective.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreography, while influenced by Balanchine, is renowned for its own unique vocabulary, which deconstructs and evolves classical and neoclassical ballet. His work has a distinct and complex style of its own.\n\nIn conclusion, without a standardized definition of what constitutes a single \"pas de Balanchine\" and video evidence to analyze, counting them within a specific performance is impossible. Any number provided would be based on personal interpretation rather than factual, objective counting.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo because the term does not refer to a single, standardized ballet step.>>>"
