    "In Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nNewton created a color wheel where he analogized the seven colors of the visible spectrum to the seven notes of a musical scale. In his system, he divided the spectrum, starting with red, and mapped it to a Dorian musical scale beginning on the note D.\n\nThe correspondence between colors and notes in Newton's system is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Therefore, the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle falls on the note associated with green, which is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
