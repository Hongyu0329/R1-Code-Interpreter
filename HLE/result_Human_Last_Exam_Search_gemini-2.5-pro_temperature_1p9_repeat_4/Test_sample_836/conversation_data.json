    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. This quantity is often denoted as S(q, ω) or in dimensionless units as S(α, β).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (r) and time (t) yields the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω). Here, **q** represents the momentum transfer (related to the spatial Fourier variable) and ω represents the energy transfer (related to the temporal Fourier variable).\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity in nuclear engineering and physics because it is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section, which governs how neutrons scatter off of nuclei in a medium. This information is fundamental for neutron transport calculations, which are used to determine the effective neutron multiplication factor (k-eff) and ensure criticality safety in nuclear systems like reactors and fuel storage facilities. Its use is integral to generating the thermal neutron scattering cross-section libraries used by simulation codes such as MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle).\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
