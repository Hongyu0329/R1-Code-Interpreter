    "The first step has been successfully executed. I have found that the Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\". The current plan is to now research the etymology of the modern English word \"sister\" and the influence of Old Norse on its development. I will then explore the natural evolution of Old English words into Modern English, independent of Norse influence, to construct a hypothetical Modern English equivalent of \"sweostor\". I have sufficient information to proceed with the existing plan.\n\n formulated the following subsequent steps:\n*   Research the etymology of the modern English word \"sister\".\n*   Investigate the influence of Old Norse on the word \"sister\".\n*   Analyze the general phonological changes from Old English to Modern English, independent of Norse influence, to hypothesize the word's modern form.\n*   Conclude what the modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse interaction.\n\nGiven this, I have a clear path to the solution and do not need to alter the plan.\n\nThe current step has successfully identified that the modern English \"sister\" is derived from a mix of Old English \"sweostor\" and the Old Norse \"systir\". The \"i\" in \"sister\" is attributed to the Norse influence. The next logical step is to analyze the phonological evolution of \"sweostor\" to determine what it would have become without this Norse interaction. I have sufficient information from the previous searches to proceed with this analysis and then to formulate a final answer. Therefore, no new search queries are needed at this stage.\n\nWithout the interaction with the Norse, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely have evolved into something akin to **\"swester\"** or possibly **\"suster\"**.\n\nThe Old English word for sister was *sweostor* or *swuster*. The modern form, \"sister,\" shows the clear influence of the Old Norse word *systir*. The vowel \"i\" in the first syllable of \"sister\" is a direct result of this Norse influence.\n\nIn the absence of Viking invasions and the subsequent linguistic exchange, the native Old English *sweostor* would have undergone the typical phonological changes that occurred as Old English transitioned into Middle and then Modern English. The \"eo\" diphthong in *sweostor* would likely have been smoothed and simplified. Following the regular patterns of English sound evolution, the word would have probably become \"swester\" or, following the alternative Old English form *swuster*, it might have evolved into \"suster\". The latter form, \"suster\", was indeed a common Middle English variant before the Norse-influenced \"sister\" became dominant.\n\nTherefore, without the Norse influence, a word like \"swester\" or \"suster\" would be our modern term for a female sibling, reflecting a more direct and uninterrupted evolution from its Old English root.\n\n<<<swester or suster>>>"
