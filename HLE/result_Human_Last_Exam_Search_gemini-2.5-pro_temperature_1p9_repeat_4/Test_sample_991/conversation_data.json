    "A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center. This is a classic Chinese character riddle.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the riddle:\n\n*   **\"A wooden stick\"** refers to the character **木** (mù), which means wood or tree.\n*   **\"Hanging a square box\"** refers to the character **口** (kǒu), which means mouth and is a square in shape. The way it is \"hanging\" suggests its placement relative to the \"stick.\"\n*   **\"A ladder placed in the center\"** is the most descriptive part of the clue, indicating that a central line goes through the \"box.\"\n\nWhen you combine these elements, you get the character **束**. In the character **束** (shù), the character for wood, **木**, has its central vertical stroke passing through the center of the character for mouth, **口**, which fits the description of a ladder in the center.\n\nA very similar riddle is, \"木了又一口，不作杏字猜，若作杏字猜，便是呆秀才\" which translates to \"Wood with a mouth, but don't guess it as 'apricot' (杏). If you guess it as 'apricot', you are a foolish scholar.\" The answer to this is also **束**.\n\n<<<束>>>"
