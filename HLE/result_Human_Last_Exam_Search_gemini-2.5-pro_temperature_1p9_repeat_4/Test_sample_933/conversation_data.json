    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases. This process is typically carried out by heating the elements in a sealed nickel vessel.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the optimal temperature for this reaction to produce XeF₄ efficiently is approximately 400°C. The reaction is performed with a specific molar ratio of xenon to fluorine, commonly 1:5, at elevated pressure. While the temperature for the synthesis can range between 350 and 450°C, 400°C is noted as the preferable temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nTemperatures significantly lower than this tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). For instance, while some reaction products may be observed at lower temperatures, the rate and efficiency of XeF₄ production are maximized at around 400°C. One synthesis method uses a flow system with a temperature range of 300-500°C, though this can lead to impurities. There are alternative methods, such as using a high-temperature pulse initiator or catalytic processes that can occur at different temperatures, but the standard and most efficient thermal method remains at 400°C.\n\nGiven the provided answer choices, 400°C is the most accurate temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
