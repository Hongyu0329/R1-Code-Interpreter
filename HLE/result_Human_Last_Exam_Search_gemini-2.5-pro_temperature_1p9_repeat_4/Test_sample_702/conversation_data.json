    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 9. This means that the map induces isomorphisms on the homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 9$ and a surjection (epimorphism) on $\\pi_9$.\n\nThis map is a specific instance of a more general construction in algebraic topology known as the James-Hopf invariant or a generalized Whitehead product map. The connectivity of such maps is a classical result in homotopy theory, largely attributed to the work of G. W. Whitehead.\n\nTo determine the connectivity, we analyze the spaces involved:\n*   **Spheres**: The 4-sphere, $S^4$, is 3-connected, meaning its homotopy groups $\\pi_k(S^4)$ are trivial for $k < 4$. The 6-sphere, $S^6$, is 5-connected, as its homotopy groups $\\pi_k(S^6)$ are trivial for $k < 6$.\n*   **Loop Spaces**: The loop space of an $n$-sphere, $\\Omega S^n$, has its homotopy groups shifted, i.e., $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^n)$. Thus, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n*   **Smash and Suspension**: The smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ and its suspension $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ are highly connected spaces. Similarly, the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is highly connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is determined by a theorem of G. W. Whitehead, which states that for $(p-1)$-connected space $X$ and $(q-1)$-connected space $Y$, the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected. In our case, $X=S^4$ is 3-connected, so $p=4$. And $Y=S^6$ is 5-connected, so $q=6$. The connectivity of the map is therefore $4+6-1 = 9$.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider $X$ to be $p$-connected and $Y$ to be $q$-connected, the theorem states the map is $(p+q+1)$-connected. For $X=S^4$ ($p=3$) and $Y=S^6$ ($q=5$), this gives a connectivity of $3+5+1=9$.\n\nTherefore, the map $\\pi_k(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$ is an isomorphism for $k < 9$ and a surjection for $k=9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
