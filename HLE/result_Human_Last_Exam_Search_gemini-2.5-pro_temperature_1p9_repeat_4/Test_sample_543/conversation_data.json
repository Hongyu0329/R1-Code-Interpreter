    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF) followed by an aqueous work-up results in the sequential substitution of all three halogen atoms by phenyl groups. This type of reaction is a Grignard cross-coupling (specifically, a Kumada coupling).\n\nThe reactivity of the halogens in such coupling reactions is in the order of I > Br > Cl > F. Therefore, the substitution will occur in a step-wise manner:\n1.  First, the most reactive carbon-iodine bond at position 2 is replaced by a phenyl group to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  Next, under the forceful conditions of reflux and with an excess of the Grignard reagent, the two less reactive carbon-bromine bonds at positions 1 and 3 are also substituted by phenyl groups.\n3.  The final product after the substitution of all three halogens is a benzene ring with three phenyl substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe aqueous work-up quenches any unreacted Grignard reagent and neutralizes the magnesium salts, leaving the stable final organic product.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
