    "## \"Gigi\" First Best Picture Winner to Feature Luxor Obelisk\n\nThe 1958 film *\"Gigi\"* holds the distinction of being the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The iconic Parisian landmark, located in the center of the Place de la Concorde, is visible during scenes shot on location in the French capital.\n\nThe film, a musical romance set in La Belle Ã‰poque, utilized numerous real Parisian settings to enhance its authentic atmosphere. One of the key locations for the movie was the Place de la Concorde, where the ancient Egyptian obelisk stands prominently. A notable scene in the film features the character Gaston Lachaille, played by Louis Jourdan, wandering through the plaza in a moment of emotional realization, with the fountains and the obelisk providing a backdrop.\n\nThere are two Luxor Obelisks, one in Paris and the other at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. While other Best Picture-winning films were set or partially filmed in Paris, evidence suggests \"Gigi\" was the first to include the famous landmark. For instance, the 1951 Best Picture winner, *\"An American in Paris\"*, primarily used studio backlots for its Parisian scenes, including a replica of the Place de la Concorde's fountain for a ballet sequence, but not the actual location with the obelisk.\n\nAnother Best Picture winner, *\"Around the World in 80 Days\"* (1956), also included Paris in its global itinerary. However, detailed descriptions of its Parisian filming locations do not prominently mention the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Obelisk, with some scenes, like a balloon ascent, being filmed on a studio set. No evidence was found of any Best Picture-winning film depicting the obelisk that remains in Luxor, Egypt.\n\nTherefore, based on available filming location information and scene descriptions, \"Gigi\" is the first Best Picture winner to showcase the historic Luxor Obelisk to Academy audiences.\n\n<<<Gigi>>>"
