    "## Unveiling the Equilibrium State of Light Quanta Through Large Deviation Theory\n\nBy applying the principles of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems, the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a gas of light quanta (photons) can be determined. These theorems, which quantify the probability of rare events, provide a powerful framework for understanding the statistical behavior of physical systems, including the Bose-Einstein statistics that govern photons.\n\nAt thermal equilibrium, a photon gas is characterized by a specific distribution of particles across different energy levels. This equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic configuration, and large deviation theory explains why significant deviations from this state are exponentially unlikely.\n\nFor the Bose case of light quanta, the key characteristics are that photons are indistinguishable bosons and their total number is not conserved, which leads to a chemical potential of zero at equilibrium.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium is directly related to the rate function from Sanov's theorem. Sanov's theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from the true distribution is governed by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. At equilibrium, the system will be in the macrostate that maximizes the number of microscopic configurations, which corresponds to the state that minimizes the large deviation rate function. This minimization is equivalent to the maximization of entropy. For a photon gas, the equilibrium entropy (S) is given by:\n\n*   **S = (4/3) * a * V * T³**\n\nwhere 'a' is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 'V' is the volume, and 'T' is the temperature. This formula is a cornerstone of black-body radiation and can be derived by maximizing the statistical entropy under the constraints of the system.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n\nThe mean energy of the photon gas can be determined using Cramer's theorem, which deals with the probability of the empirical mean deviating from the expected value. The equilibrium state corresponds to the mean energy that minimizes the Chernoff bound. This leads to the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy (E) of a photon gas at equilibrium:\n\n*   **E = a * V * T⁴**\n\nThis shows that the total energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The mean energy per photon can then be found by dividing the total energy by the average number of photons. The average number of photons (N) in a volume V at temperature T is given by:\n\n*   **N ≈ 20.3 * V * (kT/hc)³**\n\nwhere 'k' is the Boltzmann constant, 'h' is the Planck constant, and 'c' is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the **mean energy per photon** is approximately **2.7 * kT**.\n\nIn essence, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why a photon gas settles into the specific equilibrium state described by Planck's law of black-body radiation, from which the expressions for equilibrium entropy and mean energy are derived. The equilibrium state is the one that is overwhelmingly the most probable, with any significant deviations being exceedingly rare.\n\nThe application of large deviation theory to the Bose gas of photons successfully reproduces the results obtained by Bose and Planck, demonstrating the deep connection between probability theory and the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<The equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is given by S = (4/3) * a * V * T³, and the equilibrium mean energy is E = a * V * T⁴.>>>"
