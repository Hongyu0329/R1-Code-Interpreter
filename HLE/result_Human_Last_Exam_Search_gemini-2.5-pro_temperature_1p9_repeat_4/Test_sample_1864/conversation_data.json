    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) using Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 12 essential control samples. These controls are crucial for accurate data interpretation and for setting up the sorter correctly to ensure the purity of the sorted populations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls needed:\n\n**1. Unstained Control (1 sample):**\n*   This sample contains only your cells and the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels.\n*   **Purpose:** It is used to determine the baseline level of autofluorescence from both the cells and the beads and to set the initial voltage for the detectors on the flow cytometer.\n\n**2. Compensation Controls (5 samples):**\n*   You need one single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n    *   Sample 1: Stained only with AF350\n    *   Sample 2: Stained only with GFP\n    *   Sample 3: Stained only with PE\n    *   Sample 4: Stained only with AF647\n    *   Sample 5: Stained only with AF750\n*   **Purpose:** These controls are essential to correct for spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorochrome's signal into a detector intended for another color. This mathematical correction, known as compensation, is critical for accurate multicolor analysis. For these controls to be effective, they should be at least as bright as the signal in your experimental sample.\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):**\n*   An FMO control is a sample stained with all the antibodies in your panel *except for one*. For a five-color experiment, you will prepare five different FMO controls.\n    *   FMO for AF350: Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n    *   FMO for GFP: Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n    *   FMO for PE: Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750.\n    *   FMO for AF647: Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750.\n    *   FMO for AF750: Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647.\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are the most accurate way to set the gates that distinguish between positive and negative cell populations for each specific marker, as they account for the fluorescence spread from all other colors in the panel. This is especially critical for cell sorting to ensure high purity.\n\n**4. Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding Control (1 sample):**\n*   This sample consists of your cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin but *without* the biotinylated primary antibody.\n*   **Purpose:** This control is crucial to determine if the streptavidin reagent is binding non-specifically to your cells, which could otherwise lead to false-positive results. This is analogous to a secondary antibody control.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n*   **Viability Dye:** It is highly recommended to include a viability dye in all your samples to exclude dead cells. Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, compromising your results. If the viability dye uses a sixth, separate fluorochrome, you would need an additional compensation control for it.\n*   **Biological Controls:** It is also good practice to have biological positive and negative controls—cells that are known to express the markers and cells known to be negative for them—to validate the staining.\n\nIn summary, for a robust and accurate five-color sorting experiment using streptavidin, preparing these 12 fundamental controls is essential.\n\n<<<12>>>"
