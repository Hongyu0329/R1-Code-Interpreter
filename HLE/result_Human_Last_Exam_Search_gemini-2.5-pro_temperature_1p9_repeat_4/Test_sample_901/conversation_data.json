    "When (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is treated with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol, an E2 elimination reaction occurs. This reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In the context of a cyclohexane ring, this means both the bromine and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\nThe (1S,2R) stereoisomer of 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans* isomer, meaning the bromo and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring. For the reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane ring must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n\nLet's analyze the required conformation:\n1.  If the bromine atom is in an axial position (e.g., axial-down), the *trans* methyl group at the adjacent carbon must also be in an axial position (axial-up) for this specific chair conformation. While this diaxial conformation is less stable than the diequatorial conformer, the equilibrium between the two allows the reaction to proceed through this less stable, but reactive, form.\n2.  With the bromine in an axial position, we look for anti-periplanar β-hydrogens.\n    *   **At carbon 2:** The methyl group is in an axial position, which means the hydrogen on carbon 2 is in an equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be abstracted for the elimination. Therefore, the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, cannot be formed.\n    *   **At carbon 6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is in an axial position and is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\nBecause the only available anti-periplanar hydrogen is on carbon 6, the strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) will abstract this proton. This results in the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6.\n\nThe resulting product is the less substituted Hofmann product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
