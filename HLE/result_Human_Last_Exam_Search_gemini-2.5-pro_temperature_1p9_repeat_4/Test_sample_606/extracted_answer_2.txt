The effect on Neff is not definitively an increase or decrease; it depends on the thermalization process of the decay products. While an increase is possible if the energy primarily stays in the neutrino sector, it is also plausible, and perhaps more likely under the given conditions (m >> 3*T), that Neff would decrease because the highly energetic neutrinos would transfer a significant portion of their energy to the electromagnetic plasma, heating the photons more than the neutrinos. Therefore, the answer is that Neff could either increase or decrease.
