    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to changes in the laws of nature, both in the context of the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws following the Fall, is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine, a pivotal figure in early Christian thought, articulated a framework for understanding how God could act outside of the established natural order. He introduced specific Latin phrases to describe these divine interventions.\n\nIn a sermon discussing the miraculous birth of Jesus, Augustine used the distinct phrase **\"Naturae jura mutantur in homine\"**, which translates to \"The laws of nature are changed in the case of man.\" This terminology directly addresses the suspension or alteration of natural laws to allow for the virgin birth, an event he considered a divine prodigy.\n\nRegarding the consequences of the Fall of man, Augustine developed the concept of a **\"second nature\" (quasi secunda natura)**. He equated humanity's original, pre-Fall state with the \"natural law.\" The fall, according to Augustine, corrupted this original state, introducing a \"second nature\" characterized by sin, mortality, and a disordered will. This concept of a \"second nature\" represents a fundamental shift in the natural state and functioning of humanity, effectively an alteration of the \"law\" of human nature as it was originally created. The International Theological Commission, in discussing the Church Fathers' views, notes that for them, \"the natural law is henceforth understood in the framework of the history of salvation, which leads to distinguishing different states of nature (original nature, fallen nature, restored nature) in which the natural law is realized in different ways,\" a view deeply influenced by Augustine.\n\nWhile Augustine's terminology for the virgin birth (\"Naturae jura mutantur\") is a direct statement about the laws of nature, his concept of a \"second nature\" describes a change in human nature itself as a consequence of the Fall. This new, fallen nature operates under different principles than the original, unfallen nature, thus representing a change in the natural laws governing humanity.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
