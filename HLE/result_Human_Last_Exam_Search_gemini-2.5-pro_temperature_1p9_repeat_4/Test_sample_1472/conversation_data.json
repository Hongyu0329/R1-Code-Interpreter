    "The symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom.\n\nThe **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** complex has a tetrahedral coordination geometry around the copper ion. Its specific point group is **S₄**. An S₄ symmetry element is a rotation by 90 degrees followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.\n\nOn the other hand, the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** complex exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. In the solid state, this complex crystallizes in the P2₁/c space group, which has an inversion center. The molecule itself has a center of inversion, which would place it in the **Cᵢ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the specific symmetry point group depends on which complex is being referred to. However, the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is a well-cited example for the S₄ point group.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex>>>"
