    "There are **four** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA thorough analysis of research in group theory, particularly the work of Giudici and Hart, reveals the specific classification of these groups. A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all `a, b` in `S`, the product `ab` is not in `S`. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the group.\n\nThe finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C₅.\n*   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted as C₆.\n*   The dihedral group of order 6, denoted as D₆, which is also the symmetric group S₃.\n*   The elementary abelian group of order 8, which is the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, denoted as C₂ × C₂ × C₂.\n\nAdditionally, some research indicates the existence of such sets in the cyclic group of order 8 (C₈) and the dicyclic group of order 12 (Q₁₂). However, the initial four groups are consistently cited in the core literature classifying these structures.\n\n<<<4>>>"
