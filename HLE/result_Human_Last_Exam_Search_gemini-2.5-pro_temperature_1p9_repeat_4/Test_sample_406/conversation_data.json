    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point (x, y, z) that remains unchanged after the application of three functions, F, G, and H, in a specific manner. The conditions for the existence of such a point are primarily studied within the mathematical framework of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\nAn element (x, y, z) in a space X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point of the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z if:\n*   x = F(x, y, z)\n*   y = G(y, x, y)\n*   z = H(z, y, x)\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under a specific set of conditions. These conditions generally relate to the properties of the spaces (X, Y, Z), the nature of the functions (F, G, H), and the existence of a starting point.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Space**\nThe functions must be defined on partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means:\n*   **(X, ≤, dX)**, **(Y, ≤, dY)**, and **(Z, ≤, dZ)** are complete metric spaces equipped with a partial order relation '≤'. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space converges to a point within the space.\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property.\" This property ensures that the functions behave in a predictable way with respect to the partial ordering. Specifically, for any x, u in X, y, v in Y, and z, w in Z:\n\n*   **For F:** F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.\n    *   If x ≤ u, y ≥ v, and z ≤ w, then F(x, y, z) ≤ F(u, v, w).\n*   **For G:** G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.\n    *   If y ≤ v, x ≥ u, and y ≤ v, then G(y, x, y) ≤ G(v, u, v).\n*   **For H:** H is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second.\n    *   If z ≤ w, y ≥ v, and x ≥ u, then H(z, y, x) ≤ H(w, v, u).\n\n### **3. Contractive Condition**\nThe functions must satisfy a \"contractive\" condition. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied repeatedly, the distance between successive points decreases. There exist constants k, l, m in [0, 1) such that their sum is less than 1 (k + l + m < 1) and for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, z, w ∈ Z with x ≤ u, y ≥ v, z ≤ w, the following inequality holds:\n\nd(F(u, v, w), F(x, y, z)) + d(G(v, u, v), G(y, x, y)) + d(H(w, u, w), H(z, y, x)) ≤ k * d(u, x) + l * d(v, y) + m * d(w, z)\n\nThis is a specific type of contractive condition; various forms exist in the literature.\n\n### **4. Existence of an Initial Point**\nThere must exist initial points x₀ in X, y₀ in Y, and z₀ in Z that satisfy the following starting conditions:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nAlternatively, the inequalities can be reversed. If F, G, and H are continuous functions, this condition is sufficient for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point. If the functions are not necessarily continuous, an additional condition on the space's structure (regularity) is needed.\n\n### **Condition for Uniqueness**\nFor the FGH-tripled fixed point to be unique, an additional condition on the space is required:\n\n*   **Comparability:** For every pair of points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, there exists a third point (a, b, c) that is comparable to both. This means that (x ≤ a, y ≥ b, z ≤ c) and (u ≤ a, v ≥ b, w ≤ c).\n\nThese conditions together ensure that the iterative sequences generated by applying F, G, and H converge to a unique FGH-tripled fixed point. The concept is a generalization of the well-known Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a multi-dimensional setting with multiple functions.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are that the spaces (X, ≤, dX), (Y, ≤, dY), and (Z, ≤, dZ) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition.
