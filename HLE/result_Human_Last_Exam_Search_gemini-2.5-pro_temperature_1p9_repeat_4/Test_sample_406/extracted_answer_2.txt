The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are that the spaces (X, ≤, dX), (Y, ≤, dY), and (Z, ≤, dZ) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition. Specifically, there must exist constants k, l, m in [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that d(F(u, v, w), F(x, y, z)) + d(G(v, u, v), G(y, x, y)) + d(H(w, u, w), H(z, y, x)) ≤ k * d(u, x) + l * d(v, y) + m * d(w, z) for all x ≤ u, y ≥ v, z ≤ w. Furthermore, there must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, z₀ ∈ Z such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀). For uniqueness, for every pair of points in X × Y × Z, there must exist a third point comparable to both.
