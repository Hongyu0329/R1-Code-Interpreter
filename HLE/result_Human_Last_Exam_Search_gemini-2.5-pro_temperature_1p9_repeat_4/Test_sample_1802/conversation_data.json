    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit), we first need to understand the properties of these channels.\n\nA Pauli channel in dimension $d$ is a quantum channel described by the following map:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is a basis of unitary operators known as the generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$). These unitary operators are orthogonal, satisfying the condition $\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kj}$, where $\\delta_{kj}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe action of the channel can be expressed using Kraus operators, $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. The channel map is then $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger$. The number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ determines the number of Kraus operators needed to describe the channel.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the quantum evolution. If the original channel $\\Lambda$ has Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel maps the input state $\\rho$ to a state of the environment, given by:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,j} \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_j^\\dagger) |k\\rangle\\langle j| $$\nwhere $|k\\rangle$ and $|j\\rangle$ are basis states of the environment. The rank of this complementary channel, rank($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$), is determined by the dimension of the operator space spanned by the products $A_k^\\dagger A_j$. Specifically, rank($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$) = dim(span{$A_k^\\dagger A_j$ : for all $k,j$}).\n\nFor our Pauli channel, the operators $A_k^\\dagger A_j$ are:\n$$ A_k^\\dagger A_j = (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j) = \\sqrt{p_k p_j} U_k^\\dagger U_j $$\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to consider the case where the linear space spanned by these operators is as large as possible. This occurs when the maximum number of probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero, meaning $p_k > 0$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$.\n\nThe set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ forms a complete basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices. The product of any two of these unitary operators, $U_k^\\dagger U_j$, results in another operator that is, up to a phase factor, one of the operators in the Pauli basis, $c_{kjm}U_m$. Therefore, the set of all possible products $\\{U_k^\\dagger U_j\\}$ will span the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nThe dimension of the space of $d \\times d$ matrices is $d^2$. Since the set of operators $\\{A_k^\\dagger A_j\\}$ spans this full space, the dimension of this span is $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
