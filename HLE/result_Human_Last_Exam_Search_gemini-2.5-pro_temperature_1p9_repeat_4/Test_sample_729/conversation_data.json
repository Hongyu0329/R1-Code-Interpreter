    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group of order 2<sup>7</sup>. The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature. The most natural interpretation in this context is that of a **cyclic subgroup**, which is a subgroup generated by taking all integer powers of a single element.\n\nTo find the number of cyclic subgroups in Q_128, we must identify all its cyclic subgroups. The structure of Q_128 is given by the presentation:\n<center>Q_128 = &#10216;x, y | x<sup>64</sup> = 1, x<sup>32</sup> = y<sup>2</sup>, yxy<sup>-1</sup> = x<sup>-1</sup>&#10217;</center>\n\nThe elements of Q_128 can be divided into two categories:\n1.  Elements that are powers of *x*.\n2.  Elements that are not powers of *x*.\n\n**1. Cyclic Subgroups from Powers of *x***\n\nThe element *x* generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64, denoted as &#10216;x&#10217;. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group of order *n* is equal to the number of divisors of *n* (τ(*n*)). For the subgroup &#10216;x&#10217; of order 64, the number of subgroups is τ(64). The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. For each divisor *d* of 64, there is exactly one subgroup of order *d* within &#10216;x&#10217;.\n\nThis gives a total of **7** cyclic subgroups:\n*   One subgroup for each of the orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n\n**2. Cyclic Subgroups from Elements Outside &#10216;x&#10217;**\n\nThe elements outside of the subgroup &#10216;x&#10217; have the form *x*<sup>k</sup>y for k = 0, 1, ..., 63. There are 64 such elements.\n\nIt is a known property of generalized quaternion groups Q<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> that for n ≥ 3, every element outside the cyclic subgroup &#10216;x&#10217; has an order of 4. Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\nA cyclic group of order 4 has φ(4) = 2 generators, where φ is Euler's totient function. This means that each of these cyclic subgroups of order 4 is generated by two distinct elements. To find the number of unique cyclic subgroups of order 4 from these 64 elements, we divide the number of elements by the number of generators per subgroup:\n\nNumber of new cyclic subgroups = 64 / φ(4) = 64 / 2 = **32**.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroup of order 4 found within &#10216;x&#10217; (which is &#10216;x<sup>16</sup>&#10217;), as they contain elements with *y*, while the subgroups of &#10216;x&#10217; do not.\n\n**Total Number of Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nThe total number of cyclic (power) subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from within &#10216;x&#10217; and the unique subgroups generated by the elements outside of it:\n\nTotal cyclic subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nTherefore, there are 39 power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
