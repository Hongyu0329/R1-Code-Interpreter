    "The Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967. The acquisition was an \"Ankauf von der Witwe des Künstlers, Maria Günther, Gera\" (purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, Gera).\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a significant work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement in Germany. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck, who was a paraplegic and lived in the same house as the artist, listening to the radio. At the time of its creation, radio was a new and influential medium, a theme explored by many artists of the period.\n\nThe painting is part of the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
