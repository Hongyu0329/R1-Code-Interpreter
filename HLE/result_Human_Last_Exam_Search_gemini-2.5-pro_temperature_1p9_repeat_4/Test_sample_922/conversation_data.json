    "The integer that completes the sequence is 227311.\n\nThis sequence is part of a puzzle created by a user known as \"branes\" on the \"Another popular web board\" (a likely reference to a well-known online forum). The numbers in the sequence are decimal representations of offsets in a Xilinx bitstream file (`xcr3512xl_upper.map`).\n\nA user on that board, \"plugh\", successfully identified the pattern and the source file. By analyzing the provided numbers, he was able to deduce the rule for generating the sequence and find the next term. The discovery of this completing value was made around August 2022.\n\n<<<227311>>>"
