    "An upper bound for the maximum norm of an automorphic form in relation to the covolume for squarefree levels has been a subject of extensive research in number theory. The problem is often referred to as the \"sup-norm problem\".\n\nThe specific context for your question is the study of Hecke-Maass cusp forms on the modular surface $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a Hecke congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ of a squarefree level $N$.\n\nIn this setting:\n*   The **maximum norm**, which you denote as $(k_{k,\\infty})$, is typically the sup-norm of a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$. This form $f$ is an eigenfunction of the hyperbolic Laplacian with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and is also a joint eigenfunction of all Hecke operators. It is assumed to be $L^2$-normalized.\n*   The **covolume** $(V)$ is the volume of the modular surface $Y_0(N)$. For a squarefree level $N$, this volume is proportional to $N$, specifically $V = \\text{vol}(Y_0(N)) \\asymp N$.\n\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ is given in a \"hybrid\" form, meaning it depends on both the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the level $N$ (and thus the covolume $V$). A significant result in this area, which currently provides one of the best known bounds for squarefree $N$, was established by Nicolas Templier.\n\nThe upper bound is given by:\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\n\nSince the covolume $V$ is directly related to the level $N$ for squarefree $N$, this bound can be expressed in terms of $V$ as:\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nThis inequality provides a sub-convex bound in both the eigenvalue and level aspects simultaneously, generalizing previous best-known bounds in each aspect.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm ($\\|f\\|_\\infty$) of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and squarefree level $N$ is $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$, where $V$ is the covolume of the underlying modular surface.>>>"
