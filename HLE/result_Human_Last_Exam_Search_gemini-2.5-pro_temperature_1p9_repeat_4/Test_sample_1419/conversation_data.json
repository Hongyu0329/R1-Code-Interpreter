    "Near four dimensions, specifically in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the ϕ^4 theory possesses a non-trivial infrared fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\nTo find this fixed point, one calculates the renormalization group (RG) beta function for the coupling constant. A fixed point occurs where the beta function equals zero. For the ϕ⁴ theory, the one-loop beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + A * u²\n\nwhere the constant 'A' depends on the normalization of the coupling constant 'u'. The non-trivial fixed point (where u* ≠ 0) is then found by setting β(u*) = 0, which yields:\n\nu* = ϵ / A\n\nThe specific value of 'A' and thus the expression for u* depends on the conventions used in defining the theory's Lagrangian. Two common results for the leading order fixed point coupling are:\n\n*   **u* = (16π²/3)ε**: This result arises from a beta function of the form β(g) = -εg + (3/16π²)g².\n*   **u* = ε/3**: In this normalization, the beta function is β(λ) = -ελ + 3λ².\n\nBoth expressions demonstrate that the fixed point coupling is of order ϵ, which allows for a perturbative treatment of the theory in the epsilon expansion. This expansion is a powerful tool for studying the critical properties of systems like the Ising model near their critical dimension.\n\n<<<u* is directly proportional to ϵ at leading order. A common expression is u* = (16π²/3)ε, though the numerical prefactor depends on the normalization of the coupling constant.>>>"
