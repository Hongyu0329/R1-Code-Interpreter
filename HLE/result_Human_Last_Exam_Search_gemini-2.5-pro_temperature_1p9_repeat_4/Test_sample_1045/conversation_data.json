    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   Each hydrogen atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions (one for the 1s orbital, which is split into two parts).\n*   Each carbon atom (a \"heavy\" or non-hydrogen atom) has its core and valence orbitals described. For a first-row element like carbon, this includes the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals.\n    *   The 1s core orbital is represented by 1 contracted Gaussian function.\n    *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are each split into two parts (double-zeta). The 2p orbitals consist of 2px, 2py, and 2pz. So, there is 1 contracted function for the 2s orbital and 3 for the 2p orbitals (one for each p-orbital). However, due to the split-valence nature of the 6-31G basis set, the valence orbitals are represented by two basis functions each. This means there is one basis function for the 2s, and one for each of the three 2p orbitals in the inner part, and the same again for the outer part. In total, a carbon atom has 1 (for 1s) + 1 (for 2s inner) + 3 (for 2p inner) + 1 (for 2s outer) + 3 (for 2p outer) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions. This is not quite right.\nLet's re-examine the sources. The 6-31G notation means each inner shell (1s) is represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitives. The valence shell is split into two functions. For carbon, the valence shell consists of the 2s and 2p orbitals. One set of valence functions (2s and 2p) is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian function. This gives:\n*   1 function for the 1s orbital\n*   1 function for the inner valence (2s + 2p)\n*   1 function for the outer valence (2s + 2p)\nNo, this is also incorrect.\nLet's try again. The 6-31G basis set for a first-row atom like carbon involves:\n*   1s orbital: 1 contracted function.\n*   2s orbital: 2 contracted functions (split-valence).\n*   2p orbitals (px, py, pz): 2 contracted functions for *each* of the three p-orbitals. That is 2 * 3 = 6 contracted functions for the p-orbitals.\nSo, for each carbon atom, there are 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 basis functions. This still seems too high.\n\nLet's refer to another source. For a first row atom like carbon or oxygen, the number of basis functions in a 6-31G basis set is the same. For methanol (CH3OH) with a 6-31G basis set, there are 26 basis functions in total. Methanol has 1 carbon, 4 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen. If hydrogen has 2 basis functions each, that's 4*2 = 8 functions for hydrogen. Oxygen will have the same number of functions as Carbon. So, if C and O both have 'x' functions, then x + x + 8 = 26, so 2x = 18, which means x=9. So each carbon and oxygen has 9 contracted basis functions.\n\nSo, for each carbon atom in toluene, there are 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\nFor each hydrogen atom in toluene, there are 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nTotal number of contracted functions for toluene (C7H8) is:\n(Number of Carbon atoms * Functions per Carbon) + (Number of Hydrogen atoms * Functions per Hydrogen)\n= (7 * 9) + (8 * 2)\n= 63 + 16\n= 79\n\nTherefore, for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, C7H8, 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\nI will re-run the search to double-check the number of basis functions for carbon and hydrogen in the 6-31G basis set.The user is asking for the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the number of atoms of each element in toluene.**\n    Toluene's chemical formula is C7H8.\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom with the 6-31G basis set.**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. For hydrogen, the 1s orbital is split into two parts. This results in **2** contracted basis functions per hydrogen atom.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** Carbon is a second-row element. The 6-31G basis set describes the core and valence electrons.\n        *   The core (1s) orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function.\n        *   The valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are each split into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" valence).\n            *   One 2s contracted function.\n            *   One set of three 2p contracted functions (px, py, pz).\n            *   Another 2s contracted function.\n            *   Another set of three 2p contracted functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   Wait, that's not right. Let's think about it this way: a minimal basis set (like STO-3G) would have one function for each core and valence orbital. For carbon, this would be 1s, 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz, so 5 basis functions. A split-valence basis like 6-31G splits the valence orbitals.\n        *   Core: 1s (1 function)\n        *   Valence (split into two):\n            *   Inner part: 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz (4 functions)\n            *   Outer part: 2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz' (4 functions)\n        *   This gives a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = **9** contracted basis functions for each carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8).**\n    *   Total functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C atom) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H atom)\n    *   Total functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n    *   Total functions = 63 + 16\n    *   Total functions = 79\n\nI will now generate the search queries to confirm the number of basis functions for Carbon and Hydrogen with the 6-31G basis set.For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. Here's a breakdown of how this number is calculated:\n\nFirst, the chemical formula for toluene, C7H8, indicates that the molecule consists of 7 carbon (C) atoms and 8 hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each type of atom is as follows:\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted basis functions. This is because the 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set, meaning the valence orbital (1s for hydrogen) is described by two functions.\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom, a \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom, is represented by 9 contracted basis functions. This includes one function for the core (1s) orbital and four functions for the inner valence (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) and another four for the outer valence orbitals.\n\nTo find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions, you multiply the number of atoms of each element by the number of basis functions for that element and then sum the results:\n\n*   **Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nTherefore, the calculation for toluene using the 6-31G basis set will involve 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
