    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is fairy bee. \"Miner bee\" is also a common name for this genus, though it is a broader term that also refers to the family Andrenidae, to which *Perdita* belongs.\n\nThe name \"fairy bee\" alludes to the very small and delicate nature of the bees in this genus. For instance, the smallest bee in North America is *Perdita minima*, a type of fairy bee. While the name is currently in wide use, as evidenced by recent publications and online resources, the exact year it was first coined is not readily available in the searched documents. One article notes that common names for many bee species are still in their infancy and not broadly standardized.\n\n<<<fairy bee, unknown>>>"
