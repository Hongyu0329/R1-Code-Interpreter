    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which occurs where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\n**1. Defining the Supply and Demand Functions:**\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\nThe domain of the supply function requires `Q_S^3 - 2 > 0`, which means the minimum quantity supplied is `Q_min = ∛2 ≈ 1.26`.\n\n**2. Finding Market Equilibrium:**\nAt equilibrium, `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the prices are equal. We need to solve the following equation for the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`):\n`ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved algebraically. Using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity to be:\n`Q_E ≈ 4.708`\n\nWe can then find the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` into either the supply or demand function. Using the demand function:\n`P_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.708)) ≈ 4.626`\n\n**3. Calculating Consumer and Producer Surplus:**\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). These are calculated as the areas between the demand/supply curves and the equilibrium price line.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve from `Q = 0` to `Q_E`, minus the rectangular area of `P_E * Q_E`.\n    `CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_E * Q_E`\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve from its minimum quantity (`Q_min`) to `Q_E`, bounded by the equilibrium price `P_E`.\n    `PS = P_E * (Q_E - Q_min) - ∫[from Q_min to Q_E] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n**4. Numerical Integration and Final Calculation:**\nDue to the complexity of the functions, these integrals must also be solved numerically.\n\n*   **Numerical value for the demand integral:** `∫[from 0 to 4.708] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 34.208`\n*   **Calculation of CS:** `CS ≈ 34.208 - (4.626 * 4.708) ≈ 12.43`\n\n*   **Numerical value for the supply integral:** `∫[from 1.26 to 4.708] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ ≈ 12.015`\n*   **Calculation of PS:** `PS ≈ (4.626 * (4.708 - 1.26)) - 12.015 ≈ 3.93`\n\n**5. Total Welfare:**\nThe total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n`Total Welfare = CS + PS ≈ 12.43 + 3.93 = 16.36`\n\n<<<16.36>>>"
