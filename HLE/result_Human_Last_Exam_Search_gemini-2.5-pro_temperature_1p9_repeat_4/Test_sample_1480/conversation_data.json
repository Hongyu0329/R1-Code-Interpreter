    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedents and the membership degree of the consequent of the rule. The firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′)=0.7`, and the membership degree of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a type of binary operation used in fuzzy logic to represent the \"and\" operator. Common t-norms include the minimum (min) and the product. Without a specific t-norm being mentioned, the minimum operator is one of the most common choices.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\nRule Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7\n\nIf the product t-norm were used, the result would be:\nRule Activation Level = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\nRule Activation Level = 0.63\n\nAssuming the commonly used minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
