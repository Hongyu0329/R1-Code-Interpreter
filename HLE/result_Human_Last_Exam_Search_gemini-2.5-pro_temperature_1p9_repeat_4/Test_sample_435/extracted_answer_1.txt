Based on the body of evidence, the prediction is that CAR T cells manufactured with Interleukin-15 would exhibit a more robust and sustained release of key effector cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α upon antigen encounter, which may also lead to an increased incidence of cytokine release syndrome in a clinical setting due to their enhanced anti-tumor activity and proliferation.
