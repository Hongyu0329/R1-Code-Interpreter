    "The search results confirm the structure of a barbell graph and the principles of randomized uniform gossiping. A barbell graph with $2n$ nodes is composed of two complete graphs of $n$ nodes each, connected by a single edge, referred to as a bridge. For a 10-node barbell graph, each complete graph, or clique, therefore contains 5 nodes. The connecting edge is indeed the bottleneck of the graph, a term used in the context of gossiping algorithms.\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping involves nodes communicating with others chosen uniformly at random. In the context of edge-based gossiping, this means each edge is selected with equal probability.\n\nTo determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we first need to calculate the total number of edges in the graph.\n*   A complete graph with $n$ vertices has $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.\n*   For each 5-node clique in the 10-node barbell graph, the number of edges is $\\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 10$.\n*   With two such cliques, the total number of edges within the cliques is $10 + 10 = 20$.\n*   There is one additional edge, the bottleneck or bridge, connecting the two cliques.\n*   Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is $20 + 1 = 21$.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, every edge has an equal chance of being selected. The probability of sampling any specific edge is the reciprocal of the total number of edges. Since there is only one bottleneck edge, its probability of being sampled is 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{\\text{Total number of edges}} = \\frac{1}{21}$.\n\nThus, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is $\\frac{1}{21}$.\n\n<<<The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights under randomized uniform gossiping is 1/21. This is calculated by first determining the total number of edges in the graph. A 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge (the bottleneck). Each 5-node clique has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges is 10 (in the first clique) + 10 (in the second clique) + 1 (the bottleneck edge) = 21 edges. In randomized uniform gossiping, each edge has an equal probability of being selected. Thus, the probability of selecting the single bottleneck edge is 1 out of 21.>>>"
