The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights under randomized uniform gossiping is 1/21. This is calculated by first determining the total number of edges in the graph. A 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge (the bottleneck). Each 5-node clique has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges is 10 (in the first clique) + 10 (in the second clique) + 1 (the bottleneck edge) = 21 edges. In randomized uniform gossiping, each edge has an equal probability of being selected. Thus, the probability of selecting the single bottleneck edge is 1 out of 21.
