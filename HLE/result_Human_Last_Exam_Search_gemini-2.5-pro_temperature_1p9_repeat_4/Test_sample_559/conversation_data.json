    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrices in a phase plane are the curves that separate regions of different qualitative behavior, and they are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points exist where both $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$ are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. Thus, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ and $d=-1$. Thus, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are the other two equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Classifying the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe analyze the Jacobian matrix of the system at each equilibrium point to determine its stability. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** The Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n*   **At (1, -1):** The Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the equilibrium is non-hyperbolic, and linearization does not determine its stability.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrices**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\n*   **Stable Manifold:** The eigenvector for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is vertical, indicating that the stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the point (1, -1). By analyzing the flow on the line $u=1$ (where $u'=0$), we find that trajectories approach (1, -1) from above and below. Thus, the stable manifold is the line **u = 1**.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold:** The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is tangent to this vector at (1,-1). To find the equation for this curve, we analyze the phase plane equation:\n    $$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n    This is a Riccati differential equation. We can test for a simple polynomial solution. By postulating a solution of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$ that passes through the saddle point (1, -1) and the other non-hyperbolic equilibrium at (0, 0), we can determine the coefficients. A systematic check reveals that the curve defined by the equation **d = -uÂ²** is an exact solution to this differential equation.\n\nThis curve $d = -u^2$ passes through both the saddle point (1, -1) and the equilibrium point (0, 0). This trajectory is an unstable manifold of the saddle point and serves as a separatrix for the system, dividing the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the separatrices of the system are the line $u=1$ and the parabola $d=-u^2$. Typically, the term \"the separatrix\" refers to the curve that provides the more complex and defining separation of the phase space.\n\nThe separatrix is given by the equation:\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
