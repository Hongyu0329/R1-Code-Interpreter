    "Based on established preflop opening ranges for a 100 big blind cash game, the button is the position from which the widest range of hands should be played. Standard opening range charts often serve as a baseline for strategy.\n\nAccording to a commonly referenced baseline for a 100bb cash game, the recommended opening range from the button includes suited jacks down to J6s. Hands such as J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s are typically considered too weak to open, even from this late position. Therefore, the weakest, or \"worst,\" suited jack that is still considered a standard open is J6s. Opening a wider range than this, especially without specific reads on the opponents in the blinds being exceptionally tight, can become unprofitable.\n\nIn a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is slightly higher as the entire pot is won, which can marginally widen the opening range. However, standard GTO-based ranges already account for the profitability of opening from the button, and J6s is a common cutoff point in many standard no-rake solutions as well.\n\n<<<J6s>>>"
