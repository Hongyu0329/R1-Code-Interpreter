    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass (PSEM), a major division of the cuttlefish brain. This mass also includes the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes, placing them in close proximity.\n\nStudies on the brain anatomy of various *Sepia* species, which share a similar brain layout to the dwarf cuttlefish, provide more precise positional information. Sagittal sections of the PSEM in *Sepia officinalis* show the posterior chromatophore lobe and the fin lobe situated dorsally and posteriorly relative to the palliovisceral lobe. Specifically, the posterior chromatophore lobes are described as being located in the dorsal region of the posterior subesophageal mass, which places them in a posterior position relative to other structures within this mass.\n\nFurthermore, the \"palliovisceral lobe complex\" is described as a functional grouping that, in addition to the palliovisceral lobe itself, includes the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes, underscoring their anatomical association. Research has also identified nerve cells in the most posterior region of the palliovisceral lobe, further defining its posterior boundary and its relationship with adjacent structures.\n\n<<<The brain regions that are situated adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
