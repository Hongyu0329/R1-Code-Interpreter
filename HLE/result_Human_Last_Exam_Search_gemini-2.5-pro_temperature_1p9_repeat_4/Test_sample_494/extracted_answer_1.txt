Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens having nuclear spin zero would still exhibit tunneling. The fundamental quantum mechanical tunneling process is determined by the potential energy surface and the masses of the atoms, not directly by the nuclear spin. However, the spin of the hydrogen nuclei dictates the symmetry of the total molecular wavefunction according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Changing the protons from fermions (spin 1/2) to bosons (spin 0) alters the symmetry requirements, which in turn changes the allowed rotational energy levels. Consequently, while the tunneling phenomenon would persist, its spectroscopic manifestation—the observable inversion spectrum—would be significantly different from that of ordinary ammonia because different sets of energy levels would be populated.
