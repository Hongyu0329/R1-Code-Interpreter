    "The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann's participation in the advertising campaign is confirmed through online videos of the commercials. In one of the \"Ask Why\" spots, Gell-Mann discusses the importance of questioning assumptions.\n\nThe second Nobel laureate was Indian economist Amartya Sen. While video evidence of his specific commercial is not as readily available, multiple sources reference the appearance of a prominent Indian intellectual in the campaign. Given Sen's status as a Nobel laureate and a leading public intellectual of Indian origin, he fits the description provided in these accounts. The campaign's theme of questioning the status quo also aligns with Sen's work on social choice theory and development economics.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a large-scale marketing effort by Enron to project an image of being an innovative and forward-thinking company. The inclusion of esteemed figures like Gell-Mann and Sen was intended to lend intellectual credibility to this image. The tagline \"Ask Why\" would later become ironic in the wake of the company's massive accounting fraud scandal.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
