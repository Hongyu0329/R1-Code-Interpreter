    "A \"power subgroup\" of a group is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, is a non-abelian group of order 2⁹. To find the number of its power subgroups, we must find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_2ⁿ is defined by the presentation:\n⟨a, b | a^(2ⁿ⁻¹) = 1, b² = 1, bab = a^(2ⁿ⁻² - 1)⟩\n\nFor SD_512, we have n=9, so its presentation is:\n⟨a, b | a²⁵⁶ = 1, b² = 1, bab = a¹²⁷⟩\n\nThe elements of this group are either powers of 'a' or elements of the form aⁱb.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by powers of 'a':**\n    The element 'a' generates a cyclic subgroup of order 256. The number of distinct subgroups in a cyclic group of order N is equal to the number of divisors of N. For the subgroup ⟨a⟩ of order 256 (which is 2⁸), the number of divisors is 8 + 1 = 9. These are the subgroups generated by a^d for each divisor d of 256 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256).\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form aⁱb:**\n    The order of an element aⁱb depends on whether the integer 'i' is even or odd.\n    *   If 'i' is even, the element aⁱb has an order of 2. There are 128 even values for 'i' (from 0 to 254), each generating a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. None of these are included in the subgroups generated by 'a', except for the identity element.\n    *   If 'i' is odd, the element aⁱb has an order of 4. The subgroup generated by aⁱb is {e, aⁱb, a¹²⁸, a^(i+128)b}. The 128 elements of this type pair up to generate the same subgroup (e.g., a¹b and a¹²⁹b generate the same subgroup). Therefore, there are 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 of this form. These subgroups are also distinct from the ones generated by powers of 'a'.\n\nCombining these gives the total number of power subgroups:\n*   9 cyclic subgroups from the powers of 'a'.\n*   128 cyclic subgroups of order 2.\n*   64 cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is 9 + 128 + 64 = 201. A paper on the number of cyclic subgroups of p-groups provides a formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a semidihedral group SD_2ⁿ: c(SD_2ⁿ) = 3 * 2ⁿ⁻³ + n. For n=9, this gives:\nc(SD_512) = 3 * 2⁹⁻³ + 9 = 3 * 2⁶ + 9 = 3 * 64 + 9 = 192 + 9 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
