    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nA detailed analysis of the paper reveals that it contains no citations to the work of other scientists or any lecture series. The paper is notable for its lack of references to previous work on the topic, a characteristic of several of Einstein's groundbreaking 1905 papers. Some scholars have noted that Einstein's papers from this period often had few or no citations.\n\nThe only citation within the Brownian motion paper is a footnote referencing one of his own earlier publications from 1903. Therefore, the answer to whose lectures Einstein cited is none.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
