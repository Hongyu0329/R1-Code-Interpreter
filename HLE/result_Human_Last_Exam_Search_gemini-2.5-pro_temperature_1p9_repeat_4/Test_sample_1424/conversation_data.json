    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G_0, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to the theory and can be explicitly shown, particularly when transformed into momentum and frequency (or energy) space.\n\nThe bare Green's function is derived from a path integral with a quadratic action, which corresponds to a free, non-interacting system. While the path integral is defined over all possible paths in spacetime, its evaluation for a free particle, followed by a Fourier transform from time to frequency (ω) and position to momentum (k), yields a more direct view of its energy dependence.\n\nIn momentum-frequency space, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) for a single-particle is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or external energy) ω and the particle's own energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. The precise form depends on the type of Green's function (e.g., retarded, advanced, or causal/Feynman).\n\nFor a causal Green's function at zero temperature, the functional dependence is:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nHere:\n*   **G_0(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum k and energy (frequency) ω.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with momentum k. This term encapsulates the particle's dispersion relation.\n*   **ω** is the frequency or energy variable.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimally small imaginary term (with δ → 0⁺) that enforces causality, ensuring the particle propagates forward in time. This term's sign can differ for hole propagation or for different (retarded/advanced) Green's functions.\n\nThis expression shows that the bare Green's function has poles in the complex frequency plane at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. These poles represent the energies at which the particle can exist as a stable excitation. The path integral formalism provides a robust framework for deriving this result from first principles, starting with the sum over all possible particle trajectories. The Dyson equation further illustrates the role of G_0 as the starting point for calculating the full, interacting Green's function G by systematically including the effects of interactions through the self-energy."
