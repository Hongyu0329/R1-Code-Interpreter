    "ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger color gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that ROMM RGB can represent more colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB. When converting a color from a larger gamut to a smaller one, some colors may fall \"out of gamut,\" meaning they cannot be accurately represented in the smaller color space.\n\nTo determine which of the given ROMM RGB values cannot be represented in sRGB, each color must be converted from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If the resulting sRGB values for any of the red, green, or blue channels are outside the standard range of 0 to 1, the color is considered out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nThe conversion process involves a series of steps including gamma correction and matrix transformations to account for the different primary colors and white points of the two color spaces. Performing these calculations reveals the following:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** The pure blue of ROMM RGB is a very saturated color that lies outside the boundaries of the sRGB color space. The conversion results in an sRGB blue value greater than 1 and a negative green value, indicating it is out of gamut.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** Similarly, the pure green of ROMM RGB is highly saturated and outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion leads to an sRGB green value greater than 1 and negative red and blue values, placing it out of gamut.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is less saturated and falls within the sRGB gamut.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is also within the reproducible range of sRGB.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents white, which is a common reference point for both color spaces and is therefore within the sRGB gamut.\n\nTherefore, the ROMM RGB values that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first two.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
