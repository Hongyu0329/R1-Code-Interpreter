    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension *d*=3 can be calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion near the upper critical dimension. The upper critical dimension for a system described by a scalar field theory, such as the Ising model, is *d*<sub>c</sub>=4.\n\nThe epsilon expansion involves treating ε = *d*<sub>c</sub> - *d* as a small parameter. In this case, with *d*=3, we have ε = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe critical exponents are then calculated as a power series in ε. For a system with an *n*-component order parameter, the critical exponent α for the specific heat is given to the first order in ε by the formula:\n\nα = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ε + O(ε²)\n\nFor an Ising-like system, the order parameter is a scalar, which means it has only one component, so *n*=1.\n\nSubstituting *n*=1 and ε=1 into the formula, we get:\n\nα = (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) * 1\nα = 3 / (2 * 9)\nα = 3 / 18\nα = 1/6\n\nThus, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent α is approximately 0.167.\n\nIt's important to note that this is an approximation. Higher-order terms in the ε-expansion would provide a more accurate value. For instance, including the second-order term gives α ≈ 0.108 for *n*=1 and ε=1. The experimentally and numerically determined value for the 3D Ising model is approximately 0.110. However, the first-order calculation provides a significant improvement over the mean-field theory prediction of α=0.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
