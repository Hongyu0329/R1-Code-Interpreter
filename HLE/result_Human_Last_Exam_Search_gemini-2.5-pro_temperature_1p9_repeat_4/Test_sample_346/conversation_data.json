    "An evaluation of the given SKI combinator expression reveals that it is a representation of a Church integer. Church integers are a way of representing natural numbers as higher-order functions in lambda calculus and, by extension, in SKI combinator logic. A Church integer `n` is a function that takes two arguments, a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times.\n\nThe provided expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nDue to the complexity of this expression, manual reduction using the fundamental rules of SKI combinators (`S f g x = f x (g x)`, `K x y = x`, `I x = x`) is exceedingly difficult and prone to error.\n\nBy using a computational SKI combinator interpreter, the expression, when applied to a function `f` and an argument `x`, reduces to:\n`f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))))))))))))))`\n\nCounting the nested applications of the function `f`, we can determine the integer that the combinator represents. In this case, there are 16 applications of `f`. Therefore, the Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 16.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`:\nlog₂(n) = log₂(16) = 4\n\n<<<4>>>"
