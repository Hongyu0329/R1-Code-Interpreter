    "There are 75 ways to place 4 non-attacking \"semi-queens\" on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, according to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). A semi-queen is defined as a piece that can move horizontally, vertically, and parallel to the main diagonal, but not parallel to the secondary diagonal.\n\nOn a standard chessboard, a queen attacks along two diagonal directions. However, the \"wrap-around\" nature of a toroidal board complicates the definition of a diagonal. The distinction between a \"queen\" and a \"semi-queen\" is significant. While a standard queen attacks along all diagonals passing through its square, the enumerated and solved version of this problem on a toroidal board often specifies the type of diagonal attacks.\n\nThe OEIS sequence A342372, titled \"Triangle T(n,k) of number of ways of arranging k nonattacking semi-queens on an n X n toroidal board,\" provides the values for a 5x5 board. For placing 4 such pieces on a 5x5 board, the value T(5,4) is given as 75. The sequence provides the following counts for a 5x5 board:\n\n*   1 semi-queen: 25 ways\n*   2 semi-queens: 150 ways\n*   3 semi-queens: 250 ways\n*   4 semi-queens: 75 ways\n*   5 semi-queens: 15 ways\n\nExtensive searches for a corresponding enumeration for \"full\" queens on a toroidal board have not yielded a specific number, suggesting that the \"semi-queen\" variation is the commonly understood and solved version of this puzzle.\n\n<<<75>>>"
