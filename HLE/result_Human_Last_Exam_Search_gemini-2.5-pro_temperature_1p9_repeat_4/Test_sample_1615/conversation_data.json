    "To determine the maximum number of colours needed to properly colour the vertices of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not a complete graph, we must find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, under these conditions.\n\nA complete graph with $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, requires $n$ colours for a proper vertex colouring, as every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Thus, for a complete graph with 12345 vertices, the chromatic number would be 12345. However, the problem specifies that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nThis restriction implies that the chromatic number must be less than 12345. If a graph $G$ has a chromatic number of $n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, it means that every vertex must receive a unique colour. This is only necessary if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of a complete graph. Since $G$ is not a complete graph on 12345 vertices, its chromatic number must be less than 12345.\n\nNow, consider a graph constructed by taking a complete subgraph on $12344$ vertices ($K_{12344}$) and adding a single, isolated vertex. Let's call this graph $G'$.\n*   The total number of vertices in $G'$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   $G'$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of $G'$ is determined by the chromatic number of its largest complete subgraph (clique). The $K_{12344}$ subgraph requires 12344 distinct colours. The isolated vertex can be assigned any of these 12344 colours. Therefore, the chromatic number of $G'$ is 12344.\n\nIt has been established that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, if $\\chi(G) = n-1$, then the clique number of $G$ must also be $n-1$. In our case, with $n=12345$, a chromatic number of $12344$ is possible if the graph contains a clique of size 12344, which our constructed graph $G'$ does.\n\nSince the chromatic number cannot be 12345, the maximum possible number of colours required is 12344.\n\n"
