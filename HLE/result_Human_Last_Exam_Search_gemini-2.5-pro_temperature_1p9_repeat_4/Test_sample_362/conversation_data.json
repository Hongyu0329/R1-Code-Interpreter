    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe reaction brings together the carbon backbone of both reactants to form a new carbon-carbon double bond. Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, `(CH₃)₃CCHO`, provides the sterically hindered tert-butyl group. The phosphorus ylide, `(C₆H₅)₃P=CHCH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`, provides the 2-chlorobenzyl group.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, forming an oxaphosphetane intermediate which then decomposes to the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe resulting alkene, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, has the following structure:\n\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\nCl-Ph-CH₂-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n      |\n      CH₃\n```\n(Where Ph is a phenyl ring)\n\nThis reaction can produce two geometric isomers: the (E)- and (Z)-isomers. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, is considered an unstabilized ylide because the carbon bearing the negative charge in the zwitterionic resonance structure is attached to an alkyl group. Wittig reactions with unstabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene. However, the significant steric bulk of the tert-butyl group on pivalaldehyde can override this preference, leading to the more thermodynamically stable (E)-alkene as the major product. Research has shown that with sterically hindered aldehydes like pivalaldehyde, the Wittig reaction can result in the (E)-isomer being almost the exclusive product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
