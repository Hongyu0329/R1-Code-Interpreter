    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**, with an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains play a role in Homer's epic, serving as vantage points for the gods or as significant geographical landmarks. While Mount Olympus is famed as the home of the gods and is the highest mountain in Greece at 2,918 meters, other prominent peaks are also referenced.\n\nA comparison of the highest mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, aside from Olympus, reveals the following:\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** This mountain in central Greece is the highest among the other contenders. The *Iliad* cites ancient communities that were located on it.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest peak on the island of Crete, also known as Psiloritis, stands at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). While the Mount Ida near Troy is more central to the epic's narrative, some sources state that the Cretan Ida is also mentioned.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on a peninsula in northeastern Greece, this mountain has an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet) and is mentioned by Homer in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Situated near the ancient city of Troy (modern-day Turkey), this is the mountain from which the gods most frequently observed the Trojan War. Its highest peak is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** The god Poseidon is said to have watched the Trojan War from the summit of this island mountain, which reaches a height of 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
