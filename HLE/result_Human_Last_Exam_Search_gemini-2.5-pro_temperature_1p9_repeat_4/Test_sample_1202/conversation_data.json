    "After gene duplication, the new gene copy is often redundant. The most common fate for such a duplicate is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization or nonfunctionalization. However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and divergence of both gene copies in a functional state.\n\nComparing the likely mechanisms for retention and divergence:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, leading to homogenization between the duplicate genes. While it can create novel gene variants, its primary effect is often to reduce divergence, making it less of a primary driver for the stable retention of two distinct, diverged genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where one copy becomes non-functional. This leads to the loss of a functional gene, not its retention and divergence as a working gene.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This process involves one gene copy retaining the ancestral function while the other acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation. While this is a significant path for evolutionary innovation, it relies on the rare occurrence of an advantageous mutation creating a new function.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene may have had multiple functions or patterns of expression. After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of these original functions through mutation. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene performed. This process can occur through neutral or slightly deleterious mutations, which are much more common than the beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization. For this reason, subfunctionalization is considered a more probable and common mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes. Some models even suggest subfunctionalization can act as a transitional phase, preserving genes from being lost and giving them time to potentially evolve a new function later (neofunctionalization).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes a macroevolutionary pattern of rapid diversification of a species into many new forms. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for the retention of specific genes.\n\nGiven that subfunctionalization provides a pathway for retaining duplicate genes via more common, neutral mutational events, it is considered the most likely mechanism to be responsible for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
