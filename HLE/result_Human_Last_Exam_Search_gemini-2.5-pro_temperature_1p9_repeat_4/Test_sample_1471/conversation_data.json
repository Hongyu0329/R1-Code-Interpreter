    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the Roman numerals:\n*   **xl** represents 40 (50 - 10).\n*   **mcm** represents 1900 (1000 + 900).\n*   **mcmxc** represents 1990 (1000 + 900 + 90).\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the expression. The expression is written as `xl/mcm-mcmxc`. According to the standard order of operations (often remembered by acronyms like PEMDAS or BODMAS), division is performed before subtraction.\n\nTherefore, the equation in modern numbers is:\n(40 / 1900) - 1990\n\nNow, we calculate the solution:\n1.  First, perform the division: 40 ÷ 1900 = 4/190 = 2/95.\n2.  As a decimal, 2 ÷ 95 is approximately 0.0210526.\n3.  Next, perform the subtraction: 0.0210526 - 1990 = -1989.9789474.\n\nTo give a precise answer, we can work with fractions:\n(2/95) - 1990 = 2/95 - (1990 * 95) / 95 = 2/95 - 189050/95 = -189048/95.\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately -1989.9789.\n\n<<<−189048/95>>>"
