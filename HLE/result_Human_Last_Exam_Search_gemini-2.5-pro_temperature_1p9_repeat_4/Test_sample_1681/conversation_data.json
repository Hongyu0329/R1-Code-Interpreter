    "In the quantum version of the prisoner's dilemma, the classical dilemma can be resolved by utilizing quantum entanglement. To achieve an optimal outcome, the initial state of the two players' qubits is prepared in a maximally entangled state, following the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This entanglement introduces correlations between the players' actions that are not possible in the classical version of the game.\n\nIn the classical form of this game, the dominant strategy for both players is to \"Defect,\" leading to a Nash Equilibrium at the payoff (1,1). This outcome is suboptimal, as both players would be better off with the (Cooperate, Cooperate) payoff of (5,5), but they have no rational incentive to choose cooperation.\n\nWhen the game is played in quantum space with an optimal initial state (a maximally entangled state), the players' strategy sets are expanded. They can now choose from a range of \"quantum strategies,\" which are unitary operations on their respective qubits. In this expanded strategy space, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges. This new equilibrium corresponds to both players selecting a specific quantum strategy, often denoted as 'Q'.\n\nA crucial feature of this quantum game setup is that this new equilibrium is also Pareto optimal. This means that the outcome is the best possible one for both players collectively, from which no player can improve their payoff without diminishing the other's. For the given payoff matrix, the Pareto optimal outcome is (5,5).\n\nWhen players choose their best strategies in this quantum framework, they will select the quantum strategy 'Q'. The resulting equilibrium point is the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium, which yields the payoff of (5,5). At this point, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate, thus resolving the classical dilemma. The ability to use quantum strategies, combined with the initial entanglement, makes mutual cooperation a stable and rational outcome.\n\n<<(5,5)>>>"
