    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles is crucial for their application in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. The optimal ratio is not a single value but rather depends on the specific reaction, catalyst preparation method, and the presence of other promoting elements.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction (CO + H₂O → H₂ + CO₂), the ideal Ni loading on ceria supports varies across different studies, often influenced by the catalyst's structure and the inclusion of other promoters.\n\nSeveral studies point towards an optimal range for the nickel content. For instance, research on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts found that increasing the nickel content from 5 to 12.5 wt% resulted in high CO conversion, with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni demonstrating very similar and high activity. Another study focusing on the reverse WGS reaction identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar. Further supporting a lower to mid-range nickel concentration, it has been shown that even a small addition of 2 wt.% Ni to ceria significantly boosts WGS activity.\n\nSome research indicates that higher nickel concentrations can also be beneficial. In one instance, a catalyst with a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 1:3.5, exhibited high catalytic activity. Similarly, studies on Ni/CeO₂-Al₂O₃ systems showed that increasing the Ni loading from 1 to 8 wt.% enhances the WGS activity. One of the most active catalysts for the high-temperature WGS reaction was a ceria-promoted nickel catalyst on an alumina support with 4% (w/w) Ni and 3% (w/w) CeO₂.\n\nThe preparation method and the form of the support material also play a significant role. For example, Ni-CeO₂ catalysts supported on carbon have demonstrated superior performance compared to bulk Ni/CeO₂. The strong interaction between nickel and the support material is a key factor for catalytic performance.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the context of water splitting, which involves two half-reactions—the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)—the ideal Ni/Ce ratio can differ.\n\nFor the **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)**, a series of NiₓCe₁₀₀₋ₓOₓ catalysts with varying Ni/Ce molar ratios (from 95:5 to 10:90) were synthesized and tested. The results indicated that catalysts with Ni:Ce molar ratios of 75:25 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 50:50 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ) exhibited the highest OER activities. This was attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in these specific compositions. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, showed excellent long-term stability.\n\nFor the **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)**, different optimal ratios have been reported. One study on Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF) provided the best HER performance. In another case involving Ni and Iron (Fe) co-doped ceria, a total dopant concentration of 20 mol% with a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1 was shown to be highly effective for both HER and OER.\n\nAdditionally, the synergy between nickel and ceria, often enhanced by creating specific nanostructures or incorporating other elements, is critical. For example, modifying bimetallic NiFe phosphides with CeO₂ has been shown to create an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting due to the modulated electronic structure and optimized adsorption energies.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both reactions. For the **WGS reaction**, an optimal range for Ni loading appears to be between **2 and 12.5 wt%**, with specific studies pointing to around **7% molar Ni** as a particularly effective concentration. For **water splitting**, the optimal ratio is reaction-specific: for **OER**, a higher nickel content with **Ni:Ce ratios of 75:25 and 50:50** are most effective, while for **HER**, a lower nickel to ceria ratio with a **Ce:Ni molar ratio of 2:1** has shown promising results.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range for Ni loading is generally between 2 and 12.5 wt.%. For water splitting, the optimal ratio for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is around Ni:Ce of 75:25 or 50:50, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), a Ce:Ni molar ratio of 2:1 has been shown to be effective.>>>"
