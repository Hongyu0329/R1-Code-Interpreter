The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range for Ni loading is generally between 2 and 12.5 wt.%. For water splitting, the optimal ratio for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is around Ni:Ce of 75:25 or 50:50, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), a Ce:Ni molar ratio of 2:1 has been shown to be effective.
