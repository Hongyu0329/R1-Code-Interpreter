    "Based on the chemical structure of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum can be determined by identifying all chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\nThe molecule possesses a C3 axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core. This symmetry makes the three large substituent groups chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in the central core and in one of the substituent arms.\n\n1.  **Protons on the Central Core:**\n    *   The three methyl groups (-CH3) on the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These will produce a single signal.\n        *   **1 signal**\n\n2.  **Protons of the Methylene Linkers:**\n    *   The three methylene (-CH2-) groups that link the central ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, each CH2 group is adjacent to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived substituent is chiral). This makes the two protons within each CH2 group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Consequently, these three equivalent CH2 groups will produce two distinct signals. These signals often appear as a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling.\n        *   **2 signals**\n\n3.  **Protons on the (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole Arm:**\n    We can analyze the signals from one of these identical, chiral arms. Published 1H NMR data for highly similar camphor-indazole structures confirm the number of distinct proton environments.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring at the C3 position. This gives one signal.\n        *   **1 signal**\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons:** The `7,8,8-trimethyl` part refers to three methyl groups on the camphor-like framework. Due to the chiral and rigid nature of the bicyclic system, these three methyl groups are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. Each will produce a separate singlet.\n        *   **3 signals**\n    *   **Bicyclic Framework Protons:** This part consists of the saturated bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton fused to the pyrazole ring.\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton:** There is a single proton at the C4 bridgehead position, which gives a unique signal.\n            *   **1 signal**\n        *   **Methylene Protons:** There are two methylene groups (at C5 and C6). In the rigid bicyclic structure, all four of these protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. Each will produce its own signal, typically a complex multiplet.\n            *   **4 signals**\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming up the signals from each part of the molecule:\n*   Central core methyls: 1\n*   Methylene linkers: 2\n*   Pyrazole proton: 1\n*   Substituent methyl groups: 3\n*   Bridgehead proton: 1\n*   Substituent methylene protons: 4\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = **12**\n\nThus, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
