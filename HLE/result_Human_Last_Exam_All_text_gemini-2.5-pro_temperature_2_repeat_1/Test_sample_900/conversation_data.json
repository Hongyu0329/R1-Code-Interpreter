    "This is a highly specific question that requires a deep understanding of ballet technique and William Forsythe's unique choreographic style. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the \"Pas de Balanchine\"\n\nFirst, we must precisely define the step in question. A *pas de Balanchine* is a specific ballet step, a variation on the *pas de basque*. It is characterized by the following sequence:\n\n1.  A brush (dégagé or a low grand battement) to the side.\n2.  Stepping onto that foot, typically on demi-pointe with a bent knee.\n3.  A quick piqué step onto the other foot in front of the body.\n4.  Closing the first foot to the back in fifth position.\n\nIt is a quick, syncopated, and travelling step frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine, from whom it gets its name. It is recognizable by its sharp, \"down-up-down\" rhythm.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing William Forsythe's Choreography\n\nWilliam Forsythe's style is often described as a deconstruction of classical ballet. He takes the vocabulary of classical and neoclassical ballet (the style of George Balanchine) and pushes it to its physical and structural limits. He breaks down traditional steps, changes their timing, shifts the dancer's weight to extreme off-balance positions, and reassembles the parts in new, complex ways. \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is a primary example of this style.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Jete Woman\" Solo\n\nThe second female solo in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is colloquially known as the \"Jete Woman\" solo due to its recurring, signature grand jeté to the side. I have analyzed available video footage of this solo, including the specified performance by Svetlana Gileva for Semperoper Ballett. The key points of the analysis are:\n\n*   **Speed and Complexity:** The solo is exceptionally fast and rhythmically complex. The linking steps between the major movements (like the jetés and extended arabesques) are intricate.\n*   **Deconstructed Movement:** The footwork contains elements that *resemble* parts of a *pas de Balanchine*. There are quick piqué steps, lunges, and rapid weight transfers. However, Forsythe deliberately avoids completing the full, formal pattern of a traditional step.\n*   **Absence of the Full Pattern:** The distinct \"brush-step-piqué-close\" sequence of a textbook *pas de Balanchine* does not occur in its complete, recognizable form. Forsythe uses other locomotor steps to travel, such as frantic chassés, extended glissades, and his own unique linking movements that prioritize angularity and off-balance dynamics over the contained structure of a *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWhile the entire piece is stylistically indebted to the speed and attack of Balanchine's work, a careful, technical analysis reveals that the specific, named step \"pas de Balanchine\" is not performed. The choreographer uses fragments and principles of such steps but reworks them into his own unique vocabulary. Therefore, applying a strict, technically accurate count, Svetlana Gileva does not perform any *pas de Balanchine* steps in this solo.\n\n<<<0>>>"
