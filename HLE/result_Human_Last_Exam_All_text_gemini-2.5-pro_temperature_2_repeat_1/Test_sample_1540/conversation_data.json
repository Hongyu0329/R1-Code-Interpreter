    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem:**\nThe task is to compare two strings lexicographically. The key constraints are:\n*   The comparison must be case-insensitive (e.g., 'a' is equivalent to 'A').\n*   The strings are guaranteed to have the same length.\n*   The string lengths are between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive.\n*   The goal is to write the *most memory-efficient* C program and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n**2. Input Handling Strategy:**\nTo compare the characters of the two strings at each position (e.g., `string1[i]` vs `string2[i]`), we must have both strings available in memory. Reading one character from the first string and one from the second isn't feasible as standard input is processed sequentially (the first line must be read completely before the second).\n*   **Conclusion:** We need to store both input strings in memory.\n*   **Memory Allocation:** The most memory-efficient way to store a C-style string is in a character array. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to accommodate the 100 characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`), which is automatically added by functions like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`.\n*   **Variables for Strings:**\n    *   `char string1[101];` -> `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.\n    *   `char string2[101];` -> `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = 101 bytes.\n    *   **Sub-total:** 101 + 101 = 202 bytes.\n\n**3. Comparison Logic Strategy:**\nThe comparison should proceed character by character from the beginning of the strings. The loop should stop as soon as a difference is found.\n*   We need a loop to iterate through the strings. A `while` or `for` loop is suitable.\n*   This loop requires an index variable to keep track of the current position.\n*   For case-insensitivity, we'll convert each character to a common case (e.g., lowercase using the `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library) before comparing them.\n\n**4. Optimizing the Loop Counter Variable:**\nThe loop index will range from 0 to a maximum of 99 (for a string of length 100).\n*   A standard `int` variable typically uses 4 bytes, which is excessive for a value that never exceeds 99.\n*   To be maximally memory-efficient, we should choose the smallest standard integer type that can hold values from 0 to 99.\n*   An `unsigned char` uses only 1 byte and can represent values from 0 to 255, making it the perfect choice.\n*   **Variable for Loop Counter:**\n    *   `unsigned char i;` -> `sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n\n**5. Avoiding Temporary Variables:**\nTo perform the comparison `tolower(string1[i]) < tolower(string2[i])`, we could store the result of `tolower()` in temporary `char` variables. However, this is not necessary. The function calls can be placed directly within the `if` condition, avoiding the allocation of extra variables on the stack.\n\n**6. Final Memory Calculation (m):**\nSumming the memory allocated for all necessary variables gives us the total memory usage (`m`).\n*   Memory for the first string: 101 bytes.\n*   Memory for the second string: 101 bytes.\n*   Memory for the loop counter: 1 byte.\n*   **Total (m):** 101 + 101 + 1 = 203 bytes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Null Terminator:** When using C-style strings, always allocate one extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` relies on this to know where the string ends.\n2.  **Data Type Sizing:** For maximum memory efficiency, always choose the smallest possible data type that can safely hold the required range of values. Using an `unsigned char` for a loop counter that won't exceed 255 is a key optimization.\n3.  **Library Functions:** Use standard library functions like `tolower()` for correctness and simplicity. They are highly optimized and do not add to the program's static variable memory footprint.\n4.  **Variable Scope:** The question asks for memory used by \"variables\". This refers to the variables you explicitly declare. Local variables, like our loop counter and arrays, are allocated on the stack. Temporary storage used inside library functions is not typically counted as part of your program's declared variables.\n5.  **Early Exit:** The logic should be efficient. As soon as a lexicographical difference is found, the program should print the result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate immediately, without checking the rest of the strings.\n6.  **Equality Case:** If the loop completes without finding any differences, it means the strings are equal, and the program should print `0`.\n\nBy following these steps and careful considerations, we arrive at the most memory-efficient implementation. The total memory `m` used for the variables is the sum of the sizes of the two character arrays and the single-byte loop counter.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nm = (`sizeof(char)` * 101) + (`sizeof(char)` * 101) + `sizeof(unsigned char)`\nm = (1 * 101) + (1 * 101) + 1\nm = 101 + 101 + 1\nm = 203\n\n<<<203>>>"
