    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of a matrix. It provides two pieces of information:\n*   A description of the matrix: \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n*   An explicit definition of the matrix: \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}. \\]\nThe phrasing \"where: A = ...\" indicates that the matrix `A` provided is the specific matrix we need to work with. The descriptive part of the question (\"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver...\") serves as a label or context for matrix `A`. The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be extraneous information, as the matrix `A` is given with constant entries and does not depend on `m`.\n\nTherefore, the core task is to compute the determinant of the matrix `A`.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** It is crucial to recognize that the details about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" are likely red herrings designed to make the problem seem more complex. The calculation should focus only on the explicitly defined matrix `A`.\n*   **Matrix Properties:** Observe the properties of matrix `A`. It is a symmetric 3x3 matrix.\n*   **Choice of Method:** There are several ways to compute a determinant. Choosing an efficient and error-proof method is key. For a 3x3 matrix, one can use the Sarrus' rule, cofactor expansion, or look for properties like linear dependence of rows/columns.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic for any chosen method must be performed carefully to avoid errors.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nWe need to compute det(A) for:\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n**Method 1: Using Linear Dependence of Rows/Columns (Most Efficient)**\n\nA fundamental property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Let's check for this property.\n\n*   Let the row vectors be \\( r_1 = [2, -1, -1] \\), \\( r_2 = [-1, 2, -1] \\), and \\( r_3 = [-1, -1, 2] \\).\n*   Let's sum these row vectors:\n    \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2] \\)\n    \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = [0, 0, 0] \\)\n*   Since there is a non-trivial linear combination of the rows that equals the zero vector (specifically, \\( 1 \\cdot r_1 + 1 \\cdot r_2 + 1 \\cdot r_3 = \\mathbf{0} \\)), the rows are linearly dependent.\n*   Therefore, the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Sarrus' Rule (Direct Calculation)**\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\), the determinant is given by \\( aei + bfg + cdh - gec - hfa - idb \\).\n\nFor matrix A:\n*   a=2, b=-1, c=-1\n*   d=-1, e=2, f=-1\n*   g=-1, h=-1, i=2\n\ndet(A) = \\( (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) - (-1)(2)(-1) - (-1)(-1)(2) - (2)(-1)(-1) \\)\ndet(A) = \\( 8 + (-1) + (-1) - (2) - (2) - (2) \\)\ndet(A) = \\( 8 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 \\)\ndet(A) = \\( 8 - 8 \\)\ndet(A) = \\( 0 \\)\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem asks for the determinant of a specific matrix `A`. While the context provided is complex (mentioning Markov quivers), the matrix is explicitly given. By analyzing the properties of `A`, we find that its rows are linearly dependent, which immediately implies that its determinant is 0. Direct calculation using the Sarrus' rule confirms this result.\n\n<<<0>>>"
