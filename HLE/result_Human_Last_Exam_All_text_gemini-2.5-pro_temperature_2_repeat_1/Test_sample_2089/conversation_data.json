    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, let's break down the core components of the user's query:\n1.  **The film must be Oscar-nominated.** This is a crucial filter that narrows the search from all of cinema history to a more specific list of critically acclaimed films.\n2.  **A character seals his fate.** This implies the action leads to a negative, irreversible outcome, most likely capture or death.\n3.  **The specific action is saying \"Thank you\".** This seemingly innocuous phrase is the trigger for the character's doom. This suggests a context where being recognized or speaking is dangerous.\n4.  **The setting is while boarding or on a bus.** The location is a key visual element of the scene.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Avoiding Common Pitfalls\n*   **Don't confuse it with similar scenes:** There are several famous scenes in cinema where a character's small mistake or verbal slip reveals their identity. A common mistake is to think of:\n    *   ***Inglourious Basterds***: In the tense basement tavern scene, a British spy (posing as a German officer) gives himself away by ordering three drinks using the wrong hand gesture, not by speaking on a bus.\n    *   ***The Great Escape***: An escaping POW, MacDonald, is caught when he instinctively replies \"Good luck\" in English to a suspicious Gestapo agent at a train station. While very similar in concept, the phrase is wrong (\"Good luck,\" not \"Thank you\") and the location is a train station, not a bus.\n*   **Identify the correct character:** The character in question may not be the film's protagonist. In ensemble films or stories with multiple plotlines, this fateful moment could happen to a supporting character.\n*   **Verify the \"Oscar-nominated\" status:** Before settling on an answer, it's essential to confirm that the film received at least one Academy Award nomination in any category.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  We start by considering films that fit the general theme of espionage, pursuit, or hiding under a brutal regime, as these settings make a simple phrase like \"Thank you\" potentially fatal. The WWII films mentioned above (*Inglourious Basterds*, *The Great Escape*) are close but don't match the specific details.\n\n2.  Let's expand the search beyond WWII. We need a film set in a place where being recognized is a death sentence. This leads us to consider films about political thrillers or dictatorships.\n\n3.  The film **The Last King of Scotland (2006)** fits this description.\n    *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes. Forest Whitaker won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.\n    *   **Plot Context:** The film follows a Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who becomes the personal physician to Idi Amin. As Amin's rule becomes more paranoid and violent, anyone who falls out of favor is in grave danger.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Scene:** The scene does not involve the protagonist, Garrigan. It involves his predecessor, the former Health Minister **Jonah Wasswa**.\n    *   Having been replaced and disgraced, Wasswa knows he is a marked man. He attempts to flee Kampala anonymously.\n    *   He boards a crowded public bus, trying to blend in with the other passengers.\n    *   Soldiers loyal to Amin get on the bus to look for him. It seems for a moment they might overlook him.\n    *   However, another passenger on the bus recognizes him and says his name (\"Wasswa\").\n    *   Cornered and on instinct, Wasswa politely replies, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   This verbal confirmation of his identity is all the soldiers need. They immediately seize him and drag him off the bus. We later learn he was brutally murdered, sealing his fate with that single polite phrase.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This scene from *The Last King of Scotland* perfectly matches every detail of the question: an Oscar-nominated film, a character (Jonah Wasswa) who seals his tragic fate, the specific words \"Thank you,\" and the setting of a public bus.\n\n<<<The Last King of Scotland>>>"
