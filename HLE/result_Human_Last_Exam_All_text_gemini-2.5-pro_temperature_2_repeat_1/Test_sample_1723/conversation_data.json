    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the one specific genus of mushroom that is known for producing a distinctly blue spore print. This is a question of mycological classification and identification.\n\n2.  **Understand Key Terms:**\n    *   **Genus:** A taxonomic rank in biology, ranking above species and below family. We are looking for a genus name, like *Amanita* or *Agaricus*, not a species name.\n    *   **Spore Print:** A deposit of a mushroom's spores, created by placing the cap on a surface and letting the spores fall. The color of this deposit is a crucial tool for mushroom identification.\n    *   **Distinctly Blue:** The color of the spore deposit must be blue, not just the flesh of the mushroom or a bruising reaction.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Blue-Staining vs. Blue Spore Print:** Many mushrooms bruise or stain blue when cut or handled. A famous example is the genus *Psilocybe* (magic mushrooms) or the bolete *Gyroporus cyanescens*. This blue color is a chemical reaction (oxidation of compounds like psilocin) in the mushroom's flesh and is entirely different from the color of the spores. The spore print of *Psilocybe* is typically purple-brown, and for *Gyroporus cyanescens*, it's pale yellow.\n    *   **Blue-Colored Mushroom vs. Blue Spore Print:** Some mushrooms are themselves blue in color. The most famous example is *Lactarius indigo*. This mushroom is a vibrant indigo color and even \"bleeds\" a blue latex fluid when cut. However, despite its striking appearance, its spore print is a creamy yellowish color, not blue. This makes it a common incorrect answer.\n\n4.  **Research and Identification:**\n    *   A genuinely blue spore print is exceedingly rare in the fungal kingdom. Standard identification guides primarily list colors like white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, and black.\n    *   Searching for documented cases of blue spore prints leads to a specific group of mushrooms related to the common *Lactarius* genus. Based on molecular studies, the genus *Lactarius* was split, and many species were moved to the re-established genus *Lactifluus*.\n    *   Within this \"new\" genus, *Lactifluus*, there is a species named *Lactifluus virescens*, found in Malaysia. Mycological reports and scientific descriptions of this species confirm that it produces a pale blue to greenish-blue spore deposit.\n    *   As of current scientific knowledge, this appears to be the only confirmed instance of a blue spore print in any mushroom. Therefore, the genus containing this species is the answer.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While several genera contain mushrooms that are blue-colored or stain blue, only one genus is currently known to contain a species that produces a distinctly blue spore print. That genus is *Lactifluus*.\n\n<<<Lactifluus>>>"
