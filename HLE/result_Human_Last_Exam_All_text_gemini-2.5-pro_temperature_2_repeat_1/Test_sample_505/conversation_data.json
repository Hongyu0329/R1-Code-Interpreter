    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Code Logical Qubits:**\n    The number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded on a 2D surface is determined by its topology. The formula for an orientable surface is:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n    where:\n    *   `g` is the **genus** of the surface, which corresponds to the number of \"handles\" (like in a donut or torus).\n    *   `b` is the number of **boundaries** or \"holes\" in the surface.\n\n2.  **Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code:**\n    *   A \"patch\" of surface code is typically implemented on a simple, flat plane. Topologically, a flat plane is equivalent to a disk.\n    *   A disk has no handles, so its genus `g = 0`.\n    *   A standard patch without any internal holes has one boundary: its outer edge. So, `b = 1`. For such a patch, `k = 2*0 + 1 - 1 = 0`. This means a standard, simple patch cannot store a logical qubit; it's typically used for quantum memory of a known state.\n\n3.  **Analyze a Single Patch with Two Holes:**\n    *   We start with one patch of surface code, which has a genus `g = 0`.\n    *   The question states this patch has **two holes** created inside it.\n    *   Each hole creates a new inner boundary.\n    *   The patch itself already has one outer boundary.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of boundaries `b` for one patch is: `1 (outer boundary) + 2 (inner boundaries from the holes) = 3`.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the number of logical qubits (`k_1`) for this single patch:\n        `k_1 = 2g + b - 1`\n        `k_1 = 2*0 + 3 - 1`\n        `k_1 = 2`\n    *   So, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Full System: Two Patches:**\n    *   The question specifies there are **two** such patches.\n    *   Since these are separate patches, they are not topologically connected to each other.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits in the entire system is the sum of the logical qubits from each independent patch.\n    *   Logical qubits from Patch 1 = 2.\n    *   Logical qubits from Patch 2 = 2.\n    *   Total logical qubits (`k_total`) = (Qubits from Patch 1) + (Qubits from Patch 2)\n        `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Genus and Boundaries:** It is crucial not to confuse holes (which are boundaries, `b`) with handles (which define the genus, `g`). Creating a hole in a plane does not increase its genus.\n*   **The `-1` in the Formula:** The formula `2g + b - 1` applies to a single connected topological surface. The `-1` accounts for a global constraint or a shared degree of freedom across the surface. Because we have two separate surfaces, we must apply the formula to each one and then sum the results.\n*   **Separate vs. Connected Patches:** The problem states \"two patches\", implying two independent systems. If they were connected (e.g., by a bridge), they would form a single, more complex surface, and we would need to calculate `g` and `b` for that new combined shape. As separate systems, we can simply add their capacities.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Number of patches = 2.\n*   For each patch:\n    *   Genus `g = 0`.\n    *   Number of holes = 2.\n    *   Total boundaries `b = 1 (outer) + 2 (inner) = 3`.\n    *   Logical qubits per patch = `2g + b - 1 = 2(0) + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n*   Total logical qubits = (qubits per patch) * (number of patches) = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
