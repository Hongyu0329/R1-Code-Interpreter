    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps (like moving on Manhattan streets). Each point has integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n` moves, where each move is from a point to an adjacent point. A walk of `n` steps connects `n+1` points (vertices).\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same vertex more than once. All `n+1` vertices in the path must be distinct.\n*   **a(n):** The function representing the number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of walks for small `n`**\nTo understand the complexity, let's calculate the first few values of a(n). We assume the walk starts at the origin (0,0).\n\n*   **n = 1:** From the origin, there are 4 possible moves: Right, Left, Up, or Down.\n    *   a(1) = 4\n\n*   **n = 2:** For each of the 4 initial walks, the second step cannot go back to the origin. From the end of any 1-step walk, there are 3 possible moves.\n    *   Example: Start (0,0) -> (1,0). From (1,0), possible moves are to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). Moving to (0,0) is forbidden.\n    *   a(2) = (moves for step 1) * (choices for step 2) = 4 * 3 = 12.\n\n*   **n = 3:** For each of the 12 walks of length 2, we add a third step. For any 2-step walk, such as (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) or (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1), the next move cannot immediately create a self-intersection with previously visited points (other than reversing the last step, which is already disallowed). So there are again 3 choices for the third step.\n    *   a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36.\n\n*   **n = 4:** This is where it gets more complex. We cannot simply multiply by 3. A walk can now become long enough to \"bite its own tail\".\n    *   Consider a 3-step walk that forms three sides of a square, for example: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n    *   The vertices visited are (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).\n    *   From the endpoint (0,1), the possible moves are to (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0).\n    *   However, moving to (1,1) is a reversal of the last step, and moving to (0,0) would visit the starting point. Both are forbidden.\n    *   This leaves only 2 valid moves: to (-1,1) or (0,2).\n    *   Other 3-step paths (those that are straighter) still allow 3 valid moves. We must count how many paths of each type exist.\n    *   There are 8 such \"square-forming\" 3-step paths. These give 8 * 2 = 16 paths of length 4.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` paths of length 3 are not configured this way and have 3 valid choices for the next step. These give 28 * 3 = 84 paths of length 4.\n    *   a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100.\n\n**Step 3: Address the challenge for n = 10**\nCalculating a(10) by hand using this method of direct enumeration is computationally infeasible. The number of walk configurations and the case analyses required would be immense. This is a known hard problem in combinatorial mathematics. The values of a(n) for the square lattice have been computed using sophisticated computer algorithms. The question requires recalling or looking up this well-established result.\n\nThe sequence of values is:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Lattice Type:** The question specifies a Manhattan lattice, which is a 2D square lattice. The result would be different for other lattices (e.g., triangular or hexagonal).\n2.  **Definition of n-step:** An n-step walk has a length of `n` edges and `n+1` vertices.\n3.  **Self-Avoiding Condition:** The path cannot cross or touch itself at any vertex. All `n+1` vertices must be unique.\n4.  **Counting Method:** Simple multiplication (like `4 * 3^(n-1)`) fails for `n >= 4` because of the possibility of non-local self-intersections. A proper count requires categorizing walks by their shape or using computational enumeration.\n5.  **Use of Known Results:** For anything beyond a very small `n`, the standard approach is to refer to the known, computationally derived sequence for `a(n)`. This sequence is famously cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001412.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the analysis, the problem is to find the 10th term in the sequence of the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice. This is a known, tabulated value in mathematics and physics. By referring to this established sequence, we find the value for `n=10`.\n\n`a(10) = 44,100`.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
