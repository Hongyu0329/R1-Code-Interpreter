    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*, a member of the Spinosauridae family.\n2.  **Identify the Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the \"lacrimal recess\". This is a specific fossa (depression) located on the lacrimal bone, which is part of the skull, situated in front of the eye socket. The question specifically asks for the number of smaller \"depressions\" *within* this recess.\n3.  **Locate Authoritative Scientific Sources:** To answer a detailed anatomical question about a specific dinosaur species, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes its fossil remains. The holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri* is SMNS 58022, a nearly complete skull. The most comprehensive description of this specimen is in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"The skull of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n4.  **Examine the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors provide a detailed osteological description of the skull. We need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone.\n5.  **Pinpoint the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** The paper states that the lacrimal bone has a large excavation on its outer surface called the antorbital fossa. Within this larger fossa, there is another distinct depression, the lacrimal recess.\n6.  **Count the Depressions within the Lacrimal Recess:** The authors then describe the internal morphology of the lacrimal recess itself. The paper explicitly states: \"The lacrimal recess in turn **contains two large depressions**, a smaller, rounded anterodorsal one and a larger, more elongate posteroventral one. Both depressions are separated by a distinct ridge.\"\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Hierarchy of Depressions:** It is crucial to distinguish between the different levels of depressions on the skull. The lacrimal recess is a depression *within* the larger antorbital fossa. The question is asking about the depressions *within* the lacrimal recess.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies entirely on the anatomical description provided in the peer-reviewed scientific paper that first formally described the skull in detail. This is the most accurate and reliable source of information.\n*   **Specificity:** The anatomical detail is specific to the holotype of *Irritator challengeri* (SMNS 58022). While other spinosaurids may have similar features, the answer is based directly on the description of this particular specimen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the direct description from the primary scientific literature, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains a specific number of smaller depressions. The key paper by Sues et al. (2002) explicitly identifies and counts these features. The lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
