    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We need to identify a specific person based on several key pieces of information:\n    *   They are a physicist.\n    *   They are primarily known for their work in microscopy.\n    *   They discovered an optical effect related to real imagery.\n    *   The initial observation was made accidentally by a custodial worker or technician.\n    *   The object involved in the accidental observation was concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Clues:**\n    *   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\":** This points to a major figure in the history of optical microscopy. Candidates could include Ernst Abbe, Frits Zernike, August Köhler, or Georges Nomarski, among others.\n    *   **\"Discovered an optical effect in real imagery\":** This narrows the field to someone who worked with interference, diffraction, or polarization in a way that creates a new imaging modality. Zernike (phase contrast) and Nomarski (differential interference contrast) are very strong candidates here.\n    *   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\":** This is the most specific and unusual clue. It describes a famous anecdote in the history of optics. We need to find which physicist's discovery is linked to this story.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues:** The unique story of the custodial worker and the concave mirrors is the key to solving the puzzle. Researching this anecdote directly points to one individual.\n    *   The story takes place at the Institut d'Optique Théorique et Appliquée in France after World War II.\n    *   The French government had a surplus of large, high-quality concave mirrors from a cancelled military telescope project.\n    *   A technician or cleaner was tasked with maintaining these mirrors. While cleaning them, this person noticed unusual and colorful interference fringes.\n    *   Curious about this unexpected optical phenomenon, the worker brought it to the attention of a physicist working at the institute.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Physicist:**\n    *   The physicist who investigated this phenomenon was the Polish-French physicist **Georges Nomarski**.\n    *   He realized the interference patterns were not from the cleaning process itself, but were caused by minute imperfections in the mirrors—specifically, a slight wedge-like variation in the thickness of the reflective coating.\n    *   Instead of dismissing this as a flaw, Nomarski had the insight to understand that this effect could be harnessed. He developed a way to intentionally and precisely replicate this effect using a modified Wollaston prism, now known as the **Nomarski prism**.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   **Is he a physicist?** Yes, Georges Nomarski was a physicist.\n    *   **Is he known for microscopy?** Yes, he is famous for inventing Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, often called Nomarski microscopy.\n    *   **Did he discover an optical effect?** Yes, the principle of differential interference contrast.\n    *   **Was it linked to a cleaner and concave mirrors?** Yes, this is the specific origin story of his insight that led to the invention. All the clues perfectly match the story of Georges Nomarski.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
