    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\"**: The first step is to correctly identify the work in question. There are two famous works titled \"Sir Launfal.\" One is a 14th-century Middle English romance attributed to Thomas Chestre. The other is a 19th-century poem, \"The Vision of Sir Launfal,\" by James Russell Lowell. The phrase \"preserved alongside\" strongly suggests a manuscript context, which points to the medieval romance by Thomas Chestre.\n2.  **Understand \"Preserved Alongside\"**: This means the text of *Sir Launfal* is found within the same physical document (a codex or manuscript) as another work. Medieval texts often survive in miscellanies, which are collections of different works bound together.\n3.  **Identify the Manuscript**: The next step is to find the specific manuscript in which Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is preserved. Research shows that this romance survives in only one unique manuscript: **Cotton MS Caligula A.II**, now held in the British Library.\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\"**: The final step is to examine the other contents of the Cotton Caligula A.II manuscript and identify which one fits the description of a \"book of manners\" (also known as a courtesy book). This genre of literature provides instruction on proper etiquette, courtly behavior, and social conduct.\n5.  **Synthesize the Information**: By looking at the table of contents for this manuscript, we can find the specific title of the courtesy book it contains alongside *Sir Launfal* and several other romances.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing the two \"Sir Launfals\"**: It is crucial to focus on the medieval text by Thomas Chestre, not the later poem by Lowell, as only the former exists in a medieval manuscript with other contemporary works.\n*   **Manuscript Uniqueness**: The fact that *Sir Launfal* survives in a single manuscript makes the answer definitive. If it existed in multiple manuscripts, we would have to specify which manuscript was being referred to.\n*   **Genre Identification**: A \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book\" is a specific genre. The identified text must fit the definition of this genreâ€”a work intended to instruct on social conduct.\n*   **Accurate Title**: The title of the book of manners should be identified correctly.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nFollowing the steps above:\n\n1.  We have established that the work is Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal*.\n2.  We have identified its sole manuscript source as **Cotton MS Caligula A.II**.\n3.  Upon examining the contents of this manuscript, we find it contains a collection of Middle English texts, including the romances *Sir Eglamour*, *Emare*, and *Octavian*.\n4.  Crucially, the manuscript also contains a famous example of a medieval book of manners or courtesy book. This text provides detailed instructions on table manners, service in a noble household, and general good conduct.\n5.  The title of this work is **The Boke of Curtasye** (The Book of Courtesy).\n\nTherefore, *Sir Launfal* was preserved alongside *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
