    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Function:** The question starts with the \"generalized pair correlation function\". In the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, this refers to the correlation of fluctuations in the neutron population (or a related quantity like detector counts) between two space-time points, $(\\vec{r}_1, t_1)$ and $(\\vec{r}_2, t_2)$. This function is often written as $G(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)$.\n\n2.  **Incorporate System Properties:** For many theoretical analyses in nuclear engineering, the reactor medium is treated as statistically stationary in time and homogeneous in space. This is a good approximation for a system operating at steady power in a large, uniform core. Under these assumptions, the correlation function only depends on the relative separation in space, $\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1$, and time, $t = t_2 - t_1$. The function can thus be simplified to $G(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n\n3.  **Understand the Transformation:** The question asks for the \"space-time, double Fourier transform\" of this function. This is a mathematical operation that transforms a function from the space-time domain $(\\vec{r}, t)$ to the wavevector-frequency domain $(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n    $\\tilde{G}(\\vec{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d^3\\vec{r} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\, G(\\vec{r}, t) e^{-i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)}$\n\n4.  **Apply the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem:** This fundamental theorem provides the physical meaning of the transformed function. The theorem states that the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of that process. This concept can be generalized to space and time.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Physical Meaning:** The resulting function, $\\tilde{G}(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectral density of the fluctuations' variance (or \"power\"). Specifically, it describes how the power of the neutron noise is distributed across different spatial patterns (described by the wavevector $\\vec{k}$) and different temporal oscillations (described by the frequency $\\omega$).\n\n6.  **Determine the Common Name in the Community:** While other fields of physics (like condensed matter) might call this quantity the \"dynamic structure factor,\" this term is not common in the nuclear criticality community. Instead, the language of **noise analysis** is used.\n    *   The Fourier transform of a time-domain correlation function is called a Power Spectral Density.\n    *   Since the initial \"generalized pair correlation function\" involves two potentially different points ($\\vec{r}_1$ and $\\vec{r}_2$), it is a cross-correlation function.\n    *   The time Fourier transform of a cross-correlation function is specifically called the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n    *   The subsequent spatial Fourier transform yields the wavevector-dependent CPSD. This is the quantity that appears in the fundamental Langevin theory of space-dependent reactor noise.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinction from Transfer Function:** The Power Spectral Density is not the same as the reactor's transfer function. The PSD of the neutron noise is proportional to the *modulus squared* of the transfer function, $|H(\\vec{k}, \\omega)|^2$, multiplied by the PSD of the intrinsic noise source.\n*   **Auto- vs. Cross-Spectrum:** The term **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)** is used for the special case where the correlation is at a single point ($\\vec{r}_1 = \\vec{r}_2$). The **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)** is the more general term for correlation between two different points, which matches the \"generalized pair correlation function.\"\n*   **Terminology:** While \"Power Spectral Density\" is a correct general term, \"Cross-Power Spectral Density\" is more specific and more accurately describes the transform of a correlation function between a *pair* of distinct points. In the literature of reactor noise analysis (e.g., in the works of PÃ¡zsit, Pal, and Williams), this quantity is commonly identified as the Cross-Power Spectral Density.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is the wavevector- and frequency-dependent representation of the correlation between two points. Within the specialized vocabulary of the nuclear criticality and reactor noise community, this quantity is most accurately and commonly known as the Cross-Power Spectral Density.\n\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density>>>"
