    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core of the Question:** The question asks for the total number of times the author describes Otchumyelov's greatcoat. The question's preamble correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic, relating to the character's shifting mentality. Therefore, a \"description\" in this context refers not just to the coat's physical appearance but to any action involving the coat (putting it on, taking it off, wrapping it) that reveals Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n\n2.  **Instance 1: The Introduction:**\n    At the very beginning of the story, Chekov introduces the character and his coat.\n    *   Description: \"...walks the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in a new greatcoat...\"\n    *   Analysis: This first instance establishes the coat as a symbol of his official status and authority. This is the first description.\n\n3.  **Instance 2: First Shift (Towards Servility):**\n    When it is suggested the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's official severity melts away.\n    *   Description: He says it is hot and orders the policeman, \"Take my coat off me, Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   Analysis: This is an action involving the coat that clearly symbolizes his change in attitude. He is literally shedding his symbol of authority to be more conciliatory. This is the second description.\n\n4.  **Instance 3: Second Shift (Reasserting Authority):**\n    The policeman suggests the dog is not the General's after all. Otchumyelov's authoritative stance returns.\n    *   Description: He complains of a chill and orders, \"Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad...\"\n    *   Analysis: He is putting his authority back on. This is the third description.\n\n5.  **Instance 4: Third Shift (Towards Servility again):**\n    Another voice in the crowd says the dog does look like one of the General's. Otchumyelov immediately reverses course.\n    *   Description: He again feels hot and says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   Analysis: He sheds his authority once more in a panic. This is the fourth description.\n\n6.  **Instance 5: Fourth Shift (Reasserting Authority again):**\n    The General's cook arrives and states the dog does not belong to the General.\n    *   Description: Otchumyelov feels the wind again and commands, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   Analysis: His official, severe persona is restored. This is the fifth description.\n\n7.  **Instance 6: The Conclusion:**\n    After the matter is resolved to his satisfaction (learning the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother), Otchumyelov walks away.\n    *   Description: \"...wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him, he walks on...\"\n    *   Analysis: This final action with the coat signifies his restored self-importance and comfort in his authority. It is the sixth and final description.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Definition of \"Description\":** The key is to count not only mentions of the coat but every distinct action involving it that carries symbolic weight.\n*   **Counting Actions:** The count includes the initial state (wearing it), the four on/off actions, and the final action (wrapping it).\n*   **Consistency across Translations:** While wording may vary slightly between English translations, these six key moments involving the greatcoat are central to the story's theme and structure and are present in all faithful versions.\n*   **The total count is not just the number of times he takes it off or puts it on (which is 4), but the total number of symbolic descriptions, which includes the beginning and the end.**\n\nBy counting each of these distinct symbolic descriptions, we arrive at the total.\n\n<<<6>>>"
