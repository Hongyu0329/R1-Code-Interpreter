    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis:\n1.  Deconstruct the problem description to understand the requirements.\n2.  Analyze the provided Java code for correctness against the requirements.\n3.  If the code is incorrect, design a correct and maximally efficient C program.\n4.  Calculate the specific efficiency metrics (`x`: comparisons, `y`: memory) for the optimal C solution.\n5.  Format the final answer as requested.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Deconstruction\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single variable, `x`, is initialized to 0.\n*   **Input:** An integer `n` (number of statements), followed by `n` lines, each containing a single statement. For the efficiency calculation, we assume `n=100`.\n*   **Statements:** There are four possible statements which modify `x`:\n    *   `++X`: Increment `x` by 1.\n    *   `X++`: Increment `x` by 1.\n    *   `--X`: Decrement `x` by 1.\n    *   `X--`: Decrement `x` by 1.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate and print the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Java Program\n\nThe provided Java code is:\n```java\n// ... imports and class definition ...\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner inpt = new Scanner(System.in);\n    int t = inpt.nextInt(); // Reads n\n    int tresult = 0;      // This is x, initialized to 0\n    while (t-- > 0) {\n        String test = inpt.next(); // Reads one statement\n        \n        if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { // Checks for \"++X\"\n            tresult++;\n        }\n        if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { // Checks for \"--X\"\n            tresult--;\n        }  \n    }\n    System.out.println(tresult);\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Careful Points & Flaw Detection:**\n*   The problem states that the operation and variable can be in any order, meaning `X++` and `X--` are valid inputs.\n*   The Java code uses `test.contains(\"++X\")`. Since the input strings are exactly 3 characters long (e.g., \"X++\"), this condition is only true if the input string is exactly `\"++X\"`.\n*   Similarly, `test.contains(\"--X\")` is only true if the input string is exactly `\"--X\"`.\n*   The code **completely fails to handle** the input cases `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`. If the input contains these statements, `tresult` will not be updated, leading to a wrong final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Java program is **incorrect**.\n\n### Step 3: Designing an Efficient C Program\n\nSince the Java program is incorrect, we need to devise an efficient C solution and analyze its performance.\n\n**Careful Points for Efficiency:**\n*   **Fastest Execution (Least Comparisons):** To determine whether to increment or decrement, we must inspect the statement. A key observation is that the increment operations (`++X`, `X++`) always contain a `+`, and decrement operations (`--X`, `X--`) always contain a `-`. Furthermore, the middle character (at index 1) is *always* `+` or `-`. Therefore, we only need to check this single character to make a decision. This minimizes the number of comparisons.\n*   **Least Memory:** To minimize memory, we should:\n    1.  Use the smallest possible data types for variables.\n    2.  Avoid storing all `n` statements in memory at once. We can process them one by one.\n\n**Optimal C Program Logic:**\n1.  Read the integer `n`. Use a `signed char` as `n <= 100` fits within its range [-128, 127].\n2.  Initialize the result variable `x` to 0. A `signed char` is also sufficient for `x`, as its value will be between -100 and 100.\n3.  Loop `n` times.\n4.  In each loop, we don't need to read the whole 3-character string. We only care about the middle character. We can read character by character, discarding the first and third, and only storing the second.\n5.  Check if this character is `'+'`. If so, increment `x`. Otherwise, decrement `x` (since it must be `-`).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Efficiency Metrics (for n=100)\n\n*   **x: Smallest number of character comparisons:**\n    *   The logic described above (`if (middle_char == '+')`) performs exactly **one** character comparison for each statement.\n    *   For 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   This is the theoretical minimum, as we must inspect at least one character to distinguish the two operations.\n    *   So, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **y: Smallest memory size in Bytes:**\n    *   We need variables to hold the state and process the input:\n        1.  A variable for `n` (the number of statements): `signed char n;` -> **1 Byte**.\n        2.  A variable for the result `x`: `signed char x;` -> **1 Byte**.\n        3.  A temporary variable to hold the character being checked: `char op_char;` -> **1 Byte**.\n    *   The total minimum memory required for the program's variables is the sum of these sizes: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` Bytes.\n    *   So, **y = 3**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe required format is `Nx+y` because the Java program is incorrect (`N`).\n*   `x = 100`\n*   `y = 3`\n\nCombining these gives the final answer.\n\n<<<N100+3>>>"
