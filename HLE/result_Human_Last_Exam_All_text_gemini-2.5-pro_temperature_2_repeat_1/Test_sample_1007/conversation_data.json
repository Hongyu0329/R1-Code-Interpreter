    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front in a closed position like fifth) is identical at the beginning and the end of the movement.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** \"Entrechat\" means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding\". It's a vertical jump in which the dancer's legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the total number of crossings or changes of position. An \"Entrechat six\" involves three changes with each leg, for a total of six movements.\n    *   **Key Point:** In entrechats, an **even number** (deux, quatre, six, huit) indicates that the dancer lands in the *same* fifth position from which they started. An odd number (trois, cinq, sept) indicates that the feet are changed, and the dancer usually lands on one foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Since six is an even number, the dancer lands in the same fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step ends in the same position it begins.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   \"Échappé\" means \"escaped move\". The feet jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second or fourth).\n        *   \"Battu\" means \"beaten\". The legs beat against each other as they open.\n        *   \"Changé\" means \"changed\". This is the crucial part. It indicates that when the legs jump back to the closed position (fifth), the foot that was originally in front is now in the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If the step starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position is changed.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble\" or \"join together\". The working leg (e.g., the right leg from the back) brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing simultaneously. In a common version called *assemblé dessus* (over), the working leg lands in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If starting in fifth with the left foot front and performing an *assemblé dessus* with the right leg, the dancer will land in fifth with the right foot in front. The position is changed. While some variations of assemblé might not change feet, the most common forms do.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step generally changes the foot position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide\". It is a traveling step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind\". This specifies that as the second leg closes to fifth position, it moves to the back.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The outcome depends on which leg initiates the glide and in which direction.\n        *   *Scenario 1:* From fifth position with the right foot front, you glide sideways to the right, leading with the right foot. To close *derrière*, the left foot must close behind the right foot. You end up in fifth with the right foot in front (no change).\n        *   *Scenario 2:* From fifth position with the right foot front, you glide sideways to the left, leading with the left (back) foot. To close *derrière*, the right foot must close behind the left foot. You end up in fifth with the left foot in front (a change).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The instruction \"Glissade derrière\" by itself is not enough to guarantee the starting and ending positions are the same. Therefore, it's not a reliable answer.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Action:** This is a complex step similar to a *pas de chat* but with a small circular movement (rond de jambe) of each leg as it is lifted.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer jumps, performs the leg movements, and lands on the first foot, with the second foot closing in the opposite position. If starting with the right foot in front, the step typically finishes with the left foot closing in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The position is changed.\n\n**Final Decision**\nReviewing all the steps, only **Entrechat six** has a definition that intrinsically guarantees the dancer will land in the exact same leg configuration from which they started. This is determined by the rule that even-numbered entrechats do not change feet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
