    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of a line from (1, 1) to (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Inputs\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the coordinates of the central pixel on the line.\n*   **Algorithm:** Bresenham's line algorithm.\n*   **Start Point (x₁, y₁):** (1, 1)\n*   **End Point (x₂, y₂):** (11, 5)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Parameters\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the change in x and y and determine the line's slope characteristics.\n\n*   **Calculate dx:** `dx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10`\n*   **Calculate dy:** `dy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4`\n\n**Careful Point:** We observe that `dx` (10) is greater than `dy` (4), and both are positive. This means the line has a \"gentle\" positive slope (slope is between 0 and 1). In Bresenham's algorithm, this means we will always increment `x` by 1 at each step, and we will decide whether or not to increment `y`.\n\n### Step 3: Run Bresenham's Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating along the major axis (x-axis in this case) and plotting pixels. We use a decision parameter `p` to decide when to increment the minor axis coordinate (y).\n\n1.  **Initial Decision Parameter (p₀):**\n    The formula for the initial decision parameter is `p = 2*dy - dx`.\n    `p₀ = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`\n\n2.  **Initial Pixel:** The first pixel is the starting point **(1, 1)**.\n\n3.  **Iteration Loop:** We will loop `dx` times (10 times) to find the remaining pixels.\n\n    *   **At each step `k` (from 0 to 9):**\n        *   Increment `x`: `xₖ₊₁ = xₖ + 1`.\n        *   Check the decision parameter `pₖ`:\n            *   If `pₖ < 0`, the next point is `(xₖ₊₁, yₖ)`. Update `p` with `pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + 2*dy`.\n            *   If `pₖ ≥ 0`, the next point is `(xₖ₊₁, yₖ + 1)`. Update `p` with `pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + 2*dy - 2*dx`.\n\nLet's trace the algorithm's execution:\n(Constants for updates: `2*dy = 8`, `2*dy - 2*dx = 8 - 20 = -12`)\n\n| k | `pₖ` (Initial) | Condition | Plotted Pixel (x, y) | y Update | `pₖ₊₁` (Updated) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| - | - | - | **(1, 1)** | - | `p₀ = -2` |\n| 0 | -2 | `p < 0` | **(2, 1)** | y stays 1 | `-2 + 8 = 6` |\n| 1 | 6 | `p ≥ 0` | **(3, 2)** | `y = 1 + 1 = 2` | `6 - 12 = -6` |\n| 2 | -6 | `p < 0` | **(4, 2)** | y stays 2 | `-6 + 8 = 2` |\n| 3 | 2 | `p ≥ 0` | **(5, 3)** | `y = 2 + 1 = 3` | `2 - 12 = -10` |\n| 4 | -10 | `p < 0` | **(6, 3)** | y stays 3 | `-10 + 8 = -2` |\n| 5 | -2 | `p < 0` | **(7, 3)** | y stays 3 | `-2 + 8 = 6` |\n| 6 | 6 | `p ≥ 0` | **(8, 4)** | `y = 3 + 1 = 4` | `6 - 12 = -6` |\n| 7 | -6 | `p < 0` | **(9, 4)** | y stays 4 | `-6 + 8 = 2` |\n| 8 | 2 | `p ≥ 0` | **(10, 5)** | `y = 4 + 1 = 5` | `2 - 12 = -10` |\n| 9 | -10 | `p < 0` | **(11, 5)** | y stays 5 | `-10 + 8 = -2` |\n\nThe loop stops here, as we have plotted the pixel for `x = 11`.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Central Pixel\n\nWe have the complete list of pixels that form the line.\n\n**Careful Point:** We need to find the total number of pixels to locate the middle one. The number of pixels is `dx + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`.\n\nThe list of pixels is:\n1.  (1, 1)\n2.  (2, 1)\n3.  (3, 2)\n4.  (4, 2)\n5.  (5, 3)\n6.  **(6, 3)**\n7.  (7, 3)\n8.  (8, 4)\n9.  (9, 4)\n10. (10, 5)\n11. (11, 5)\n\nWith 11 pixels, the central pixel is the `(11 + 1) / 2 = 6th` pixel in the sequence.\n\nLooking at our generated list, the 6th pixel is **(6, 3)**.\n\n### Verification (Alternative Method)\n\nWe can find the geometric midpoint of the line segment:\n*   Midpoint `x = (x₁ + x₂) / 2 = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6`\n*   Midpoint `y = (y₁ + y₂) / 2 = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3`\n\nThe geometric midpoint is (6, 3). Since the coordinates are integers, this point corresponds exactly to a pixel on the grid. This pixel must be part of the line drawn by Bresenham's algorithm and will be the central pixel. This confirms our result from the step-by-step trace.\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
