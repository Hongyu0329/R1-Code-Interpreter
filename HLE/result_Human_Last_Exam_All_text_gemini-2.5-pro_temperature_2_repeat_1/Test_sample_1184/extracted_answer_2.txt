**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit and form the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP), which is the primary docking site for the alpha-1 subunit. The positions refer to the canonical human CACNB1 isoform (UniProt: P54283-1).

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are critical for the specific modulatory effects of the beta-1 subunit on channel kinetics and voltage-dependence, acting through mechanisms distinct from the primary binding event.

*   **N-terminal Domain:** This region is crucial for modulating the rate of channel inactivation. A key functional hotspot is:
    *   **Tyrosine 9 (Y9)**
*   **SH3 Domain:** This domain contributes to allosteric modulation of the channel complex. A critical residue on its canonical ligand-binding surface is:
    *   **Tryptophan 164 (W164)**
