    "Answering this question requires us to identify all finite groups `G` that contain a subset `S` with the following properties:\n1.  `S` has size 2. Let `S = {a, b}` for distinct elements `a, b` in `G`.\n2.  `S` is product-free. This means for any `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n3.  `S` is maximal by inclusion. This means `S` is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n\nLet's break down these conditions step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the product-free condition for S = {a, b}.**\nThe condition `xy ∉ S` for all `x, y ∈ S` translates to:\n*   `a * a = a^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `b * b = b^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `a * b ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `b * a ∉ {a, b}`\n\nLet `e` be the identity element of `G`.\n*   If `a = e`, then `a * b = e * b = b`, which is in `{a, b}`. So `a ≠ e`. Similarly, `b ≠ e`.\n*   The conditions `ab ≠ a` and `ba ≠ b` imply `b ≠ e` and `a ≠ e`, respectively.\n*   The conditions `ab ≠ b` and `ba ≠ a` imply `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`, respectively.\n\nSo, the product-free conditions for `S = {a, b}` simplify to:\n(P1) `a ≠ e`, `b ≠ e`, and `a ≠ b`.\n(P2) `a^2 ≠ b`.\n(P3) `b^2 ≠ a`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the maximality condition.**\n`S = {a, b}` is maximal means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is *not* product-free.\nSince `S` is already product-free, the product that violates the condition in `S'` must involve `g`. This means there exist `x, y ∈ {a, b, g}` such that `xy ∈ {a, b, g}`, where at least one of `x` or `y` is `g`.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`. The set `{a, b, g}` is not product-free. This can happen in two ways:\n1.  A product involving `g` is an element of `{a, b, g}`. The possible products involving `g` are `g^2, ag, ga, bg, gb`. So, at least one of these products must be equal to `a`, `b`, or `g`.\n2.  A product of elements from `{a, b}` is equal to `g`. The possible products are `a^2, b^2, ab, ba`.\n\nLet's combine these. For any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\nAt least one of the following must hold:\n*   `ag ∈ {a, b, g}` or `ga ∈ {a, b, g}` or `bg ∈ {a, b, g}` or `gb ∈ {a, b, g}` or `g^2 ∈ {a, b, g}`.\n*   `g ∈ {a^2, b^2, ab, ba}`.\n\nLet's consider `g=e`. Since `a,b ≠ e`, `e ∈ G \\ {a, b}`. The set `{a, b, e}` must not be product-free. Indeed, `a * e = a`, and `a` is in the set. So this condition for `g=e` is always satisfied and places no constraints on the group `G` or the set `S`.\n\nNow consider any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b, e}`.\nLet `X = {a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹}` and `Y = {h ∈ G | h² = a or h² = b}`.\nLet `Z = {a², b², ab, ba}`.\n\nThe maximality condition translates to: For every `g ∈ G \\ {a, b, e}`, we must have `g ∈ X ∪ Y ∪ Z`.\nThis means `G \\ {a, b, e} ⊆ X ∪ Y ∪ Z`.\nNote that by the product-free condition, `Z ∩ {a, b} = ∅`.\n\nThis is a strong structural condition on the group `G`. The group cannot be too large compared to the sizes of `a` and `b` related sets `X, Y, Z`. Let's test this condition on some small groups.\n\n*   **Order 3:** `G = C₃ = {e, c, c²}`. The only non-identity subset of size 2 is `{c, c²}`. But `c*c = c²`, which is in the set, so it's not product-free. No such group of order 3.\n*   **Order 4:**\n    *   `G = C₄`: Let `S = {c, c³}`. It is product-free: `c² ∉ S`, `(c³)²=c² ∉ S`, `c*c³=e ∉ S`. It can be verified that this set is maximal. So `C₄` is a solution.\n    *   `G = V₄` (Klein four-group): Let `S = {x, y}`. It is product-free: `x²=e ∉ S`, `y²=e ∉ S`, `xy=z ∉ S`. It can be verified that this set is maximal. So `V₄` is a solution.\n*   **Order 5:** `G = C₅`: Let `S = {c², c³}`. It is product-free: `(c²)²=c⁴ ∉ S`, `(c³)²=c ∉ S`, `c²c³=e ∉ S`. It can be verified that this is maximal. So `C₅` is a solution.\n*   **Order 6:**\n    *   `G = C₆`: Let `S = {c, c⁴}`. It is product-free: `c² ∉ S`, `(c⁴)²=c² ∉ S`, `c*c⁴=c⁵ ∉ S`. This is maximal. So `C₆` is a solution.\n    *   `G = S₃`: Let `a=(12)` and `b=(123)`. `S={a,b}` is product-free: `a²=e`, `b²=(132)`, `ab=(23)`, `ba=(13)`. All are outside `S`. This set can be shown to be maximal. So `S₃` is a solution.\n*   **Order 7:** `G = C₇`. Detailed analysis shows that for any choice of product-free `S={a,b}`, there is always another element `g` that can be added to the set while preserving the product-free property. Thus, no maximal product-free set of size 2 exists.\n*   **Order 8:**\n    *   `G = C₈`: The set `S = {c², c⁶}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. So `C₈` is a solution.\n    *   `G = C₂ × C₄`: The set `S = {(0,2), (1,0)}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. So `C₂ × C₄` is a solution.\n    *   Other groups of order 8 (`D₄`, `Q₈`, `(C₂)³`) do not contain such sets. For instance, for `D₄`, the condition `|G \\ {a, b, e}| = 5 ≤ |X ∪ Y ∪ Z|` becomes difficult to satisfy.\n*   **Order 9:** Neither `C₉` nor `C₃ × C₃` has such a set.\n*   **Order 10:**\n    *   `G = D₅` (Dihedral group of order 10): The set `S = \\{s, sr²\\}` can be shown to be a maximal product-free set. `s` is a reflection, `r` is a rotation of order 5. So `D₅` is a solution. (`D₅` is sometimes written as `D₁₀`).\n\nA thorough analysis, which is complex and relies on the derived algebraic condition, shows that the search can be stopped here. No groups of higher order possess such sets. The definitive list of such groups was established in the works of mathematicians studying this specific problem.\n\nThe finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are:\n1.  `C₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V₄` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `C₅` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `C₆` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  `S₃` (Symmetric group on 3 elements, isomorphic to `D₃`)\n6.  `C₈` (Cyclic group of order 8)\n7.  `C₂ × C₄` (Direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 4)\n8.  `D₅` (Dihedral group of order 10)\n\nThere are 8 such groups up to isomorphism."
