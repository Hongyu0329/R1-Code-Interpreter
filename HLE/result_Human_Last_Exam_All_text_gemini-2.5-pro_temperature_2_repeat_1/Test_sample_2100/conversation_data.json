    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n*   **Clue 2:** Voznesensky also wrote a famous line about him: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n*   **Clue 3:** The location of his grave (the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question) became known in the late 1980s.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Source of the Quotes**\n\n*   Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Soviet and Russian poet. We need to find a work by him that features these lines or sentiments about a specific historical figure.\n*   The poignant question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" is a direct quote from the epilogue of Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (1970).\n*   This poem formed the libretto for the immensely popular Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (premiered in 1981). The opera's success brought renewed fame to its protagonist.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Man from the Poem/Opera**\n\n*   The protagonist of both \"Avos!\" and \"Juno and Avos\" is the historical figure Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n*   Rezanov (1764-1807) was a Russian nobleman, statesman, and explorer. He led an expedition around the world on the ships \"Juno\" and \"Avos\" to establish relations between the Russian-American Company and Spanish California.\n*   The phrase \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is a fitting poetic description for Voznesensky's portrayal of Rezanov, who found unexpected love (joy) with Concepción Argüello in California during his voyage.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Final Clue about the Grave**\n\n*   Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried there, and a monument was erected.\n*   However, during the Soviet era, the cemetery was destroyed, and the exact location of his grave was lost. For many decades, Voznesensky's question, \"Where is your grave...?\", was literally true.\n*   Fueled by the massive popularity of the rock opera in the 1980s, public interest surged. A campaign began in Krasnoyarsk to locate the lost grave.\n*   This fits the clue perfectly: the \"answer\" to the location of his grave began to emerge precisely in the late 1980s as a result of these efforts, culminating in the erection of a new monument on the supposed burial site.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll clues point to the Russian statesman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
