    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the current word and its origin.**\nThe current Modern English word is \"sister\". Its origin lies in the Old Norse word \"systir\". It was borrowed into Old English during the period of Viking invasions and settlement, gradually replacing the native Anglo-Saxon term.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.**\nThe native Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweostor\". This word shares the same Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr) as the Old Norse \"systir\", which is why they look similar. Cognates in other Germanic languages, like German \"Schwester\" and Dutch \"zuster\", also descend from this common ancestor and evolved from their own native forms, not from Norse borrowings.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expected sound changes from Old English \"sweostor\" to Modern English.**\nIf the word \"sweostor\" had not been replaced, it would have undergone the natural sound changes that occurred in the English language over the centuries. We can predict its modern form by looking at how similar words evolved.\n\n*   **The \"sw-\" start:** The initial \"sw\" consonant cluster generally survives into Modern English. For example, Old English \"swān\" became \"swan\", and \"swimman\" became \"swim\". So, the word would likely still begin with \"sw-\".\n*   **The \"-eo-\" vowel:** The Old English short diphthong \"eo\" typically smoothed into a short \"e\" /ɛ/ (as in \"bed\") during the Middle English period. For example, Old English \"heorte\" became Middle English \"herte\" (Modern English \"heart\", which underwent a later change) and Old English \"eorþe\" became Middle English \"erthe\" (Modern English \"earth\"). Thus, \"sweostor\" would likely have become \"swester\" in Middle English.\n*   **The \"-or\" ending:** In unstressed final syllables, Old English \"-or\" consistently became \"-er\" in Middle English. This is seen in very common words:\n    *   OE *brōþor* -> ModE *brother*\n    *   OE *mōdor* -> ModE *mother*\n    *   OE *fæder* -> ModE *father* (from a different ending, but showing the same principle of reduction to /-ər/).\n    Following this pattern, \"sweostor\" would become \"swester\".\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Great Vowel Shift.**\nThe Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700) primarily affected long vowels. The vowel in our hypothetical Middle English word \"swester\" is a short \"e\" /ɛ/ because it is in a \"closed syllable\" (followed by two consonants, \"-st-\"). Short vowels in closed syllables were generally not affected by the shift. For example, \"bed\", \"help\", and \"left\" retain their short \"e\" sound from Middle English. Therefore, the pronunciation would remain as /'swɛstər/.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final form.**\nBased on the predictable path of linguistic evolution, the Old English word \"sweostor\" would have first become \"swester\" in Middle English and then retained that spelling and pronunciation into the modern day. This word, \"swester\", did exist in some English dialects but was eventually outcompeted by the Norse-derived \"sister\".\n\nTherefore, if the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be derived from the original Old English \"sweostor\".\n\n<<<swester>>>"
