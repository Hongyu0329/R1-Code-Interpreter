    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the dance where a specific figure, the \"Reverse Turn,\" cannot be \"overturned\" (turned more than the standard amount) without fundamentally violating the established technique of that dance.\n\n2.  **Define \"Reverse Turn\":** A Reverse Turn is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that involves a turn to the left. The exact mechanics, timing, and amount of turn vary significantly between dances.\n\n3.  **Define \"Overturning\":** This means to intentionally turn more than the standard, prescribed amount for the figure. This is often done at corners of the ballroom or for choreographic effect.\n\n4.  **Analyze each dance choice in relation to overturning a Reverse Turn:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The Viennese Waltz Reverse Turn is a continuously rotating figure. The standard is a full 360-degree turn over six steps. However, it is common and technically acceptable for advanced dancers to turn slightly more or less than 360 degrees to navigate the floor (floorcraft), especially when approaching a corner. This does not violate the core technique of continuous rotation and pendulum swing.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** The standard Reverse Turn in the Waltz covers 3/4 of a turn over six steps. An \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a named, recognized variation in advanced syllabi. This variation allows dancers to turn more than the standard amount, typically to navigate a corner. It uses the same fundamental techniques of swing, sway, rise and fall, and footwork, simply applied to generate more rotation. Therefore, it is possible without disregarding the technique.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** The Reverse Turn in Foxtrot is a cornerstone figure known for its continuous, flowing movement. Just like in the Waltz, an \"Overturned\" version of the Reverse Turn is a recognized and standard variation for advanced dancers. The core principles of CBM (Contrary Body Movement), body swing, and continuous travel are maintained; they are simply used to produce a greater degree of turn.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This dance is fast and energetic. Figures like the Reverse Turn and Reverse Pivot are often overturned. In fact, due to the speed and momentum of the dance, being able to modify the amount of turn in figures is a crucial part of advanced Quickstep floorcraft. It is done without violating the bounce action and light, quick character of the dance.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** This is the critical case. Tango technique is fundamentally different from the other four \"swing\" dances. Tango is characterized by a staccato (sharp, clipped) action, no rise and fall, and no body swing. The movement is meant to be direct and grounded. A Tango Reverse Turn (e.g., the Open Reverse Turn, Lady Outside) has a very specific, limited amount of turn achieved through sharp pivots and precise foot placements, ending with a collected step (e.g., closing the feet on QQ**S**). To \"overturn\" this figure, a dancer would need to introduce continuous rotation and momentum. This action is, by definition, **swing**, which is the very thing Tango technique explicitly forbids. Adding this continuous swing would fundamentally violate the staccato character, the footwork, and the entire technical basis of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn *without disregarding the technique*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile overturning turns is a standard technical variation in the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) to navigate the floor, doing so in Tango would require incorporating swing and continuous momentum, which are in direct contradiction to the fundamental staccato technique of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
