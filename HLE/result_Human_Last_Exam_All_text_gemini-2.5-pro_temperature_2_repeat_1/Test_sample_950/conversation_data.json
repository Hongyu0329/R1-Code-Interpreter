    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Space and the Mathematical Object\n\nThe question asks about the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is known as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ or $Gr(3, \\mathbb{R}^5)$. It consists of all 3-dimensional linear subspaces of the 5-dimensional real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nThe mathematical object we need to analyze is the **integral cohomology ring** of this space, denoted by $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. This is a graded ring, which is also an abelian group under addition. The additive group structure is given by the direct sum of cohomology groups at each degree:\n$R = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^{\\infty} H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Specific Question\n\nThe question asks for the **rank** of the **torsion subgroup** of this ring.\n\nLet's break this down:\n1.  **Torsion Subgroup**: For any abelian group $A$, its torsion subgroup $T(A)$ is the set of all elements of $A$ that have finite order. The group we are considering is the additive group of the cohomology ring, $R$. Its torsion subgroup is $T(R) = \\text{Tors}(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. This is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group: $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{k \\geq 0} \\text{Tors}(H^k(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n2.  **Rank**: The rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a finitely generated abelian group, which decomposes as $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$ (where $T$ is the finite torsion part), the rank is the integer $r$. This corresponds to the size of a maximal linearly independent subset of the group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Properties of the Torsion Subgroup\n\nThe group we are asked to find the rank of is $T(R) = \\text{Tors}(H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. By its very definition, every element in $T(R)$ has a finite order. An abelian group in which every element has finite order is called a **torsion group**.\n\nSo, the question is equivalent to asking for the rank of a torsion group.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Rank of a Torsion Group\n\nLet $G$ be any torsion abelian group. To find its rank, we compute the dimension of $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary simple tensor $g \\otimes q$ in $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$, where $g \\in G$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $g$ is an element of a torsion group, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $ng = 0$ (where $ng$ means $g$ added to itself $n$ times).\nWe can write the rational number $q$ as $q = \\frac{n \\cdot q}{n}$. Now, we use the properties of the tensor product:\n$g \\otimes q = g \\otimes \\left(\\frac{nq}{n}\\right) = g \\otimes \\left(n \\cdot \\frac{q}{n}\\right) = (n \\cdot g) \\otimes \\frac{q}{n}$\nSince $ng=0$, this becomes:\n$0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0$.\n\nThis shows that every element in $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is zero. Therefore, $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space. The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.\n\nThus, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\n### Step 5: Verify that the Question is Well-Posed\n\nFor the question to be meaningful, we should check that the torsion subgroup of $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is well-defined and exists. It is a known fact from algebraic topology that the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians can have torsion.\nMore specifically:\n*   The Grassmannian $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a compact manifold of dimension $k(n-k)$. For $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the dimension is $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n*   $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even, or if $k$ and $n-k$ are both odd. Here, $n=5$ is odd, $k=3$ is odd, but $n-k=2$ is even. Thus, $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is a non-orientable manifold.\n*   For any compact, connected, non-orientable $D$-dimensional manifold $M$, the top integral cohomology group is $H^D(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   Therefore, $H^6(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis confirms that the torsion subgroup is non-trivial. It contains at least one non-zero element.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nThe object of interest is the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This is a torsion group. The rank of any torsion group is, by definition, 0. The specific details of the space $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ are only necessary to confirm that torsion exists, but they do not alter the value of the rank of the torsion subgroup itself.\n\nThe rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
