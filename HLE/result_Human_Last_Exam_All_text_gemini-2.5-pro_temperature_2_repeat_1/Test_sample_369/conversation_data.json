    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Write out the line and identify syllables:**\n    ver-um u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.\n\n2.  **Identify and apply Elisions:** Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\". The first syllable is effectively dropped or merged. This line has a chain of elisions at the start.\n    *   `verum ubi`: `verum` ends in `-um`, `ubi` starts with `u-`. The syllable `-rum` is elided. Scans as `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `ubi equi`: `ubi` ends in `-i`, `equi` starts with `e-`. The syllable `-bi` is elided. Scans as `ub(i) equi`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: `atque` ends in `-e`, `hominis` starts with `h-` + vowel. The syllable `-que` is elided. Scans as `atqu(e) hominis`.\n\n3.  **Determine Vowel Quantities (Long/Short):**\n    *   A vowel is long by nature (e.g., ē, ā) or if it's a diphthong (e.g., ae, au).\n    *   A vowel is long by position if it is followed by two or more consonants (including `x` and `z`).\n    *   A vowel is short if followed by another vowel or if it is short by nature and not made long by position.\n\n    Here are the key quantities for this line:\n    *   `vērum`: `ē` is long.\n    *   `ĕquĭ`: Both vowels are short in the genitive case (\"of the horse\").\n    *   `hŏmĭnis`: All vowels are short. However, the final syllable `-nis` becomes long by position because it is followed by the `c` of `casu`.\n    *   `cāsū`: Both `ā` and `ū` are long.\n    *   `convēnit`: The `ē` is long. The syllable `con-` is long by position (before `nv`).\n    *   `imāgō`: The `ā` is long. The final `-o` is considered long by rule (`brevis in longo`).\n\n4.  **Scan the Line Foot by Foot (from 1 to 6):**\n    A dactyl is a long syllable followed by two shorts (— U U), represented by \"D\".\n    A spondee is two long syllables (— —), represented by \"S\".\n    The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl. The sixth is always a spondee.\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `vērum ub(i) e(qui)`\n        The foot is formed from the chain elision. We take `vē-` from `verum` (long), `u-` from `ubi` (short), and `e-` from `equi` (short). This forms `— U U`.\n        Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 2:** `qui at(que)`\n        This foot starts with `-qui` from `equi` (short) and `at-` from `atque` (long by position). This would be `U —`. To fit the meter, a poetic license called **ictus** is used, where the metrical stress on the first syllable of the foot lengthens the short `i` in `qui`. So we scan `quī at-`, which is `— —`.\n        Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 3:** `hominis`\n        The syllables of `hominis` are `ho` (short), `mi` (short), `nis` (short vowel, but followed by `c` of `casu`, so long by position). This gives `U U —`. To make a dactyl, another **ictus** is applied to the first syllable `ho-`, lengthening it. This gives `hō-mi-nis`, or `— U U`.\n        Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 4:** `cāsū`\n        The two syllables of `casu` are `cā-` (long) and `-sū` (long). This forms `— —`.\n        Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 5:** `convēnit i(mago)`\n        The syllables are `con-` (long by position), `-vē-` (long by nature), `-nit` (short), and the first syllable `i-` from `imago` (short). The foot is formed from the last three: `-vē-nit i-`, which is `— U U`.\n        Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 6:** `māgō`\n        The remaining two syllables are `-mā-` (long) and `-gō` (long by rule at the end of the line). This forms `— —`.\n        Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\n### Final Scansion\nCombining the feet gives the following pattern:\nDactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
