    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n**Step 1: Interpreting the question**\n\nThe question asks for \"the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\". In the context of algebraic groups, this is standardly interpreted as finding the number of distinct **conjugacy classes** of such tori under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. A maximal torus $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, i.e., it is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$. Two such tori, $T_1$ and $T_2$, are considered equivalent if there exists an element $g \\in G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $T_2 = gT_1g^{-1}$. We are looking for the number of these equivalence classes.\n\n**Step 2: The connection between maximal tori and the Weyl group**\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields connects the classification of rational maximal tori to the structure of the group's Weyl group. The theorem states:\n\n*The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is equal to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.*\n\nHere, $F$ represents the automorphism of the Weyl group $W$ induced by the Frobenius endomorphism of $G$. An $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ is the set $\\{g w F(g)^{-1} \\mid g \\in W\\}$.\n\n**Careful point:** The structure of these classes depends on the action of the Frobenius map on the Weyl group. This action is determined by how the Frobenius permutes the simple roots of the group, which is trivial if and only if the group is *split* over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the group $G$ of type $E_8$**\n\nThe group $G$ is specified to be of type $E_8$. To understand the Frobenius action, we need to determine if $G$ is split or a twisted form.\n\n1.  The possible twisted forms of a simple algebraic group are related to the symmetries of its Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group.\n2.  This implies that any group of type $E_8$ over any field is of \"inner type\".\n3.  A theorem of Lang, generalized by Steinberg, states that over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, any two groups that are inner forms of each other are isomorphic.\n4.  Since the split group of type $E_8$ exists over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, any other group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be isomorphic to it.\n\nTherefore, the group $G$ in question is, up to isomorphism, the unique **split** group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Careful point:** For split groups, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the basis of simple roots. Consequently, the induced automorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is the identity map, i.e., $F(g) = g$ for all $g \\in W$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the counting problem**\n\nWith $F$ being the identity automorphism on $W$, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies. An $F$-conjugacy class of $w \\in W$ becomes the set:\n$\\{g w F(g)^{-1} \\mid g \\in W\\} = \\{g w g^{-1} \\mid g \\in W\\}$.\nThis is simply the ordinary conjugacy class of $w$ in the group $W$.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the number of standard conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$**\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of a finite Weyl group is a well-known result from the theory of reflection groups and combinatorics. These numbers are tabulated in standard literature on the subject. For the exceptional Weyl groups, the numbers of conjugacy classes are:\n\n*   $W(G_2)$: 6\n*   $W(F_4)$: 25\n*   $W(E_6)$: 25\n*   $W(E_7)$: 60\n*   $W(E_8)$: 112\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\n**Careful point:** This number is a constant and does not depend on the characteristic of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ or the value of $q$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
