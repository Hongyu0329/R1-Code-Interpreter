    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\nThe number of primitive functions depends on the atom in question. We will analyze the two general cases: a second-row \"heavy\" atom (like Carbon) and a Hydrogen atom. The question, being general, is most commonly interpreted as asking for the heavy atom case, as it utilizes more features of the specified basis set.\n\n### Analysis of a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)\n\nFor a second-row atom like Carbon (1s²2s²2p²), the core is the 1s orbital, and the valence shell consists of the 2s and 2p orbitals.\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Core Shell description (`6-`)**\n    *   The `6` in `6-311G**` indicates that the core atomic orbital (the 1s orbital for Carbon) is described by a single contracted Gaussian function.\n    *   This single contracted function is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions of s-type.\n    *   **Careful Point:** These 6 primitives only contribute to the core s-orbital.\n    *   *Contribution*: **6** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Valence Shell description (`-311G`)**\n    *   The `311` describes the valence shell (the 2s and 2p orbitals). It's a triple-zeta basis, meaning each valence orbital is represented by three separate basis functions.\n    *   The first basis function is a contracted function composed of **3** primitives.\n    *   The second basis function is an uncontracted function, meaning it is a single primitive (**1** primitive).\n    *   The third basis function is also an uncontracted function, i.e., a single primitive (**1** primitive).\n    *   **Careful Point:** In Pople-style basis sets (like this one), the primitive Gaussian exponents for the valence s- and p-orbitals are shared. This means the `311` split applies to both the 2s and 2p primitives.\n    *   *Contribution for 2s*: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   *Contribution for 2p*: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** p-type primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Polarization Function description (`**`)**\n    *   The `**` indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all heavy atoms (i.e., non-hydrogen atoms).\n    *   This set is uncontracted, consisting of a single primitive Gaussian for each function. The standard is to use **6** Cartesian d-functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The second `*` applies only to Hydrogen atoms and is therefore not considered for the heavy atom case.\n    *   *Contribution*: **6** d-type primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **Step 4: Sum all primitives for the heavy atom**\n    *   Total primitives = (Core s-primitives) + (Valence s-primitives) + (Valence p-primitives) + (Polarization d-primitives)\n    *   Total = 6 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 22.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis for a Hydrogen Atom (H)\n\nFor completeness, let's analyze the simpler case of a Hydrogen atom (1s¹).\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Core Shell description (`6-`)**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. This part of the basis set name does not apply.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Valence Shell description (`-311G`)**\n    *   The 1s orbital of hydrogen is its valence orbital. It is described by the `311` split.\n    *   This means it is represented by 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   *Contribution*: **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Polarization Function description (`**`)**\n    *   The second `*` in `**` adds a set of p-type polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms.\n    *   This set is uncontracted and consists of **3** p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    *   *Contribution*: **3** p-type primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **Step 4: Sum all primitives for the hydrogen atom**\n    *   Total primitives = (Valence s-primitives) + (Polarization p-primitives)\n    *   Total = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the number of primitive Gaussians in \"a 6-311G** basis set\". Without specifying an atom, the most complete and standard interpretation refers to a second-row heavy atom, for which the answer is 22.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{22}$.\n<<<22>>>"
