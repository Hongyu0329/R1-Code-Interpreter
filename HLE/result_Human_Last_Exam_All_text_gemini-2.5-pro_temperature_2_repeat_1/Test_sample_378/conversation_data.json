    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for a specific year when the former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, began to publicly use the name \"Azikiwe\". The phrasing \"publicly identify himself as\" suggests an event, a change, or an announcement where he added this name to his public persona.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Fact-Checking:** The first step is to establish the subject's full legal name.\n    *   Full Name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    *   This research confirms that \"Azikiwe\" is not a name he adopted or added later in life. It is part of his given name from birth.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Premise of the Question:** The question is based on a false premise. It assumes that \"Azikiwe\" was a name he chose to start using at some point during his public life. Since it has always been part of his name, there was no single event or year where he \"began\" to identify with it.\n\n4.  **Identify the Source of Confusion:**\n    *   **Common Usage:** In media and casual conversation, he is most often referred to as \"Goodluck Jonathan.\"\n    *   **Full Name vs. Shortened Name:** It is very common for public figures with multiple names to be known by a shortened version. The infrequent use of his full name, \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" might lead someone to believe that \"Ebele\" and \"Azikiwe\" were either added later or are unused middle names.\n\n5.  **Address \"Publicly Identify\":** While there was no year he *started* using the name, we can consider when his full name became part of the public record in a significant way. His political career is the key.\n    *   **Entry into Politics:** Goodluck Jonathan became the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State in 1999.\n    *   **Official Records:** From 1999 onwards, all official documents, swearing-in ceremonies, and legal records related to his roles as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President would have used his full legal name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    *   Therefore, he has been publicly and officially identified by his full name, including Azikiwe, since the beginning of his prominent political career.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThere was no specific year in which Goodluck Jonathan started to publicly identify as \"Azikiwe\" because it has been part of his official name since birth. His full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, has been used in all official capacities throughout his political career, which began prominently in 1999. The question is based on a misunderstanding that the name was a later addition.\n\n***\n\nThere is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Jonathan started to publicly identify himself as Azikiwe, because Azikiwe is one of his given birth names. His full name has always been Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, and it has been used in official documents throughout his entire political career. The question is based on an incorrect premise that he added the name at a later date.\n<<<There is no specific year for this event as \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his given name; it was not adopted or added later in his life.>>>"
