    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of PIE `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **Analyze the PIE form:** The form is `*seh₂gieti`, a third-person singular present indicative verb.\n    *   Root: `*seh₂g-` ('to track, perceive').\n    *   Suffix: `-ie-`, forming a present stem.\n    *   Ending: `-ti`, the 3rd person singular primary ending.\n*   **Laryngeal and Vowel Changes:**\n    *   The `h₂` laryngeal colors a preceding `*e` to `*a` and then is lost, lengthening the vowel. Thus, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāg-` in pre-Germanic.\n    *   The PIE long vowel `*ā` becomes the long vowel `*ō` in Proto-Germanic. So, the root `*sāg-` becomes PGmc `*sōk-`.\n*   **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Consonant Shift):**\n    *   The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes the voiceless velar stop `*k`.\n    *   The PIE voiceless alveolar stop `*t` (in the ending `*-ti`) becomes the voiceless dental fricative `*þ`.\n    *   The initial PIE `*s` is not affected by Grimm's Law.\n*   **Verner's Law:** This law causes voicing of fricatives if the preceding syllable was unstressed in PIE. In `*seh₂giéti`, the stress was on the suffix. However, Verner's Law does not apply to initial `*s`, nor does it affect the `*k` that comes from PIE `*g` (it only affects consonants that came from PIE voiceless stops). Therefore, Verner's law has no effect here.\n*   **Forming the PGmc Verb:**\n    *   The verb belongs to the first class of weak verbs (infinitive `*-janą`). The stem vowel is `-i-` from the PIE `-ie-` suffix.\n    *   Root: `*sōk-`\n    *   Stem vowel: `-i-`\n    *   3rd Singular Ending: `*-þ` (from PIE `*-ti`).\n    *   Combining these elements gives the Proto-Germanic 3rd person singular form: **`*sōkiþ`**. The infinitive would be `*sōkijaną`.\n\n**2. Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ`. We use the infinitive `*sōkijaną` to establish the verb's paradigm.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The `*j` in the infinitive and the `*i` in the 3rd person singular cause the fronting of the long back vowel `*ō` to `*œ` (written `œ` or `æ`). The stem becomes `sœk-`.\n*   **Endings:** The PGmc 3rd singular present ending `-iþ` evolves into Old Norse `-ir`.\n*   **Result:** The umlauted stem `sœk-` combines with the ending `-ir`.\n*   **Old Norse form:** **`sœkir`**. (The infinitive is `sœkja`).\n\n**3. Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ` / infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **i-Umlaut (Front Mutation):** As in Old Norse, the `*j` or `*i` causes umlaut of the preceding root vowel. In Old English, PGmc `*ō` is umlauted to `*ē`. The stem becomes `sēk-`.\n*   **Palatalization:** The original velar consonant `*k` is fronted to a palatal affricate `c` [tʃ] before the new front vowel `*ē` (and the following `-i-`).\n*   **Endings:** The PGmc 3rd singular ending `*-iþ` becomes Old English `-eþ` (sometimes contracted to `-þ` after a long syllable).\n*   **Result:** The umlauted and palatalized stem `sēc-` [seːtʃ] combines with the ending `-eþ`.\n*   **Old English form:** **`sēceþ`** (or the contracted form `sēcþ`). (The infinitive is `sēcan`).\n\n**4. Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting form:** PGmc `*sōkiþ` / infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **Vowel Shift:** PGmc long `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. So, the root becomes `suok-`.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:**\n    *   PGmc `*k` after a vowel becomes the voiceless fricative `hh` [x]. The root `*suok-` becomes `suohh-`.\n    *   PGmc `*þ` in the middle or end of a word becomes the voiced stop `d`. The ending `-iþ` becomes `-id`. This `d` is then subject to word-final devoicing, becoming `t`.\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The stem formative `*i` is retained in the 3rd singular form. Normally, this `i` would cause umlaut of `uo` to `üe`. However, in this specific common verb (`suohhen`), umlaut does not apply for unknown reasons (perhaps early loss of the trigger in the dominant dialect).\n*   **Endings:** The PGmc `*-iþ` becomes OHG `-it`.\n*   **Result:** The shifted stem `suohh-` combines with the ending `-it`.\n*   **Old High German form:** **`suohhit`**. (The infinitive is `suohhen`).\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Laryngeals:** Remember that PIE `*eh₂` results in a long `*ā` vowel before it shifts to `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n2.  **Grimm's vs. Verner's Law:** It is crucial to apply these laws correctly. Verner's Law does *not* apply to word-initial consonants or to the output of PIE voiced stops (`b,d,g`), so `s` and `k` (<`g`) are unaffected here.\n3.  **i-Umlaut:** This is the key process differentiating the daughter languages. Note the different outcomes: PGmc `*ō` > ON `œ`, OE `ē`.\n4.  **Palatalization:** Palatalization is a defining feature of Old English phonology that must be accounted for (`k` > `c` [tʃ]).\n5.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This complex set of changes is fundamental to OHG. The key shifts here are `k` > `hh` and `þ` > `d`.\n6.  **OHG Umlaut Irregularity:** The lack of i-umlaut on `uo` in `suohhen`/`suohhit` is an important, language-specific exception that must be known. Assuming a regular process would lead to an incorrect reconstruction (`*süehhit`).\n7.  **Inflected Form:** The question asks for the descendant of a specific 3rd person singular form (`*seh₂gieti`), so the answer should ideally be the corresponding 3rd person singular form in each daughter language, not just the infinitive.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step phonological tracing, here are the resultant forms:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ` (or `sēcþ`)\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ, **Old Norse:** sœkir, **Old English:** sēceþ, **Old High German:** suohhit>>>"
