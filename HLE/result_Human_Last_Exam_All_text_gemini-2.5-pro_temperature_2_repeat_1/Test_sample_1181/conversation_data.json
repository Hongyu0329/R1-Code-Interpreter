    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying feature of this character is a specific emotional confession: they feel ashamed for missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This points to a character who is deeply introspective, nostalgic, and aware of the psychological toll that living in space has taken on them.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided character choices in the context of the film's themes.**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent to the station. The film begins with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, establishing his deep connection to it. He certainly misses Earth, but his primary emotional conflict revolves around his guilt over his deceased wife, Hari, and his relationship with her replica. He is the audience's window into this world, but the specific line about shame belongs to someone who has been there longer and has had more time to reflect on their own dehumanization.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical replica of Kris's late wife created by the Solaris ocean from his memories. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself. Her existence is confined to the station, and her journey is about discovering her own nature. She cannot miss something she has never experienced.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is a cyberneticist and one of the two scientists still living on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, often cynical, and drinks heavily, but he is also the most philosophical character. He acts as a guide to Kris, explaining the strange phenomena and their psychological effects. A statement expressing shame over losing a fundamental human connection to nature fits his introspective and jaded personality perfectly. He is lamenting how long-term isolation in the sterile, artificial environment of the space station has changed him.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is an astrobiologist, the other surviving scientist. He is the opposite of Snaut: cold, detached, and rigorously scientific. He sees the \"guests\" as objects of study and contamination to be controlled or destroyed. He actively suppresses emotion and nostalgia, viewing them as weaknesses. It is highly out of character for Sartorius to admit to such a poetic and vulnerable feeling as shame for missing something earthly.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian was Kris's friend and a scientist on the station who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a disturbing video recording he left for Kris. While he was clearly in despair and missed Earth, the specific, reflective quote about being \"ashamed to miss\" a sound isn't attributed to him in his brief appearance. His message is more of a desperate warning.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific dialogue and character.**\nThe line in question is spoken by Dr. Snaut during a conversation with Kris Kelvin. Snaut is trying to explain the mental state of the crew and the nature of their predicament. He confesses his own feelings of being lost and disconnected, using the rustling leaves as a powerful example of what he feels he *should* miss more profoundly. He is ashamed of the numbness that has set in after years in space, a sign of losing his humanity. The line showcases his self-awareness and the film's core theme of longing for home.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe character who expresses this specific sentiment is Dr. Snaut. His world-weary philosophical nature and his role as the crew's long-suffering commentator make him the perfect vehicle for this poignant reflection on what has been lost by leaving Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
