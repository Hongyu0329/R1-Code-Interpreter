Yes, the theory can fail. The principle of reversing the optical path, as described, relies on the time-reversal symmetry of the entire system. While standard birefringence from an anisotropic crystal is a reciprocal effect and would not break this symmetry, other forms of birefringence are not. A key example is the Faraday effect, where a magnetic field induces circular birefringence, causing the plane of polarization to rotate. This effect is non-reciprocal: the rotation direction depends on the magnetic field, not the light's direction of propagation. If light is rotated by +θ on the forward path, it gets rotated by another +θ on the return path. This non-reciprocal behavior breaks the time-reversal symmetry of the system, and as a result, the "theory" of being able to perfectly reverse the light path would no longer hold true.
