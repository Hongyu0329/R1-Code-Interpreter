    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to determine how the bare Green's function ($G_0$) depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) within the framework of the Feynman path integral.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, describes the propagation of a particle from one spacetime point to another. The *bare* Green's function, $G_0$, describes this propagation in a non-interacting system. For a fermionic system (the logic for bosons is analogous), the time-ordered bare Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of a creation and an annihilation field operator.\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x,t) \\psi^\\dagger(x',t')] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^\\dagger(x',t')$ are the field operators that annihilate and create a particle at specific spacetime points.\n*   $T$ is the time-ordering operator, which arranges operators chronologically from right to left.\n*   The angle brackets $\\langle ... \\rangle_0$ denote the expectation value in the ground state of the *non-interacting* system.\n*   The factor of $-i$ is a common convention.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism provides a way to calculate expectation values by integrating over all possible classical field configurations, weighted by a phase factor determined by the system's action, $S$. For our Green's function, this is:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x,t) \\psi^*(x',t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\n*   $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^*(x,t)$ are now classical (Grassmann-valued for fermions) fields, not operators.\n*   $\\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ represents the functional measure over all possible field configurations.\n*   $S_0$ is the classical action for the **non-interacting** system. This is the crucial element that makes this the *bare* Green's function.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a system of non-interacting particles is a quadratic functional of the fields. It can be written in terms of the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$.\n\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nThe key feature of this action is the operator $\\mathcal{O} = (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0)$. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $H_0$:\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\nwhere $|k\\rangle$ are the single-particle energy eigenstates (e.g., plane waves for a free particle in space, with $k$ being the wavevector).\n\n**Step 4: Diagonalize the Action**\n\nThe path integral is easiest to evaluate in a basis that diagonalizes the operator $\\mathcal{O}$. This is the basis of the eigenstates of $H_0$ (the basis indexed by $k$) and the Fourier basis for the time coordinate (indexed by frequency $\\omega$).\n\nWe expand the fields in this basis:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\phi_k(x) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\nwhere $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$ is the spatial part of the eigenfunction.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$, the operator $\\mathcal{O}$ acts on its own eigenfunctions. The derivative $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes a multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$, and $H_0$ becomes a multiplication by $\\epsilon_k$. The action simplifies to a sum over uncoupled modes:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\psi_k^*(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\nFrom here, we can clearly see that the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ encapsulates the entire dynamics of the non-interacting system for the mode $(k, \\omega)$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral (Find the Propagator)**\n\nThe Green's function is fundamentally the inverse of the operator in the quadratic part of the action. The path integral provides a formal way to show this. For an action of the form $S = \\int \\phi^* A \\phi$, the two-point function $\\langle \\phi \\phi^* \\rangle$ is proportional to $A^{-1}$.\n\nIn our diagonalized $(k, \\omega)$ basis, the operator \"A\" is just the scalar value $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ for each independent mode. Its inverse is simply the reciprocal. Performing the Gaussian path integral (or by identifying the Green's function as the inverse of the action's kernel), we find the Green's function in this basis:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: Incorporate Causality (The Feynman Prescription)**\n\nThe expression has a pole when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, which corresponds to the physical condition of an \"on-shell\" particle having energy $\\epsilon_k$. To handle this pole correctly during integration over $\\omega$, we must add a small imaginary part, $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This $i\\delta$ prescription is not ad-hoc; it arises directly from the time-ordering operator $T$ in the original definition of $G_0$. It ensures that the propagator respects causality (effects do not precede their causes).\n\nThe final standard form of the bare Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate basis is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\n(Note: For many-body systems with a filled Fermi sea, the sign of $i\\delta$ depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied, leading to the more general form $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The form above is standard for vacuum QFT.)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This derivation is strictly for the *bare* propagator, $G_0$, because we used the non-interacting action, $S_0$. For an interacting system with action $S = S_0 + S_{int}$, the full propagator, $G$, would be modified by the interaction term, leading to concepts like self-energy. However, the bare propagator $G_0$ remains a fundamental building block in the perturbative expansion for $G$.\n\n2.  **Basis Dependence:** The simple form $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ is specific to the frequency-energy eigenbasis where the operator $\\mathcal{O}$ is diagonal. In a real-space representation, the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is more complex, contained within the operator kernel of the Green's function.\n\n3.  **Physical Meaning of the Pole:** The pole in the Green's function at $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k / \\hbar$ is a central feature. It indicates the energy-momentum relationship (the dispersion relation) of the particle excitations in the system. The real part of the pole's location gives the particle's energy, and the imaginary part (which is zero for the stable, non-interacting particles described by $G_0$) gives its decay rate.\n\n4.  **Conventions:** The overall sign, factors of $i$, and $\\hbar$ can vary slightly between different conventions (e.g., quantum field theory vs. condensed matter physics). However, the functional dependence on $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ is universal. Here we set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity in the final steps, which is a common practice.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that it is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency variable $\\omega$ (multiplied by $\\hbar$) and the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nIn the frequency-momentum (or frequency-eigenstate) basis, this relationship is expressed explicitly as:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nThe term $\\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, subtracted from the energy variable $\\hbar\\omega$. This shows that the propagator becomes singular (has a pole) when a particle is \"on-shell,\" i.e., when its energy $\\hbar\\omega$ is equal to its intrinsic single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In the frequency-eigenstate basis, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is proportional to the inverse of $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The specific functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, where $\\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, subtracted from the frequency variable $\\omega$.>>>"
