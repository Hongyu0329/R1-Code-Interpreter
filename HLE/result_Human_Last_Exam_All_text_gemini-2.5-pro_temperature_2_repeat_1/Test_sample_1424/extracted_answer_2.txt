In the frequency-eigenstate basis, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is proportional to the inverse of $(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k)$. The specific functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$, where $\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, subtracted from the frequency variable $\omega$.
