    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made a particular conceptual distinction.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This is a specific Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy that flourished in the interwar period (1918-1939). Key figures include its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The answer must be one of these or a closely associated thinker.\n    *   **Hallmark:** This term refers to a sign, a distinguishing characteristic, or an indicator. In the context of philosophy and semiotics (the study of signs), it's a general term for something that stands for something else. The Polish equivalent is often *znak*.\n    *   **Symptoms and Signals:** These are the two specific types of \"hallmarks\" or signs the philosopher distinguished between. This is the crucial clue. A \"symptom\" typically implies a natural, causal link (e.g., smoke is a symptom of fire), while a \"signal\" implies a conventional or intentional link (e.g., a green light is a signal to proceed).\n\n3.  **Research and Elimination within the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   We need to search for a philosopher within this school who worked on semantics, semiotics, or the philosophy of language.\n    *   While many members worked on logic, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is particularly famous for his contributions to the philosophy of language and his work on meaning.\n    *   A review of Ajdukiewicz's work, particularly his book *Pragmatic Logic* (originally *Logika pragmatyczna*, 1965) and earlier essays on language, reveals his detailed analysis of the concept of the \"sign\" (*znak*).\n    *   Ajdukiewicz explicitly distinguishes between different kinds of signs.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Specific Distinction:**\n    *   Ajdukiewicz divided signs into two main categories:\n        1.  **Symptoms (or natural signs; Polish: *oznaki*):** These are signs where the relationship between the sign and what it signifies is a natural or causal one, existing independently of human rules or conventions. For example, a fever is a symptom of illness; footprints are a sign (symptom) of someone having walked by.\n        2.  **Signals (or conventional signs; Polish: *sygnały* or *znaki konwencjonalne*):** These are signs where the relationship is based on a human-made rule, convention, or agreement. The words of a language are the most common example. The word \"dog\" means dog only because of an established convention among English speakers. A traffic light is another classic example.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a leading figure of the Lviv-Warsaw School. This distinction was central to his analysis of language and meaning.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Translation:** The English term \"hallmark\" is a general stand-in for the more technical Polish term *znak* (sign) that Ajdukiewicz was analyzing. It's important to understand this context.\n*   **Specific Thinker:** While other members of the school, like Tadeusz Kotarbiński, also discussed related concepts, the explicit and well-known distinction between \"symptoms\" (*oznaki*) and \"signals\" (*sygnały*) is a cornerstone of Ajdukiewicz's semiotic theory.\n*   **School Identity:** Verifying that Ajdukiewicz was indeed a central member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is a necessary step. He was a student of the school's founder, Kazimierz Twardowski, and a professor at Lviv and later Warsaw, making him an undisputed member.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
