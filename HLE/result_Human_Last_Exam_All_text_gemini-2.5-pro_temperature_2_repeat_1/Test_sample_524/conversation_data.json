    "This is a classic and deep question in the field of continuum theory, a branch of topology. To determine the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua, we need to understand the definitions and rely on some major theorems that classify these objects.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. The question asks about continua, which are subsets of a larger space.\n*   **Planar Continuum:** This is a continuum that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, R². By the Heine-Borel theorem, this means it's a closed, bounded, and connected subset of R².\n*   **Homogeneous Space:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) f: X → X such that f(x) = y. Informally, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting every single homogeneous planar continuum, but rather grouping them into classes where all continua in a class are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these distinct classes.\n\n**2. Identifying the Candidates**\n\nThe solution to this problem relies on a complete classification theorem developed over decades by several topologists, including R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and J. T. Rogers, Jr. The classification exhaustively lists all possible homogeneous planar continua.\n\nLet's break down the classification:\n\n**A. The Degenerate Case**\nFirst, we must consider the simplest possible continuum.\n*   **The Point:** A single point is non-empty, compact, connected, and can be embedded in the plane. It is also trivially homogeneous (there's only one point, so the identity map satisfies the condition). This is known as the **degenerate continuum**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The question does not specify \"non-degenerate\" continua, so the point must be included in our count.\n\n**B. Non-Degenerate Cases**\nNow, let's consider continua with more than one point. A fundamental result states that a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum either separates the plane or it does not.\n\n*   **Case 1: The Continuum Separates the Plane**\n    A famous theorem by J. T. Rogers, Jr. (1983) states that the only non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane is the **simple closed curve (the circle)**.\n    *   The Circle (S¹): It is compact, connected, and homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point). It clearly separates the plane into a bounded \"inside\" and an unbounded \"outside\". This forms our second homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **Case 2: The Continuum Does Not Separate the Plane**\n    This case is more complex. F. B. Jones proved that any homogeneous, non-degenerate, planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be **indecomposable** (meaning it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua). Further work, primarily by J. T. Rogers, Jr. (1985), showed that there are exactly two such objects, up to homeomorphism.\n    *   **The Pseudo-arc:** This is a famously complicated, snake-like continuum. It is indecomposable, tree-like (can be mapped onto a tree with arbitrarily small point-inverses), and not locally connected. It was shown to be homogeneous by R. H. Bing. It is our third class.\n    *   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** This can be visualized as being constructed by replacing each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion. Like the pseudo-arc, it is indecomposable and not locally connected. However, it is fundamentally different because it is \"circle-like\", not \"tree-like\". Its algebraic structure (Čech cohomology) is different from that of the pseudo-arc. This gives us our fourth class.\n\n**3. Verifying the Classes are Distinct**\n\nThe four candidates are in different homeomorphism classes because their topological properties differ.\n1.  **Point:** 0-dimensional.\n2.  **Circle:** 1-dimensional, locally connected, separates the plane.\n3.  **Pseudo-arc:** 1-dimensional, not locally connected, does not separate the plane, is tree-like.\n4.  **Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** 1-dimensional, not locally connected, does not separate the plane, is not tree-like (it is \"circle-like\").\n\nThese distinguishing properties are all preserved under homeomorphism, so no two of these can be in the same class.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe classification theorems are complete, meaning no other examples of homogeneous planar continua exist. Other well-known homogeneous continua like solenoids or the Menger universal curve are proven to be non-planar and are therefore excluded.\n\nBased on this complete classification, there are exactly four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua:\n1.  The Point\n2.  The Circle\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nThe total number of classes is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
