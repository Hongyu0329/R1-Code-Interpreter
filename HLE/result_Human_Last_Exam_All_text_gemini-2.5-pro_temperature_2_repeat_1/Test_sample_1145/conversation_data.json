    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Question**\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D infinite potential well (a \"box\") of length 'a'. We are given two specific conditions:\n1.  The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the quantum number **n = 2**.\n2.  The location interval is from **x₁ = 0.495a** to **x₂ = 0.505a**.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\nFor a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' (from x=0 to x=a), the normalized wavefunction for a given quantum state 'n' is:\n$$ \\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\nThe probability of finding the particle at a specific position 'x' is given by the probability density function, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n$$ P(x) = |\\psi_n(x)|^2 = \\psi_n^*(x)\\psi_n(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\nFor our specific case, **n = 2**, the probability density is:\n$$ |\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Probability Integral**\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ to x₂ is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n$$ P(\\text{x₁} \\le x \\le \\text{x₂}) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |\\psi_2(x)|^2 dx $$\nSubstituting the specific values:\n$$ P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx $$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Calculation Method**\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The interval is very small: $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$. This is only 1% of the box's length.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The interval is centered around $x_c = 0.5a$. Let's check the value of the probability density at this center point.\n    $$ |\\psi_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0 $$\n    This means the center of our interval is a **node**, a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Since the interval is small but the function value at the center is zero, a simple approximation like $P \\approx |\\psi_2(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$ would incorrectly yield a result of 0. We must either perform the exact integration or use a more careful approximation. Since the interval is small, approximating the function near the node is a very effective strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Apply a Suitable Approximation (Taylor Expansion)**\nLet's analyze the function near the node at $x = a/2$. We can define a new variable $\\delta x = x - a/2$. Our integration limits in terms of $\\delta x$ are from $-0.005a$ to $0.005a$.\nThe probability density becomes:\n$$ |\\psi_2|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (a/2 + \\delta x)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\sin(\\pi + \\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$ |\\psi_2|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right) $$\nNow, for the small interval we are considering, the argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}$, is small. We can therefore use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n$$ |\\psi_2|^2 \\approx \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 (\\delta x)^2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3}(\\delta x)^2 $$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Approximate Probability Integral**\nNow we can perform the simplified integration with respect to $\\delta x$ over its new limits. Note that $dx = d(\\delta x)$.\n$$ P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3}(\\delta x)^2 d(\\delta x) $$\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} (\\delta x)^2 d(\\delta x) $$\nThe integral of $(\\delta x)^2$ is $(\\delta x)^3/3$:\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{(\\delta x)^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} $$\nEvaluate at the limits:\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right] $$\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\cdot (0.005a)^3 \\right] = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005)^3 a^3 $$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel out, as expected for a probability calculation.\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3 $$\n\n**Step 7: Final Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we compute the final numeric value.\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9}) $$\n$$ P \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 125}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{2000}{3} \\pi^2 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ P \\approx 666.67 \\times (3.14159)^2 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ P \\approx 666.67 \\times 9.8696 \\times 10^{-9} $$\n$$ P \\approx 6579.7 \\times 10^{-9} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the specified interval is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
