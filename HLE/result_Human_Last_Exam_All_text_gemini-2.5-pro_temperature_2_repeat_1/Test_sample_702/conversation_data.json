    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map.**\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet's denote the spaces involved:\n*   The domain is $X = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The codomain is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$, the codomain is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe map is described as \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". This points towards a canonical map in homotopy theory. Indeed, this is a known map, sometimes called the Hopf-James map or the Samelson-Whitehead map. Let's call it $\\Phi$.\n\nMore formally, for two pointed CW-complexes $A$ and $B$, there is a canonical map:\n$\\lambda_{A,B}: \\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$\nThe map in the question is an instance of this canonical map with $A=S^4$ and $B=S^6$.\n\n**Step 2: Define connectivity of a map.**\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the homotopy fiber of $f$, denoted $F_f$, is $k$-connected. A space is $k$-connected if all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\leq k$. This implies that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a monomorphism for $i = k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain.**\n*   **Domain:** $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    1.  $S^4$ is the 4-sphere. It is 3-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(S^4)=0$ for $i \\leq 3$, except for $\\pi_0=0$ by convention for connected spaces).\n    2.  $\\Omega S^4$ is the loop space of $S^4$. Its homotopy groups are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^4)$. Thus, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n    3.  $S^6$ is the 6-sphere. It is 5-connected.\n    4.  $\\Omega S^6$ is the loop space of $S^6$. It is 4-connected.\n    5.  For two CW-complexes $A$ and $B$ that are $p$-connected and $q$-connected respectively, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(p+q+1)$-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    6.  The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected. Therefore, $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Codomain:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$\n    1.  $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n    2.  $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1) = 8$-connected.\n\nBoth the domain and the codomain are 8-connected spaces. This means that for $i < 9$, the homotopy groups are trivial, and so $\\pi_i(\\Phi)$ is trivially an isomorphism. The connectivity of the map $\\Phi$ is therefore at least 8. To find the precise connectivity, we must analyze the map on $\\pi_9$ and higher.\n\n**Step 4: Apply a known theorem for the connectivity of the map.**\nThe map in question, $\\Phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is an example of the map whose connectivity is given by a theorem of H.-J. Baues. The theorem applies to a map $\\lambda(X,Y): \\Sigma(\\Omega\\Sigma X \\wedge \\Omega\\Sigma Y) \\rightarrow \\Omega(\\Sigma X \\wedge \\Sigma Y)$.\nTo match our map with the theorem, we set $\\Sigma X = S^4$ and $\\Sigma Y = S^6$. This implies we should take $X = S^3$ and $Y = S^5$.\nThe theorem of Baues states:\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be connected CW-complexes. The canonical map\n$\\lambda_{\\Sigma X, \\Sigma Y}: \\Sigma(\\Omega\\Sigma X \\wedge \\Omega\\Sigma Y) \\rightarrow \\Omega(\\Sigma X \\wedge \\Sigma Y)$\nis $(\\mathrm{conn}(X) + \\mathrm{conn}(Y)+3)$-connected.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the connectivity.**\nWe apply this theorem with $X=S^3$ and $Y=S^5$.\n1.  The connectivity of $S^3$ is $\\mathrm{conn}(S^3)=2$.\n2.  The connectivity of $S^5$ is $\\mathrm{conn}(S^5)=4$.\n3.  According to the formula, the connectivity of the map is $2 + 4 + 3 = 9$.\n\n**Step 6: Final interpretation.**\nA connectivity of 9 means that the homotopy fiber of the map $\\Phi$ is 9-connected. This implies that $\\pi_i(\\Phi)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 9$ and a monomorphism for $i=9$.\n*   For $i<9$, we have $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(Y)=0$, so the condition is satisfied.\n*   For $i=9$, we have the first non-trivial homotopy groups.\n    *   $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Hurewicz theorem for this 7-connected space, this is isomorphic to $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The theorem implies that the map $\\pi_9(\\Phi): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is a monomorphism, i.e., it is not the zero map. In fact, more detailed analyses show it is an isomorphism.\nThe fiber being 9-connected, $\\pi_i(F_\\Phi) = 0$ for $i \\leq 9$. The connectivity of the map is thus 9."
