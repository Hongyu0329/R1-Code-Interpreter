    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to examine the first violin part (\"Violino I\") at the very end of the final movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Consult the Musical Score**\nTo find the notes, we must look at the actual sheet music. The symphony concludes in the key of B-flat major. The final measures are marked *fortississimo* (*fff*), indicating a very loud and powerful ending.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the First Violin Part in the Final Measures**\nLooking at the first violin part in the last two measures of the symphony reveals the final sequence of notes:\n*   **Penultimate Measure:** The first violins play two separate notes in this measure. Both are half notes. The pitch for both of these notes is D6 (the D located one ledger line above the treble staff).\n*   **Final Measure:** The first violins play a single whole note to conclude the piece. The pitch of this final note is B-flat 5 (the B-flat on the top line of the treble staff).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Last Three Notes and Compare Their Pitches**\nThe sequence of the last three notes played by the first violin section is therefore: D6, D6, B-flat 5.\nNow we must compare the pitches to find the lowest one:\n*   Note 1: D6\n*   Note 2: D6\n*   Note 3: B-flat 5\n\nIn standard musical pitch, B-flat 5 is a minor third lower than D6.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBy comparing the pitches of the final three notes, we can definitively state that B-flat 5 is the lowest note in the sequence.\n\n<<<B-flat 5>>>"
