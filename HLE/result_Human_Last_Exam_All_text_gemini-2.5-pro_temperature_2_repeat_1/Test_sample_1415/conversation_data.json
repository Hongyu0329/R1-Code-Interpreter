    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\nFirst, let's write out each function explicitly based on the definitions provided.\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in the form ∫ (u'(x) / u(x)) dx, where u(x) = F₃(x). This is a standard integral form whose antiderivative is ln|u(x)|.\n\nSo, the antiderivative of F₃'(x) / F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral**\nTo evaluate the definite integral, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] evaluated from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 4: Determine the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nWe need to calculate the value of F₃(x) at the limits of integration, x=0 and x=1.\n*   **At x = 0:**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1,\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **At x = 1:**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Check if the absolute value is necessary**\nWe need to check if F₃(x) is positive on the interval [0, 1].\n*   For x in [0, 1] (in radians), sin(x) ≥ 0.\n*   Therefore, e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\n*   This means 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2.\n*   The natural logarithm of a number greater than or equal to 2 is always positive. So, F₃(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1].\n*   We can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the final expression for V**\nSubstituting the values back into the expression for V:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we get:\nV = ln [ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the numerical value**\nNow we compute the numerical value of V using a calculator. Remember that sin(1) refers to 1 radian.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.3197779\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.3197779\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.3197779) ≈ 1.199855 (This is F₃(1))\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.693147 (This is F₃(0))\n\nNow substitute these into the expression for V:\nV ≈ ln(1.199855 / 0.693147)\nV ≈ ln(1.73105)\nV ≈ 0.548709\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final requested value**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548709 = 5487.09\nThe closest integer to 5487.09 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
