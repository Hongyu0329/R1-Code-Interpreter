    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Polynomial Matrix:** A matrix whose elements are polynomials in a variable `s`.\n*   **Right Divisor:** A polynomial matrix `D(s)` is a right divisor of `P(s)` if there exists another polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)D(s)`.\n*   **Common Right Divisor (CRD):** `D(s)` is a common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):** A CRD `D(s)` is a GCRD if for any other CRD, `D'(s)`, `D'(s)` is a right divisor of `D(s)`. This means `D(s) = L(s)D'(s)` for some polynomial matrix `L(s)`. The GCRD is unique up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. The Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Matrices**\n\nThe GCRD can be found by applying elementary row operations to a stacked matrix formed by `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. The elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe goal is to transform the stacked matrix into the form `[R(s); 0]`, where `R(s)` is a matrix with the same number of columns as `P1` and `P2`, and `0` is a zero matrix. The resulting matrix `R(s)` is a GCRD.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nThe given matrices are:\n`P1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]`\n`P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]`\n\n**Step A: Form the stacked matrix M(s).**\n\n`M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n`M(s) = `\n`[R1: s^2 + s,  -s     ]`\n`[R2: -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]`\n`[R3: s,         0      ]`\n`[R4: -s - 1,   1      ]`\n\n**Step B: Perform elementary row operations.**\n\nOur strategy is to use rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials. `R3` is very simple, so we will use it to simplify `R1` and `R2`.\n\n*   `R1_new = R1 - (s+1) * R3`\n    `= [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1) * [s, 0]`\n    `= [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s]`\n    `= [0, -s]`\n*   `R2_new = R2 + s * R3`\n    `= [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s * [s, 0]`\n    `= [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2]`\n    `= [-1, s^2]`\n\nThe matrix is now transformed into `M'(s)`:\n`M'(s) = `\n`[R1': 0,      -s ]`\n`[R2': -1,     s^2]`\n`[R3:  s,      0  ]`\n`[R4:  -s - 1, 1  ]`\n\nNow, the new row `R2' = [-1, s^2]` is an excellent pivot because its first element is a constant. We use `R2'` to eliminate the first element in all other rows.\n\n*   `R3_new = R3 + s * R2'`\n    `= [s, 0] + s * [-1, s^2]`\n    `= [s - s, s^3]`\n    `= [0, s^3]`\n*   `R4_new = R4 - (s+1) * R2'`\n    `= [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, s^2]`\n    `= [(-s - 1) - (-s - 1), 1 - (s+1)s^2]`\n    `= [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]`\n\nThe matrix becomes `M''(s)`:\n`M''(s) = `\n`[R1': 0,      -s              ]`\n`[R2': -1,     s^2             ]`\n`[R3': 0,      s^3             ]`\n`[R4': 0,      1 - s^3 - s^2   ]`\n\nNow we have isolated the first column. The problem reduces to simplifying the second column for rows 1, 3, and 4. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the polynomials `-s`, `s^3`, and `1 - s^3 - s^2`.\n`GCD(-s, s^3) = s`.\n`GCD(s, 1 - s^3 - s^2)`. By polynomial division: `(1 - s^2 - s^3) = (-s^2 - s) * s + 1`. The remainder is 1.\nSo, `GCD(-s, s^3, 1 - s^3 - s^2) = 1`.\n\nSince the GCD is 1, we can perform row operations to obtain a row `[0, 1]`. Let's demonstrate this:\n1 = (1) * `(1 - s^2 - s^3)` + `(s^2+s)` * `(s)`\n1 = (1) * `(1 - s^2 - s^3)` - `(s^2+s)` * `(-s)`\nThis corresponds to the row operation:\n`R_new = 1 * R4' - (s^2 + s) * R1'`\n`R_new = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (s^2 + s) * [0, -s]`\n`R_new = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2 + s^3 + s^2] = [0, 1]`\n\nSo, we have shown that our set of rows can be manipulated to produce a row `[0, 1]`. Let's call this `R_A`. We can now use `R_A` to eliminate the second element in all other rows.\n\n*   `R1'_new = R1' + s * R_A = [0, -s] + s * [0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n*   `R2'_new = R2' - s^2 * R_A = [-1, s^2] - s^2 * [0, 1] = [-1, 0]`\n*   `R3'_new = R3' - s^3 * R_A = [0, s^3] - s^3 * [0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n*   `R4'_new = R4' - (1 - s^3 - s^2) * R_A = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (1 - s^3 - s^2) * [0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n\nAfter all these operations, the final matrix is equivalent to a matrix with two non-zero rows, `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`, and two zero rows.\n\n**Step C: Identify the GCRD.**\n\nThe non-zero rows form the GCRD. We can write it as:\n`R(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\nThis matrix `R(s)` is a GCRD. The GCRD is only unique up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The determinant of `R(s)` is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. Therefore, `R(s)` is unimodular.\n\nWhen the GCRD is unimodular, the simplest and most common canonical representation is the identity matrix `I`. We can obtain `I` by multiplying `R(s)` by another unimodular matrix `U(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]`:\n\n`GCRD = U(s) * R(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I`\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
