No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral and is typically oriented at about 45 degrees to the radial direction.

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate magnetic helicity is a common approximation based on **Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis**. The core assumption is not that the magnetic field is radial, but rather that the **wave propagation vector (k) is aligned with the bulk solar wind velocity vector (V_sw)**.

Since the solar wind flow at L1 is overwhelmingly radial, this simplifies to assuming that the waves propagate radially. Consequently, the plane of polarization is taken to be the one perpendicular to the radial direction. This is a computationally convenient simplification for analyzing broadband turbulence from a single spacecraft, but it is an approximation that can be inaccurate for specific, purely field-aligned waves like AIC waves, especially when the magnetic field direction is far from radial.
