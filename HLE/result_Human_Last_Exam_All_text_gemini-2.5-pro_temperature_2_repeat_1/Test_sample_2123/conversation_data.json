    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Location:** The description is of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Object:** The surname of an English poet appears in this description.\n    *   **Task:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Puzzle:** The question is a riddle that relies on a specific piece of literary knowledge. The connection between a Viennese boulevard and an English poet is unlikely to be direct. It's almost certainly a play on words, a pun that exists in the Russian language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Linguistic Connection:**\n    *   We need to find a Russian word related to \"wide boulevards\" or \"streets\" that sounds like the surname of an English poet.\n    *   Let's consider Russian words for roads:\n        *   `улица` (ulitsa) - street\n        *   `проспект` (prospekt) - avenue\n        *   `бульвар` (bul'var) - boulevard\n        *   None of these have a strong phonetic resemblance to a famous English poet's surname.\n    *   Let's consider a more specific type of large, paved road or highway, which would be characteristic of major routes through a country like Austria. The Russian word for this, borrowed from French, is **`шоссе`** (shosse).\n\n4.  **Connect the Russian Word to an English Poet:**\n    *   Pronounce the Russian word: `шоссе` (shosse) sounds very similar to the surname **Chaucer**.\n    *   Geoffrey Chaucer is a foundational figure in English poetry, often called the \"Father of English literature.\" This fits the \"English poet\" criteria perfectly.\n\n5.  **Identify the Source Essay:**\n    *   This specific pun is famously used by the poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky, a Russian-American Nobel laureate.\n    *   In his essay \"Journey to Istanbul\" (from the collection \"Less Than One\"), Brodsky describes his car journey from Vienna eastward.\n    *   When describing the excellent Austrian highways, he uses this exact wordplay, marveling at a country where even the roads themselves – `шоссе` (shosse) – seem to evoke the great literary tradition of `Chaucer`.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The essay is by Joseph Brodsky.\n    *   The context is a journey starting from Vienna, describing the highways (`шоссе`).\n    *   The pun connects the Russian word `шоссе` (shosse) to the English poet's surname, `Chaucer`.\n    *   Therefore, the surname is Chaucer.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The question's vagueness (\"a certain essay\") is a key feature, indicating it's a well-known literary puzzle rather than a straightforward search query.\n*   The reference to the \"Russian translation\" is crucial because the pun works with the Russian word `шоссе`. Brodsky wrote the essay in Russian first (\"Путешествие в Стамбул\").\n*   While the question mentions \"boulevards of Vienna,\" Brodsky's reference is more broadly to the main highways (`шоссе`) of Austria, which one would travel on when leaving Vienna.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe key is the phonetic pun between the Russian word for a highway, **`шоссе`** (shosse), and the surname of the English poet Geoffrey **Chaucer**. This pun is used by essayist Joseph Brodsky when describing the roads in Austria near Vienna.\n\n<<<Chaucer>>>"
