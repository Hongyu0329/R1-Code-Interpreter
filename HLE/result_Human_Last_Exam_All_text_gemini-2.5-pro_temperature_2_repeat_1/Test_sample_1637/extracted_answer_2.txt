Yes, modifying the molecule to incorporate a longer Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) chain is a very common and effective strategy for increasing the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic compounds and will likely solve the precipitation problem. The original probe precipitates because its large hydrophobic parts (the thioxanthenone ring system and the hexyl chain) are not sufficiently balanced by its small hydrophilic parts. A PEG chain consists of many repeating `-(CH2CH2O)-` units, whose ether oxygens can form hydrogen bonds with water, thus significantly improving the overall solubility of the molecule. While this change might affect other properties like cell permeability or target binding, it directly addresses the observed issue of poor solubility.
