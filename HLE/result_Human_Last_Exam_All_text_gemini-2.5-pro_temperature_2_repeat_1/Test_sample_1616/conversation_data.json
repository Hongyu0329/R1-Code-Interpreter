    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English that affects the pronunciation of vowels. The rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   **The Rule:** A tense vowel (like the \"i\" in *divine* or the \"a\" in *sane*) becomes lax (short) if it is in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word.\n*   **Conditions for TSL:**\n    1.  The word must have **at least three syllables**.\n    2.  The vowel in question must be in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third-to-last syllable).\n    3.  The vowel must be **tense** (a long vowel or a diphthong) in its base form or in a related word.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nLet's examine each word based on the conditions for TSL. We will look at its syllable count, the position of the key vowel, and its history by comparing it to a related base word.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word only has two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** Because it does not have three syllables, it cannot undergo Trisyllabic Laxing. The vowel change from *south* (/aʊ/) to *southern* (/ʌ/) is a different type of vowel shortening that occurs before certain consonant clusters, not TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Antepenultimate Syllable:** The antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable is `-riv-`.\n    *   **Vowel History:** Compare it to the base word *derive*. The \"i\" in *derive* is a tense diphthong, /aɪ/. In *derivative*, this same \"i\" becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** A tense vowel /aɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable becomes lax /ɪ/. This is a classic example of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Antepenultimate Syllable:** The antepenultimate syllable is `-ren-`.\n    *   **Vowel History:** Compare it to the base word *serene*. The \"e\" in *serene* is a tense vowel, /iː/. In *serenity*, this \"e\" becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** A tense vowel /iː/ in the antepenultimate syllable becomes lax /ɛ/. This is another clear case of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word only has two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** Like *southern*, it does not meet the three-syllable requirement for TSL. The vowel change from *please* (/iː/) to *pleasant* (/ɛ/) is a different type of vowel shortening.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   **Antepenultimate Syllable:** The antepenultimate syllable is `grat-`.\n    *   **Vowel History:** The \"a\" in `gratitude` can be compared to related forms like *grateful* or its Latin root *grātus*, which had a long/tense \"a\" sound (/eɪ/ in modern English). In *gratitude*, this \"a\" is the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** A base tense vowel /eɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable becomes lax /æ/. This fits the pattern of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** `shad-ow` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word only has two syllables. It also has a unique vowel history.\n    *   **Analysis:** Because it is disyllabic, it cannot have undergone TSL. Furthermore, its root vowel in Old English (*sceadu*) was already short. Unlike *southern* or *pleasant*, which are derived from a base with a long/tense vowel (*south*, *please*), the word *shadow* comes from a form that always had a short/lax vowel. Therefore, no laxing process of any kind occurred in its history.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Answer\n\nWe have found three words that did not undergo Trisyllabic Laxing: *southern*, *pleasant*, and *shadow*. They all fail the first condition (being at least three syllables). However, the question implies a single best answer.\n\nThe key distinction is in the term \"undergone... laxing\".\n*   *southern* and *pleasant* both exhibit a vowel that has been laxed (shortened) from its base form, even though the process isn't TSL.\n*   *shadow*, on the other hand, comes from a historical form (*sceadu*) that always had a short/lax vowel. Its vowel did not need to \"undergo\" laxing because it was never tense to begin with.\n\nTherefore, *shadow* is the strongest answer, as it not only fails the structural requirement for TSL but also did not undergo any historical vowel laxing process in its direct line of development.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
