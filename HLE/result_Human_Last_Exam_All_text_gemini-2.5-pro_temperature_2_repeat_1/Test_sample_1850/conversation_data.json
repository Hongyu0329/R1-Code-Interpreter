    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the number of \"historical saints\" who are \"mentioned by name\" specifically within the text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: This is a crucial distinction. In Christian tradition, there is a difference between \"biblical saints\" (figures from the Old and New Testaments like Abraham, Moses, David, the Virgin Mary, or the Apostle Peter) and \"historical saints\" (figures who lived *after* the biblical era and were later canonized or recognized for their holiness, such as St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi, or St. Thomas Aquinas). The term \"historical\" implies a post-biblical context.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: We must look for specific proper names, not general references to groups like \"the saints,\" \"martyrs,\" or \"friars.\"\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The search is strictly limited to this specific epic poem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Scope and Content of *Paradise Lost***\n*Paradise Lost* focuses primarily on biblical narratives: the War in Heaven, the Creation, and the Fall of Man. The poem culminates in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals the future of mankind to Adam. This vision of the future is the only part of the poem where post-biblical figures could logically be mentioned.\n\nHowever, a careful examination of this section reveals that Michael's prophecy only covers events *within the Bible*:\n*   **Book XI**: Details history from Cain and Abel through Enoch to Noah and the Flood. All named figures are from the Book of Genesis.\n*   **Book XII**: Continues with Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob), Moses and the Exodus, the conquest of Canaan by Joshua, the reigns of David and Solomon, and the life, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. The prophecy concludes with the sending of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles and the establishment of the early church.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Milton's Theological Perspective**\nJohn Milton was a devout Puritan with strong anti-Catholic and anti-hierarchical views. His poem reflects this theology. In Book XII, immediately after describing the mission of the Apostles, Michael prophesies that the Church will be corrupted by \"grievous wolves\" who will \"subvert\" pure doctrine and seek powerâ€”a clear criticism of the institutions (like the Papacy) that would later be responsible for canonizing historical saints. Milton famously derides \"hermits and friars, / White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery\" in Book III, consigning them to the \"Paradise of Fools.\" Given this hostile stance, it is highly improbable that he would mention any specific Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox saints by name as exemplars of faith.\n\n**Step 4: Search for Potential Candidates and Conclude**\n*   **Biblical Saints**: The poem is filled with named biblical figures who are saints (Abraham, Moses, David, Mary, etc.), but these do not fit the definition of \"historical saints.\"\n*   **Angelic Saints**: The poem names the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, who are venerated as saints. However, they are angels, not historical human figures.\n*   **Post-Biblical Figures**: A thorough search of the text for the names of prominent historical saints (such as Augustine, Constantine, Francis, Dominic, Aquinas, etc.) yields no results. The one post-biblical historical figure mentioned by name is the scientist Galileo (\"the Tuscan artist\" in Book III), but he is not a saint.\n\nThe narrative of *Paradise Lost* ends at the dawn of the Apostolic Age, and Milton's theology is critical of the subsequent developments in church history. Therefore, he includes no figures who fit the specific category of \"historical saints.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are zero historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<0>>>"
