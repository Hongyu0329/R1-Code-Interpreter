    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to design an observer for the discrete-time system `x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`, `y(k) = Cx(k)`. The observer's estimate `x_hat(k)` should converge to the true state `x(k)` in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer. The output should be the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\nThe standard Luenberger observer has the form:\n`x_hat(k+1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nwhere `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)`.\n\nThe observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` evolves according to the dynamics:\n`e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to be identically zero after a certain number of steps, the matrix `F = A - LC` must be nilpotent, meaning `F^m = 0` for some integer `m`. The goal is to find an `L` that makes this convergence happen in the minimum possible number of steps, `m_min`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Shortest Possible Convergence Time\nThe shortest possible convergence time for a deadbeat observer is given by the observability index, `ν`, of the system pair `(C, A)`. The observability index is the smallest integer `ν` such that the rank of the partial observability matrix `O_ν = [C^T, (CA)^T, ..., (CA^(ν-1))^T]^T` is equal to the state dimension, `n`. Here `n=4`.\n\nThe system matrices are:\nA = `[-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\nC = `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\n*   **For ν = 1:** The matrix is `C`.\n    `rank(C) = rank([1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]) = 2`. Since `rank < 4`, `ν > 1`.\n*   **For ν = 2:** We form the matrix `[C; CA]`.\n    `CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n    `rank([C; CA]) = rank([1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0])`. The row `[-1 0 0 1]` is a linear combination of the first two rows (`[1 0 0 1] - 2*[1 0 0 0]`), so the rank is 3. Since `rank < 4`, `ν > 2`.\n*   **For ν = 3:** We form the matrix `[C; CA; CA^2]`.\n    `CA^2 = CA * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0] * A = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\n    The matrix `[C; CA; CA^2]` contains the row `[2 1 0 -3]` from `CA^2`, which is linearly independent of the rows in `[C; CA]`. Thus, the rank is 4.\n\nThe observability index is `ν = 3`. This is the shortest possible number of steps for the error to become identically zero. We must find `L` such that `(A-LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Gain Matrix L\nOur design goal is to choose `L` such that `F = A - LC` has the property `F^3 = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the matrix `LC`.\n`LC = L * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\nThe second and third columns of `C` are zero vectors. This implies that the second and third columns of the product `LC` will also be zero vectors, regardless of the choice of `L`.\n*   Column 2 of `LC` = `L * [0; 0]` = `[0; 0; 0; 0]`\n*   Column 3 of `LC` = `L * [0; 0]` = `[0; 0; 0; 0]`\n\nThis means that in the matrix `F = A - LC`, the second and third columns are unalterable by `L` and are identical to the second and third columns of `A`.\n*   Column 2 of `F` = Column 2 of `A` = `[0; 0; 1; 0]`\n*   Column 3 of `F` = Column 3 of `A` = `[0; 0; 0; 1]`\n\nSo, `F` must have the form:\n`F = [ F11 0 0 F14 ]`\n    `[ F21 0 0 F24 ]`\n    `[ F31 1 0 F34 ]`\n    `[ F41 0 1 F44 ]`\n\nTo make `F` nilpotent as quickly as possible, we can try to make as many of its columns zero as possible. We can control columns 1 and 4 of `F` by choosing `L`. A very effective choice is to make columns 1 and 4 zero vectors.\n*   **Set Column 1 of F to zero:**\n    `F(:,1) = A(:,1) - LC(:,1) = 0  => LC(:,1) = A(:,1)`\n    `L * C(:,1) = L * [1; 1] = A(:,1) = [-1; 1; 0; -1]`\n*   **Set Column 4 of F to zero:**\n    `F(:,4) = A(:,4) - LC(:,4) = 0  => LC(:,4) = A(:,4)`\n    `L * C(:,4) = L * [0; 1] = A(:,4) = [1; 2; -1; -1]`\n\nLet `L` be composed of two column vectors, `L = [l_c1, l_c2]`.\nFrom `L * [0; 1] = A(:,4)`, we get `l_c2 = A(:,4)`.\n`l_c2 = [1; 2; -1; -1]`\n\nFrom `L * [1; 1] = A(:,1)`, we get `l_c1 + l_c2 = A(:,1)`.\n`l_c1 = A(:,1) - l_c2 = [-1; 1; 0; -1] - [1; 2; -1; -1] = [-2; -1; 1; 0]`\n\nNow we can construct the gain matrix `L`:\n`L = [l_c1, l_c2] = [-2 1; -1 2; 1 -1; 0 -1]`\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Design\nLet's verify that this `L` results in `(A-LC)^3 = 0`.\nWith this `L`, the resulting `F = A - LC` matrix is:\n`F = [ 0  A(:,2)  A(:,3)  0 ]`\n`F = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0]`\n\nNow we compute the powers of `F`:\n`F^2 = F * F = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0] * [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0]`\nThe third row of `F^2` is `[0 1 0 0] * F = (2nd row of F) = [0 0 0 0]`.\nThe fourth row of `F^2` is `[0 0 1 0] * F = (3rd row of F) = [0 1 0 0]`.\n`F^2 = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0]`\n\n`F^3 = F^2 * F = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0] * [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0]`\nThe fourth row of `F^3` is `[0 1 0 0] * F = (2nd row of F) = [0 0 0 0]`.\n`F^3 = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0] = 0`\n\nSince `(A-LC)^3 = 0` and `(A-LC)^2 ≠ 0`, the error is guaranteed to be zero in exactly 3 steps, which is the shortest possible time. The calculated gain matrix `L` is correct.\n\n<<<[-2 1; -1 2; 1 -1; 0 -1]>>>"
