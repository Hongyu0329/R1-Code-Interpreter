    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C solution and calculate the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Input:** A string containing a sum of numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, separated by '+' signs (e.g., \"3+1+2+1\").\n    *   **Task:** Rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order and print the new sum (e.g., \"1+1+2+3\").\n    *   **Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient*.\n    *   **Output:** The value `m`, which is the total memory in bytes consumed by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Design for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   **Avoid Storing the Input:** To minimize memory, we should avoid storing the entire input string. The maximum string length is 1000, so a character array like `char s[1001];` would use 1001 bytes. We can do much better by processing the input character by character as it's read using a function like `getchar()`.\n    *   **Use Counting Sort:** Since the numbers are from a very small and fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the most efficient sorting algorithm is Counting Sort. This algorithm only requires us to count the occurrences of each number. This avoids creating an intermediate array to store all the numbers from the input.\n    *   **Generate Output Directly:** After counting, we can iterate through our counters and print the result directly to standard output, without building a new string in memory. We will need to handle the placement of the '+' characters correctly.\n\n3.  **Variable Selection for Minimal Memory:**\n    Based on the chosen algorithm, we identify the necessary variables and select the smallest standard C data type that can safely hold their required values. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(short)` is 2, `sizeof(int)` is 4, and `sizeof(_Bool)` is 1.\n\n    *   **Counters for Numbers:** We need to count the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n        *   **Variable:** An array of four counters, `counts[4]`.\n        *   **Data Type:** The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The number of summands is at most `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, which rounds down to 500. A `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is too small. A `short` (range -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient and is smaller than an `int`.\n        *   **Memory:** `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n    *   **Input Character Holder:** To read the input character by character using `getchar()`, the variable must be an `int` to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value. A `char` is not sufficient for this.\n        *   **Variable:** A single variable, let's call it `c`.\n        *   **Data Type:** `int`.\n        *   **Memory:** `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n    *   **Output Formatting Flag:** To print the '+' symbol correctly (i.e., before every number except the first), we need a flag to track whether the first term has been printed.\n        *   **Variable:** A single boolean flag.\n        *   **Data Type:** The most memory-efficient type for a boolean flag is `_Bool` (available in C99 and later), which has a size of 1 byte.\n        *   **Memory:** `sizeof(_Bool) = 1` byte.\n\n    *   **Loop Counters:** To construct the output, a nested loop structure is clear and efficient. The outer loop iterates through the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the inner loop iterates up to the count of each number (~500 max).\n        *   **Variables:** Two loop counter variables, `i` and `j`.\n        *   **Data Type:** As with the counters, a `short` is sufficient for these loops.\n        *   **Memory:** `2 * sizeof(short) = 2 * 2 = 4` bytes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Input Processing:** The loop reading the input should handle `\\n` and `EOF` as termination conditions and ignore any character that is not a digit from '1' to '4'.\n*   **Variable Sizing:** It is crucial to use `short` instead of `int` where possible and `_Bool` instead of an `int` flag to achieve the lowest memory footprint. The `int` for `getchar()` is non-negotiable.\n*   **Compiler Padding:** This analysis calculates memory based on `sizeof(type)`, which is the standard interpretation for this kind of problem. It does not account for potential memory alignment or padding added by the compiler, which is implementation-specific and outside the scope of the program's variable definitions.\n\n### Final Calculation of Total Memory (m)\n\nNow, we sum the memory usage of all identified variables to find `m`.\n\n1.  Counters (`short counts[4]`): **8 bytes**\n2.  Input character (`int c`): **4 bytes**\n3.  Loop counters (`short i, j`): **4 bytes**\n4.  Formatting flag (`_Bool first`): **1 byte**\n\nTotal Memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17 bytes.\n\nThis is the total memory used by the variables in a highly optimized, memory-efficient C program for this problem.\n\n<<<17>>>"
