    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to understand the musical terms used in the question:\n\n*   **Tonic**: This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. We label it with the Roman numeral `I` in a major key (e.g., C major chord in the key of C major) or `i` in a minor key (e.g., A minor chord in the key of A minor).\n*   **Minor fifth chord**: This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n    *   In a **major key**, the natural fifth chord is major (labeled `V`). A \"minor fifth chord\" would be a modified, borrowed chord (labeled `v`). For example, in the key of G major, the tonic (`I`) is G major, and the minor fifth chord (`v`) would be D minor.\n    *   In a **minor key**, the natural fifth chord is already minor (labeled `v`). For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic (`i`) is A minor, and the minor fifth chord (`v`) is E minor.\n*   **Chord jump**: This implies a direct and prominent change from the first chord to the second, happening right at the beginning of the song.\n\nSo, we are looking for a song that starts with one of these two progressions:\n1.  **`I -> v`** (in a major key)\n2.  **`i -> v`** (in a minor key)\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Potential Candidates\n\nLet's analyze some well-known Beatles songs based on their opening chords. We are looking for one that matches either `I -> v` or `i -> v`.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is a common guess because of its moody, minor-key feel. It's in the key of F minor (for the verses). The tonic chord (`i`) is F minor (Fm). The song opens with the line \"Michelle, ma belle,\" which is harmonized with an **Fm** chord. The next line, \"These are words that go together well,\" moves to a **Db major** chord. This is a progression from `i -> VI` (tonic to the submediant). It does not go to the minor fifth chord (which would be C minor). Therefore, \"Michelle\" is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The song is in the key of A major. The first chord, under \"(I need) somebody,\" is **A major** (`I`). The next chord, under \"(Help!) not just any-,\" is a **C# minor** (`iii`). This is a `I -> iii` progression. It is not correct.\n\n*   **\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\"**: The key is D major (technically D Mixolydian, but the tonic is D major). The song starts with a **D major** chord (`I`). The chord on \"...had a girl\" is **G major** (`IV`). This is a `I -> IV` progression. It is not correct.\n\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\"**: This song is in the key of A minor.\n    *   The song begins immediately with vocals and an acoustic guitar playing an **A minor** chord (`i`, the tonic). The first line is \"You say you will love me...\".\n    *   The very next lyrical phrase, \"If I have to go...\", is accompanied by a chord change to **E minor**. The E minor chord is built on the fifth degree of the A minor scale, making it the **minor fifth chord** (`v`).\n\nThis progression, from **Am (`i`) to Em (`v`)**, is a perfect match for the question. The song \"starts\" with this chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the opening chord progressions of famous Beatles songs, \"Things We Said Today\" is the one that fits the description precisely. It begins in A minor and its first harmonic movement is a jump from the tonic chord (A minor) to the minor fifth chord (E minor).\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
