    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) on adjacent carbons (C1, C2) indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-Butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) is the solvent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base leads to an elimination reaction, specifically an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n**2. Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction:**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and the proton that is being removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar geometry translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. This means both the leaving group and the proton must be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**3. Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate:**\n*   (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. It exists in equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A (Diequatorial):** The bromine atom is equatorial, and the methyl group is also equatorial. This conformation is more stable because bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial position. However, in this conformation, the equatorial bromine atom does not have any anti-periplanar protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Therefore, **this conformation cannot undergo an E2 reaction.**\n    *   **Conformation B (Diaxial):** Through a ring-flip, the diequatorial conformation converts to a diaxial one. The bromine atom becomes axial, and the methyl group also becomes axial. This conformation is less stable due to 1,3-diaxial steric interactions. However, it is the only conformation from which an E2 reaction can proceed. According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the reaction will occur through this less stable but reactive conformation.\n\n**4. Identify the Site of Elimination:**\n*   We must now examine the reactive diaxial conformation (Conformation B) to see which proton can be removed. Let's assume the axial bromine on C1 is pointing up.\n*   **Proton on C2:** In the diaxial conformation, the methyl group on C2 is axial (pointing down). Therefore, the hydrogen atom on C2 is in an equatorial position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. **Elimination towards C2 cannot occur.** The product that would result from this path, 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product), is not formed.\n*   **Proton on C6:** Carbon 6 has two hydrogens. One is axial (pointing down) and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1 (Br is axial-up, H is axial-down). **Elimination can occur by abstracting this proton.**\n\n**5. Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n*   The E2 reaction proceeds by the tert-butoxide base removing the axial proton from C6, while the C-Br bond at C1 breaks simultaneously.\n*   This forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is not involved in the reaction and remains on its carbon.\n*   The resulting product has a double bond, and a methyl group on a carbon that is adjacent to one of the carbons of the double bond.\n\n**6. Name the Product:**\n*   To name the product using IUPAC rules, we must number the carbon ring.\n    *   The carbons of the double bond must be given the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n    *   The ring must then be numbered in a direction that gives the substituent (the methyl group) the lowest possible number.\n*   Let's call the carbons of the double bond \"original C1\" and \"original C6\". The methyl group is on \"original C2\".\n*   **Numbering Option 1:** Start numbering from \"original C6\" as the new C1, and \"original C1\" as the new C2. Continuing around the ring, \"original C2\" (where the methyl group is) becomes the new C3. This gives the name **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n*   **Numbering Option 2:** Start numbering from \"original C1\" as the new C1, and \"original C6\" as the new C2. Continuing around the ring, \"original C2\" becomes the new C6. This would give the name 6-methylcyclohexene.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, we choose the numbering that results in the lower locant for the substituent. Since 3 is lower than 6, the correct name is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction is stereospecific due to the trans-diaxial requirement of the E2 mechanism. This geometric constraint dictates that only the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene, 3-methylcyclohexene) can be formed. The Zaitsev product (the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene) cannot be formed because the proton on C2 is not in an axial position in the reactive conformer.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
