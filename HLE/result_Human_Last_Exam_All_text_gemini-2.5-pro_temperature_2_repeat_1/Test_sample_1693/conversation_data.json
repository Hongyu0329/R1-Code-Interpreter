    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific vessel based on four key criteria:\n*   **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II, but specifically *before* the Franco-German armistice was signed on 22 June 1940. The relevant period is from 3 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n*   **Metric of Size:** The ship must be the \"largest by displacement\". For commercial vessels like passenger liners or cargo ships, this is typically measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). For warships, it is measured in displacement tons. The largest vessels of this era were generally large passenger liners, so we will likely be comparing GRT.\n\n**2. Identifying Potential Candidates**\nWe need to search for French ships sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe and identify the largest ones. This involves looking at lists of U-boat victims from the early phase of the Battle of the Atlantic.\n\n*   **Initial Candidates (Merchant Ships/Liners):**\n    *   **SS *Bretagne*:** This French Line passenger liner was sunk on 14 October 1939 by a torpedo from the U-boat *U-45*. Her size was **10,108 GRT**. This is a significant loss and a strong early candidate.\n    *   **Other Merchant Ships:** A search of French merchant losses to U-boats in this period reveals other ships like *Vermont* (5,186 GRT), *Baoulé* (5,874 GRT), and *P.L.M. 25* (5,345 GRT), all of which are smaller than the *Bretagne*.\n\n*   **Considering French Warships:**\n    *   The largest French warships of the era were battleships like the *Dunkerque*-class (~26,500 tons) or *Richelieu*-class (~35,000 tons). However, none of these were sunk by U-boats before the armistice.\n    *   The French Navy did lose destroyers and a submarine to U-boats in this period (e.g., the submarine *Doris*, sunk by *U-9* in May 1940), but their displacement was very small in comparison (e.g., *Doris* was only 609 tons).\n\n**3. Investigating a Key Candidate: SS *Champlain***\nA thorough review of the period reveals another major French loss right before the armistice.\n*   **The ship:** The SS *Champlain* was a large and modern ocean liner belonging to the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (the French Line).\n*   **The sinking:** On 17 June 1940, while off the coast of La Rochelle, France, the *Champlain* struck a mine. The ship sank with the loss of approximately 11 lives.\n*   **The perpetrator:** The mine had been laid by the German submarine *U-65*.\n*   **The size:** The *Champlain*'s size was **28,124 GRT**.\n\n**4. Addressing Careful Points**\n\n*   **\"Sunk by a U-boat\": Does a mine count?** Yes. Laying mines was a primary and effective tactic for U-boats. A sinking caused by a mine laid by a specific U-boat is officially credited as a \"kill\" for that submarine. Therefore, the sinking of the *Champlain* is correctly attributed to the actions of *U-65*.\n*   **Timeline Confirmation:** The sinking on 17 June 1940 occurred five days *before* the armistice was signed on 22 June 1940, placing it squarely within the required timeframe.\n*   **Comparison of Displacement:**\n    *   SS *Champlain*: 28,124 GRT\n    *   SS *Bretagne*: 10,108 GRT\n    The *Champlain* was nearly three times the size of the next largest contender, the *Bretagne*. It was also larger in tonnage than any French warship sunk during this period.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the specific constraints of the question, we can systematically eliminate smaller vessels and warships. The largest French ships afloat were passenger liners. Comparing the two largest liners sunk by U-boat action before the armistice, the SS *Champlain* is clearly the largest by a significant margin.\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the ocean liner **SS *Champlain***. She was 28,124 GRT and was sunk on 17 June 1940 after striking a mine laid by the German submarine *U-65*.\n\n<<<The SS Champlain>>>"
