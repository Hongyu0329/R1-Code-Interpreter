    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics that evaluates the goodness of a population. It modifies Total Utilitarianism by introducing a \"critical level\" of welfare, let's call it `c`.\n\n*   According to this view, the value contributed by a person with welfare `w` is not `w` itself, but `w - c`.\n*   The total value of a population is the sum of these contributions: `Î£(w_i - c)`.\n*   A key feature is that for a person's life to be a net positive addition to the world's value, their welfare `w` must be greater than the critical level `c` (`w > c`).\n*   If a person's life has welfare that is positive but below the critical level (`0 < w < c`), adding that person to the population is considered a bad thing because it decreases the total value (`w - c` is negative).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth theorem proves that it's impossible for any single theory of population ethics to satisfy all of a set of seemingly desirable conditions. We need to analyze how critical-level views fare against these conditions. Let's examine each choice.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that if population A has the same number of people as B, everyone in A is better off than everyone in B, and welfare is distributed more equally in A, then A is better than B.\n*   **Analysis:** Critical-level views satisfy this. If everyone in A has welfare `w_A` and everyone in B has welfare `w_B` (with `n` people in each), and `w_A > w_B`, then the value of A is `n * (w_A - c)` and the value of B is `n * (w_B - c)`. Since `w_A > w_B`, it follows that `n * (w_A - c) > n * (w_B - c)`, so A is better than B.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a complex condition designed to ensure that quality is eventually prioritized over quantity, avoiding some forms of the Repugnant Conclusion. It essentially says that for any welfare level, no matter how many people are at it, a population of people at a higher welfare level can be better.\n*   **Analysis:** Critical-level views satisfy this. For any population of `n` people at welfare `w`, we can always find a better population of `m` people at a higher welfare `w'`. We just need to make `m` large enough so that `m * (w' - c)` is greater than `n * (w - c)`. This is always possible.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that for any population of very happy people (high welfare), there is some better population consisting of a sufficiently large number of people with low but positive welfare.\n*   **Analysis:** This is where critical-level views run into trouble. Let's set a positive critical level, for instance, `c = 10`.\n    *   Consider Population A: One person with a very high welfare of `w_A = 100`. The value of this population is `100 - c = 100 - 10 = 90`. This is a positive value.\n    *   Now, consider adding people with \"low but positive welfare.\" Let's pick a welfare level `w_B = 5`. This life is worth living (`w_B > 0`), but it's below the critical level (`w_B < c`).\n    *   According to Non-Elitism, there should be some number of people, `m`, at welfare level `w_B = 5` that would create a better population (Population B).\n    *   Let's calculate the value of Population B with `m` people. The value is `V_B = m * (w_B - c) = m * (5 - 10) = -5m`.\n    *   The condition requires that we can find an `m` such that `V_B > V_A`, which means `-5m > 90`. This inequality can never be satisfied for any positive number of people `m`. In fact, the more people we add at this low (but positive) welfare level, the *worse* the population becomes.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views violate the Non-Elitism principle.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that adding a person with negative welfare (a life of suffering) makes a population worse, all else equal.\n*   **Analysis:** Critical-level views satisfy this. A person with negative welfare `w < 0` contributes `w - c` to the total value. Since `c` is typically positive, `w - c` is a significantly negative number, so adding this person clearly makes the population worse.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that there exists at least one type of life with positive welfare such that adding a person with that life always makes a population better.\n*   **Analysis:** Critical-level views satisfy this. Any life with welfare `w` that is greater than the critical level `c` qualifies. Adding a person with `w > c` contributes a positive value (`w - c`), thereby always making the population better.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the only condition from the list that is violated by critical-level views (with a positive critical level) is Non-Elitism. They are \"elitist\" in the sense that they reject the idea that a large number of low-welfare lives can outweigh a small number of high-welfare lives, especially if that low welfare is below the critical level.\n\n<<<C>>>"
