To decrypt a Vigen√®re cipher without knowing the key, the first step is to determine the key's length. This is typically done using the Kasiski examination (by finding the distances between repeated segments of ciphertext) or by using the Index of Coincidence (by testing which potential key length results in letter frequencies that are the least random). Once the key length 'L' is found, the ciphertext is broken into L separate sets of letters, with each set being a simple Caesar cipher. Finally, frequency analysis is performed on each set to determine the individual letter of the key for that set, ultimately revealing the entire key.
