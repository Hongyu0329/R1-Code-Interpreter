    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor `d`**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n1.  Check for small prime factors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n2.  Try dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n3.  Try dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n4.  Try dividing 589 by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n5.  31 is a prime number.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let's denote the primes as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters for this Conductor**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nThe conductor of $\\chi$, denoted $f(\\chi)$, is the product of the conductors of its components: $f(\\chi) = f(\\chi_1)f(\\chi_2)f(\\chi_3)f(\\chi_4)$.\n\nA character is *primitive* if its conductor is equal to its modulus. So, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $d$, we must have $f(\\chi)=d$.\n\nFor a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$, its conductor $f(\\chi_i)$ is $p_i$ if $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character, and $f(\\chi_i)=1$ if $\\chi_i$ is the principal character (the character of order 1).\n\nTherefore, for $f(\\chi) = d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, it must be that $f(\\chi_i) = p_i$ for all $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. This is equivalent to saying that each component character $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal. A character is non-principal if and only if its order is greater than 1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The condition for $\\chi$ to be primitive is that each component character $\\chi_i$ must have an order greater than 1.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Order of the Character**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. Then $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\nSo, we must have $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Possible Orders of Component Characters**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic and isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(p)=p-1$. The order of any character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of this group, i.e., $o_i$ must divide $p_i-1$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$ implies that each individual order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that for a primitive character, $o_i > 1$. So, the possible orders for each component are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's verify if these orders are possible for each component:\n*   For $\\chi_1 \\pmod 7$: Group order is $\\phi(7)=6$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 6. So, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $\\chi_2 \\pmod{13}$: Group order is $\\phi(13)=12$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 12. So, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $\\chi_3 \\pmod{19}$: Group order is $\\phi(19)=18$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 18. So, characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $\\chi_4 \\pmod{31}$: Group order is $\\phi(31)=30$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 30. So, characters of these orders exist.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** For each prime factor $p_i$ of the conductor, we have confirmed that non-principal characters whose orders divide 6 (i.e., orders 2, 3, 6) exist.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $i$, and $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\nThe number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (with $k|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's count the number of choices for each component $\\chi_i$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n1.  **Count all primitive characters whose order divides 6.**\n    This means for each component $\\chi_i$, its order $o_i$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    For each component $i$, the number of available characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are 4 components, the total number of such character tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.**\n    Since all component orders $o_i$ divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. The cases where the lcm is not 6 are those where it is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.\n    *   **lcm = 1**: This would mean all $o_i = 1$. But we required $o_i > 1$ for the character to be primitive. So, this case is not possible.\n    *   **lcm divides 2 (i.e., lcm = 2)**: This happens if and only if all component orders $o_i$ divide 2. Since $o_i>1$, this means $o_i=2$ for all $i$. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    The total number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **lcm divides 3 (i.e., lcm = 3)**: This happens if and only if all component orders $o_i$ divide 3. Since $o_i>1$, this means $o_i=3$ for all $i$. The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    The total number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The set of characters whose order-lcm divides 2 and the set whose order-lcm divides 3 are disjoint (except for the case of lcm=1, which is already excluded). An lcm cannot be both 2 and 3. So we can simply subtract these counts.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Number of characters of order 6 = (Total characters with order dividing 6) - (Characters with order dividing 2) - (Characters with order dividing 3)\n    Number = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is the number of tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ for the moduli $(7, 13, 19, 31)$ such that the least common multiple of their orders is 6.\n\n*   Total primitive characters whose order divides 6: $(\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n*   Primitive characters whose order divides 2 (i.e. is 2): $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n*   Primitive characters whose order divides 3 (i.e. is 3): $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   The number of characters with order exactly 6 is $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
