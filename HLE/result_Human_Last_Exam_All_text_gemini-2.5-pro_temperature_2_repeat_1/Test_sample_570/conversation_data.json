    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects a specific family of lines.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are looking for the minimal area of a convex domain, let's call it `K`, in the Cartesian plane. This domain `K` must intersect every line defined by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Family of Lines\nThe set of lines `L_{p,q}` is defined by `px + qy = 1` with `gcd(p, q) = 1`. Let's consider some specific lines from this family:\n- If `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n- If `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n- If `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n- If `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\nSince `K` must intersect all these lines, it must have points with x-coordinates of 1 and -1, and points with y-coordinates of 1 and -1.\nBecause `K` is convex:\n- `sup {x | (x, y) in K} >= 1`\n- `inf {x | (x, y) in K} <= -1`\n- `sup {y | (x, y) in K} >= 1`\n- `inf {y | (x, y) in K} <= -1`\nThis implies that the width of `K` in the x-direction must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`, and its width in the y-direction must also be at least 2. This suggests a candidate shape, the square `S = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`, which has an area of 4. We can verify that `S` does indeed intersect all the required lines. However, this is not the minimal area.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Intersection Condition\nA convex set `K` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` if and only if the range of the linear function `f(x, y) = px + qy` over the domain `K` contains the value 1. That is:\n`inf_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy) <= 1 <= sup_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy)`\n\nThis condition must hold for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. Note that if `(p, q)` are coprime, so are `(-p, -q)`.\nThe line for `(-p, -q)` is `-px - qy = 1`, which is equivalent to `px + qy = -1`.\nSo, for any `(p, q) \\in L'` (the set of primitive integer vectors), `K` must intersect both `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1`.\nThis gives a stronger condition:\n- `sup_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy) >= 1`\n- `inf_{(x,y) in K} (px + qy) <= -1`\n\n### Step 4: Symmetrization of the Domain\nLet `K` be any such convex domain. Consider its central symmetrization, `K_s = (1/2)(K - K) = { (x - y)/2 | x, y in K }`.\n- `K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex domain (symmetric about the origin).\n- By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K) >= Area(K_s)`. To find the minimal area for `K`, we can first find the minimal area for a centrally symmetric `K_s`.\n\nLet's find the condition for `K_s`. The support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(p, q) = sup_{z in K_s} (pz_x + qz_y)`.\n`h_{K_s}(p,q) = (1/2) * [sup_K(px+qy) - inf_K(px+qy)]`.\nFrom Step 3, `sup_K(px+qy) >= 1` and `inf_K(px+qy) <= -1`.\nTherefore, `sup_K - inf_K >= 1 - (-1) = 2`.\nSo, `h_{K_s}(p, q) >= (1/2) * 2 = 1`.\nThis means we are looking for the minimum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K_s` whose support function `h_{K_s}(p,q)` is at least 1 for all coprime integer vectors `(p, q)`.\n\n### Step 5: Using Duality (Polar Bodies)\nFor any centrally symmetric convex body `B` containing the origin, its polar body `B*` is defined as `B* = { (u,v) | ux + vy <= 1 for all (x,y) in B }`. This is equivalent to `B* = { (u,v) | h_B(u,v) <= 1 }`.\nThe condition `h_{K_s}(p, q) >= 1` for all coprime `(p, q)` means that no such primitive integer vector can lie in the *interior* of the polar body `K_s*`.\nSo, `K_s*` is a centrally symmetric convex set whose interior does not contain any primitive integer points `(p,q)`.\n\nLet `v = (p,q)` be any non-zero integer vector. We can write `v = k * v'`, where `k` is an integer `(k = gcd(p,q) >= 1)` and `v'` is a primitive integer vector. If `v` lies in the interior of `K_s*`, which is a convex and centrally symmetric set, then the entire line segment `[-v, v]` lies in its interior. This segment contains the primitive vector `v'`. Therefore, the condition \"no primitive integer points in the interior\" is equivalent to \"no non-zero integer points in the interior\".\n\n### Step 6: Applying Minkowski's Theorem and Mahler's Inequality\nWe are now looking for a centrally symmetric convex set `K_s*` which contains no non-zero integer lattice points in its interior. By Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies, the area of such a set is bounded: `Area(K_s*) <= 4`. To minimize `Area(K_s)`, we must maximize `Area(K_s*)`. So we should choose `K_s*` to have the maximal possible area, which is 4.\n\nThe relationship between the area of a centrally symmetric convex body `B` and its polar `B*` in the plane is given by the Blaschke-SantalÃ³ inequality and Mahler's conjecture (proven for 2D):\n`8 <= Area(B) * Area(B*) <= pi^2`\nThe minimum, 8, is achieved when `B` is a parallelogram.\nWe can write `Area(K_s) >= 8 / Area(K_s*)`.\nTo minimize `Area(K_s)`, we need to maximize `Area(K_s*)`. The maximum is 4.\n`Area(K_s) >= 8 / 4 = 2`.\nThis establishes that the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 7: Constructing the Minimal Domain\nWe need to check if this lower bound of 2 is achievable. The minimum `Area(K_s)=2` is achieved if `Area(K_s*) = 4` and `K_s` is a parallelogram.\nLet's choose a set for `K_s*` with area 4 that satisfies the conditions. The square `S* = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]` works. Its interior `(-1, 1) x (-1, 1)` contains no non-zero integer points, and its area is 4.\nNow we find its polar, which will be our candidate for `K_s`.\n`K_s = (S*)* = { (x, y) | px + qy <= 1 for all (p,q) in [-1,1]x[-1,1] }`.\nThe maximum value of `px + qy` for `(p,q)` in the square `[-1,1]x[-1,1]` is `|x| + |y|`.\nSo, `K_s` is the region defined by `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\nThis is a square with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`. Its area is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n\n### Step 8: Final Verification\nThe domain `K = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| <= 1 }` is a convex domain with area 2. We need to check if it intersects all lines `px+qy=1` with `gcd(p,q)=1`.\nSince `K` is centrally symmetric, we just need to check that its support function `h_K(p,q) >= 1`.\nThe support function `h_K(p, q)` for `|x| + |y| <= 1` is given by the maximum of `px+qy` over the region. The maximum must be at one of the vertices `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. The values are `p, q, -p, -q`.\nSo, `h_K(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe condition is `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, they cannot both be zero.\n- If `p = 0`, then `gcd(0, q) = |q| = 1`, so `max(0, 1) = 1`. The condition holds.\n- If `q = 0`, then `gcd(p, 0) = |p| = 1`, so `max(1, 0) = 1`. The condition holds.\n- If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, `|p| >= 1` and `|q| >= 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`. The condition holds.\nThe domain `|x| + |y| <= 1` satisfies all conditions and has an area of 2. Since we proved that the minimal area is at least 2, this must be the minimal area.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1. The problem is to find the minimum area of a convex set `K` that intersects all lines `px+qy=1` where `p,q` are coprime integers.\n2. This implies `K` must also intersect `px+qy=-1`, leading to the condition that the width of `K` in any primitive direction `(p,q)` is at least `2/sqrt(p^2+q^2)`.\n3. Symmetrizing `K` to `K_s` preserves convexity and can only decrease the area. The condition on `K_s` becomes that its support function `h_{K_s}(p,q) >= 1` for all coprime `(p,q)`.\n4. Using duality, the polar body `K_s^*` must be a centrally symmetric convex set with no non-zero integer points in its interior.\n5. By Minkowski's theorem, `Area(K_s^*) <= 4`.\n6. Using the property `Area(K_s) * Area(K_s^*) >= 8`, we get `Area(K) >= Area(K_s) >= 8 / Area(K_s^*) >= 8/4 = 2`.\n7. The area of 2 is shown to be achievable by the convex set `|x|+|y|<=1`, which is the polar of the square `[-1,1]x[-1,1]`.\n\nThe minimal area is 2.\n\n>>>2"
