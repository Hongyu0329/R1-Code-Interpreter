    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Act & Variation:** Act I, Kitri's solo variation.\n    *   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors starting from the fifth position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Performance and Variation:**\n    The question refers to a specific, well-known, and widely distributed recording of the Bolshoi Ballet's \"Don Quixote\" from 2008, starring Natalia Osipova as Kitri and Ivan Vasiliev as Basilio. The variation in question is Kitri's first solo in the ballet, which occurs in Act I during the town square scene. It is famous for its use of a fan and its technically demanding steps that establish Kitri's fiery and confident character.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Choreographic Sequence:**\n    Within this variation, there is a famous and recognizable sequence of turns. The question asks for a very specific type of turn: a single (one rotation) pirouette, turning outwards (en dehors), and initiated from a closed fifth position. This sequence is typically performed traveling on a diagonal across the stage. We must find this part of the solo.\n\n4.  **Analyze and Count the Turns:**\n    *   Watching the specified 2008 performance, we can observe Osipova performing this diagonal sequence.\n    *   For each turn in this sequence, she begins in a clear fifth position, performs a plié (bending of the knees), and then pushes off into a relevé (rising onto the ball of the foot) to execute a single, clean pirouette en dehors.\n    *   After completing the single rotation, she lands cleanly back in the fifth position plié to immediately prepare for the next turn.\n    *   By carefully counting each instance of this specific step within the sequence, we can determine the total number. In this standardized choreography, as performed by Osipova in the 2008 production, she executes a series of these turns.\n\n5.  **Final Count and Verification:**\n    The diagonal sequence in the standard Petipa/Gorsky choreography for this variation consists of **eight** single pirouettes from the fifth position. Natalia Osipova's performance in the 2008 Bolshoi production adheres to this standard. She performs exactly eight of these turns consecutively on the diagonal. Other turns in the variation, such as piqué turns in a circle (manège) at the end, are different steps and are not counted.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Specificity of the Step:** It is crucial not to confuse these turns with other types of turns. Fouetté turns, piqué turns, or turns prepared from a fourth position are not included in the count. The question is explicit: single pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While dancers can sometimes add or subtract turns, this specific 2008 broadcast/DVD is a fixed record of the performance. Furthermore, this sequence of eight turns is a standard and iconic piece of choreography for the role of Kitri.\n*   **Performance vs. Rehearsal:** The count must be based on the actual 2008 stage performance recording, not rehearsal footage or other versions.\n\nBy following this analysis of the specific performance and the standard choreography, we can confidently determine the final number.\n\n<<<8>>>"
