    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means calculations for position are done modulo 5. For a position `(r, c)`, both `r` and `c` are in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   **Queen's Attack:** A queen at `(r, c)` attacks all squares in:\n    1.  The same row `r`.\n    2.  The same column `c`.\n    3.  The same \"forward\" diagonals, which are cells `(x, y)` where `x - y ≡ r - c (mod 5)`.\n    4.  The same \"backward\" diagonals, which are cells `(x, y)` where `x + y ≡ r + c (mod 5)`.\n*   **Problem:** We need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens on this board such that no two queens attack each other. Let the positions of the four queens be `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`.\n\n*   **Conditions for a Valid Placement:**\n    1.  **Rows:** The `r` coordinates (`r1, r2, r3, r4`) must all be distinct.\n    2.  **Columns:** The `c` coordinates (`c1, c2, c3, c4`) must all be distinct.\n    3.  **Forward Diagonals:** The values `ri - ci (mod 5)` must all be distinct.\n    4.  **Backward Diagonals:** The values `ri + ci (mod 5)` must all be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nA arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens is an \"incomplete\" solution. Let's consider what a \"complete\" solution of 5 non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board looks like. For 5 queens to be non-attacking, they must occupy 5 different rows, 5 different columns, 5 different forward diagonals, and 5 different backward diagonals.\n\nAny set of 4 non-attacking queens `{(r1, c1), ..., (r4, c4)}` leaves one row (`r_u`), one column (`c_u`), one forward diagonal (`d_u`), and one backward diagonal (`s_u`) unused. These unused elements define a single \"phantom\" square `(r_u, c_u)`. If we were to place a 5th queen on this square, it would not attack any of the other 4 queens. It can be shown that this 5th queen completes the set, meaning the five queens together form a valid 5-queen solution.\n\nTherefore, every valid 4-queen arrangement corresponds to exactly one 5-queen solution with one queen removed. This simplifies the problem: we can first find the number of all possible 5-queen solutions, and then count how many 4-queen arrangements can be generated from them.\n\n### Step 3: Find all 5-Queen Solutions on the 5x5 Toroidal Board\n\nIt is a known result in mathematics (due to Pólya and others) that for a `p x p` toroidal board where `p` is a prime number and `p ≥ 5`, all solutions to the `p`-queens problem are \"linear\". This means the coordinates `(r, c)` of the queens must follow a linear equation:\n`c ≡ ar + b (mod p)`\nwhere `a` and `b` are constants in `{0, 1, ..., p-1}`.\n\nFor our 5x5 board, `p=5`, and the equation is `c ≡ ar + b (mod 5)`. For this to represent a valid 5-queen solution, placing a queen at `(r, ar+b)` for each row `r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4` must satisfy all non-attacking conditions.\n\n1.  **Distinct Rows:** We iterate through `r = 0,1,2,3,4`, so rows are distinct by construction.\n2.  **Distinct Columns:** The columns are `c = ar+b`. For these to be distinct for each `r`, the function `f(r) = ar+b` must be a permutation of `{0,1,2,3,4}`. This is true if and only if the slope `a` is not zero modulo 5. `a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n3.  **Distinct Forward Diagonals:** The diagonal indices are `d = r - c = r - (ar+b) = (1-a)r - b`. This function must also be a permutation, which requires its slope `(1-a)` to be non-zero. So `1-a ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, which means `a ≠ 1`.\n4.  **Distinct Backward Diagonals:** The diagonal indices are `s = r + c = r + (ar+b) = (1+a)r + b`. This requires the slope `(1+a)` to be non-zero. So `1+a ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, which means `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n\nCombining these constraints, `a` must be an element of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` but cannot be `1` or `4`.\n*   **Valid choices for `a`:** `{2, 3}`. (2 choices)\n*   The constant `b` (the column of the queen in row 0) can be any value from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. (5 choices)\n\nSo, the total number of 5-queen solutions is `2 (choices for a) * 5 (choices for b) = 10`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of 4-Queen Arrangements\n\nEach of the 10 distinct 5-queen solutions is a set of 5 non-attacking queen positions. To get a 4-queen arrangement, we can simply remove any one of the 5 queens.\n\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions = 10.\n*   Number of ways to remove one queen from a set of 5 = 5.\n\nThis gives a total of `10 * 5 = 50` possible ways.\n\nWe must ensure that this method does not overcount. Overcounting would occur if removing a queen from one 5-queen solution (`S1`) could result in the same set of 4 queens as removing a queen from a different 5-queen solution (`S2`). This would imply that `S1` and `S2` share 4 queens.\n\nLet's check if two different 5-queen solutions can share 4 queens.\nLet `S1 = {(r, ar+b)}` and `S2 = {(r, a'r+b')}` be two different solutions.\n*   **Case 1: `a = a'`.** Since the solutions are different, `b ≠ b'`. A queen at `(r, c)` is shared if `c = ar+b` and `c = ar+b'`. This implies `b=b'`, which is a contradiction. Thus, if the slope `a` is the same, the solutions are completely disjoint.\n*   **Case 2: `a ≠ a'`.** Let `a=2` and `a'=3`. A queen at `(r, c)` is shared if `c = 2r+b` and `c = 3r+b'`. This gives `2r+b = 3r+b'`, which solves to `r = b-b'`. For any given pair of solutions (i.e., fixed `b` and `b'`), there is only one row `r` where a queen can be shared.\n\nTherefore, any two distinct 5-queen solutions on this board can share at most one queen. They can never share 4 queens. This means that each time we choose a 5-queen solution and remove one queen, we generate a unique 4-queen arrangement. There is no overcounting.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is the number of 5-queen solutions multiplied by the number of queens in each solution.\nNumber of ways = `10 * 5 = 50`.\n\n<<<50>>>"
