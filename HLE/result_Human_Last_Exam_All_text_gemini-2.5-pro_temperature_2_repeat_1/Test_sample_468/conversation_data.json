    "This request requires a step-by-step analysis to determine the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year that name was established.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Scientific Name and Native Range:**\n    *   The genus in question is *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*.\n    *   The native range for this genus is primarily the arid and semi-arid regions of North and Central America, especially the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. The common name would therefore be the one used in this region, particularly in English.\n\n2.  **Determine the Current Common Name:**\n    *   A search of reputable entomological sources, including university extension websites (e.g., University of California), museum collections, and authoritative insect identification guides (like BugGuide.net and \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Wilson & Carril), is necessary.\n    *   These sources consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* by the common name **Fairy bees**.\n    *   This name is fitting due to the bees' extremely small size (often only 2-3 mm long) and their frequently iridescent or pale coloration, giving them a delicate, ethereal appearance. As of 2024, this remains the most widely accepted and used common name.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:**\n    *   Unlike formal scientific names, common names often lack a single, official \"coining\" date. They typically enter the lexicon through influential publications. The goal is to find the earliest significant and formal usage of the term \"Fairy bees\" in relation to the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   Historical research points to the work of prominent mid-20th-century entomologists who specialized in California insects.\n    *   The term was prominently introduced and popularized by entomologists E. Gorton Linsley and Charles D. Michener.\n    *   They published a key paper in *The Pomona College Journal of Entomology and Zoology* in **1938**.\n    *   The title of this publication is \"Some 'Fairy Bees' of California (Hymenoptera, Andrenidae)\", which explicitly applies this common name to the genus *Perdita*. The use of quotation marks in the original title suggests they were formalizing a new or descriptive term. This is the most reliable and citable origin for the name.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinction:** It is crucial not to confuse the date the genus was scientifically described (1853 by Frederick Smith) with the date its common name was coined.\n*   **\"Coining\" vs. \"Usage\":** While the term might have been used informally before 1938, the Linsley and Michener paper represents the first major, formal publication that cemented \"Fairy bees\" as the common name for *Perdita*. For the purpose of providing a specific year, this is the most accurate milestone.\n*   **Current Relevance:** The name has remained in continuous use in both scientific and popular literature since its introduction and is the standard common name used today (2024).\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   **Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year Coined:** 1938\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy bees, 1938\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1938>>>"
