The trace of the local second heat kernel coefficient, $\text{tr}_V(a_2(x, D_A^2))$, is given by the sum of a gauge part and a gravitational part:
$$ \text{tr}_V(a_2(x)) = \frac{2}{3} g^2 C(r) F_{\mu\nu}^c F_c^{\mu\nu} + \text{dim}(r) \left( \frac{1}{60}C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}C^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{180} E_4 \right) $$
where $g$ is the gauge coupling constant, $F_{\mu\nu}^c$ is the gauge field strength, $C(r)$ and $\text{dim}(r)$ are the index and dimension of the gauge representation $r$, $C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is the Weyl curvature tensor, and $E_4$ is the integrand of the Gauss-Bonnet term.
