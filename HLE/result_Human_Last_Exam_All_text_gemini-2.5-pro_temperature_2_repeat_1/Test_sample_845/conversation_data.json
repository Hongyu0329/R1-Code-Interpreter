    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\n*   **Core Topic:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n*   **Measurement Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n*   **Fundamental Data:** The system captures \"beat-to-beat intervals.\"\n*   **Core Question:** HRV is computed from a \"value between heartbeats.\" What is the name of this value?\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the average number of heartbeats over a period, usually one minute (beats per minute or bpm).\n*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the rate itself but the measure of the *variation* in time between successive heartbeats. High variability is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable cardiovascular system, while low variability can indicate stress or health issues.\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval:** This is the raw data used to calculate both HR and HRV. It is the precise amount of time that passes from one heartbeat to the next.\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:**\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** Measures the electrical activity of the heart. The most prominent feature of an ECG waveform is the \"QRS complex,\" with the \"R-wave\" being the highest peak. The time between two consecutive R-waves is the gold standard for measuring the beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** Measures changes in blood volume in the capillaries, which correspond to the pulse wave generated by each heartbeat. It does not measure electrical activity directly. The time is measured from the peak of one pulse wave to the peak of the next.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Specific Term for the \"Value between Heartbeats\"\n\n1.  The question is asking for the name of the time interval between consecutive beats.\n2.  In the context of an ECG, this interval is called the **R-R interval** (or RR interval), named after the R-waves it connects.\n3.  Although PPG measures pulse peaks (P-waves, not to be confused with the P-wave in an ECG) and the interval is technically a \"Peak-to-Peak\" (PP) interval, the term **R-R interval** has become the standard and most widely used term in scientific and medical literature for the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of whether it was measured with an ECG or a PPG device.\n4.  Another common, more general term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n5.  However, **R-R interval** is the most specific and universally recognized term in the context of HRV analysis. When a device reports HRV data, the raw time intervals are almost always referred to as R-R intervals.\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points\n\n*   **Source Signal Distinction:** It is crucial to understand that PPG and ECG are different technologies. PPG measures pulse waves (blood flow), while ECG measures electrical cardiac activity.\n*   **Terminology Crossover:** Despite the technical difference in the source signal, the terminology from ECG (R-R interval) is pervasively used for PPG-derived beat-to-beat intervals when discussing HRV.\n*   **Value vs. Metric:** The question asks for the name of the raw value (the time interval itself), not the statistical metrics calculated from these values (like SDNN or RMSSD, which are measures of variability).\n*   **Synonyms:** Be aware that \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI) is a correct, albeit more general, term. \"R-R interval\" is the most common technical term in HRV studies.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude and Formulate the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, used to compute HRV, is most commonly and technically referred to as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
