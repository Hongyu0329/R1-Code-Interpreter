    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe user wants to identify a specific Christian theologian based on a set of criteria:\n1.  **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a formal, defined set of terms, not just a general discussion.\n3.  **Purpose:** The terminology is used to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n4.  **Application:** This terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    a. The virgin birth of Jesus (a singular, miraculous event).\n    b. Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, cosmic change).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core Concepts\n*   **Laws of Nature:** In a theological context, this refers to the consistent, observable order of the created world which God established and sustains.\n*   **Changes in Laws of Nature:** This can mean two things:\n    1.  A temporary suspension or bypassing of a natural law for a specific purpose (a miracle).\n    2.  A fundamental and permanent alteration of how the natural order itself functions.\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle (point 1 above), where the normal law of human reproduction is bypassed.\n*   **The Fall:** Theologians who believe the Fall had cosmic consequences argue that it caused a fundamental change in the natural order (point 2 above), introducing principles like decay, human death, and enmity into creation that were not present before.\n\nThe question requires finding a theologian who created a single terminological system that can account for both types of \"changes.\"\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates\n*   **Early Church Fathers (e.g., Augustine of Hippo):** Augustine wrote extensively on miracles and the consequences of the Fall. He spoke of God acting outside the usual \"course of nature\" (*cursus naturæ*). He viewed miracles as part of God's higher, hidden plan, not as a violation of it. While his thought provides a foundation, he did not create a single, formal terminological system like the one described. His explanation for the Fall's effects on nature often centers on humanity's loss of supernatural gifts (like immortality), which then subjected humans to the already-existing potential for decay, rather than a rewriting of physical laws themselves.\n\n*   **Medieval Scholastic Theologians:** This era is known for creating precise, systematic theological language. This makes it a very likely source.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274):** Aquinas is the most prominent candidate. In his efforts to systematize theology and integrate it with Aristotelian philosophy, he made a crucial and influential distinction between God's power in two modes:\n        1.  ***Potentia Ordinata*** **(Ordained Power):** This is God's power as He chooses to exercise it through the consistent, regular order that He has established. This is the basis for what we call the \"laws of nature.\"\n        2.  ***Potentia Absoluta*** **(Absolute Power):** This is God's power in itself, unconstrained by the order He created. It refers to everything God *can* do (i.e., anything not logically self-contradictory), including acting outside the *potentia ordinata*.\n\n*   **Reformation and Modern Theologians:** Thinkers like Calvin, Luther, or later figures like C.S. Lewis discussed these issues, but they were generally building upon or reacting to earlier frameworks rather than originating a new, foundational terminology for this specific problem. They affirmed the reality of the events but did not create the primary technical vocabulary for them.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Best Candidate's Terminology to the Question's Examples\nLet's test the terminology of Thomas Aquinas against the question's criteria:\n\n*   **Is it \"specialized terminology\"?** Yes, *potentia ordinata* and *potentia absoluta* are technical Latin terms from scholastic theology.\n*   **Does it describe \"changes in the laws of nature\"?** Yes, perfectly. It distinguishes between the normal laws (*potentia ordinata*) and God's ability to act outside of them or change them (*potentia absoluta*).\n*   **Is it applicable to the virgin birth?** Yes. The virgin birth is a textbook example of God using his *potentia absoluta* to work outside the established *potentia ordinata* of normal human conception.\n*   **Is it applicable to alterations at the Fall?** Yes. The framework allows a theologian to describe the consequences of the Fall as God, via His *potentia absoluta*, changing the very system of the *potentia ordinata*. The \"laws\" of the pre-Fall world (e.g., without human death or certain forms of decay) could have been a different ordained order, which was then altered by God to the current ordained order we experience post-Fall.\n\n### Conclusion\nThomas Aquinas is the theologian who first developed the influential and specialized terminological framework—the distinction between *potentia ordinata* and *potentia absoluta*—that provides the precise tools to describe both a singular miracle that bypasses natural law (the virgin birth) and a systemic change in the laws of nature themselves (the consequences of the Fall).\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
