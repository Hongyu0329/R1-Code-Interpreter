    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad*\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all mountains that are explicitly mentioned by name in the text of the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous mountain, home to the twelve Olympian gods. It is mentioned throughout the epic. The question explicitly asks us to exclude this mountain.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is critically important in the *Iliad*. It is located in the Troad (the region around Troy) and is used by the gods, particularly Zeus, as a vantage point to watch the Trojan War unfold below. Hera also famously seduces Zeus on its peak, Gargarus, in Book 14.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (modern name Fengari):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of \"wooded Samothrace\" to watch the battle, as from this vantage point he could see Mount Ida, the city of Troy, and the Achaean ships.\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain is mentioned by name in Book 14 during the goddess Hera's journey from Olympus to Mount Ida. Homer describes her passing \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen... and from their crest she came down upon Athos, and upon the sea.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned multiple times, not as a location for divine action, but as the source of the great ash spear wielded by Achilles. This spear was cut from a tree on its summit and given to Achilles' father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm they are \"Historical\" Mountains\n\nAll the mountains listed above are real, physical mountains that can be located on a map today.\n\n*   Mount Olympus is in northern Greece.\n*   Mount Ida is in modern Turkey (as Kaz Dağı).\n*   Mount Samothrace (Fengari) is on the Greek island of Samothrace.\n*   Mount Athos is a mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   Mount Pelion is in the region of Thessaly, Greece.\n\n### Step 3: Find and Compare the Elevations of these Mountains\n\nTo find the tallest after Olympus, we need to compare their peak elevations.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft) - This is our reference, but it is excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Athos:** **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Answer\n\nBy comparing the elevations of the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* (excluding Mount Olympus), we can rank them by height:\n1.  **Mount Athos** (2,033 m)\n2.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n3.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n4.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\nThe tallest historical mountain on the list after Mount Olympus is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
