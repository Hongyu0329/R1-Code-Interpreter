    "This problem asks for the conditions under which a system of three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, has a specific type of fixed point, which we will call an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is an extension of the famous Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a system of equations.\n\n### Initial Analysis and Clarifications\n\n1.  **Function Definitions and Typo Correction**: The question provides `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. It is highly probable that the second function `G` is a typo and should be a distinct function, `H`. We will proceed with the analysis assuming the functions are:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\n2.  **Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a triplet `(x, y, z)` belonging to the product space `X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n    *   `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    *   `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    *   `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Conditions\n\nThe core idea is to treat the system of three equations as a single fixed-point equation on the product space `S = X × Y × Z`. We will then apply the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, which requires the space to be a complete metric space and the operator to be a contraction mapping.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Space and its Properties**\n\nTo use the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the underlying spaces must be complete metric spaces.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces.\n*   We define a new space `S` as the Cartesian product `S = X × Y × Z`.\n*   We can equip `S` with a metric `d`. A common choice is the sum metric, defined for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `S` as:\n    `d(p1, p2) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   **Condition 1: Completeness.** For the Banach theorem to apply, the space `(S, d)` must be complete. The product of complete metric spaces is itself a complete metric space. Therefore, the first condition is that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must all be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**Step 2: Define an Operator on the Product Space**\n\nWe can combine the three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` into a single operator `T` that maps the space `S` to itself.\n*   Define the operator `T: S → S` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   A fixed point of this operator is a point `p* = (x*, y*, z*)` such that `T(p*) = p*`. This means:\n    `(F(x*, y*, z*), G(y*, x*, y*), H(z*, y*, x*)) = (x*, y*, z*)`\n    This single operator equation is equivalent to the original system of three equations. Finding an FGH-tripled fixed point is the same as finding a fixed point for `T`.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Contraction Condition for the Operator**\n\nThe Banach Fixed Point Theorem requires the operator `T` to be a contraction mapping. This means there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p1, p2 ∈ S`, we have `d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d(p1, p2)`.\n\nLet's expand `d(T(p1), T(p2))`:\n`d(T(p1), T(p2)) = d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) + d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) + d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2))`\n\nTo bound this expression, we need to impose Lipschitz-like conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Contraction Conditions on F, G, H.** There must exist non-negative constants (`α_i, β_i, γ_i ≥ 0`) such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1 * d_X(x1, x2) + α2 * d_Y(y1, y2) + α3 * d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1 * d_Y(y1, y2) + β2 * d_X(x1, x2) + β3 * d_Y(y1, y2)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1 * d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2 * d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3 * d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n**Step 4: Combine Conditions to Ensure T is a Contraction**\n\nNow, we substitute the inequalities from Step 3 into the expression for `d(T(p1), T(p2))`:\n\n`d(T(p1), T(p2))`\n`≤ [α1 d_X + α2 d_Y + α3 d_Z] + [(β1+β3)d_Y + β2 d_X] + [γ1 d_Z + γ2 d_Y + γ3 d_X]`\n\nwhere `d_X = d_X(x1, x2)`, `d_Y = d_Y(y1, y2)`, and `d_Z = d_Z(z1, z2)`.\n\nGrouping the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n\n`d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ (α1 + β2 + γ3)d_X + (α2 + β1 + β3 + γ2)d_Y + (α3 + γ1)d_Z`\n\nLet `k_x = α1 + β2 + γ3`, `k_y = α2 + β1 + β3 + γ2`, and `k_z = α3 + γ1`.\nLet `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)`.\nThen, we have:\n\n`d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k*d_X + k*d_Y + k*d_Z = k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z) = k * d(p1, p2)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, the constant `k` must be strictly less than 1.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Overall Contraction Factor.** The constants from the Lipschitz-like conditions must satisfy:\n    `k = max(α1 + β2 + γ3, α2 + β1 + β3 + γ2, α3 + γ1) < 1`\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist and be unique if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces)**: `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  **(Joint Contraction)**: The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy the following Lipschitz-type inequalities for all points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X×Y×Z` with some non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1 d_X(x1, x2) + α2 d_Y(y1, y2) + α3 d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1 d_Y(y1, y2) + β2 d_X(x1, x2) + β3 d_Y(y1, y2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1 d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2 d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3 d_X(x1, x2)`\n3.  **(Contraction Factor Condition)**: The sum of the coefficients influencing each dimension must form a contraction, meaning the maximum of these sums is less than 1:\n    *   `max(α1 + β2 + γ3,  α2 + β1 + β3 + γ2,  α3 + γ1) < 1`\n\nIf these conditions hold, then by the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, the operator `T` has a unique fixed point `(x*, y*, z*)`, which is the unique FGH-tripled fixed point of the system.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `x = F(x, y, z)`, `y = G(y, x, y)`, and `z = H(z, y, x)` are:\n1.  **Spaces**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n2.  **Contractive Mappings**: There exist non-negative constants `α1, α2, α3`, `β1, β2, β3`, and `γ1, γ2, γ3` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the functions satisfy the following inequalities:\n    a) `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1 d_X(x1, x2) + α2 d_Y(y1, y2) + α3 d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    b) `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ (β1 + β3) d_Y(y1, y2) + β2 d_X(x1, x2)`\n    c) `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1 d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2 d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3 d_X(x1, x2)`\n3.  **Overall Contraction**: The constants satisfy the condition that `k < 1`, where `k` is defined as:\n    `k = max(α1 + β2 + γ3, α2 + β1 + β3 + γ2, α3 + γ1)`>>>"
