    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry group of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the SMILES String and Identify the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   The SMILES string provided is `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`.\n*   `(C#C)` represents an ethynyl group (`-C≡CH`). There are three such groups.\n*   The complex aromatic system `c1...c67` describes a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The structure with an 18-carbon outer perimeter and the described internal fusion pattern corresponds to **hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC)**. This is a large, disc-shaped planar molecule.\n*   By tracing the connections along the perimeter as described in the SMILES string, we can determine the positions of the three ethynyl substituents on the 18-carbon perimeter of the HBC core.\n    *   `C#Cc1...`: The first substituent is at position 1.\n    *   `...c1cc2...`: The label `c2` is 2 bonds away from `c1`. So, `c2` is at position 3.\n    *   `...c2ccc3...`: The label `c3` is 3 bonds away from `c2`. So, `c3` is at position 3+3=6.\n    *   `...c3c(C#C)cc4...`: The second substituent is on the carbon immediately following `c3`. So, this substituent is at position 6+1=7.\n    *   `...c4ccc5...`: Following the pattern, `c4` is at 6+3=9 and `c5` is at 9+3=12.\n    *   `...c5c(C#C)cc6...`: The third substituent is on the carbon immediately following `c5`. So, this substituent is at position 12+1=13.\n*   The final structure is a hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) core substituted with three ethynyl groups at positions 1, 7, and 13.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of the Parent and Substituted Molecule**\n\n*   **Parent Molecule (HBC)**: The unsubstituted HBC molecule is a highly symmetric planar molecule. Its point group is **D6h**.\n*   **Substituted Molecule**: The substitution pattern `1, 7, 13` breaks some of the symmetry of the original `D6h` group. To find the new point group, we assume the conformation with the highest possible symmetry, which is a completely planar structure where the ethynyl groups lie in the plane of the HBC core, pointing radially outwards.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Remaining Symmetry Elements**\n\n1.  **Identity (E)**: This element is always present.\n2.  **Principal Rotation Axis (Cn)**:\n    *   The `C6` axis of the original HBC is lost because a 60° rotation would move a substituted carbon to an unsubstituted position.\n    *   However, a 120° rotation around the axis perpendicular to the center of the molecule maps substituted position 1 to 7, 7 to 13, and 13 back to 1. Since these positions are identical, this is a valid symmetry operation. Therefore, a **C3** axis is present. This is the new principal axis.\n3.  **Perpendicular C2 Axes**:\n    *   We need to check for `C2` axes lying in the molecular plane and perpendicular to the `C3` axis.\n    *   Consider an axis passing through the center of the molecule, the substituted carbon C1, and the opposite carbon C10. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves C1 and C10 unchanged, but it swaps C7 with C13. Since C7 and C13 are identically substituted, this is a valid symmetry operation. Thus, a **C2** axis exists here.\n    *   Due to the presence of the `C3` axis, there must be two other equivalent `C2` axes, for a total of **three C2 axes** perpendicular to the principal `C3` axis.\n4.  **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh)**:\n    *   The molecule is assumed to be perfectly planar. The plane of the molecule is therefore a mirror plane. A reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged. Thus, a **σh** is present.\n5.  **Inversion Center (i)**:\n    *   The inversion center of the parent HBC is lost. Inverting through the center of the molecule would map the substituted carbon C1 to the unsubstituted carbon C10.\n6.  **Other Symmetry Elements**:\n    *   The presence of a `C3` axis and a `σh` plane implies the existence of an `S3` improper rotation axis.\n    *   The presence of the `C3` axis and the three perpendicular `C2` axes imply the existence of three vertical mirror planes (`σv`). Each `σv` contains the `C3` axis and one of the `C2` axes.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Point Group**\n\nThe set of symmetry elements we have found is: `E`, `2C3`, `3C2`, `σh`, `2S3`, and `3σv`.\nA point group with a principal `Cn` axis, `n` perpendicular `C2` axes, and a horizontal mirror plane `σh` is defined as a **Dnh** group.\nIn our case, `n=3`. Therefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is **D3h**.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
