    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the book and author:** The question refers to the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by the Polish science fiction author Jacek Dukaj.\n\n2.  **Identify the main character:** The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century man who is cryopreserved and resurrected in the late 25th century. The story is told from his perspective as he navigates this vastly different future.\n\n3.  **Identify the marriage plot point:** A central part of Adam's story is his relationship with the advanced posthumans of this new era. He is considered a \"stahs,\" a resurrected historical human, and something of a curiosity. He forms a close and critical bond with a powerful posthuman individual.\n\n4.  **Identify the spouse:** The character Adam Zamoyski forms this deep, binding union with is **Angelika Pathana**. She is an \"Inkluzja Standardowa,\" a highly evolved being. Their relationship evolves throughout the novel, and their \"marriage\" is a significant event, acting as a deep personal, political, and social alliance that cements Adam's place in the world and ties him to Angelika's powerful lineage.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Concept of \"Marriage\":** In the far-future setting of the novel, the union between Adam and Angelika might not conform to the traditional 21st-century definition of marriage. It is a more complex, multi-layered bond. However, within the context of the narrative, it functions as a marriage, and Angelika is his partner/spouse.\n*   **Spelling:** The names are Polish. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, and the character he marries is Angelika Pathana. Correct spelling is important for accuracy.\n*   **Central Relationship:** The relationship between Adam and Angelika is a core element of the plot, not a minor detail. She is his primary guide, protector, and romantic interest in this new world.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character the main character marries is Angelika Pathana.\n\n<<<Angelika Pathana>>>"
