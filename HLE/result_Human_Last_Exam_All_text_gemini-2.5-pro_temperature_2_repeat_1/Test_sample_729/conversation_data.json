    "**1. Understanding the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nIn this problem, the size of the group is 128. So, $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\nThe group in question is $G = Q_{128}$, with the presentation:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's establish some basic properties of this group:\n*   The order of the element $x$ is 64. The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   The order of the element $y$ is 4, since $y^2 = x^{32}$ (which has order 2), and $y^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Every element of $G$ can be uniquely written as $x^i y^j$ where $0 \\le i < 64$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   The relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$ can be rewritten as $xy = yx^{-1}$. This shows how $y$ and powers of $x$ commute.\n\n**2. Interpreting the term \"Power Subgroups\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not universally standard. We will analyze the most plausible interpretations. The strong agreement between the results of these interpretations will give us confidence in the answer.\n\n**Interpretation 1: Verbal Subgroups $G^k$**\n\nThe most direct interpretation is that \"power subgroups\" are the verbal subgroups of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for integers $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: k is odd.**\n    *   The elements of $G^k$ are generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\n    *   For elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$, we have $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. This implies that the subgroup generated by all $x^{ik}$ is $\\langle x \\rangle$ itself.\n    *   For elements of the form $x^iy$, we compute $(x^i y)^k$. Since $k$ is odd, we can write $(x^i y)^k = ((x^i y)^2)^{(k-1)/2} (x^i y)$.\n    *   We first calculate $(x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i(yx^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   Then $(x^i y)^k = (x^{32})^{(k-1)/2} (x^i y) = x^{16(k-1)} x^i y$.\n    *   So, $G^k$ contains $\\langle x \\rangle$ and elements of the form $x^j y$. This means $G^k$ must be $G$ itself.\n    *   Thus, for any odd $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us one power subgroup: **G**.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even.** Let $k=2m$.\n    *   $(x^i)^k = (x^i)^{2m} = x^{2im}$.\n    *   $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m} = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   So, $G^k = G^{2m} = \\langle x^{2im}, x^{32m} \\rangle_{i=0..63} = \\langle x^{2m}, x^{32m} \\rangle$.\n    *   Let's analyze this subgroup:\n        *   If $m$ is odd, $G^{2m} = \\langle x^{2m}, x^{32} \\rangle$. The greatest common divisor $\\gcd(2m, 32) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(m, 16) = 2$ (since $m$ is odd). So the subgroup is $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This gives one subgroup: **<x²>**\n        *   If $m$ is even, $m=2j$ and $k=4j$. The generator $x^{32m} = x^{64j} = 1$. The subgroup becomes $G^{4j} = \\langle x^{4j} \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(4j, 64)} \\rangle$.\n        *   The possible values for $d = \\gcd(4j, 64)$ are divisors of 64 that are multiples of 4. These are $4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n        *   This gives us the following subgroups:\n            *   **<x⁴>** (e.g., for $j=1, k=4$)\n            *   **<x⁸>** (e.g., for $j=2, k=8$)\n            *   **<x¹⁶>** (e.g., for $j=4, k=16$)\n            *   **<x³²>** (e.g., for $j=8, k=32$)\n            *   **<x⁶⁴> = {1}** (e.g., for $j=16, k=64$)\n\n*   **Counting the subgroups:**\n    Combining all cases, the set of distinct power subgroups $G^k$ is:\n    $\\{ G, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$\n    There are a total of **7** such subgroups.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Subgroups in the Lower and Upper Central Series**\n\nThese important series of subgroups are defined by taking powers and commutators. It's plausible that \"power subgroups\" might refer to the members of these series.\n\n*   **Lower Central Series (LCS):** $\\gamma_1(G) = G$, $\\gamma_{i+1}(G) = [\\gamma_i(G), G]$.\n    *   $\\gamma_1(G) = G$\n    *   $\\gamma_2(G) = G' = \\langle [x,y] \\rangle = \\langle x^{-2} \\rangle = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n    *   $\\gamma_3(G) = [\\langle x^2 \\rangle, G] = \\langle [x^2, y] \\rangle = \\langle x^{-4} \\rangle = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n    *   Continuing this pattern, $\\gamma_i(G) = \\langle x^{2^{i-1}} \\rangle$.\n    *   The series is: $G \\supset \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^8 \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^{16} \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^{32} \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n    *   The distinct subgroups in the LCS are $\\{G, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$. This is a set of **7** subgroups.\n\n*   **Upper Central Series (UCS):** $Z_0(G)=\\{1\\}$, $Z_{i+1}(G)/Z_i(G) = Z(G/Z_i(G))$.\n    *   $Z_0(G) = \\{1\\}$\n    *   $Z_1(G) = Z(G) = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n    *   $G/Z_1(G) = G/\\langle x^{32} \\rangle \\cong D_{64}$ (Dihedral group of order 64). The center is $Z(D_{64}) = \\langle \\bar{x}^{16} \\rangle$. So, $Z_2(G) = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$.\n    *   Continuing this process, we find:\n        $Z_0(G)=\\{1\\}, Z_1(G)=\\langle x^{32} \\rangle, Z_2(G)=\\langle x^{16} \\rangle, Z_3(G)=\\langle x^8 \\rangle, Z_4(G)=\\langle x^4 \\rangle, Z_5(G)=\\langle x^2 \\rangle, Z_6(G)=G$.\n    *   The distinct subgroups in the UCS are $\\{\\{1\\}, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, G\\}$. This is a set of **7** subgroups.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nAll three plausible interpretations of \"power subgroups\" lead to the exact same set of 7 subgroups:\n$\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\nThis provides strong evidence that this is the intended set of subgroups. The number of subgroups in this set is 7.\n\nFinal Answer Count:\n1.  $Q_{128}$\n2.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (Order 32)\n3.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (Order 16)\n4.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (Order 8)\n5.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (Order 4)\n6.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (Order 2)\n7.  $\\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup, Order 1)\n\nThere are 7 such subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
