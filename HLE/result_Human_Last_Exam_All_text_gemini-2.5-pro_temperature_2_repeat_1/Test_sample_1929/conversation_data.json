    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a conjugated diene, a typical component in a Diels-Alder reaction, providing 4 π-electrons.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is an alkene derivative, which can act as a dienophile, providing 2 π-electrons. The halogen atoms are electron-withdrawing groups, which activate the dienophile for this reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction. It is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring, specifically a cyclohexene derivative. This reaction is thermally allowed and proceeds in a concerted fashion.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the General Structure of the Product**\n\nThe Diels-Alder reaction forms two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   The carbons from butadiene form four of the ring atoms, with a new double bond located between the central two carbons (C2 and C3 of butadiene).\n*   The carbons from the dienophile form the other two ring atoms, connected by a new single bond.\nThe general product is a substituted cyclohexene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Regioselectivity of the Reaction**\n\n*   **The Issue:** The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric. However, the dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetric because one carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other to two fluorine atoms (CF₂). This means two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) can potentially be formed.\n*   **The Principle (Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory):** The regioselectivity of a Diels-Alder reaction is controlled by the interaction of the diene's Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the dienophile's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). The reaction proceeds through a transition state where the lobes of these orbitals with the largest coefficients overlap.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Butadiene HOMO:** Being symmetric, the terminal carbons (C1 and C4) of the butadiene HOMO have orbital coefficients that are equal in magnitude.\n    2.  **Dienophile LUMO:** We need to determine on which carbon (the CCl₂ carbon or the CF₂ carbon) the LUMO has a larger coefficient. This is determined by the electronic effects of the halogen substituents.\n        *   **Inductive Effect (-I):** Both F and Cl are strongly electronegative and withdraw electron density. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine (F > Cl). This effect would tend to make the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient.\n        *   **Resonance Effect (+M):** Both halogens can donate electron density from their lone pairs into the π system. This effect depends on the effectiveness of orbital overlap (p-π overlap). The overlap between the 2p orbitals of fluorine and carbon is much better than the overlap between the 3p orbital of chlorine and the 2p orbital of carbon. Therefore, fluorine is a much stronger π-donor than chlorine (+M effect: F > Cl).\n    3.  **Conclusion on LUMO:** For halogen-substituted alkenes, the π-donating resonance effect is often the dominant factor in determining the polarization of the frontier orbitals. The stronger π-donating group (F) on the CF₂ carbon causes the LUMO to have a *smaller* coefficient on that carbon and a correspondingly *larger* coefficient on the other carbon of the double bond (the CCl₂ carbon).\n*   **Predicting the Product:** To maximize orbital overlap in the transition state, a terminal carbon of the diene (with its large HOMO coefficient) will preferentially bond to the dienophile carbon with the larger LUMO coefficient. Based on our analysis, this is the CCl₂ carbon.\n    *   One end of the butadiene molecule attacks the CCl₂ group.\n    *   The other end of the butadiene molecule must then attack the CF₂ group.\n\n**Step 4: Draw and Name the Final Product**\n\nLet's construct the product based on the favored reaction path:\n*   A C-C bond forms between a terminal CH₂ of butadiene and the CCl₂ group of the dienophile.\n*   A second C-C bond forms between the other terminal CH₂ of butadiene and the CF₂ group of the dienophile.\n*   The final structure is a cyclohexene ring where one CH₂ group is adjacent to the CCl₂ group, and the other CH₂ group is adjacent to the CF₂ group.\n\nLet's draw this structure and name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The backbone of the product is `(-CH₂-CCl₂-CF₂-CH₂-CH=CH-)`.\n2.  The parent ring is cyclohexene.\n3.  The double bond must be assigned the lowest possible locants, so it is at positions C1 and C2 (`cyclohex-1-ene`).\n4.  We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Let's try both directions:\n    *   Path A: `(1)CH=(2)CH-(3)CH₂-(4)C(F₂)-(5)C(Cl₂)-(6)CH₂-`  Locants: 4,4,5,5\n    *   Path B: `(1)CH=(2)CH-(3)CH₂-(4)C(Cl₂)-(5)C(F₂)-(6)CH₂-`  Locants: 4,4,5,5\n5.  Since both numbering schemes give the same set of locants (4,4,5,5), we use alphabetical order to decide. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\". Therefore, the CCl₂ group should be assigned the lower number. This corresponds to Path B.\n6.  The correct IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH = CH\n     /       \\\n    CH₂       CH₂\n    |         |\n    CCl₂ ----- CF₂\n```\nwhere the CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the CF₂ group is at position 5 (numbering starts from the double bond and proceeds through the CH₂ group adjacent to the CCl₂ group).\n\nFinal Answer is the chemical name of the product.\n\n**Product:** 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
