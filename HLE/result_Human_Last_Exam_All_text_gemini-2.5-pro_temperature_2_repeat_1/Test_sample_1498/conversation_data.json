    "Of course. Let's break down the question and analyze the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' to find the precise answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Poem and the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (*abyāt*, singular *bayt*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that are dedicated to listing the names of the Prophets. 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a 57-verse poem by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that simplifies the core tenets of Islamic belief (Aqidah) in an easy-to-memorize format. The poem is structured logically, moving from the attributes of Allah, to the attributes of the Prophets, and then to a list of the 25 prophets one must know by name.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on Prophets**\n\nBefore listing the names, the poem discusses the four compulsory attributes of all prophets (Truthfulness, Trustworthiness, Conveying the Message, and Astuteness). This discussion ends, and the author then introduces the section where he will list the 25 prophets. We need to find this transition.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Preparatory Verse (and a Careful Point)**\n\nThe verse that explicitly introduces the list of the 25 prophets is:\n\n**Verse 37:**\n> تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ\n> كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n*Tafṣīlu khamsatin wa ‘ishrīna lazim*\n*Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim*\n\n*Translation: The detailed mention of twenty-five is binding upon every accountable person, so realize this and seize the opportunity.*\n\n**Careful Point:** This verse *introduces* the topic and states the number (25), but it does not yet contain any of the prophets' names. Therefore, the list of names does not begin here. The question asks from which verse the *names are mentioned*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Starting Verse**\n\nThe very next verse is where the author begins listing the names, starting with Adam (peace be upon him).\n\n**Verse 38:**\n> هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\n> صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n*Hum Ādamun Idrīsu Nūḥun Hūdu maʿ*\n*Ṣāliḥin wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ*\n\n*Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih, and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.*\n\nSince this verse contains the first names on the list, **Bayt 38 is the starting verse.**\n\n**Step 5: Follow the Sequence to Identify the Ending Verse**\n\nWe now follow the verses until the list is complete.\n\n*   **Verse 39** continues with: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Verse 40** continues with: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, and Dawud.\n*   **Verse 41** continues with: Sulayman, Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, and 'Isa.\n\nThe list of the 25 prophets culminates with the final prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). He is mentioned in the next verse.\n\n**Verse 42:**\n> وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنكَ الْغَيَّا\n> وَآلُهُ وَصَحْبُهُ وَمَنْ تَقَفَّى\n*Wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ʿanka l-ghayyā*\n*Wa Āluhū wa Ṣaḥbuhū wa man taqaffā*\n\n*Translation: And Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) is the seal; leave aside misguidance. And his family, his companions, and those who followed.*\n\nThis verse mentions the final Prophet in the list (\"Taha\", \"Khatim\" - the Seal), thus completing the enumeration of the 25 prophets. The second half of the verse then moves to his family and companions, signifying the end of the prophet list and a transition to the next topic.\n\nTherefore, **Bayt 42 is the ending verse.**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** The standard numbering of the most common version of this poem is 57 verses. The numbers used here (37-42) correspond to this standard edition. Minor variations in numbering might exist in different publications, but the sequence of verses remains the same.\n2.  **The \"Introductory\" vs. \"Starting\" Verse:** It is crucial to distinguish between Verse 37, which *announces* the list, and Verse 38, where the list of *names* actually begins. The question specifically asks where the names are mentioned.\n3.  **The Concluding Verse:** Verse 42 clearly contains the final Prophet in the list (Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) and concludes the section before moving on to a new topic (the Prophet's family and companions).\n4.  **Confirmation:** The next verse, Verse 43, starts a new topic entirely, discussing the angels: `وَالْمَلَكُ الَّذِي بِلاَ أَبٍ وَأُمّ...` (\"And the angels are those without a father or mother...\"), confirming that the section on the prophets' names concluded in verse 42.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe names of the 25 Prophets mentioned in the Quran are listed in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' beginning from the verse that starts with \"Hum Ādamun...\" and ending with the verse that refers to the final Prophet as \"Ṭāhā khātimun...\". This corresponds to the range from verse 38 to verse 42.\n\n<<<From Bayt 38 to Bayt 42>>>"
