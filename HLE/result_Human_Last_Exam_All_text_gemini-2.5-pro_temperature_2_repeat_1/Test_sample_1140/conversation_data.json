    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**\n*   **Molecule:** A 100 amino acid (100aa) peptide.\n*   **Key Feature:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), \"X\", specified as azido phenylalanine.\n*   **Objective:** Identify the \"most helpful\" technique for its synthesis.\n\n**2. Identify the Challenges:**\nThis problem presents two simultaneous challenges:\n*   **Length:** 100 amino acids is a long peptide.\n*   **Composition:** It includes a non-canonical or unnatural amino acid.\n\n**3. Evaluate Standard Synthesis Techniques:**\n\n*   **Technique 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** Amino acids are added sequentially to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to a solid resin support.\n    *   **Analysis for this problem:**\n        *   **Unnatural Amino Acid:** SPPS can incorporate UAAs like azido phenylalanine, provided a properly protected version (e.g., Fmoc-azido-L-phenylalanine) is available for purchase or synthesis. So, this part is feasible.\n        *   **Length:** This is the major drawback. The overall yield of SPPS is the product of the individual coupling efficiencies. For a 100-mer, even a very high 99% coupling efficiency at each of the 99 steps would result in a theoretical yield of only (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In reality, side reactions and, crucially, the aggregation of the long peptide chain on the resin make it extremely difficult to achieve high purity and yield for peptides over ~50 amino acids.\n    *   **Conclusion:** SPPS alone is not the most helpful technique due to the severe yield and purity issues associated with synthesizing a peptide of this length.\n\n*   **Technique 2: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (like *E. coli*), which then uses its natural protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes, tRNAs) to produce the peptide.\n    *   **Analysis for this problem:**\n        *   **Length:** This method is ideal for producing long proteins and peptides, so the 100aa length is not an issue.\n        *   **Unnatural Amino Acid:** This is the critical failure point. The standard genetic code only encodes the 20 canonical amino acids. The cell's translational machinery has no natural way to recognize or incorporate azido phenylalanine into the growing peptide chain.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used to make this specific peptide.\n\n**4. Evaluate Advanced and Hybrid Techniques:**\n\nSince standard methods fail on at least one count, we must consider advanced techniques designed to overcome these specific limitations.\n\n*   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** NCL is a semi-synthetic method that chemically joins two smaller peptide fragments. One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. They react to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Analysis for this problem:** This is an excellent strategy. The 100-mer can be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n        1.  Synthesize a small peptide fragment (e.g., 20-40 aa) containing the azido phenylalanine using SPPS. This is efficient and yields a high-purity product. This fragment would be modified to have either a C-terminal thioester or an N-terminal cysteine.\n        2.  Synthesize the remaining, larger fragment (e.g., 60-80 aa) using a different method. This could be SPPS (if not too long) or, more powerfully, standard recombinant expression (since it would contain only natural amino acids). This is often called Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL).\n        3.  Ligate the two purified fragments together in solution.\n    *   **Conclusion:** NCL is a very powerful and helpful technique as it combines the strengths of chemical synthesis (to incorporate the UAA) and recombinant expression (to produce the bulk of the peptide), overcoming the limitations of each individual method.\n\n*   **Technique 4: Recombinant Expression using an Expanded Genetic Code**\n    *   **How it works:** This is an advanced biosynthetic technique that engineers the host organism. An \"orthogonal\" aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is introduced into the cell. This new synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and attaches it to its partner tRNA. The orthogonal tRNA is engineered to recognize a codon that is not used for a standard amino acid, most often the amber stop codon (TAG). The gene for the 100-aa peptide is then synthesized with a TAG codon at the desired position 'X'. When the cell translates this gene, the engineered tRNA delivers azido phenylalanine to the ribosome when it encounters the TAG codon.\n    *   **Analysis for this problem:** This technique elegantly solves both problems at once. The recombinant system handles the synthesis of the long 100-aa backbone, while the engineered components specifically handle the incorporation of the unnatural amino acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is also a very powerful and direct method for producing the entire, final peptide in a single biological process.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** and **Recombinant Expression using an Expanded Genetic Code** are state-of-the-art methods that are highly suitable for this task. They are the \"most helpful\" techniques. Standard SPPS would be highly inefficient, and standard recombinant expression is impossible. Between the two advanced methods, genetic code expansion offers a direct, one-step biological synthesis of the final product, which is arguably the most elegant solution. NCL provides a modular, semi-synthetic route that also reliably yields the final product. Both are correct answers in a modern protein chemistry context, but **recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code** is a single, complete process that directly addresses the incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a recombinantly produced peptide.\n\n<<<Recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code>>>"
