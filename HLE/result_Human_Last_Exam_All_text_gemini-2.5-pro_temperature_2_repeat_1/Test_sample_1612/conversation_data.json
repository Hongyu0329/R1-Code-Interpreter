    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we must perform a careful, step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the \"Triple Crown\" in MLB**\n\nFirst, it is crucial to recognize that there are two distinct types of Triple Crowns in Major League Baseball: one for batting (hitting) and one for pitching.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in a single season: **batting average (AVG)**, **home runs (HR)**, and **runs batted in (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in three key pitching categories in a single season: **wins (W)**, **strikeouts (K)**, and **earned run average (ERA)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Question and Potential Ambiguities**\n\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there?\" can be interpreted in a few ways. The careful point here is to determine if the user is asking for:\n*   The total number of *times* the Triple Crown has been won.\n*   The total number of unique *players* who have won the Triple Crown.\n*   Whether to include just batting, just pitching, or both.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify batting or pitching, the most comprehensive answer should account for both. The phrasing \"winners\" (plural) suggests the number of unique individuals who have accomplished the feat is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**3. Tally the Batting Triple Crown Winners**\n\nLet's list the unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   **National League (NL) Winners (7 unique players):**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    3.  Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    4.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925) - *Won twice*\n    5.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    6.  Joe Medwick (1937)\n*   **American Association (AA) Winner (1 unique player):**\n    *   MLB officially recognizes the AA as a major league from that era.\n    1.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n*   **American League (AL) Winners (9 unique players):**\n    1.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    2.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    3.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    4.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    5.  Ted Williams (1942, 1947) - *Won twice*\n    6.  Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    7.  Frank Robinson (1966)\n    8.  Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    9.  Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\nAdding up the unique players from each league gives us **17 unique batting Triple Crown winners**.\n*Note: A common error is to count 16 winners. However, Paul Hines (1878), Tip O'Neill (1887), and Hugh Duffy (1894) are recognized pre-modern era winners, and counting all AL and NL players, there are 7 (NL) + 9 (AL) + 1 (AA) = 17 unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown a total of 19 times.* A simpler tally is that 15 players have won it in the AL/NL since 1901, plus Hines and Duffy in the NL's early days, plus O'Neill in the AA. Total unique players = 15+2 = 17. The players are Lajoie, Cobb, Foxx, Gehrig, Williams, Mantle, Robinson, Yastrzemski, Cabrera, Zimmerman, Hornsby, Klein, Medwick, Hines, Duffy, plus O'Neill from the AA. So 16 unique winners seems more common by some sources (that omit O'Neill for being in AA, or the older ones for stats debate) but 17 is technically the most correct. Let's stick with the more commonly agreed list of **16** by standard MLB convention, which often omits the American Association's Tip O'Neill from modern lists despite its Major League status. That is 7 in the NL and 9 in the AL.\n\n*   **Total unique Batting Triple Crown winners = 16 players.**\n\n**4. Tally the Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\n\nNext, we list the unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown. This feat has been accomplished more frequently than the batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners (26 players):**\n    1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n    2.  Old Hoss Radbourn (1884)\n    3.  Tim Keefe (1888)\n    4.  John Clarkson (1889)\n    5.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n    6.  Cy Young (1901)\n    7.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n    8.  Christy Mathewson (1905, 1908)\n    9.  Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n    10. Hippo Vaughn (1918)\n    11. Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n    12. Dazzy Vance (1924)\n    13. Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n    14. Lefty Gomez (1934, 1937)\n    15. Bucky Walters (1939)\n    16. Bob Feller (1940)\n    17. Hal Newhouser (1945)\n    18. Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n    19. Steve Carlton (1972)\n    20. Roger Clemens (1997, 1998)\n    21. Pedro Mart√≠nez (1999)\n    22. Randy Johnson (2002)\n    23. Johan Santana (2006)\n    24. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n    25. Justin Verlander (2011)\n    26. Shane Bieber (2020)\n\n*   **Total unique Pitching Triple Crown winners = 26 players.**\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nTo get the total number of unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we sum the number of unique batting winners and unique pitching winners. A careful check confirms that no player in MLB history has ever won both a batting Triple Crown and a pitching Triple Crown.\n\n*   Total Unique Batting Winners: 16\n*   Total Unique Pitching Winners: 26\n\nTotal Unique Winners = 16 + 26 = 42.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe number of unique players who have won a batting Triple Crown is 16.\nThe number of unique players who have won a pitching Triple Crown is 26.\nThe total number of MLB players who have won a Triple Crown (either batting or pitching) is the sum of these two groups.\n\nTotal winners = 16 + 26 = 42.\n\n<<<42>>>"
