The final equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega_0)$ as a function of the laser carrier frequency $\omega_0$ are as follows:

**a) For a chain of non-interacting molecules:**

The absorption cross-section equation is:
$$ \sigma_a(\omega_0) = C_a \cdot N |\vec{\mu}_e|^2 \omega_e e^{-(\omega_e - \omega_0)^2 \tau^2} $$
Here, $C_a$ is a constant of proportionality, $N$ is the number of molecules, $\vec{\mu}_e$ is the single-molecule transition dipole moment, $\omega_e$ is the single-molecule transition frequency, and $\tau$ is the Gaussian pulse duration. This equation represents a single Gaussian peak centered at the molecular frequency $\omega_e$, with an amplitude proportional to $N$.

**b) For a chain with nearest-neighbor molecular interaction ($J$):**

The absorption cross-section equation is:
$$ \sigma_b(\omega_0) = C_b \cdot N |\vec{\mu}_e|^2 (\omega_e + 2J/\hbar) e^{-(\omega_e + 2J/\hbar - \omega_0)^2 \tau^2} $$
Here, $C_b$ is a proportionality constant and $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy. This equation represents a single Gaussian peak whose position is shifted by the interaction to a new frequency $\omega_e + 2J/\hbar$. The total oscillator strength is concentrated in this single transition, an effect of exciton coherence. The linewidth in both cases is determined by the pulse duration $\tau$.
