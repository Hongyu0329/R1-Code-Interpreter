    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Set of Numbers**\n\nThe problem asks about sums of distinct numbers from a set defined by the formula `a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1`. The first crucial step is to determine the domain of `n`.\n\n*   **Assumption 1: `n` is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...)**\n    Let's calculate the first few terms:\n    *   `a_0 = 2(0)^2 + 3(0) + 1 = 1`\n    *   `a_1 = 2(1)^2 + 3(1) + 1 = 6`\n    *   `a_2 = 2(2)^2 + 3(2) + 1 = 15`\n    *   `a_3 = 2(3)^2 + 3(3) + 1 = 28`\n    *   ...\n    The set is `{1, 6, 15, 28, ...}`. We need to write numbers as sums of *distinct* elements from this set. Let's try to form small integers:\n    *   1 can be formed as `a_0`.\n    *   2 cannot be formed. `1+1` is not a sum of distinct elements, and all other elements are larger than 2.\n    *   3, 4, 5 also cannot be formed.\n    Since there are small integers that cannot be represented, and all subsequent terms in the set are larger than these numbers, these gaps can never be filled. For example, 2 will never be representable. This contradicts the premise of the question, which states that *all* numbers greater than or equal to some `N` are representable. This implies that the set of unrepresentable numbers must be finite. Therefore, the assumption that `n` is only a non-negative integer must be incorrect.\n\n*   **Assumption 2: `n` is any integer (n = ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)**\n    This is the only other standard interpretation. Let's analyze the numbers generated by this domain.\n    The formula can be factored: `a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1 = (n+1)(2n+1)`.\n\n    *   For `n \\geq 0`: `a_0 = 1`, `a_1 = 6`, `a_2 = 15`, `a_3 = 28`, ...\n    *   For `n < 0`, let `n = -k` where `k` is a positive integer.\n        `a_{-k} = (-k+1)(2(-k)+1) = (-k+1)(-2k+1) = (k-1)(2k-1)`.\n        *   `n = -1 (k=1)`: `a_{-1} = (1-1)(2-1) = 0`. (We consider sums of positive numbers, so we ignore 0).\n        *   `n = -2 (k=2)`: `a_{-2} = (2-1)(4-1) = 3`.\n        *   `n = -3 (k=3)`: `a_{-3} = (3-1)(6-1) = 10`.\n        *   `n = -4 (k=4)`: `a_{-4} = (4-1)(8-1) = 21`.\n        *   ...\n\n    Combining the set of positive numbers for all integers `n`: `{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...}`.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Set as Triangular Numbers**\n\nThe set of triangular numbers, `T_k`, is given by the formula `T_k = k(k+1)/2`.\n`T_1=1`, `T_2=3`, `T_3=6`, `T_4=10`, `T_5=15`, `T_6=21`, `T_7=28`, ...\nOur generated set `{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...}` is precisely the set of all triangular numbers.\n\nThe original question can now be rephrased:\n\"Determine the smallest number `N` such that any number `m \\geq N` can be written as a sum of *distinct triangular numbers*.\"\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Rephrased Problem**\n\nThis is a known, though non-trivial, result in number theory. Not every number can be expressed as a sum of distinct triangular numbers. For instance:\n*   `T = {1, 3, 6, 10, ...}`\n*   2 cannot be formed.\n*   5 cannot be formed (`1+3=4`, `1+6=7`, `1+...`).\n*   8 cannot be formed (`1+...`, `3+...`, `6+1=7`, `6+3=9`).\n\nThe set of numbers that *cannot* be written as a sum of distinct triangular numbers is finite. This set is:\n`{2, 5, 8, 12, 18, 23, 27, 33}`.\n\nThe largest number on this list is 33. This means that 33 is the largest integer that cannot be written as a sum of distinct triangular numbers.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest number `N` such that *any* number `m \\geq N` is representable. Since the largest unrepresentable number is 33, every integer from 34 onwards must be representable.\n\nLet's check a few numbers to gain confidence:\n*   33 is the largest unrepresentable number.\n*   `34 = 28 + 6`. (Both are triangular numbers).\n*   `35 = 28 + 6 + 1`.\n*   `36` is a triangular number itself (`T_8`).\n*   `37 = 36 + 1`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `N` for which all greater or equal integers are representable is `33 + 1`.\n\n`N = 34`."
