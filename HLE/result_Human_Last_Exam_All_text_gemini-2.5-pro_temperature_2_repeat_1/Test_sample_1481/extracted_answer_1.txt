The leading-order asymptotic behavior of the generating function `H(s, s')` for the planar Birkhoff billiard map in the limit `|s' - s| → 0` is given by the expansion:

`H(s, s') = |s'-s| - (κ(s)^2 / 24)|s'-s|^3 + o(|s'-s|^3)`

where `s` and `s'` are the arc-length parameters of the two collision points on the boundary, and `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at point `s`.
