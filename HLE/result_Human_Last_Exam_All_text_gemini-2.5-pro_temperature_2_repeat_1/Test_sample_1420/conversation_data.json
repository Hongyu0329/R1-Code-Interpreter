    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat using the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Framework and Key Parameters:**\n    *   **Method:** The problem specifies using the renormalization group (RG) theory and the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion.\n    *   **Target Exponent:** We need to find the critical exponent for the specific heat, denoted by $\\alpha$.\n    *   **Spatial Dimension:** The system is in $d=3$.\n    *   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the class of models that exhibit such phase transitions (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg models, described by the O(n) universality class), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, mean-field theory becomes exact.\n    *   **Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative method performed in powers of $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. For our case, $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Utilize Scaling Relations:**\n    *   Critical exponents are not independent but are connected by universal scaling relations. A key relation needed here is the **hyperscaling relation**, which connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n      $2 - \\alpha = \\nu d$\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\alpha$:\n      $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$\n    *   Substituting $d = 4 - \\epsilon$, we get:\n      $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu (4 - \\epsilon)$\n    *   This expression shows that if we can find the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the exponent $\\nu$, we can derive the one for $\\alpha$.\n\n3.  **Find the Epsilon Expansion for the Correlation Length Exponent ($\\nu$):**\n    *   A standard result from the RG treatment of the O(n) model (which describes systems with an n-component order parameter) gives the expansion for $\\nu$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n      $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    *   The leading term, $\\nu = 1/2$, is the prediction from mean-field theory, which is exact at $d=d_c=4$ (i.e., when $\\epsilon=0$).\n\n4.  **Derive the Epsilon Expansion for $\\alpha$:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expansion for $\\nu$ into the expression for $\\alpha$. We are only interested in the result up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n      $\\alpha = 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right)(4 - \\epsilon)$\n    *   Expand the product, keeping only terms up to $O(\\epsilon)$:\n      $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(4) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(\\epsilon) + \\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right)(4) + \\dots \\right]$\n      The term $(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)$ is of order $\\epsilon^2$ and is therefore dropped in a first-order calculation.\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n      $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon \\right]$\n      $\\alpha = 2 - 2 + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon$\n      $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    *   Combine the terms inside the parenthesis over a common denominator:\n      $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1(n+8) - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n      $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n5.  **Specialize to the Ising Model and Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   The question does not specify the symmetry of the system (i.e., the value of 'n'). In such a general context, it is conventional to assume the simplest and most fundamental case: the **Ising model**, where the order parameter (e.g., magnetization) has only one component. Thus, we set $n=1$.\n    *   For the Ising model ($n=1$):\n      $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n    *   Finally, we evaluate this expression for the physical dimension $d=3$, which corresponds to setting the expansion parameter $\\epsilon=1$:\n      $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative technique, formally valid for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Applying it for $\\epsilon=1$ (i.e., for $d=3$) gives an approximation. The question asks for the result *from this method*, not the more precise value known from other numerical techniques (which for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$).\n*   The calculation depends on correctly identifying the upper critical dimension ($d_c=4$) and using the appropriate scaling relation (hyperscaling).\n*   The final numerical answer depends on the system's universality class (the value of 'n'). The choice of the Ising model ($n=1$) is standard for unspecified problems.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
