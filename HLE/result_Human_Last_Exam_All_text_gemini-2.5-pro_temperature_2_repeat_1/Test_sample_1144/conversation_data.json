    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Given Information\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (`Δp`) to its actual momentum (`p`) in a specific scenario.\n\n*   **What to find:** The ratio `Δp / p`.\n*   **Particle:** Electron.\n*   **State:** It is in the first Bohr orbit, which means its principal quantum number `n = 1`.\n*   **Given:** The uncertainty in its position is `Δx = 10 pm`.\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points and Relevant Formulas\n\n1.  **Unit Conversion:** The uncertainty in position is given in picometers (pm). For calculations using standard physical constants, we must convert this to SI units (meters).\n    *   `1 pm = 10^-12 m`\n    *   `Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10^-12 m = 10^-11 m`.\n\n2.  **Calculating Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** This is governed by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n    *   **Formula:** `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`ħ = h / 2π`).\n    *   To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   **Constant:** Reduced Planck's constant, `ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Momentum (p) in the First Bohr Orbit:** This is determined by the Bohr model's quantization condition.\n    *   **Formula:** The angular momentum (`L`) is quantized: `L = mvr = nħ`.\n    *   Since the linear momentum is `p = mv`, we can rewrite the quantization condition as `p * r = nħ`.\n    *   Therefore, the momentum is `p = nħ / r_n`, where `r_n` is the radius of the nth orbit.\n    *   **Radius of the first Bohr orbit (n=1):** `r_1 = a_0`, where `a_0` is the Bohr radius.\n    *   **Constant:** Bohr radius, `a_0 ≈ 5.29 x 10^-11 m`.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Part A: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n\n*   Using the Uncertainty Principle formula: `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n*   Substitute the values:\n    *   `ħ = 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`\n    *   `Δx = 10^-11 m`\n*   Calculation:\n    `Δp = (1.054 x 10^-34) / (2 * 10^-11)`\n    `Δp = 0.527 x 10^-23 kg·m/s`\n    `Δp = 5.27 x 10^-24 kg·m/s`\n\n**Part B: Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron.**\n\n*   Using the Bohr model formula for the first orbit (`n=1`): `p = (1 * ħ) / r_1`\n*   Substitute the values:\n    *   `ħ = 1.054 x 10^-34 J·s`\n    *   `r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 x 10^-11 m`\n*   Calculation:\n    `p = (1.054 x 10^-34) / (5.29 x 10^-11)`\n    `p ≈ 0.1992 x 10^-23 kg·m/s`\n    `p ≈ 1.992 x 10^-24 kg·m/s`\n\n**Part C: Find the ratio (Δp / p).**\n\n*   Use the values calculated in the previous parts:\n    *   `Δp = 5.27 x 10^-24 kg·m/s`\n    *   `p = 1.992 x 10^-24 kg·m/s`\n*   Calculation:\n    `Ratio = Δp / p = (5.27 x 10^-24) / (1.992 x 10^-24)`\n    The `10^-24` terms cancel out.\n    `Ratio = 5.27 / 1.992`\n    `Ratio ≈ 2.6455`\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is 2.65.\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
