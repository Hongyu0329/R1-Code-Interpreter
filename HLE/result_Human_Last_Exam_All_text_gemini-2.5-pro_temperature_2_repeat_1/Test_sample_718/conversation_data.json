    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nThe question asks for the integer $n$ for which a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, where $J$ is an upper semilattice. Let's break down each term.\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements $x, y \\in J$ have a least upper bound (or supremum, or join), denoted $x \\lor y$. When viewed as a category, the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\le j$.\n    *   A finite poset is an upper semilattice if and only if it is a disjoint union of \"one-peak\" posets (posets with a unique maximal element).\n\n2.  **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$ over the field $K$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, such that composition is respected. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of left modules over the **incidence algebra** $KJ$.\n\n3.  **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame\" is part of the tame/wild dichotomy in representation theory. A category of modules (or functors) is of **tame representation type** if, for any dimension $d$, its indecomposable objects of dimension $d$ can be parameterized by a finite number of one-parameter families. A \"tame functor\" should be interpreted as an indecomposable functor belonging to such a category. The question therefore presupposes that the category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is of tame representation type.\n\n4.  **$n$-resolvable**: A functor (or module) $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. That is, there exists an exact sequence:\n    $$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. The smallest such $n$ for which a resolution exists is the **projective dimension** of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$. The question asks for a uniform bound $n$ such that *any* functor $f$ in a tame category of this type has $\\text{pd}(f) \\le n$. This is equivalent to asking for the **global dimension** of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n**Rephrased Question**: What is the maximum possible global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice and the category is of tame representation type?\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Connections\n\n1.  **Projective Dimension and Global Dimension**: The statement \"f is $n$-resolvable\" for all relevant $f$ means that the global dimension of the functor category is at most $n$. The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category.\n    $$\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) = \\sup_{f} \\{ \\text{pd}(f) \\}$$\n\n2.  **Global Dimension and Poset Structure**: For the category of representations of a finite poset $J$, its global dimension is determined by the structure of $J$. Specifically, the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equal to the maximum length of a chain in $J$. A chain $j_0 < j_1 < \\dots < j_m$ has length $m$.\n\n3.  **Upper Semilattices and Connected Components**: A finite poset $J$ is an upper semilattice if and only if it can be decomposed into a disjoint union of connected components $J = J_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup J_k$, where each component $J_i$ is a poset with a unique maximal element (a \"one-peak poset\").\n\n4.  **Properties of Decomposed Posets**:\n    *   **Representation Type**: The category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is of tame representation type if and only if each category $\\text{Fun}(J_i, \\text{Vect}_K)$ for its components is of tame representation type.\n    *   **Global Dimension**: The global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is the maximum of the global dimensions of its components: $\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) = \\max_{i} \\{ \\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J_i, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\}$.\n\n5.  **The Central Theorem**: The problem reduces to finding the maximum chain length in a tame one-peak poset. There is a key theorem by Z. Leszczyński that addresses this directly.\n\n    **Theorem (Leszczyński, 1992)**: Let $J$ be a finite one-peak poset. The incidence algebra $KJ$ (and thus the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$) is of tame representation type if and only if the global dimension of $KJ$ is less than or equal to 4.\n\n    Furthermore, this bound is sharp; there exists a one-peak poset of tame representation type whose global dimension is exactly 4.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for a number $n$ such that any tame functor on an upper semilattice $J$ is $n$-resolvable. This means we are seeking the maximum possible projective dimension for any functor in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, under the condition that this category is of tame representation type.\n\n2.  The maximum projective dimension is the global dimension of the category, which is in turn equal to the maximum length of a chain in the poset $J$.\n\n3.  The poset $J$ is an upper semilattice. If we assume $J$ is finite (which is standard in this context), $J$ is a disjoint union of one-peak posets, say $J = J_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup J_k$.\n\n4.  The category for $J$ is tame if and only if the categories for all its one-peak components $J_i$ are tame.\n\n5.  The global dimension for $J$ is the maximum of the global dimensions for its components. `gl.dim(J) = max(gl.dim(J_i))`.\n\n6.  We can now apply Leszczyński's theorem. For each component $J_i$, if its representation category is tame, its global dimension (i.e., its maximal chain length) is at most 4.\n\n7.  Since this holds for every component, the maximum global dimension over all components must also be at most 4.\n    $$\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) = \\max_{i} \\{ \\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J_i, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\} \\le 4$$\n\n8.  This means that for any upper semilattice $J$ of tame representation type, its maximal chain length is at most 4. Consequently, the global dimension of the corresponding functor category is at most 4.\n\n9.  Therefore, any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ in this category has a projective dimension $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 4$. This is precisely the definition of being 4-resolvable.\n\n10. Since the bound of 4 is known to be achievable (there exists a tame one-peak poset with global dimension 4), $n=4$ is the smallest integer for which this universal statement is true."
