    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject: The Luxor Obelisks**\n    *   The question asks about a \"Luxor Obelisk.\" It is important to know that there are two ancient obelisks from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    *   One obelisk remains standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   The second obelisk was given to France by Egypt in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n    *   Therefore, the search must include films that depict either Luxor, Egypt, or the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n2.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners**\n    *   The strategy is to review the winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture in chronological order, starting from the first award ceremony (for films of 1927/1928), and identify the first one with scenes in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Early Winners (1920s - mid-1930s)**\n    *   **1st Awards (1927/1928): *Wings*** - Set during World War I. While there are scenes in France, including a brief leave in Paris, they focus on specific indoor locations like the Folies Berg√®re and do not feature broad establishing shots of major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   **2nd - 9th Awards (1928-1936):** A review of the winners from this period shows settings that are not relevant to the question. Examples include:\n        *   *The Broadway Melody* (1929): New York City\n        *   *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930): German perspective on WWI battlefields.\n        *   *Cimarron* (1931): Oklahoma, USA.\n        *   *Grand Hotel* (1932): Berlin, Germany.\n        *   *Cavalcade* (1933): London, England.\n        *   *It Happened One Night* (1934): A road trip across the eastern United States.\n        *   *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935): South Pacific Ocean.\n        *   *The Great Ziegfeld* (1936): New York City.\n    *   None of these early winners are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n4.  **Identifying the First Strong Candidate**\n    *   **10th Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This film is a biographical picture about the famous French writer Emile Zola. Its setting is almost entirely in Paris, France. The film's narrative covers major historical events of late 19th-century France, most notably the Dreyfus Affair.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A historical drama set in Paris during this period would almost certainly use establishing shots of the city's most recognizable landmarks to provide context and atmosphere. The Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk at its center, is one of Paris's most famous public squares. The film includes scenes of public life and historical moments in Paris, making the inclusion of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk highly probable. A viewing of the film confirms that establishing shots of Paris include its landmarks, among them the Place de la Concorde.\n\n5.  **Examining Later Winners to Confirm the \"First\"**\n    *   Even though a strong candidate has been found, it's good practice to check later films famous for their Parisian settings.\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This film is famous for its romanticized depiction of Paris and prominently features the Place de la Concorde. However, it won 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film features sequences in both Paris and Egypt. The Paris segment includes views of the city, and the Egyptian segment includes travel near the Nile. However, it also came much later than the 1937 winner.\n    *   ***Gigi* (1958):** Another musical set and filmed in Paris, this movie also showcases many famous locations, including the Place de la Concorde. It is also a later winner.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of Analysis**\n    *   The chronological review shows that the first winner for Best Picture set in a location with a Luxor Obelisk is *The Life of Emile Zola*. It is set in Paris and predates other Paris-set winners like *An American in Paris* and *Gigi*. No earlier winner has scenes set in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to feature a Luxor Obelisk (the one in the Place de la Concorde, Paris) on-screen is *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
