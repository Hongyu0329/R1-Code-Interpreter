    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Topology of the Feynman Diagram**\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction between two vertices corresponds to a propagator (an internal line).\n\nTo understand the diagram's structure, we need to know the type of interaction vertex. The number of lines emanating from a vertex determines the type of interaction (e.g., three lines for $\\phi^3$, four lines for $\\phi^4$). Let's assume the vertices are of the same type.\n\nIf each vertex has $N$ lines, then the total number of line \"stubs\" from the two vertices is $2 \\times N$. Since a propagator connects two stubs, the total number of propagators needed to connect all stubs internally (forming a closed diagram) is $(2 \\times N) / 2 = N$.\n\nThe problem states there are four field contractions, which means there are four propagators. Therefore, $N=4$. This implies the diagram arises from a theory with a four-field interaction, such as the $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex connects four lines.\n\nWith two $\\phi^4$ vertices and four propagators, the only possible topology is one where each of the four propagators connects vertex $v_1$ to vertex $v_2$. This forms a vacuum bubble diagram, often called a \"double scoop\" or \"setting sun\" vacuum diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Definition of a Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when summing over diagrams in a perturbative expansion. It is the number of ways one can permute the internal lines and vertices of a diagram without changing its overall structure (topology). The calculated value of the diagram is then divided by $S$.\n\nWe need to identify all such possible permutations for our diagram.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Symmetry Factor by Counting Symmetries**\n\nWe can break down the calculation into contributions from different types of symmetries:\n\n*   **Symmetry from permuting equivalent propagators:**\n    *   In our diagram, there are four propagators, all running between the same two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   These four propagators are topologically identical. We can exchange any of them, and the diagram will look exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four lines is $4!$.\n    *   $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n*   **Symmetry from permuting equivalent vertices:**\n    *   The diagram consists of two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   Since they are from the same interaction term (e.g., $\\lambda\\phi^4$), they are of the same type.\n    *   Swapping the position labels of $v_1$ and $v_2$ results in the same diagram (four lines connecting the two points).\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two vertices is $2!$.\n    *   $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Symmetries to Find the Total Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the number of permutations from each independent symmetry operation.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of propagator permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations})$\n*   $S = 4! \\times 2!$\n*   $S = 24 \\times 2$\n*   $S = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Interpreting the Diagram:** The most critical step is deducing the diagram's shape from the description. \"Two vertices and four contractions\" uniquely points to the double-scoop vacuum diagram in a $\\phi^4$-type theory, as any other configuration (like a self-energy diagram) would have a different number of propagators for two vertices. A self-energy diagram with two $\\phi^4$ vertices has 3 internal lines, not 4.\n2.  **Systematic Counting:** It is important to consider all possible symmetries. Breaking them down into categories (line permutations, vertex permutations) helps ensure none are missed.\n3.  **Independence of Symmetries:** The permutation of lines and the permutation of vertices are independent operations. Therefore, their contributions to the symmetry factor are multiplicative.\n4.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended):** The result can be cross-checked by counting the number of ways to form the diagram via Wick contractions. The numerical factor in front of the diagram's integral is $1/S$. This method also yields a factor of $1/48$, confirming that $S=48$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is calculated by multiplying the factorial of the number of equivalent propagators by the factorial of the number of equivalent vertices.\n\n$S = 4! \\times 2! = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
