    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices is `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices `C ⊆ V` such that every two distinct vertices in `C` are connected by an edge. A clique with `k` vertices is called a `k`-clique.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph with vertex set `S` and an edge set consisting of all edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **A clique as an induced subgraph:** A set of `k` vertices, `S`, forms a `k`-clique if and only if the subgraph induced by `S`, denoted `G[S]`, is the complete graph on `k` vertices, `K_k`. Therefore, the phrases \"the graph has a `k`-clique\" and \"the graph has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`\" are equivalent.\n\n**Step 2: Formalize the problem**\n\nLet `G` be any graph with 128 vertices. Let `S(G)` be the set of all possible integers `k` such that `G` contains a clique of size `k`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `|S(G)|` over all possible graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the set of clique sizes `S(G)`**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of `S(G)`.\nSuppose a graph `G` has a clique of size `k_{max}`. Let this clique be `C_{max}`. So, `k_{max} = |C_{max}|` and `k_{max}` is an element of `S(G)`. In fact, `k_{max}` is the largest element of `S(G)`, known as the clique number of the graph, `\\omega(G)`.\n\nNow, consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ k_{max}`. Can we show that `k` must also be in `S(G)`?\nYes. Since we have a clique `C_{max}` of size `k_{max}`, we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from `C_{max}`. Let's call this subset `C_k`. Because every vertex in `C_{max}` is connected to every other vertex in `C_{max}`, it follows that every vertex in the subset `C_k` is also connected to every other vertex in `C_k`. Thus, `C_k` is a clique of size `k`.\n\nThis proves a critical point: if a graph `G` contains a clique of size `k_{max}`, it must also contain cliques of all sizes `k` for `1 ≤ k ≤ k_{max}`.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes for any graph `G` is not just some arbitrary collection of integers, but is always a continuous set of integers starting from 1. Specifically, `S(G) = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., \\omega(G)\\}`, where `\\omega(G)` is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the problem to the clique number `ω(G)`**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes in `G` is the cardinality of the set `S(G)`.\nBased on our analysis in Step 3, `|S(G)| = |\\{1, 2, ..., \\omega(G)\\}| = \\omega(G)`.\n\nSo, the problem of finding the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is equivalent to finding the maximum possible value of the clique number, `\\omega(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the maximum possible clique number**\n\nThe size of any clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with `n=128` vertices, the clique number `\\omega(G)` must satisfy `\\omega(G) ≤ 128`.\nThis means the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n**Step 6: Show that this maximum is achievable**\n\nTo prove that 128 is the maximum possible number, we must show that there exists at least one graph `G` on 128 vertices for which the number of different clique sizes is exactly 128.\n\nConsider the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other.\n*   The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is `\\omega(K_{128}) = 128`.\n*   According to our reasoning in Step 4, the number of different clique sizes in `K_{128}` is equal to its clique number, which is 128.\n*   Indeed, for any integer `k` from 1 to 128, we can simply pick any `k` vertices from `K_{128}`, and they will form a `k`-clique. Thus, `K_{128}` has induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_1, K_2, ..., K_{128}`.\n*   The set of clique sizes for `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of different sizes is 128.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is determined by the maximum possible clique number `\\omega(G)` for a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices. The maximum possible value for `\\omega(G)` is 128, and this is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`. This graph contains cliques of every size from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes.\n\n<<<128>>>"
