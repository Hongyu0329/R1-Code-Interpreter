    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^m$, denoted $SD_{2^m}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^m} = \\langle a, b | a^{2^{m-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^{-1+2^{m-2}} \\rangle$.\n    In this problem, the group size is 512, which is $2^9$. So, we have $m=9$. The group is:\n    $G = SD_{512} = \\langle a, b | a^{256} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^{-1+2^7} = a^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of this group are of the form $a^i$ or $a^i b$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup of a group G, denoted $G^n$, is the subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements in G.\n    $G^n = \\langle g^n | g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    The question asks for the size of the set $\\{G^n | n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Exponent of the Group**\n\nThe exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements.\n*   The order of $a^i$ is $256/\\gcd(i, 256)$. The maximum order for elements of this form is 256 (when $i=1$).\n*   Let's find the order of elements of the form $a^i b$. We compute its square:\n    $(a^i b)^2 = a^i b a^i b = a^i (bab^{-1})^i b^2 = a^i (a^{127})^i = a^i a^{127i} = a^{128i}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even, let $i=2k$. Then $(a^{2k}b)^2 = a^{128(2k)} = a^{256k} = 1$. The order is 2.\n    *   If $i$ is odd, let $i=2k+1$. Then $(a^{2k+1}b)^2 = a^{128(2k+1)} = a^{256k}a^{128} = a^{128}$.\n    Since $(a^{128})^2 = a^{256} = 1$, the order of $a^i b$ is 4 when $i$ is odd.\nThe orders of elements in $G$ are powers of 2, specifically divisors of 256 or 4. The maximum order is 256. Therefore, the exponent of $G$ is $\\exp(G)=256$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nFor a finite p-group $G$ with exponent $p^e$, it is a known result that the power subgroup $G^n$ is equal to $G^{\\gcd(n, p^e)}$.\nOur group $G=SD_{512}$ is a 2-group ($p=2$) with exponent $256 = 2^8$ (so $e=8$).\nThus, any power subgroup $G^n$ is equal to $G^d$ where $d = \\gcd(n, 256)$.\nThe divisors of 256 are the powers of 2 from $2^0$ to $2^8$:\n$d \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\nThis means there are at most 9 distinct power subgroups, one for each of these divisors. To find the exact number, we need to check if these 9 subgroups are all distinct.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Power Subgroups for Divisors of the Exponent**\n\nWe will compute the structure of $G^{2^k}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 8$.\n$G^{2^k} = \\langle g^{2^k} | g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle (a^i)^{2^k}, (a^j b)^{2^k} \\rangle$ for all possible $i, j$.\n\n*   For $k=0$ ($n=1$):\n    $G^1 = G$. This is the group $SD_{512}$ itself. Its order is 512.\n\n*   For $k=1$ ($n=2$):\n    $G^2 = \\langle (a^i)^2, (a^j b)^2 \\rangle$. The term $(a^i)^2$ generates the subgroup $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$. The term $(a^j b)^2$ is $1$ if $j$ is even, and $a^{128}$ if $j$ is odd. So, $G^2$ is generated by the elements of $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$ and the element $a^{128}$. Since $a^{128} = (a^2)^{64}$, it is already in $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle a^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$.\n\n*   For $k=2$ ($n=4$):\n    $G^4 = \\langle (a^i)^4, (a^j b)^4 \\rangle$. The term $(a^i)^4$ generates $\\langle a^4 \\rangle$. The elements $(a^j b)$ have order 2 or 4. In both cases, $(a^j b)^4 = 1$.\n    Thus, $G^4 = \\langle a^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/4 = 64$.\n\n*   For $k \\ge 2$:\n    The argument for $k=2$ extends. For any $k \\ge 2$, $2^k$ is a multiple of 4. Since every element $(a^j b)$ has order 2 or 4, $(a^j b)^{2^k}=1$.\n    Therefore, for $k \\ge 2$, $G^{2^k}$ is generated solely by the elements $(a^i)^{2^k}$, which means $G^{2^k} = \\langle a^{2^k} \\rangle$.\n    The order of this cyclic subgroup is $256/2^k = 2^{8-k}$.\n\n**Step 5: List the Distinct Power Subgroups and Count Them**\n\nWe now list the distinct power subgroups we have found:\n1.  $G^{2^0} = G^1 = SD_{512}$. Order 512.\n2.  $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle a^2 \\rangle$. Order 128.\n3.  $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle a^4 \\rangle$. Order 64.\n4.  $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle a^8 \\rangle$. Order 32.\n5.  $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle a^{16} \\rangle$. Order 16.\n6.  $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle a^{32} \\rangle$. Order 8.\n7.  $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle a^{64} \\rangle$. Order 4.\n8.  $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle a^{128} \\rangle$. Order 2. (This is the center of the group, $Z(G)$).\n9.  $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. Order 1. (The trivial subgroup).\n\nWe have found 9 subgroups. To confirm they are all distinct, we can compare their orders. The orders are $512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$. Since all the orders are different, the 9 subgroups are indeed distinct.\n\nThus, there are 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512."
