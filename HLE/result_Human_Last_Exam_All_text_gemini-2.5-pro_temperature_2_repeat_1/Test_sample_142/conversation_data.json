    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **System Identification:** The molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We need to determine the total number of electrons in this molecule. The chemical formula is interpreted as containing one carbon (C), three hydrogens (H), one silicon (Si), and one fluorine (F) atom.\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** The 6-31G** basis set must be correctly interpreted to find the number of basis functions (atomic orbitals) for each atom. The `**` notation is critical, indicating polarization functions on both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. By convention, programs use 6 Cartesian d-functions for d-polarization and 3 Cartesian p-functions for p-polarization.\n3.  **Calculation Type:** The calculation is a Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI). This means we must consider all possible ways of distributing the electrons among the available molecular orbitals (which are formed from the atomic orbital basis functions).\n4.  **Target Quantity:** We need to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs), not Slater determinants. CSFs are spin-adapted linear combinations of determinants. For a stable molecule with an even number of electrons like this one, we calculate the number of singlet (total spin S=0) CSFs.\n5.  **Formula Selection:** A standard formula is required to calculate the number of CSFs based on the number of electrons (N), the number of spatial orbitals (K), and the total spin (S).\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:** The calculation will involve very large numbers (combinations of large numbers), requiring careful arithmetic, preferably with a tool that handles arbitrary-precision integers.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nWe sum the number of electrons for each atom in the molecule:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each (x3) -> 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n*   **Total Electrons (N)** = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n*   This is an even number, so the ground state will be a singlet (total spin S=0).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of spatial basis functions (K)**\n\nWe count the number of basis functions provided by the 6-31G** basis set for each atom:\n*   **For Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G** basis provides a [2s1p] set of functions.\n    *   2 s-type functions + 1 set of p-type functions (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n    *   Number of functions per H = 2 + 3 = 5.\n*   **For Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):** The 6-31G** basis provides a [3s2p1d] set of functions.\n    *   3 s-type functions + 2 sets of p-type functions (2 * 3 = 6) + 1 set of d-type functions (6 Cartesian functions).\n    *   Number of functions per C or F = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15.\n*   **For Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):** The 6-31G** basis provides a [4s3p1d] set of functions.\n    *   4 s-type functions + 3 sets of p-type functions (3 * 3 = 9) + 1 set of d-type functions (6 Cartesian functions).\n    *   Number of functions per Si = 4 + 9 + 6 = 19.\n\nNow, we sum the functions for all atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F):\n*   **Total Basis Functions (K)** = (1 × 15) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 19) + (1 × 15)\n*   K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64 spatial orbitals**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet (S=0) CSFs**\n\nThe formula for the number of CSFs for a singlet state (S=0) in a system with K spatial orbitals and N electrons is:\nNumber of CSFs = $\\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1} \\binom{K}{N/2+1}$\n\nHere, K = 64 and N = 32, so N/2 = 16. Plugging in the values:\nNumber of CSFs = $\\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the numerical value**\n\nWe first evaluate the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot (64-16)!} = 458,343,268,710,615$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot (64-15)!} = 149,662,334,268,776$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot (64-17)!} = 1,294,145,685,780,984$\n\nNow, substitute these into the formula:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (458,343,268,710,615)^2 = 210,080,480,593,520,387,419,002,122,225$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (149,662,334,268,776) \\times (1,294,145,685,780,984) = 193,687,274,453,959,045,717,804,028,224$\n\nFinally, perform the subtraction:\n*   Number of CSFs = $210,080,480,593,520,387,419,002,122,225 - 193,687,274,453,959,045,717,804,028,224$\n*   Number of CSFs = $16,393,206,139,561,341,701,198,094,001$\n\nThis is an immense number, which is characteristic of Full CI calculations on non-trivial systems.\n\n<<<16,393,206,139,561,341,701,198,094,001>>>"
