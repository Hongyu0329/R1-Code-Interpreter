    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\nThe expression must evaluate to `True`.\nThe length must be exactly 5 symbols.\nOperator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nWe can classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 by the number of binary operators (`&`, `|`) they contain. An expression can have 0, 1, or 2 binary operators.\n\n### Case 1: 0 Binary Operators\nThe expression is built using only `T`, `F`, `!`, `(`, `)`. We need to find all valid, true expressions of length 5.\n\nLet's list them systematically:\n1.  `!!!!T`: This is parsed as `!(!(!(!T)))`. Length is 5. `T` -> `!F` -> `!!T` -> `!!!F` -> `!!!!T`. The final value is `True`.\n2.  `((T))`: This is parsed as `( (T) )`. Length is 5. The value is `True`.\n3.  `(!!T)`: This is parsed as `( !(!T) )`. The symbols are `(`, `!`, `!`, `T`, `)`. Length is 5. The value is `True`.\n4.  `!!(T)`: This is parsed as `!(!(T))`. The symbols are `!`, `!`, `(`, `T`, `)`. Length is 5. The value is `True`.\n5.  `!((F))`: This is parsed as `!( (F) )`. The symbols are `!`, `(`, `(`, `F`, `)`, `)`. Length is 5. `! (F)` evaluates to `!F`, which is `True`.\n6.  `!(!!F)`: This is parsed as `!( !(!F) )`. The symbols are `!`, `(`, `!`, `!`, `F`, `)`. Length is 5. `!(!(!F))` evaluates to `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> `True`.\n7.  `!!(!F)`: This is parsed as `!(!(!F))`. The symbols are `!`, `!`, `(`, `!`, `F`, `)`. Length is 5. `!(!(!F))` evaluates to `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> `True`.\n\nThere are **7** such expressions.\n\n### Case 2: 1 Binary Operator\nThe expression has a single `&` or `|`. The general structures are `A op B` or `(A op B)`.\n\n**Subcase 2.1: Structure `A op B`**\nHere, `A` and `B` are expressions that do not contain binary operators themselves.\n`length(A) + length(op) + length(B) = 5`, so `length(A) + length(B) = 4`.\nThe possible pairs of lengths for (A, B) are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 1).\n\n*   **Operands by length:**\n    *   Length 1: `T` (True), `F` (False)\n    *   Length 2: `!F` (True), `!T` (False)\n    *   Length 3: `(T)` (True), `!!T` (True), `(F)` (False), `!!F` (False) (There are 2 true and 2 false expressions of length 3 with no binary ops).\n\n*   **(length(A)=1, length(B)=3):**\n    *   `A & B`: `A` must be `T`. `B` must be one of the 2 true length-3 expressions. (1 * 2 = 2 expressions)\n    *   `A | B`: (A=T, B=any) or (A=F, B=T). (1 * 4) + (1 * 2) = 6 expressions.\n    *   Total for (1,3): 2 + 6 = 8.\n\n*   **(length(A)=2, length(B)=2):**\n    *   `A & B`: `A` must be `!F`, `B` must be `!F`. (1 * 1 = 1 expression)\n    *   `A | B`: (`A`=T, `B`=any) or (`A`=F, `B`=T). (1 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 3 expressions.\n    *   Total for (2,2): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **(length(A)=3, length(B)=1):** Symmetric to (1,3). Total = 8.\n\nTotal for Subcase 2.1: 8 + 4 + 8 = **20** expressions.\n\n**Subcase 2.2: Structure `(A op B)`**\nHere, `A` and `B` are literals (`T`, `F`) because the parens add 2 to the length.\n`length('(') + length(A) + length(op) + length(B) + length(')') = 5`, so `length(A)+length(B) = 1`. This is impossible.\nWait, my formula is wrong. `1 + len(A) + 1 + len(B) + 1 = 5`, so `len(A) + len(B) = 2`.\nThis means `len(A)=1` and `len(B)=1`.\n*   `(A & B)` is true only for `(T & T)`. (1 expression)\n*   `(A | B)` is true for `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)`. (3 expressions)\nTotal for Subcase 2.2: 1 + 3 = **4** expressions.\n\n### Case 3: 2 Binary Operators\nThe expression contains two `&`s or `|`s. The operands must be single letters (`T`, `F`) for the total length to be 5 (`A op1 B op2 C`). The structure is determined by operator precedence (`&` before `|`). Parentheses could be used to override precedence, but this would make the expression longer than 5 symbols (e.g., `(T|F)&T` has 7 symbols). Therefore, we only consider expressions without parentheses.\n\n*   `A & B & C`: Parsed as `(A & B) & C`. True only if `A, B, C` are all `T`. (1 expression: `T&T&T`)\n*   `A | B | C`: Parsed as `(A | B) | C`. True if at least one operand is `T`. This is true for 7 of the 8 combinations of T/F for A,B,C. (7 expressions)\n*   `A & B | C`: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. True if `C` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `C` is `F` and `A&B` is `T` (1 combination: `T&T&F`). (5 expressions)\n*   `A | B & C`: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. True if `A` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `A` is `F` and `B&C` is `T` (1 combination: `F|T&T`). (5 expressions)\n\nTotal for Case 3: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18** expressions.\n\n### Final Calculation\nAdding up the counts from all disjoint cases:\n*   Case 1 (0 operators): 7\n*   Case 2 (1 operator): 20 + 4 = 24\n*   Case 3 (2 operators): 18\n\nTotal True Expressions = 7 + 24 + 18 = 49.\n\n<<<49>>>"
