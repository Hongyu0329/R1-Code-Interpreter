    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hypothesis Class\nThe hypothesis class is defined as $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$.\n*   $X$ is the domain of points, with $|X| = T$.\n*   $h$ is a hypothesis, which is a function that classifies each point in $X$ as either 0 or 1.\n*   The constraint is that any valid hypothesis $h$ in this class must assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ points from the domain $X$.\n*   $z$ is a positive integer. For the class to be non-empty, the number of points we label '1' cannot exceed the total number of available points, so we assume $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n### Step 2: Recalling the Definition of VC Dimension\nThe VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be **shattered** by $H$. A set $S$ of size $d$ is shattered if for every one of the $2^d$ possible binary labelings of the points in $S$, there exists a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that can produce that specific labeling.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Condition for Realizing a Labeling\nLet's determine when a set of points $S \\subset X$ with size $|S| = d$ can be shattered. To shatter $S$, we must be able to realize any given labeling for the points in $S$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary labeling for the $d$ points in $S$. Suppose this labeling has $k$ points labeled '1' and $d-k$ points labeled '0'. The value of $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $d$.\n\nFor this labeling to be realized by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The hypothesis $h$ must match the labeling on $S$. So, it must assign '1' to $k$ specific points in $S$ and '0' to the other $d-k$ points in $S$.\n2.  The hypothesis $h$ must belong to $H_{z-ones}$, meaning it must assign '1' to exactly $z$ points in total over the entire domain $X$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, the number of '1's that $h$ assigns to points *outside* of $S$ (i.e., in the set $X \\setminus S$) must be exactly $z - k$.\nThe number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T - d$.\n\nFor it to be possible to assign $z-k$ ones to the points in $X \\setminus S$, two constraints must be satisfied:\n*   **Constraint A:** The number of required '1's must be non-negative: $z - k \\ge 0$, which implies $k \\le z$.\n*   **Constraint B:** The number of required '1's must not exceed the number of available points in $X \\setminus S$: $z-k \\le T-d$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Largest Shatterable Set Size\nFor the class $H_{z-ones}$ to shatter a set $S$ of size $d$, the two constraints derived above must hold for **all** possible labelings of $S$. This means they must hold for all possible values of $k$, where $k$ is the number of '1's in the labeling and can range from $0$ to $d$.\n\n*   **Analyzing Constraint A ($k \\le z$):** This must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The most restrictive case is when $k$ is at its maximum, i.e., $k=d$. So, we must have $d \\le z$.\n\n*   **Analyzing Constraint B ($z-k \\le T-d$):** This must also hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The left side, $z-k$, is largest when $k$ is smallest, i.e., $k=0$. To satisfy the constraint in the \"worst-case\", we need $z - 0 \\le T-d$, which simplifies to $z \\le T-d$, or equivalently, $d \\le T-z$.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, both conditions must be met. Therefore, $d$ must satisfy both $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$. This means $d$ can be at most the smaller of these two values:\n$d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nThis shows that any set of size $d > \\min(z, T-z)$ cannot be shattered, which gives us an upper bound on the VC dimension: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 5: Proving the Lower Bound\nNow we show that we can indeed shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let $S$ be any set of this size. As we showed in Step 4, for any labeling of $S$ with $k$ ones (where $0 \\le k \\le d$):\n*   $k \\le d \\le z \\implies z-k \\ge 0$.\n*   $d \\le T-z \\implies z+d \\le T$. Since $k \\le d$, we have $z+k \\le z+d \\le T \\implies z-k \\le T-2k$. This is not quite the condition. Let's use the simple one: $d \\le T-z \\implies z \\le T-d$. Since $k \\ge 0$, we have $z-k \\le z \\le T-d$. So $z-k \\le T-d$.\n\nSince both conditions ($0 \\le z-k$ and $z-k \\le T-d$) hold for any $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$, we can always complete the labeling. We can define a valid hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ by:\n1.  Assigning labels to points in $S$ as per the given labeling ( $k$ ones, $d-k$ zeros).\n2.  Choosing any $z-k$ points from the $T-d$ points in $X \\setminus S$ and labeling them '1'.\n3.  Labeling the remaining points in $X \\setminus S$ as '0'.\n\nThe total number of ones assigned by this $h$ is $k + (z-k) = z$, so $h \\in H_{z-ones}$. Since this works for any labeling of $S$, the set $S$ of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\nThis establishes the lower bound: $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nCombining the results from Step 4 and Step 5:\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n*   $VC(H_{z-ones}) \\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n**Example check:** If $T=10$ and we must assign $z=3$ ones, the VC dimension is $\\min(3, 10-3) = \\min(3, 7) = 3$. If we must assign $z=8$ ones, the VC dimension is $\\min(8, 10-8) = \\min(8, 2) = 2$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
