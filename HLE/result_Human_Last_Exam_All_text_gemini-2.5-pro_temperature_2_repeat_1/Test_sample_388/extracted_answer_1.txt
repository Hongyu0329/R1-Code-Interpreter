The pharmacist should counsel Allison on a significant drug interaction. Her antidepressant, Fluoxetine (an SSRI), when taken with Excedrin (which contains aspirin, an NSAID), significantly increases the risk of stomach bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend that she avoid using Excedrin or other NSAIDs (like ibuprofen or naproxen) while on Fluoxetine. For future headaches, a safer over-the-counter option would be a product containing only acetaminophen (such as Tylenol). She should also be advised to mention the headaches to her doctor, as they could be a side effect of her medications.
