No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry in bumblebees is to provide a visual warning signal to predators, which are primarily birds. Birds have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Since bumblebee color patterns can include UV components, human-based visual similarity rankings will miss a critical part of the signal. Therefore, the resulting clusters may not reflect the groupings that are actually perceived by the predators and thus may not represent the true, functional mimicry syndromes.
