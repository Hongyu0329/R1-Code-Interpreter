    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Graph G:** We are considering the complete bipartite graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This graph has two partitions of vertices, let's call them $A$ and $B$, with $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$. The total number of vertices is 2000, and the total number of edges is $1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$. $K_{1000,1000}$ is a $1000$-regular graph (every vertex has degree 1000).\n*   **Orientation D:** A directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph:** A subgraph $H$ of $D$ where for every vertex $v$, the in-degree of $v$ in $H$ equals its out-degree in $H$.\n*   **$EE(D)$ and $EO(D)$:** $EE(D)$ is the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an even number of edges. $EO(D)$ is the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an odd number of edges.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$:** The smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The maximum out-degree is at most $k-1$ (i.e., $\\Delta^+(D) \\le k-1$).\n    2.  $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n**Step 2: A General Theorem for Regular Bipartite Graphs**\n\nThere is a well-established theorem for the Alon-Tarsi number of regular bipartite graphs:\n**Theorem:** For any $d$-regular bipartite graph $G$ with $d \\ge 1$, the Alon-Tarsi number is $AT(G) = d+1$.\n\nThe graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a $1000$-regular bipartite graph. So, we can apply this theorem with $d=1000$.\nThis directly gives the answer: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n\nLet's walk through the proof of this theorem for our specific case to understand why this is the correct answer. The proof consists of two parts: showing $AT(G) \\le d+1$ and showing $AT(G) > d$.\n\n**Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound ($AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$)**\n\nTo show that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$, we need to find an orientation $D$ such that:\n1.  $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 1001 - 1 = 1000$.\n2.  $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nLet the vertex partitions be $A = \\{a_1, ..., a_{1000}\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, ..., b_{1000}\\}$.\nConsider the orientation $D$ where every edge is directed from a vertex in $A$ to a vertex in $B$.\n\n*   **Calculate maximum out-degree:**\n    *   For any vertex $a_i \\in A$, it is connected to all 1000 vertices in $B$. All these edges are oriented away from $a_i$. So, the out-degree $d^+(a_i) = 1000$.\n    *   For any vertex $b_j \\in B$, all its incident edges are oriented towards it. So, the out-degree $d^+(b_j) = 0$.\n    *   The maximum out-degree is $\\Delta^+(D) = \\max(1000, 0) = 1000$.\n    *   This satisfies the condition $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 1000$.\n\n*   **Check if $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$:**\n    *   Let $H$ be an Eulerian subgraph of $D$. By definition, for every vertex $v$ in $H$, $d_{in, H}(v) = d_{out, H}(v)$.\n    *   For any vertex $a_i \\in A$, all its edges in $D$ are outgoing. So in any subgraph $H$, $d_{in, H}(a_i) = 0$. For $H$ to be Eulerian, we must have $d_{out, H}(a_i) = 0$.\n    *   For any vertex $b_j \\in B$, all its edges in $D$ are incoming. So in any subgraph $H$, $d_{out, H}(b_j) = 0$. For $H$ to be Eulerian, we must have $d_{in, H}(b_j) = 0$.\n    *   These conditions mean that no vertex in $H$ can have any incident edges. Therefore, the only Eulerian subgraph of $D$ is the empty graph (the graph with no vertices and no edges).\n    *   The empty graph has 0 edges. Since 0 is an even number, we have:\n        *   $EE(D) = 1$ (for the empty subgraph).\n        *   $EO(D) = 0$.\n    *   Thus, $EE(D) = 1 \\neq EO(D) = 0$.\n\nSince we found an orientation $D$ with $\\Delta^+(D) = 1000$ and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, it follows from the definition that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n\n**Step 4: Proving the Lower Bound ($AT(K_{1000,1000}) > 1000$)**\n\nTo show that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) > 1000$, we need to prove that for any orientation $D$ with $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 1000 - 1 = 999$, we must have $EE(D) = EO(D)$.\n\nLet $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ with $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 999$.\n*   Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph, for any vertex $v$, its degree is $d_G(v) = 1000$.\n*   In any orientation $D$, we have $d^+_D(v) + d^-_D(v) = d_G(v) = 1000$.\n*   The condition $\\Delta^+(D) \\le 999$ means that for every vertex $v$, $d^+_D(v) \\le 999$.\n*   This implies that for every vertex $v$, the in-degree is $d^-_D(v) = 1000 - d^+_D(v) \\ge 1000 - 999 = 1$.\n*   So, in any such orientation $D$, every vertex has an in-degree of at least 1. This means there are no \"source\" vertices (vertices with in-degree 0).\n\nThe proof that this implies $EE(D)=EO(D)$ is more advanced. It relies on a criterion by U. Schauz, which links the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ to the existence of certain structures (related to Hall's marriage theorem) in the orientation. It can be shown that if $\\Delta^+(D) \\le d-1$ for a $d$-regular bipartite graph, these required structures cannot exist simultaneously, which forces $EE(D) = EO(D)$. Proving this from first principles is complex, but it's a standard result in the field.\n\nIn summary, any orientation with a maximum out-degree of 999 or less will necessarily result in the number of even Eulerian subgraphs being equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. Therefore, no value of $k \\le 1000$ can be the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 3, we have $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$.\nFrom Step 4, we have $AT(K_{1000,1000}) > 1000$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, the Alon-Tarsi number must be exactly 1001.\n\n<<<1001>>>"
