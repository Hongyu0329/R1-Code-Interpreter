    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Kanji character.**\nThe character in question is 謄. We can see it is composed of two parts, a left side and a right side. This is a common structure for Kanji called *hen-tsukuri* (偏旁).\n*   The left part (hen) is: 言\n*   The right part (tsukuri) is: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (bushu).**\nIn most Kanji with a left-right (*hen-tsukuri*) structure, the left part (*hen*) serves as the radical. The radical indicates the general semantic category of the character. In this case, the left part is 言, which means \"speech,\" \"word,\" or \"to say.\" Many characters related to speaking, language, or recording things have this radical (e.g., 語, 話, 記). Therefore, 言 is the radical of 謄.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Japanese name of the radical.**\nThe radical 言, when it appears on the left side of a character, is called by a specific name.\n*   The radical itself is 言.\n*   Its positional name is *gonben* (言偏). This name comes from the *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) of the character, \"gon,\" combined with \"hen\" (meaning \"left side\"), which is voiced to \"ben\".\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the name into Hepburn Romanization.**\nThe Japanese name for the radical is ごんべん. The Hepburn transcription for this is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize the common Kanji structures, like the left-right *hen-tsukuri* form, as it's the primary clue for identifying the radical.\n*   One must know the specific names given to radicals based on their position within a character. The radical 言 is not just called \"gen\" in this context, but more specifically \"gonben\".\n*   The romanization must be accurate. In Hepburn, ごんべん is \"Gonben\", not \"Gomben\", as the \"n\" sound before \"b\" is not written as \"m\".\n\nFollowing this analysis, we conclude that the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name in Hepburn transcription is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
