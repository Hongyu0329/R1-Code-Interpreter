    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial state and coordinate system.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard Cartesian coordinate system. We can define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a unit cube with one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The side length is 1.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n*   **The Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of the cube connects opposite vertices. For our Cube A, the main diagonal from the origin is the line segment connecting (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted in geometric problems to mean that the components of the shift vector along each axis are 1/2 of the components of the diagonal vector. In this case, the shift vector **v** is:\n    **v** = 1/2 * **d** = 1/2 * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\nThis means Cube A is displaced by 1/2 unit in the x-direction, 1/2 unit in the y-direction, and 1/2 unit in the z-direction to form Cube B.\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nCube B is the result of shifting every point of Cube A by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). So, for any point (x, y, z) in Cube B, its coordinates must satisfy:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 4: Find the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the conditions for both Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the overlap for each coordinate's range.\n*   **x-coordinate:** The point must be in the range `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-coordinate:** The point must be in the range `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-coordinate:** The point must be in the range `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nSo, the region of intersection is a new rectangular prism (in this case, a cube) defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe volume of this intersection region is the product of the lengths of its sides.\n*   Length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/8**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the shift:** The most critical step is interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The alternative interpretation, that the *distance* of the shift is 1/2, would result in a shift vector of `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))` and a much more complicated and \"messy\" answer. The interpretation used above is standard for such problems and leads to a clean, logical solution.\n2.  **Symmetry:** A cube has four main diagonals. Due to the cube's symmetry, the volume of intersection is the same regardless of which main diagonal is chosen for the shift. Our choice of the diagonal from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) simplifies the setup without loss of generality.\n3.  **Intersection Logic:** The geometry of the intersection is a smaller cube because the shift is aligned with the axes in this coordinate system. The volume can be found by simply multiplying the lengths of the overlapping intervals for each dimension.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the volume of the intersection is calculated as follows:\nThe intersection forms a cube with side lengths of (1 - 1/2) = 1/2.\nThe volume is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
