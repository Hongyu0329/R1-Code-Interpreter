The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids in the patch—Serine-47, Glutamate-48, Glutamate-49, and Aspartate-50—to Alanine. This A-A-A-A mutant would effectively and cleanly eliminate the entire negatively charged environment. The S47A mutation removes the phosphorylation site, and the E48A, E49A, and D50A mutations replace the negatively charged acidic residues with a small, neutral amino acid.
