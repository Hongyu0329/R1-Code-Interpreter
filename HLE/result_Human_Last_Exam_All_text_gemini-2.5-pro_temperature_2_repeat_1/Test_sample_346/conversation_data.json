    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Goal\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate a complex SKI combinator expression which represents a Church integer `n`. After finding the value of `n`, we need to compute `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Combinators and Church Numerals\n\nFirst, we need the reduction rules for the S, K, and I combinators:\n*   **S** x y z → x z (y z)\n*   **K** x y → x\n*   **I** x → x\n\nA Church integer `n` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. The lambda calculus representation is `λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n\nWe will identify the standard SKI representations of some key Church numerals and functions within the expression.\n*   **Church Numeral 1**: The identity combinator `I` behaves like the Church numeral 1 when applied to two arguments: `I f x → f x`, which is `f^1(x)`. So, `1 = I`.\n*   **Successor Function (`Succ`)**: The problem uses a combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` to represent the successor function. Let's verify this. Let `n` be a church numeral.\n    `Succ n f x = S(S(K(S))(K)) n f x`\n    `→ S(K S)(K) f (n f) x`\n    `→ K S f (K f) (n f) x`\n    `→ S (K f) (n f) x`\n    `→ K f x ((n f) x)`\n    `→ f (n f x)`\n    Since `n f x → f^n(x)`, the expression becomes `f(f^n(x)) = f^{n+1}(x)`. This confirms that `S(S(K(S))(K))` is indeed a successor function (`n → n+1`).\n*   **Another Successor Function (`+1`)**: The combinator `S(I)` also acts as a successor function.\n    `S(I) n f x → I f (n f) x`\n    `→ f (n f x)`\n    `→ f(f^n(x)) = f^{n+1}(x)`.\n    So, `S(I)` also maps `n` to `n+1`.\n\n### Step 3: Deconstructing the Expression\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break this down using the definitions from Step 2. We can see multiple nested applications. According to the rule of left-associativity in combinator logic (`A B C D` means `(((A B) C) D)`), we should parse it from the inside out.\n\nLet's identify the innermost components:\n1.  `P = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    This is `Succ(I)`. Since `I` is Church numeral `1`, `P` is `Succ(1)`, which is Church numeral `2`.\n2.  `Q = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n    First, we evaluate `S(I)(I)`. This is `S(I)` applied to Church numeral `1`.\n    `S(I)(I) f x → f(I f x) → f(f x)`, which is `f^2(x)`. So `S(I)(I)` is Church numeral `2`.\n    Therefore, `Q = Succ(S(I)(I)) = Succ(2)`, which is Church numeral `3`.\n\nNow, we can substitute `P` and `Q` back into the main expression.\nThe expression becomes: `S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I) (K(2)) (3) ) )`\nLet's add parentheses to show the order of operations:\n`S(I) ( S(I) ( (S(I)(K(2))) (3) ) )`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Innermost Non-trivial Part\n\nLet's evaluate the innermost complex term: `G = (S(I)(K(2))) (3)`.\n*   We apply the `S` combinator rule `S x y z → x z (y z)` with `x = I`, `y = K(2)`, and `z = 3`.\n*   `(S(I)(K(2))) (3) → (I 3) ((K 2) 3)`\n*   `I 3 → 3`\n*   `(K 2) 3 → 2`\n*   So, `G → 3 2` (The combinator `3` applied to the combinator `2`).\n\n### Step 5: Church Numeral Exponentiation\n\nWhen one Church numeral `m` is applied to another `n` (`m n`), this represents exponentiation: `n^m`. The numeral on the left (`m`) is the exponent, and the one on the right (`n`) is the base.\n*   In our case `3 2`, the exponent is `3` and the base is `2`.\n*   So, `3 2` represents the Church numeral for `2^3 = 8`.\n*   The expression now simplifies to `S(I) (S(I) (8))`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Evaluation\n\nWe are left with two applications of the successor combinator `S(I)`.\n*   First, we evaluate `S(I) (8)`. As established in Step 2, `S(I)` adds one to the numeral. So `S(I)(8)` yields Church numeral `9`.\n*   The expression is now `S(I) (9)`.\n*   Applying the successor function again, `S(I)(9)` yields Church numeral `10`.\n\nThus, the entire expression evaluates to the Church integer `n = 10`.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 10`\n*   `log_2(10) = ln(10) / ln(2) ≈ 2.302585 / 0.693147 ≈ 3.321928`\n\nThe question format implies a numerical answer is expected.\n\n<<<3.321928>>>"
