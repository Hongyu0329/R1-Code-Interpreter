    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Curve Definition**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis type of curve is known as a Lissajous curve. The shape of the curve is determined by the ratio of the frequencies in the x and y components. Here, the frequencies are n_x = 9 and n_y = 5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Period of the Curve**\nTo find the self-intersection points, we first need to determine the interval of 't' over which the curve is traced exactly once. This is the period of the parametric curve.\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π / 9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π / 5.\nThe period of the entire curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, the curve traces itself exactly once as t varies in the interval [0, 2π). We look for self-intersections within this interval.\n\n**Step 3: Define a Self-Intersection Point**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x₀, y₀) that the curve passes through at two or more different times. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points (x₀, y₀) for which there exist t₁ and t₂ such that:\n0 ≤ t₁ < t₂ < 2π\nx(t₁) = x(t₂) = x₀\ny(t₁) = y(t₂) = y₀\n\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1. cos(9t₁) = cos(9t₂)\n2. sin(5t₁) = sin(5t₂)\n\n**Step 4: Use the Standard Formula for Lissajous Curves**\nSolving this system of equations directly can be complex because it's necessary to count the number of unique coordinate pairs (x₀, y₀) generated by the solution pairs (t₁, t₂). A more direct and reliable method is to use the established formula for the number of self-intersections of a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(n_x t), y(t) = sin(n_y t).\n\n**Careful point 1: Verify the conditions for the formula.**\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points N is given by:\nN = (n_x - 1)(n_y - 1) / 2\nThis formula is valid under specific conditions:\n1.  n_x and n_y must be integers. (Here, n_x=9, n_y=5, which are integers).\n2.  n_x and n_y must be coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. (GCD(9, 5) = 1. This condition is met).\n3.  n_x and n_y must both be odd. (9 is odd and 5 is odd. This condition is met).\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, we can confidently apply the formula.\n\n**Careful point 2: Distinguish from other cases.**\nIt is important to use the correct formula. If one frequency were even and the other odd, the number of self-intersections would be zero. The formula differs for other forms like sin/sin or cos/cos curves. The given curve perfectly matches the cos/sin form with two odd, coprime frequencies.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Number of Self-Intersection Points**\nSubstitute the values n_x = 9 and n_y = 5 into the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n*   The curve is identified as a Lissajous curve x=cos(9t), y=sin(5t).\n*   The conditions for using the standard formula for self-intersections are checked and verified: the frequencies (9 and 5) are coprime and both are odd integers.\n*   The formula N = (n_x-1)(n_y-1)/2 is applied.\n*   Plugging in the numbers gives N = (9-1)(5-1)/2 = 16."
