    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific object held by the artist Curt Querner in a self-portrait from 1933. It also states the context: the painting was made after he escaped from the Gestapo, and the object he is holding is a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Research the historical context**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner (1904-1976), a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement.\n*   **Political Affiliation:** He was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO).\n*   **The Event of 1933:** Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Querner was arrested in March 1933 by the SA (the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing, who performed many of the early arrests before the Gestapo was fully established). He was imprisoned and tortured in Dresden. He managed to escape from custody.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork**\nThe painting in question is Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Cloth), also known as \"Self-Portrait after Escaping from Custody.\" He painted it in the months following his ordeal. The portrait starkly depicts his gaunt face and haunted eyes, showing the physical and psychological toll of his imprisonment and torture.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object and its symbolism**\n*   **The Object:** In the portrait, Curt Querner is holding a small, vibrant red flower in his right hand. This flower is specifically a **red carnation** (rote Nelke).\n*   **The Symbolism:** The red carnation was a well-known political symbol.\n    *   **Color Red:** The color red has long been associated with the labor movement, socialism, and communism.\n    *   **The Red Carnation:** Specifically, the red carnation was a symbol used by socialists and communists, particularly in Germany and Austria, often worn on International Workers' Day (May Day). It was an emblem of affiliation with the political left.\n    *   **Symbol of Resistance:** By holding the red carnation prominently in the portrait after being persecuted for his political beliefs, Querner made a powerful and defiant statement. It symbolized his unbroken spirit and his continued adherence to his communist ideals in the face of Nazi oppression. It was an act of personal and political resistance.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis**\nAfter escaping imprisonment and torture by Nazi authorities for his communist beliefs, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait. In this portrait, he holds a red carnation, a direct and defiant symbol of the leftist political ideals for which he had been persecuted.\n\n***\n\n<<<A red carnation>>>"
