    "This problem asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ has a non-empty intersection with $A$. Here $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the group G and its cyclic subgroups.**\n    *   $G$ is an abelian group, which is a direct product of 2024 copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ must divide 49. The divisors of 49 are 1, 7, and 49.\n    *   Consequently, the order of any element $g \\in G$ must be 1, 7, or 49.\n    *   The cyclic subgroups of $G$ are therefore of order 1, 7, or 49.\n        *   Order 1: The trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, where $0$ is the identity element of $G$.\n        *   Order 7: Cyclic subgroups generated by an element of order 7.\n        *   Order 49: Cyclic subgroups generated by an element of order 49.\n\n2.  **Analyze the condition on the set A.**\n    *   The condition is that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ must be non-empty.\n    *   Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the family of all cyclic subgroups of $G$. We want to find the minimum size of a set $A$ (a \"hitting set\") such that for all $H \\in \\mathcal{C}$, $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n3.  **Consider the trivial subgroup.**\n    *   The trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0\\}$ is a cyclic subgroup of $G$ (generated by the identity element 0).\n    *   For the condition to hold for $H_0$, we must have $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. This implies that $0 \\in A$.\n\n4.  **Literal interpretation vs. intended problem.**\n    *   **Literal interpretation:** If we take $A = \\{0\\}$, let's check the condition. For any cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, by the definition of a subgroup, $0 \\in H$. Since $0 \\in A$, the intersection $A \\cap H = \\{0\\}$ is non-empty. Thus, $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition. The size of this set is 1. This would mean the specific structure of $G$ (apart from it being a group) is irrelevant. This is unlikely to be the intended problem, as the numbers 49 and 2024 would be superfluous information.\n    *   **Intended Problem:** In contest-style problems, there is often an implicit assumption of non-triviality. A more likely interpretation is that for any *non-trivial* cyclic subgroup, its intersection with $A$ must contain a *non-zero* element. The problem would then be to find the minimum size of a set $A$ such that:\n        1.  $0 \\in A$ (to handle the trivial subgroup).\n        2.  For every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$, $A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n    We will proceed with solving this more challenging and likely intended problem.\n\n5.  **Solving the intended problem.**\n    *   Let $A = \\{0\\} \\cup A'$, where $A'$ consists of non-zero elements. The condition is that $A'$ must have a non-empty intersection with every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$. Our goal is to find the minimum size of $A'$, and the final answer will be $|A'| + 1$.\n    *   Non-trivial cyclic subgroups have order 7 or 49.\n    *   Consider a cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $ord(g)=49$. This subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n    *   If the set $A'$ intersects every subgroup of order 7, it will also intersect every subgroup of order 49. This is because if $A' \\cap H_7 \\neq \\emptyset$ for the subgroup $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$, then there is an element $a \\in A'$ with $a \\in H_7$. Since $H_7 \\subset H_{49}$, we have $a \\in H_{49}$, so $A' \\cap H_{49} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n    *   Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum size of $A'$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n6.  **Hitting subgroups of order 7.**\n    *   Let $H$ be a subgroup of order 7. We need to find a non-zero element $a \\in A'$ such that $a \\in H$.\n    *   The order of any element in a group must divide the order of the group. Since $H$ has order 7 (a prime), any non-zero element of $H$ must have order 7.\n    *   So, any element $a \\in A'$ that intersects a subgroup of order 7 must itself have order 7. This means $A'$ must be a set of elements of order 7.\n    *   Now, consider an element $a \\in A'$ of order 7. It generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ of order 7. Can this element $a$ belong to any other subgroup of order 7? If $a \\in H'$ where $H'$ is another subgroup of order 7, then since $a \\neq 0$, $a$ must generate $H'$, so $H' = \\langle a \\rangle$.\n    *   This means each element of $A'$ can belong to (and thus \"hit\") exactly one subgroup of order 7.\n    *   Therefore, to hit all cyclic subgroups of order 7, the size of $A'$ must be at least the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7. The minimum is achieved when we select exactly one generator from each subgroup of order 7.\n\n7.  **Counting the subgroups of order 7.**\n    *   We need to count the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n    *   An element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ has order dividing 7 if and only if $7g = 0$. This is equivalent to $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\n    *   In $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the solutions to $7x=0$ are the multiples of 7: $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$. There are 7 such elements, forming a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The set of all elements $g \\in G$ with $7g=0$ forms a subgroup $V \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This can be viewed as a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    *   The cyclic subgroups of order 7 correspond to the 1-dimensional subspaces of this vector space $V$.\n    *   The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q-1}$.\n    *   In our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$. So, the number of subgroups of order 7 is:\n        $$ N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\n    *   This is the minimum required size for the set $A'$.\n\n8.  **Final calculation.**\n    *   The minimum size of $A'$ is $N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n    *   The set $A$ is $A' \\cup \\{0\\}$. Since $0 \\notin A'$, the total size is:\n        $$ |A| = |A'| + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} + 1 $$\n    *   This can be simplified:\n        $$ |A| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1 + 6}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6} $$\n\nThis is an integer because $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, and $7^{2024}+5 \\equiv 1+5=6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\n\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6} + 1$."
