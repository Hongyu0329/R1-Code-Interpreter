    "This question is a riddle that requires identifying a historical figure based on an interpretation of their work. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.\n\n1.  **\"HIS work\"**: The subject is a man.\n\n2.  **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This points towards an academic or intellectual context. Veronika Campan is an art historian, and the study of art is fundamentally about *representation*. This suggests the \"prohibition against representation\" is a key theme.\n\n3.  **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: This can mean two things: either late in his career, in one of his final books or projects, or thematically at the conclusion of a particular piece of work (like the final chapter or final rule).\n\n4.  **\"HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This is a very clear reference to the Tenth Commandment of the Decalogue: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house ... nor anything that is thy neighbor's.\" This commandment deals with the *desire* for another's property.\n\n5.  **\"by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the most critical clue. The most famous \"prohibition against representation\" in Western culture is the Second Commandment: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\" This commandment is central to the aniconic tradition in Judaism. The person in question is described as \"ignoring\" this prohibition as part of his method or analysis.\n\n**Synthesizing the Clues:**\n\nWe are looking for a male thinker whose work connects the Second Commandment (on images) with the Tenth Commandment (on coveting), likely in a work from the end of his life. This person's own method must involve a form of \"representation\" that could be seen as \"naturally ignoring\" the religious prohibition.\n\nLet's consider the prime candidate:\n\n*   **Sigmund Freud**: He was a male thinker of Jewish heritage, making the \"prohibition against representation\" a culturally significant concept for him.\n*   One of his last major works, written at the end of his life, was **\"Moses and Monotheism\"** (1939).\n*   In this book, he directly analyzes Moses and the Ten Commandments. He puts forth the radical theory that Moses was an Egyptian.\n*   He specifically discusses the **\"prohibition against representation\"** (the Second Commandment), interpreting it as a pivotal moment in civilization's developmentâ€”a move from sensual perception to abstract thought.\n*   He also addresses the **\"issue of another's material possessions\"** by analyzing the psychological roots of the Tenth Commandment's ban on coveting (desire), a core topic of his life's work in psychoanalysis.\n*   Crucially, Freud **\"naturally ignores\"** the prohibition himself. His entire method of psychoanalysis involves creating intellectual \"representations\" or models of unseen psychic structures and forbidden desires. In \"Moses and Monotheism,\" he commits the ultimate act of intellectual representation by psychoanalyzing the sacred figure of the lawgiver, Moses, thereby breaking the taboo surrounding him and his laws. This is a natural part of his analytical method.\n\nThe reference to an art historian (Veronika Campan) serves to frame the riddle within the intellectual discourse of representation, making the identification of Freud and his work on Moses particularly fitting.\n\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
