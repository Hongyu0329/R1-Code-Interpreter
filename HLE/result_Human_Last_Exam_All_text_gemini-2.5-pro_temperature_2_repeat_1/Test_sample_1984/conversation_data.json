    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\n\nThis equation has two solutions, which are the equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we use the first derivative test. An equilibrium point is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 4: Deeper stability analysis for $x=1$**\nWhen the first derivative test is inconclusive, we can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point $x=1$. This is known as a phase line analysis.\nThe term $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for any $x \\neq 1$.\nThe term $-x$ is negative for any $x > 0$. In the neighborhood of $x=1$, we can assume $x>0$.\nTherefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-x$, which is negative.\nSo, $f(x) < 0$ for all $x$ in a neighborhood of 1 (except at $x=1$ where it is 0).\n\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$. This means the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving *away* from 1.\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$. This means the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving *towards* 1.\n\nAn equilibrium point is considered stable (in the sense of Lyapunov stability) only if solutions starting on *both* sides of the point stay near or approach it. Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a semi-stable point, which is a type of unstable point.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of m**\nThe variable $m$ is defined as the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\n$m = 1$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThe final answer is this expression.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n1.  **Finding all equilibria:** It's important to factor the polynomial $f(x)$ completely to find all roots.\n2.  **Correctly applying stability tests:** Use the derivative test $f'(x^*)$ as the first step.\n3.  **Handling inconclusive tests:** When $f'(x^*) = 0$, the linear stability test fails. A phase-line analysis (checking the sign of $f(x)$ around $x^*$) is a reliable alternative.\n4.  **Understanding \"stable\":** The standard definition of a stable equilibrium requires solutions on both sides to remain close to the equilibrium point. Semi-stable points do not meet this criterion and are thus considered unstable.\n5.  **Interpreting `m`:** The phrasing \"m is a number of stable equilibrium\" implies $m$ is the count of such points.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that there is only one stable equilibrium point, $m=1$.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
