    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Key Figure 1: Fernand Braudel.** A prominent French historian associated with the Annales School, known for his focus on long-term historical structures (*longue durée*) and a world-systems or global perspective.\n    *   **Key Figure 2: Paul Morand.** The author of the assertion Braudel is quoting. He was a French writer and diplomat.\n    *   **The Assertion:** A \"conceptual entity\" must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **The Metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere.\" A sphere is a three-dimensional representation of a globe. To \"inscribe\" something within it means to place it inside, to understand it as a part of that larger whole. This metaphor points directly to a global or worldwide context.\n    *   **The Clue/Example:** The conceptual entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This is a critical clue. The entity itself is not \"a nation,\" but a nation is a prime example or symbol of it. We need to think about what a nation represents in a historical context.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   Braudel's work consistently argued against narrow, event-focused, and nationalistic historiography. He advocated for a history that looked at broad geographical areas (like the Mediterranean) and global economic systems (like capitalism) over very long periods.\n    *   Therefore, when Braudel quotes someone approvingly about placing something in a \"sphere\" (the globe), he is reinforcing his own argument for a global perspective.\n    *   What about a nation needs to be placed in a global context, according to a historian like Braudel? Not the nation as a static object, but its story, its development, its interactions—in other words, its **history**.\n    *   Nationalism often promotes the idea of a nation's history as a unique, self-contained, and often superior narrative. Braudel and others who advocate for a global perspective argue that this is false. Any nation's history is inextricably linked with and can only be truly understood as part of a larger, global history.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing and Confirming:**\n    *   The \"conceptual entity\" is the narrative of a unit's development over time.\n    *   The \"nation\" is the most common unit for this type of narrative in the 19th and 20th centuries (i.e., \"national history\").\n    *   The assertion is that this narrative (national history) is no longer adequate. It must be seen as just one part of a much larger story: world history (the \"sphere\").\n    *   Therefore, the conceptual entity being discussed is **History** itself. Paul Morand argued that the time for writing *national histories* was over and that any particular history must now be written as *world history*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The entity is not simply \"a nation.\"** The question states a nation is an *example* or *symbol* of the entity. The focus is on the larger concept that a nation embodies in this context.\n*   **The core idea is a shift in historical methodology.** The move is from a narrow, national framework to a broad, global one.\n*   **The \"sphere\" is key.** It explicitly means the globe or the world, leaving little room for ambiguity about the required context.\n\nBy combining Braudel's known historical philosophy with the specific metaphors in the quote, the entity in question is identified as History, specifically the practice of writing history, which Morand and Braudel argue must transition from a national to a global scale.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe assertion from Paul Morand, which Fernand Braudel cites, is that the era of isolated national histories is past. The specific quote, from Morand's preface to *Champions du Monde* (1930), clarifies the entity: \"Our own [history], magnificent as it is, should now be inscribed inside a sphere, as geometers say, that is to say within the history of the world.” Therefore, the conceptual entity that a nation symbolizes and that must be inscribed within the sphere of the world is **History**.\n\n<<<History>>>"
