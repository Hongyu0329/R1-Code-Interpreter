    "**1. Understanding the space X**\n\nThe question asks for the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. Let's break down the components of this space.\n\n*   **Lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$**: A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be written as $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ for two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. The term \"nondegenerate\" means the lattice is of rank 2, spanning $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n*   **Area of a lattice**: The area (or covolume) of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by the basis vectors $v_1, v_2$. This is given by $|\\det(M)|$, where $M$ is the matrix whose columns are $v_1$ and $v_2$. We are given that this area is 1.\n\n*   **Moduli space**: This is the crucial term that requires interpretation. A \"moduli space\" is a space of equivalence classes of objects. For lattices, the natural notion of equivalence is isometry. Two lattices $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    An isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a map of the form $f(x) = Kx + v$, where $K \\in O(2)$ is an orthogonal transformation (a rotation or a reflection) and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a translation vector. Since lattices are subgroups, they contain the origin, so any isometry between lattices must fix the origin (or can be composed with a translation to do so). Thus, we only consider isometries from the orthogonal group $O(2)$.\n    So, two lattices $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are equivalent if there exists a $K \\in O(2)$ such that $\\Lambda_2 = K\\Lambda_1$.\n\n**2. Representing Lattices as Quadratic Forms**\n\nA powerful way to represent a lattice, which naturally handles the isometry equivalence, is through positive definite binary quadratic forms.\n\n*   To any lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, we can associate a function that gives the squared length of its vectors. If we pick a basis $(v_1, v_2)$ for $\\Lambda$, a general vector in $\\Lambda$ is $v = n_1v_1 + n_2v_2$ for integers $n_1, n_2$. Its squared Euclidean norm is:\n    $q(n_1, n_2) = \\|n_1v_1 + n_2v_2\\|^2 = \\|v_1\\|^2 n_1^2 + 2(v_1 \\cdot v_2) n_1n_2 + \\|v_2\\|^2 n_2^2$.\n\n*   This defines a binary quadratic form $q(x,y) = Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$, where $A = \\|v_1\\|^2$, $B = 2(v_1 \\cdot v_2)$, and $C = \\|v_2\\|^2$. Since the basis vectors are linearly independent, this form is positive definite (i.e., $q(x,y)>0$ for $(x,y)\\neq(0,0)$), which implies $A>0$ and $4AC-B^2 > 0$.\n\n*   The discriminant of this form is $D = B^2 - 4AC$. Let's relate this to the area of the lattice.\n    Area$(\\Lambda)^2 = |\\det(v_1, v_2)|^2 = (\\|v_1\\|\\|v_2\\|)^2\\sin^2\\theta = (\\|v_1\\|\\|v_2\\|)^2(1-\\cos^2\\theta)$\n    $= \\|v_1\\|^2\\|v_2\\|^2 - (\\|v_1\\|\\|v_2\\|\\cos\\theta)^2 = \\|v_1\\|^2\\|v_2\\|^2 - (v_1 \\cdot v_2)^2$\n    $= AC - (B/2)^2 = (4AC - B^2)/4$.\n    So, Discriminant $D = -4 \\cdot \\text{Area}(\\Lambda)^2$.\n\n*   The condition that the lattice has unit area implies Area$(\\Lambda) = 1$, so the discriminant of the associated quadratic form is $D = -4$.\n\n**3. The Space of Quadratic Forms**\n\nNow, let's connect this representation to the moduli space $X$.\n\n*   If two lattices $\\Lambda_1$ and $\\Lambda_2$ are isometric, $\\Lambda_2 = K\\Lambda_1$ for some $K \\in O(2)$, they produce the same quadratic form. This is because $K$ is an isometry, so it preserves lengths and inner products: $\\|K v\\|^2 = \\|v\\|^2$ and $(K v_1) \\cdot (K v_2) = v_1 \\cdot v_2$. So the coefficients $(A,B,C)$ are unchanged.\n\n*   Conversely, any positive definite binary quadratic form with discriminant -4 corresponds to a lattice of unit area. This correspondence is one-to-one between isometry classes of lattices and these quadratic forms. Different choices of basis for the same lattice lead to equivalent quadratic forms under the action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, but the quadratic form as a function on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (or equivalently, as the set of values it takes) is an invariant of the lattice as a point set. So, the moduli space $X$ can be identified with the space of coefficients $(A,B,C)$ of these forms.\n\n*   The space $X$ is therefore the set of all triples $(A, B, C) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying:\n    1.  $A > 0$\n    2.  $4AC - B^2 = 4$ (This implies $C>0$)\n\n**4. Analyzing the Topology of X**\n\nWe need to compute the first homology group of this space $X$. The topology of $X$ is that of a surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the equations above.\n\n*   Let's analyze the equation $4AC - B^2 = 4$. This can be rewritten as $AC - B^2/4 = 1$. This is the equation of a hyperboloid.\n*   The condition $A>0$ selects one part of this surface. Since $4AC = 4+B^2 \\ge 4$, if $A>0$, then $C>0$ must also hold.\n*   This surface is a single, connected sheet. It's one sheet of a hyperboloid of two sheets (if the equation were, e.g., $A C - B^2 = -1$) or a hyperboloid of one sheet (e.g., $A^2+C^2-B^2=1$). Here it is $4AC-B^2=4$.\n*   Let's establish a homeomorphism to a simpler space. We can define a map $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ by $f(A,B,C) = (A,B)$. This is not quite right.\n*   Let's define a map $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to X$. Let $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Let $A = e^v$, $B=u$. Then $C = (4+u^2)/(4e^v)$. This map is a homeomorphism from $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to $X$. For instance, for any $(A,B,C) \\in X$, we can find unique $(u,v)$ by $u=B$ and $v=\\ln A$.\n*   So, the space $X$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**5. Computing the Homology Group**\n\n*   The space $X$ is homeomorphic to the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a contractible space.\n*   For any contractible space $M$, the homology groups are trivial for dimensions greater than 0. That is, $H_n(M, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n*   Therefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\mathbb{R}^2, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\nFinal Check: Different interpretations of \"moduli space\" exist. For example, the space of oriented lattices is $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ which has $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. The space of conformal structures of tori is $\\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ which has $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}_6$. However, the most direct and geometrically sound interpretation of \"moduli space of lattices\" is \"isometry classes of lattices\", which leads to the space of quadratic forms. This identification is standard in the theory of lattices and quadratic forms. The area constraint directly translates to a constraint on the discriminant. The resulting space is contractible.\n\nFinal Answer: The moduli space $X$ of non-degenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, interpreted as the space of isometry classes of such lattices, is homeomorphic to the space of positive definite binary quadratic forms with discriminant -4. This space is defined by $\\{(A,B,C) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid A>0, 4AC-B^2=4\\}$, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. As $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is contractible, its first homology group is trivial.\n\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$."
