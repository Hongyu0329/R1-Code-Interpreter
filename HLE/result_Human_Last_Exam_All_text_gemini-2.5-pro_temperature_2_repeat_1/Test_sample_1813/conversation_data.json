    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe problem asks for the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\). This requires us to first understand what the generalized Markov number \\( m_r \\) is for a rational \\( r \\), and then determine what \"associated continued fraction\" refers to.\n\n**Step 1: Express the rational number r = 4/7 as a simple continued fraction.**\nTo do this, we use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{7/4} \\)\n\\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4/3} \\)\n\\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\nCombining these, we get:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\)\nThe coefficients are \\( a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1, a_3 = 3 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Define the matrix of convergents K_r.**\nFor a rational number \\( r = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\), we can associate a matrix \\( K_r \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\) which is the product of matrices corresponding to the coefficients:\n\\( K_r = \\begin{pmatrix} a_0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\dots \\begin{pmatrix} a_n & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\nThis matrix has the form \\( K_r = \\begin{pmatrix} p_n & p_{n-1} \\\\ q_n & q_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\), where \\( p_k/q_k \\) are the convergents of the continued fraction.\nLet's compute the convergents for \\( r=4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\):\n\\( \\frac{p_0}{q_0} = \\frac{0}{1} \\)\n\\( \\frac{p_1}{q_1} = [0;1] = \\frac{1}{1} \\)\n\\( \\frac{p_2}{q_2} = [0;1,1] = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\\( \\frac{p_3}{q_3} = [0;1,1,3] = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+1/3}} = \\frac{1}{1+3/4} = \\frac{4}{7} \\)\nThe last convergent is \\( p_3/q_3 = 4/7 \\) and the penultimate convergent is \\( p_2/q_2 = 1/2 \\).\nSo, \\( p_n = 4, q_n = 7 \\) and \\( p_{n-1} = 1, q_{n-1} = 2 \\).\nThe matrix \\( K_{4/7} \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\n**Step 3: Define and compute the generalized Markov number m_r.**\nOne common definition for the generalized Markov number \\( m_r \\) is the trace of the matrix \\( K_r \\).\n\\( m_r = \\text{tr}(K_r) = p_n + q_{n-1} \\).\nFor \\( r = 4/7 \\), we have \\( m_{4/7} = 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\nSo the generalized Markov number is 6.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the associated quadratic irrational.**\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" \\( m_{4/7} \\). The number \\( m_r \\) arises naturally as the trace of \\( K_r \\). The dynamics of the corresponding Mobius transformation are governed by the eigenvalues of \\( K_r \\). The quadratic irrationality whose continued fraction expansion is of interest in this context is the larger eigenvalue of \\( K_r \\), especially when \\( K_r \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\) or is related to it.\n\nThe eigenvalues \\( \\lambda \\) of \\( K_r \\) are the roots of the characteristic equation \\( \\det(K_r - \\lambda I) = 0 \\), which is:\n\\( \\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(K_r) \\lambda + \\det(K_r) = 0 \\)\nWe have \\( \\text{tr}(K_r) = m_{4/7} = 6 \\).\nLet's compute the determinant of \\( K_r \\):\n\\( \\det(K_r) = p_n q_{n-1} - p_{n-1} q_n = (4)(2) - (1)(7) = 8 - 7 = 1 \\).\nSo the matrix \\( K_{4/7} \\) is in \\( SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\\( \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 1 = 0 \\)\nThis equation is sometimes referred to as the generalized Markov equation associated with \\( r \\). The quadratic irrational we are looking for is its largest root.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the quadratic irrational.**\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots are:\n\\( \\lambda = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} \\)\n\\( \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2} \\)\nThe larger root, which we will call \\( \\alpha \\), is \\( \\alpha = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Step 6: Compute the continued fraction of the quadratic irrational \\( \\alpha \\).**\nWe apply the continued fraction algorithm to \\( \\alpha = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n1.  Let \\( \\alpha_0 = 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828 \\), so \\( \\alpha_0 \\approx 5.828 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( b_0 = \\lfloor \\alpha_0 \\rfloor = 5 \\).\n    The remainder is \\( \\alpha_0 - b_0 = (3 + 2\\sqrt{2}) - 5 = 2\\sqrt{2} - 2 \\).\n\n2.  Let \\( \\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2} - 2} = \\frac{1}{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2(2-1)} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n    \\( \\alpha_1 \\approx \\frac{1+1.414}{2} = 1.207 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( b_1 = \\lfloor \\alpha_1 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\n    The remainder is \\( \\alpha_1 - b_1 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2} \\).\n\n3.  Let \\( \\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}-1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{2-1} = 2+2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n    \\( \\alpha_2 \\approx 2+2.828 = 4.828 \\).\n    The integer part is \\( b_2 = \\lfloor \\alpha_2 \\rfloor = 4 \\).\n    The remainder is \\( \\alpha_2 - b_2 = (2+2\\sqrt{2}) - 4 = 2\\sqrt{2} - 2 \\).\n\n4.  Let \\( \\alpha_3 = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2} - 2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\alpha_1 \\).\n    Since \\( \\alpha_3 = \\alpha_1 \\), the sequence of coefficients will repeat from \\( b_1 \\). The repeating part is \\( (b_1, b_2) = (1, 4) \\).\n\nSo, the continued fraction of \\( 3 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\) is \\( [5; \\overline{1, 4}] \\).\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The continued fraction of \\( r=4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n2.  The matrix of convergents is \\( K_{4/7} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n3.  The generalized Markov number is \\( m_{4/7} = \\text{tr}(K_{4/7}) = 6 \\).\n4.  The associated quadratic irrational is the larger root of \\( \\lambda^2 - m_{4/7} \\lambda + \\det(K_{4/7}) = 0 \\), i.e., \\( \\lambda^2 - 6\\lambda + 1 = 0 \\).\n5.  This root is \\( 3+2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n6.  The continued fraction of \\( 3+2\\sqrt{2} \\) is \\( [5; \\overline{1, 4}] \\)."
