    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum number of side stickers (non-top-facing stickers) on the last layer that must be seen to uniquely identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases. At the PLL stage of the CFOP method, the top face is already oriented (e.g., all yellow), so we only need to analyze the permutation of the pieces, which is determined by the colors on the side faces of the last layer.\n\n*   **Last Layer Pieces:** 4 corners and 4 edges.\n*   **Non-Top-Facing Stickers:** Each corner has 2 side stickers, and each edge has 1 side sticker. Total stickers on the four side faces of the last layer: `(4 corners * 2) + (4 edges * 1) = 12` stickers.\n*   **The Goal:** We are looking for the smallest number `N` such that by observing `N` specific side stickers, we can distinguish the current PLL case from all other 20 possibilities. This is a \"worst-case\" question, meaning we need enough information to resolve the most similar-looking cases.\n\n### Step 2: Recognition Strategy and Information\nPLL recognition is typically done by identifying patterns like \"headlights\" (two corner stickers on a side having the same color) or \"blocks\" (an adjacent corner and edge sticker having the same color). A common strategy is to examine the three stickers on one face (one edge and two corners) and, if that's ambiguous, look at another face for more information.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased as: What is the maximum number of stickers that can be identical between two different PLL cases? The answer to the user's question will be that number plus one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Similar PLL Cases\nThe most efficient way to find the minimum number of stickers is to identify the two PLL cases that are most difficult to distinguish from each other and determine how many stickers are needed to tell them apart. Let's analyze a few pairs of similar-looking PLLs. We will define a face's sticker pattern by the three stickers we see on it: `(left-corner sticker, edge sticker, right-corner sticker)`. We'll use a standard color scheme: Front=Green, Back=Blue, Right=Red, Left=Orange.\n\n#### Case Study 1: F-perm vs. H-perm\nLet's analyze the sticker pattern these two permutations create on the Front (Green) face.\n\n*   **H-Permutation:** Swaps opposite corners (`UFL`↔`UBR`, `UFR`↔`UBL`) and opposite edges (`UF`↔`UB`, `UL`↔`UR`).\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UFL` slot (`UBR` piece): **Red**\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UF` slot (`UB` piece): **Blue**\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UFR` slot (`UBL` piece): **Orange**\n    *   Front face pattern for H-perm: **(Red, Blue, Orange)**\n\n*   **F-Permutation:** Swaps adjacent corners (`UFL`↔`UFR`) and opposite edges (`UF`↔`UB`).\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UFL` slot (`UFR` piece): **Red**\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UF` slot (`UB` piece): **Blue**\n    *   Sticker on Front from piece in `UFR` slot (`UFL` piece): **Orange**\n    *   Front face pattern for F-perm: **(Red, Blue, Orange)**\n\n**Conclusion:** Both F-perm and H-perm produce the exact same pattern of three stickers on the front face. Therefore, seeing only 3 stickers is insufficient to guarantee identification of the PLL case. We must look at more stickers.\n\n**Distinguishing F-perm from H-perm:** We need to look at least one more sticker. Let's examine a sticker on the Back (Blue) face, for instance, the sticker from the back-left corner (in the `UBL` slot).\n*   For **F-perm**, the `UBL` piece is not affected. So, the sticker on the back face is **Blue**.\n*   For **H-perm**, the piece in the `UBL` slot is the `UFR` piece. The sticker on its Green side would now be on the back face, so the sticker we see is **Green**.\n\nSince the fourth sticker we check is different (Blue vs. Green), we can now distinguish between the two cases. This implies that in this worst-case scenario, we need to see **4 stickers**.\n*   `3 stickers` on the Front face + `1 sticker` on the Back face = **4 stickers**.\n\n#### Case Study 2: E-perm vs. Z-perm\nA similar analysis can be done for other cases.\n*   **E-Permutation:** Swaps diagonal corners (`UFL`↔`UBR`, `UFR`↔`UBL`).\n*   **Z-Permutation:** Swaps adjacent corners (`UFL`↔`UFR`) and adjacent edges (`UL`↔`UR`).\n\nBoth of these permutations produce the front face sticker pattern **(Red, Green, Orange)**. So again, 3 stickers are not enough. To distinguish them, we can again look at the back-left corner sticker:\n*   For **E-perm**, this sticker is **Green**.\n*   For **Z-perm**, this sticker is **Blue**.\nThis confirms that another pair of cases requires seeing a fourth sticker to be distinguished.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe have demonstrated with two distinct pairs of PLLs (F vs. H and E vs. Z) that looking at all three stickers on a single face is insufficient, as different permutations can produce identical 3-sticker patterns. In both ambiguous scenarios, looking at one additional, specific sticker on another face is sufficient to resolve the ambiguity.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify any PLL case is **4**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
