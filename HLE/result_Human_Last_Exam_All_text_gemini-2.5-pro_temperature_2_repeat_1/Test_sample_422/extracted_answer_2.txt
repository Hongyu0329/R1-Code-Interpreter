The two problems the JTB definition runs into, given the constraints, are:

1.  **The Problem of Circularity in Justification:** The "justification" condition requires that a belief be supported by reasons. These reasons must themselves be grounded in other propositions. Given the available states are only Knowledge and Belief, a dilemma arises. If the justifying propositions are only *believed*, the justification is weak and could be based on falsehoods. If the justifying propositions must be *known*, then the definition of knowledge becomes circular: to know something, you must already know something else, defining knowledge in terms of itself.

2.  **The Problem of the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** From the perspective of the epistemic agent (the person claiming to know), two of the three JTB conditions are accessible: they can be aware of their own *belief* and their *justification* for it. However, the agent has no independent or direct way to verify that their belief is *true*. To do so would require stepping outside their own framework of beliefs. Therefore, from the agent's point of view, a justified false belief feels identical to a justified true belief (Knowledge), making the JTB definition an impractical tool for an individual to confirm their own state of knowledge.
