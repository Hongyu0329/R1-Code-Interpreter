    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** We must use the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of Knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (the Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes P (the Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (the Justification condition).\n*   **Constraint 1: Limited Epistemic States:** We are forced to assume that the only two mental states related to knowledge are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. There are no other states like \"having justification\" or \"having a true belief\" as independent categories. An agent either believes something or knows something.\n*   **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** We must not use the classic counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief by accident or luck. The problems we identify must be inherent to the JTB structure itself, independent of Gettier-style scenarios.\n*   **Objective:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB theory faces under these specific constraints.\n\n**2. Careful Point 1: The Structure of Justification**\n\n*   The JTB theory requires that a belief be \"justified.\"\n*   A key question arises: What is the nature of this justification? A justification is typically built upon other propositions or evidence. Let's say our belief in P is justified by another proposition, Q.\n*   Now we must ask about our epistemic state regarding Q. According to the constraint, our state regarding Q can only be one of two things: a **Belief** or **Knowledge**.\n*   **Scenario A: Justification is based on Belief.** If our justification for P rests on merely *believing* Q, this is a very weak foundation. Q could be false, and if it is, our justification for P would be based on a falsehood. This undermines the goal of justification, which is to connect our belief to the truth in a non-accidental way.\n*   **Scenario B: Justification is based on Knowledge.** If we say that for P to be justified, we must *know* the justifying proposition Q, then we run into a severe logical problem. The definition of Knowledge for P now requires having Knowledge of Q. This makes the definition circular. We are defining knowledge in terms of knowledge (`K(P) → J(P) → K(Q)`). This is a logical fallacy and makes the definition uninformative. This is often referred to as the **Problem of the Criterion** or a circularity/regress problem.\n\n**3. Careful Point 2: The Perspective of the Knower**\n\n*   Consider the JTB conditions from the perspective of the person (the epistemic agent) who is trying to acquire knowledge.\n*   The agent can access two of the three conditions internally:\n    1.  **Belief:** The agent can introspect and confirm, \"Yes, I believe this.\"\n    2.  **Justification:** The agent can review their reasons and evidence and confirm, \"Yes, I have justification for this belief.\"\n*   However, the third condition—**Truth**—is problematic. How can the agent confirm that their belief is actually true? The agent cannot step outside of their own mind to compare their belief with objective reality. Any attempt to verify the truth of proposition P would involve gathering more evidence and forming more beliefs (e.g., belief R, belief S), which themselves would require justification and a new, unproven connection to truth.\n*   From the agent's point of view, a justified true belief (Knowledge) and a justified false belief are indistinguishable. Both feel exactly the same—a belief held for what appears to be good reasons.\n*   Therefore, the JTB definition provides criteria that only an outside observer with a \"God's-eye view\" could apply. It doesn't give the knower a workable method for determining whether they are in a state of Belief or a state of Knowledge. The **Truth** condition is inaccessible to the subject.\n\n### Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, we can formulate the two problems:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Circularity in Justification:** The justification condition leads to a dilemma. Justification must be based on other propositions. If those propositions are merely *believed*, the justification is too weak. If they must be *known*, the definition of knowledge becomes circular, as it uses knowledge to define knowledge.\n2.  **The Problem of the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** From the subject's first-person perspective, it is impossible to definitively confirm that the \"truth\" condition has been met. An agent can be aware of their belief and their justification, but they have no independent way to access the objective truth of the proposition. This makes the JTB model practically unusable for the agent trying to distinguish their own knowledge from mere belief.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems the JTB definition runs into, given the constraints, are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Circularity in Justification:** The \"justification\" condition requires that a belief be supported by reasons. These reasons must themselves be grounded in other propositions. Given the available states are only Knowledge and Belief, a dilemma arises. If the justifying propositions are only *believed*, the justification is weak and could be based on falsehoods. If the justifying propositions must be *known*, then the definition of knowledge becomes circular: to know something, you must already know something else, defining knowledge in terms of itself.\n\n2.  **The Problem of the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:** From the perspective of the epistemic agent (the person claiming to know), two of the three JTB conditions are accessible: they can be aware of their own *belief* and their *justification* for it. However, the agent has no independent or direct way to verify that their belief is *true*. To do so would require stepping outside their own framework of beliefs. Therefore, from the agent's point of view, a justified false belief feels identical to a justified true belief (Knowledge), making the JTB definition an impractical tool for an individual to confirm their own state of knowledge."
