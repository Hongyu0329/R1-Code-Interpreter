    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, according to Terraria's source code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health**\nFirst, we need the standard, non-scaled health of the boss.\n*   In Normal Mode with a single player, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of **2,800 HP**.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Expert Mode Modifier**\nExpert Mode increases the health of bosses. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its single-player health in Expert Mode is a specific value, not a simple universal multiplier applied to all bosses.\n*   In Expert Mode with a single player, the Eye of Cthulhu's health is **3,640 HP**. This will serve as our new base value for multiplayer calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\nIn Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the world. The formula, as derived from the game's mechanics, is as follows:\n*   `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nLet's break down this multiplier:\n*   `BaseExpertHealth`: The boss's health in single-player Expert Mode (3,640 HP).\n*   `NumberOfPlayers`: The count of active players in the world. Let's call this `P`.\n*   `(P - 1)`: The formula provides a 35% health bonus for each player *after the first one*.\n*   `0.35`: This represents the 35% health increase per additional player.\n\nSo, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu for `P` players is:\n`Health(P) = 3,640 * (1 + 0.35 * (P - 1))`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players (Mathematical Limit)**\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This is a limit problem where we see what happens as `P` approaches infinity (`P → ∞`).\n\nLet's simplify the formula:\n`Health(P) = 3,640 * (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)`\n`Health(P) = 3,640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)`\n\nThis is a linear function of `P`. As the number of players `P` increases towards infinity, the term `0.35P` also increases towards infinity. Therefore, the total health also approaches infinity.\n*   `lim (P → ∞) [3,640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)] = ∞`\n\nMathematically, the health scales infinitely.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Constraints of the Source Code**\nThis is the most crucial point. The question specifically says \"According to the source code of the video game Terraria\". This means we must consider the technical limitations of the game's engine and programming.\n\n*   In the C# code that Terraria is written in, the health of an NPC (like the Eye of Cthulhu) is stored in a variable of the type `int`.\n*   An `int` is a 32-bit signed integer. This data type has a minimum and a maximum possible value.\n*   The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer (`int.MaxValue`) is **2,147,483,647**.\n\nWhile the scaling *formula* would produce an infinite value for infinite players, the game cannot actually store an infinite value. The health calculation would eventually produce a number that exceeds the maximum storable integer value. This would either result in a numerical overflow (potentially leading to a negative health value and bizarre behavior) or be capped at the maximum value. Therefore, the highest \"legal\" health value the boss can possess within the game's code is `int.MaxValue`. The condition of \"infinite players\" is simply the mechanism that guarantees this limit is reached and surpassed.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  The base health for scaling is the single-player Expert Mode health: **3,640 HP**.\n2.  The health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n3.  The health formula `Health(P) = 3,640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)` tends towards infinity as `P` tends towards infinity.\n4.  The source code uses a 32-bit signed integer to store health, which has a maximum value of **2,147,483,647**.\n5.  With a sufficient number of players (approximately 1.69 million), the health formula would yield a result exceeding this limit. Therefore, the practical and theoretical maximum health the boss can have *within the game engine* is this hard cap.\n\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is the maximum value of the variable used to store it in the game's code.\n\n<<<2,147,483,647>>>"
