    "This question contains a fundamental contradiction in its premises. Let's analyze the properties required.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze \"Optical Activity\"**\n*   **Definition:** Optical activity (or optical rotation) is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light that passes through it.\n*   **Symmetry Requirement:** For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must be **chiral**. This is a necessary and sufficient condition. A chiral object is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal's point group must lack any symmetry operations of the second kind, which are:\n    *   An inversion center (i)\n    *   A mirror plane (m)\n    *   Any rotoinversion axis (-n)\n*   **Crystal Classes with Optical Activity:** There are exactly 11 crystal classes that are chiral and therefore have the correct symmetry for optical activity. They are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n**2. Analyze \"Achiral\"**\n*   **Definition:** An object is achiral if it *can* be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   **Symmetry Requirement:** For a crystal class to be achiral, its point group must contain at least one of the symmetry elements of the second kind listed above (inversion, mirror, or rotoinversion).\n*   **Contradiction:** The condition of being \"achiral\" is the direct opposite of the condition of being \"chiral\".\n\n**3. Analyze \"Non-polar\"**\n*   **Definition:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction which is not equated to its opposite by symmetry. All centrosymmetric crystal classes are non-polar. Some non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar.\n*   **Example Polar Classes:** 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   **Example Non-polar Classes:** -1, 2/m, 222, mmm, 422, -4, 32, etc.\n\n**4. Synthesize and Conclude**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that have three properties:\n1.  Achiral\n2.  Non-polar\n3.  Have the correct symmetry for optical activity\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n*   The condition \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" means the crystal class must be **chiral**.\n*   The first condition given is that the crystal class must be **achiral**.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral simultaneously. These two requirements are mutually exclusive. The set of chiral crystal classes and the set of achiral crystal classes have no members in common.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for any crystal class to satisfy all the conditions laid out in the question.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The core of the question lies in understanding that \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" is synonymous with \"chiral\".\n*   The question's phrasing creates a logical paradox. One must identify this paradox rather than trying to find a crystal class that fits.\n*   The condition of being \"non-polar\" is extra information that is not needed to arrive at the conclusion, as the contradiction between \"chiral\" and \"achiral\" is absolute.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral and possess the symmetry required for optical activity (which is chirality). Since no class can be both achiral and chiral, no such crystal classes exist.\n\n<<<None>>>"
