    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question to identify the key clues.**\nThe question provides two distinct pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, to identify a specific novel.\n*   **Clue 1 (The Quote):** The novel is described as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue 2 (The Author's Description):** The novel's author is described as \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1: The Quote.**\nThe quote, \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" gives us insight into the nature of the work.\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a work of raw, primal power. It is likely passionate, violent, visceral, and emotionally charged.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This suggests a work of great structural and intellectual complexity. A chess game is governed by strict rules but allows for near-infinite variation and strategic depth. This implies the novel is meticulously constructed, with intricate plotting, a non-obvious structure, and layers of meaning that reveal themselves upon careful reading.\n*   **Combined Meaning:** The novel is a masterpiece that balances raw, emotional force with sophisticated, calculated artistry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2: The Author's Description.**\nThe description of the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a very specific literary judgment.\n*   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This points to an author deeply influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner's key techniques include stream of consciousness, multiple and unreliable narrators, fractured and non-linear timelines, and the creation of a mythic, self-contained fictional world (like his Yoknapatawpha County). The author in question likely employs similar narrative strategies.\n*   **\"(and simplifier) of Faulkner\":** This is a critical distinction. It means that while the author builds on Faulkner's legacy, they do not simply copy his dense, often labyrinthine prose. Instead, they distill these complex techniques into a more focused, concise, or perhaps more accessible form. The complexity remains, but it is presented with greater economy. This clue strongly points toward major figures of the 20th-century Latin American literary boom, many of whom revered Faulkner.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Author and Novel.**\nWe are looking for a Latin American author praised by Borges, influenced by Faulkner but with a more condensed style, who wrote a single, powerful novel that is both intense and structurally complex.\n*   Several authors fit the \"influenced by Faulkner\" description, including Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Juan Carlos Onetti.\n*   However, Borges's specific praise and the description of being a \"simplifier\" perfectly align with his documented opinion of the Mexican writer **Juan Rulfo**.\n*   Juan Rulfo wrote only one short novel, **_Pedro Páramo_**, and a collection of short stories. _Pedro Páramo_ is famous for its fractured timeline, its chorus of dead voices, and its spare, poetic prose that creates a dense, mythic, and haunting atmosphere. It achieves a Faulkner-like complexity but in just over 100 pages.\n*   Borges famously wrote a short text, often used as a prologue or blurb for editions of _Pedro Páramo_, in which he offered this exact praise. He saw Rulfo's work as one of the best in literature and highlighted its unique combination of brutal intensity and sophisticated, almost dreamlike construction.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe author described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Rulfo. The novel praised by Jorge Luis Borges for its tiger-like intensity and chess-like variety is Rulfo's masterpiece, _Pedro Páramo_.\n\n***\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
