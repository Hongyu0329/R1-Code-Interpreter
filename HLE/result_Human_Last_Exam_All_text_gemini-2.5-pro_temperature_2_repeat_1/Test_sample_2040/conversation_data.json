    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Material:** Free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene).\n    *   **Process:** Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\n    *   **Condition:** When excited by incident light.\n    *   **Core Inquiry:** Does this specific material exhibit this specific optical phenomenon under this condition?\n\n2.  **Analyze Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):**\n    *   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical process where a single high-energy photon (from a \"pump\" beam) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\").\n    *   **Fundamental Requirement:** For SPDC to occur, the material it passes through must have a significant **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾`. This property describes how strongly the material's polarization responds to the square of an applied electric field (from the incident light).\n\n3.  **Connect Material Properties to the `χ⁽²⁾` Requirement:**\n    *   **Symmetry Rule:** A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that a material can only possess a non-zero bulk `χ⁽²⁾` if its crystal structure **lacks an inversion center**. Materials that have a point of inversion symmetry are called \"centrosymmetric\". In such materials, the `χ⁽²⁾` is zero due to symmetry considerations, and thus they cannot support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\n4.  **Examine the Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):**\n    *   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, boron nanosheets are polymorphic, meaning they can exist in several different stable atomic structures.\n    *   **Common Structures:** The most widely studied and experimentally synthesized phases of borophene (often grown on a silver substrate) include the β₁₂, χ₃, and \"striped\" phases.\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** We must check if these common structures have an inversion center.\n        *   The β₁₂ and χ₃ phases are flat triangular lattices with different patterns of atomic vacancies. Their ideal crystal structures are **centrosymmetric**.\n        *   The \"striped\" phase is corrugated (puckered) but its underlying lattice structure is also **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   **Conclusion on Borophene Structure:** The common, stable, and low-energy phases of pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Form a Conclusion:**\n    *   SPDC requires a material with a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`.\n    *   A non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n    *   Common phases of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   Therefore, their `χ⁽²⁾` is zero.\n    *   As a result, boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real-World Material:** The analysis above pertains to ideal, pristine, free-standing nanosheets. In reality, factors can break the perfect symmetry.\n    *   **Edges:** The edges of a finite-sized nanosheet inherently break the bulk symmetry. However, this effect is localized to the edge and the resulting SPDC signal would be extremely weak compared to the bulk material response.\n    *   **Defects and Strain:** Atomic defects or non-uniform strain applied to the nanosheet can locally break the inversion symmetry, potentially inducing a weak, localized `χ⁽²⁾` response.\n    *   **External Fields:** Applying a strong, static DC electric field perpendicular to the nanosheet can also break the inversion symmetry, leading to a process known as electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISHG). This could theoretically enable a form of electric-field-induced SPDC.\n    *   **Substrate Effects:** The question specifies \"free-standing,\" but if the nanosheet were on a substrate, interactions could break the symmetry. This point is excluded by the problem's premise.\n\n2.  **Higher-Order Processes:** While the second-order process (SPDC) is forbidden by symmetry, third-order processes are not. Boron nanosheets, like all materials, possess a non-zero third-order susceptibility (`χ⁽³⁾`). This allows for other photon-pair generation processes, such as **spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM)**, where *two* pump photons are converted into a signal-idler pair. This is a distinct process from SPDC.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the primary analysis, the core property required for SPDC (`χ⁽²⁾`) is absent in the intrinsic material in question (boron nanosheets) due to its crystal symmetry. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion symmetry). The common and stable phases of boron nanosheets are all centrosymmetric. By symmetry, this makes their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`) equal to zero, thus forbidding the SPDC process.>>>"
