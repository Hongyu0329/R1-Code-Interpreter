No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion symmetry). The common and stable phases of boron nanosheets are all centrosymmetric. By symmetry, this makes their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`) equal to zero, thus forbidding the SPDC process.
