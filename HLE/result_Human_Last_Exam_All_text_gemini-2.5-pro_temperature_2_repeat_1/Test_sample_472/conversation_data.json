    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**1. Preliminary Analysis**\n*   **Meter Identification:** The line is an iambic senarius, a meter common in Roman comedy (like the works of Plautus, where this line is from). This meter consists of six iambic feet (S L). However, Plautine verse allows for significant substitutions and resolutions.\n*   **Syllable Count:** Written as is, the line has 15 syllables: `et(1) ti-bi(2) be-ne(2) es-se(2) so-li(2) quom(1) si-bi(2) sit(1) ma-le(2)`. An iambic senarius typically has 12 syllables, but with resolutions (where one long syllable is replaced by two short ones), it can have more. The 15 syllables suggest at least one elision or contraction.\n\n**2. Identifying Elision**\n*   The word `bene` ends with a vowel (`-e`), and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel (`e-`). This is a classic case for elision. The final `-e` of `bene` is dropped, and the words are pronounced as one: `benesse`.\n*   This elision reduces the syllable count by one. The two words `bene` (2 syllables) and `esse` (2 syllables) are scanned as the single unit `benesse`, which has three syllables (`be-nes-se`).\n*   The total syllable count for the line is now 14, which is plausible for a resolved iambic senarius.\n\n**3. Syllable-by-Syllable Quantity Analysis (Long/Short)**\nWe now determine whether each of the 14 syllables is long (L) or short (S). A syllable is long if its vowel is naturally long OR if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position).\n\n1.  **et**: The vowel `e` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`t` at the end of `et` and `t` at the start of `tibi`). Therefore, it is long by position. -> **L**\n2.  **ti-**: The `i` in `tibi` is naturally short. -> **S**\n3.  **-bi**: The final `i` in `tibi` is naturally short. -> **S**\n4.  **be-** (from `benesse`): The `e` is naturally short. -> **S**\n5.  **-nes-** (from `benesse`): The `e` is followed by two consonants (`s` and `s`). Long by position. -> **L**\n6.  **-se** (from `benesse`): The final `e` is short. -> **S**\n7.  **so-** (from `soli`): The `o` in `solus` is naturally long. -> **L**\n8.  **-li** (from `soli`): The `i` is short. -> **S**\n9.  **quom**: The vowel `o` is short, but the syllable is followed by two consonants (`m` and the `s` from `sibi`). Long by position. -> **L**\n10. **si-** (from `sibi`): The `i` is short. -> **S**\n11. **-bi** (from `sibi`): The `i` is short. -> **S**\n12. **sit**: The `i` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`t` and the `m` from `male`). Long by position. -> **L**\n13. **ma-** (from `male`): The `a` is short. -> **S**\n14. **-le** (from `male`): The final `e` is short. However, the last syllable of a line is considered long by convention (*brevis in longo*). -> **L**\n\n**4. Grouping Syllables into Metrical Feet**\nWe now group the sequence of 14 syllables (`L S S S L S L S L S S L S L`) into six metrical feet. The extra syllables are accommodated by \"resolved\" feet (dactyls or anapests).\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` -> `L S S`. This is a dactyl, a valid substitution for an iamb in the first foot.\n*   **Foot 2:** `be nes` (from `benesse`) -> `S L`. This is a standard iamb.\n*   **Foot 3:** `se so` (from `benesse` and `soli`) -> `S L`. A standard iamb.\n*   **Foot 4:** `li quom` (from `soli` and `quom`) -> `S L`. A standard iamb.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> `S S L`. This is an anapest, a valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> `S L`. This is a standard iamb, with the last syllable counting as long.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe resulting scansion is a dactyl, followed by three iambs, an anapest, and a final iamb.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
