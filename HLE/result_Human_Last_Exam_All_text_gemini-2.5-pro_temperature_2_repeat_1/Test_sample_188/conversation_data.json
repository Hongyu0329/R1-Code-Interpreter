  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information\nFirst, we need to break down the user's request into its fundamental components and filter out any irrelevant information.\n\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum length of the secret message. The \"length\" refers to the number of characters in the decrypted message.\n*   **Encrypted Data (Ciphertext):** The Ching book contains 9999 symbols. These symbols are the medium used to encode the message.\n*   **Decrypted Data (Plaintext):** The message is written using a specific set of Chinese characters. The problem states this set contains 120 distinct characters. This is our alphabet.\n*   **Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   The Shu contains \"around 3000\" characters. This is the length of the book from which the alphabet was derived, not the size of the alphabet itself (which is 120).\n    *   The time taken for computer vision to recognize a character (12 ms).\n    *   The computation times for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n    These time-related values concern the *processing* of the data, not the *information content* or the *length* of the message that can be encoded. They are distractors.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Properties of the Encoding Symbols\nThe problem asks for the maximum message length, which implies the most efficient encoding scheme possible. To figure this out, we must understand the symbols used for encoding.\n\n*   The symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". This term suggests a combination of two concepts from Chinese philosophy:\n    1.  **Yin-Yang (陰陽):** This represents a duality with 2 states (yin, yang).\n    2.  **Wuxing (五行):** This represents the Five Phases or Elements with 5 states (typically wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).\n*   A single \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol would naturally be a combination of one state from each system. Therefore, the number of distinct, unique symbol types is the product of the number of states in each system.\n*   Number of unique symbol types = (Number of yinyang states) × (Number of wuxing states) = 2 × 5 = 10.\n    So, the Ching is written using a set of 10 distinct symbols.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Symbols Needed per Character\nNow we must determine the minimum number of Ching symbols required to uniquely represent one character from the 120-character alphabet.\n\n*   Let `n` be the number of Ching symbols used to represent one message character.\n*   With `n` symbols, and 10 possible types for each symbol, the total number of unique sequences (or \"codes\") we can create is `10^n`.\n*   To represent all 120 characters, the number of available unique codes must be greater than or equal to the size of the alphabet. This gives us the inequality:\n    `10^n ≥ 120`\n*   We need to find the smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition. Let's test values of `n`:\n    *   If `n = 1`: `10^1 = 10`. This is not enough to represent 120 characters.\n    *   If `n = 2`: `10^2 = 100`. This is still not enough.\n    *   If `n = 3`: `10^3 = 1000`. This is more than enough to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n*   Therefore, the most efficient fixed-length encoding requires a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching to represent one character of the message.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Message Length\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of characters the Ching can encode.\n\n*   Total symbols available in the Ching = 9999.\n*   Symbols required per message character = 3.\n*   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols required per character)\n*   Maximum message length = 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\nSince 9999 is perfectly divisible by 3, we can form exactly 3333 character codes with no leftover symbols.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Identify the Alphabet Size:** The core number for the message characters is 120, not 3000.\n*   **Interpret the Symbol Types:** The term \"yinyang-wuxing\" is not just a name; it describes a combinatorial structure of 2×5=10 unique symbols.\n*   **Formulate the Information Requirement:** The problem translates to finding the smallest integer `n` such that `10^n ≥ 120`.\n*   **Ignore Distractors:** The computation and recognition times are irrelevant to the information capacity of the text.\n*   **Perform the Final Calculation:** Use the total number of available symbols (9999) and the calculated symbols-per-character (3) to find the maximum message length.\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
