    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions given in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle `S¹`, a closed disk `D²`, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (closed version) or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum.\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, its composant, `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain the point `p`. The set of all composants forms a partition of the space `X`.\n\n### Step 2: The Critical Link Between Composants and Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum `X` is determined by a fundamental property: whether `X` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** For any decomposable continuum, there is **only one composant**, which is the space `X` itself. If `X = A ∪ B`, for any point `p ∈ A ∩ B`, its composant `C(p)` contains both `A` and `B`, so it contains their union, which is `X`. It can then be shown that all points in `X` belong to this same single composant.\n\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** For any indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is **uncountably infinite**. Specifically, it is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). Each composant is a dense subset of the space. A classic example is the pseudo-arc or the Knaster buckethandle continuum.\n\nTo find the *largest possible number* of composants, we need to see if we can construct the product space `X × Y` to be indecomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Decomposability of a Product of Continua\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two continua. We are interested in the decomposability of their product, `X × Y`. (Note: The product of two continua is always a continuum, as compactness and connectedness are preserved under finite products).\n\nThere is a key theorem in continuum theory regarding this:\n\n**Theorem (R.H. Bing, 1951):** The product `X × Y` of two continua `X` and `Y` is decomposable if and only if at least one of the factor spaces, `X` or `Y`, is decomposable.\n\nThis theorem can be restated in its contrapositive form, which is more useful for our goal:\n\n**Theorem (Contrapositive form):** The product `X × Y` is **indecomposable** if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Case for the Maximum Number of Composants\n\nOur goal is to maximize the number of composants of `X × Y`.\n\n1.  From Step 2, we know the number of composants is maximized when the space is indecomposable. The maximum value is `c`.\n2.  From Step 3, we know that `X × Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are themselves indecomposable.\n3.  The question specifies that `X` and `Y` are *nondegenerate* continua. It is possible to find nondegenerate indecomposable continua. As mentioned, the **pseudo-arc** and the **Knaster continuum** are two such examples.\n\nTherefore, we can construct the scenario that yields the maximum number of composants:\n\n*   Let `X` be a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum (e.g., a pseudo-arc).\n*   Let `Y` be a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum (e.g., another pseudo-arc).\n\nIn this case:\n*   Since `X` and `Y` are both indecomposable, their product `Z = X × Y` is also an indecomposable continuum.\n*   Since `Z` is an indecomposable continuum, the number of its composants is `c`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have two possibilities for the number of composants of `X × Y`:\n\n*   **Case 1:** At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable. Then `X × Y` is decomposable, and the number of composants is **1**.\n*   **Case 2:** Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable. Then `X × Y` is indecomposable, and the number of composants is **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number*. Comparing the two cases, `c` is vastly larger than 1. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\nThis number, `c`, is an absolute maximum because a composant is a subset of the space `X × Y`. As a compact metric space, `X × Y` has a cardinality of at most `c`. The number of sets in a partition (which the set of composants is) cannot exceed the cardinality of the whole space. Since we have found a case that achieves `c`, it is indeed the maximum.\n\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
