    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the Second Great War:** The Second Great War is the name given to the galaxy-wide conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue (*Into the Void*).\n\n2.  **Identify the Starting Point:** The war officially begins with the renewed Zerg Swarm invasion of Dominion space, starting with the planet Mar Sara. This event kicks off the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Ending Point:** The war concludes with the final, permanent defeat of the dark god Amon by the unified forces of the Terran Dominion, the Zerg Swarm, and the Protoss Daelaam. This final battle takes place inside the Void and is depicted in the *Into the Void* epilogue campaign of *Legacy of the Void*. This event takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Duration:**\n    *   The war starts in the year 2504.\n    *   It continues throughout the entire year of 2505.\n    *   It finally ends in the year 2506.\n    *   To calculate the specific duration, we can look at a more detailed timeline. The invasion of Mar Sara (*Wings of Liberty*) begins in early 2504. The events of *Heart of the Swarm* follow shortly after, still within 2504. The main *Legacy of the Void* campaign spans from 2505 into 2506, and the *Into the Void* epilogue concludes the war in 2506.\n    *   Therefore, the war's duration covers a part of 2504, all of 2505, and a part of 2506.\n    *   The total time elapsed is more than the full year of 2505 plus the partial time in 2504 and 2506. Let's assume the war starts in March 2504 and ends, for example, in March 2506. This would be a duration of 2 full years. However, the narrative suggests the final campaign in the Void takes place a \"short while\" after the Reclamation of Aiur (which itself is in 2506), pushing the timeline slightly past the 2-year mark. For example, if it starts in March 2504 and ends in April 2506, the duration is 2 years and 1 month.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:**\n    *   The question explicitly asks for the duration \"in years, rounded up\".\n    *   \"Rounded up\" means we must take the ceiling of the calculated duration.\n    *   Since the duration is slightly more than 2 full years (e.g., ~2.1 years), we must round this value up to the next whole number.\n    *   The ceiling of any number greater than 2.0 and less than or equal to 3.0 is **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Start and End Points:** Precisely identifying the beginning of *Wings of Liberty* and the end of the *Into the Void* epilogue as the boundaries of the war is crucial.\n*   **Timeline Accuracy:** The war spans across three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506. This is the most important fact for the calculation.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" Interpretation:** This phrase is key. It is not standard rounding (where 2.1 would round down to 2). It specifically means to find the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the duration (the ceiling function). As the war's duration is determined to be greater than two full years, rounding up leads to three.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   War Start Year: 2504\n*   War End Year: 2506\n*   Total duration > 2 years\n*   Value rounded up = 3 years\n\n<<<3>>>"
