    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the game in a classical context using the provided payoff matrix. Let the two players be Alice and Bob. The strategies are Cooperate (C) and Defect (D).\n\nThe payoff matrix is:\n```\n           Bob\n          C      D\n      +-------+-------+\n    C | (5,5) | (0,7) |\nAlice +-------+-------+\n    D | (7,0) | (1,1) |\n      +-------+-------+\n```\nHere, the pair (Alice's payoff, Bob's payoff) is shown for each combination of choices.\n\n*   **Alice's perspective:**\n    *   If Bob Cooperates (C), Alice can either Cooperate for a payoff of 5 or Defect (D) for a payoff of 7. She should Defect (7 > 5).\n    *   If Bob Defects (D), Alice can either Cooperate for a payoff of 0 or Defect for a payoff of 1. She should Defect (1 > 0).\n    *   In both cases, Defecting is Alice's best strategy. This is her *dominant strategy*.\n\n*   **Bob's perspective (the game is symmetric):**\n    *   If Alice Cooperates (C), Bob can either Cooperate for 5 or Defect for 7. He should Defect (7 > 5).\n    *   If Alice Defects (D), Bob can either Cooperate for 0 or Defect for 1. He should Defect (1 > 0).\n    *   Defecting is also Bob's dominant strategy.\n\n*   **Classical Equilibrium:**\n    Since both rational players will choose their dominant strategy, the outcome will be (Defect, Defect). This is the unique **Nash Equilibrium** in the classical game. The corresponding payoff is **(1, 1)**. The dilemma is that this outcome is worse for both players than the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of (5, 5), which they cannot achieve rationally.\n\n**2. Formulating the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma**\n\nThe quantum version of the game introduces two new elements:\n1.  **Shared Entangled State:** The players' choices are not made in isolation. They start with a shared entangled quantum state. The problem states, \"You design the initial states for an optimal [outcome],\" which implies we should use a setup that allows for the best possible result. This typically means a maximally entangled state.\n2.  **Quantum Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer limited to C and D. They can apply any valid quantum operation (a unitary transformation) to their part of the entangled state.\n\nThe canonical setup for this problem is the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol:\n*   An initial state `|CC>` is prepared.\n*   A known entangling operator `J` is applied, creating the shared state `|ψ_initial> = J|CC>`. For an optimal outcome, `J` is chosen to create maximal entanglement.\n*   Alice and Bob apply their chosen strategies, which are unitary operators `U_A` and `U_B`, to their respective qubits. The state becomes `(U_A ⊗ U_B)|ψ_initial>`.\n*   A disentangling operator `J†` (the inverse of `J`) is applied. The final state is `|ψ_final> = J†(U_A ⊗ U_B)J|CC>`.\n*   The final state is measured in the classical basis (`{|CC>, |CD>, |DC>, |DD>}`). The probabilities of these outcomes determine the players' expected payoffs according to the original matrix.\n\n**3. Finding the Quantum Equilibrium**\n\nIn the quantum version of the game, with maximal entanglement, the classical strategy space is expanded. While the classical strategies `C` (represented by the identity operator `I`) and `D` (represented by a flip operator like Pauli-X `σ_x`) are still available, there exists a new, purely quantum strategy, let's call it `Q`.\n\n*   **The Dilemma Resolved:** A key result in quantum game theory is that when the initial state is maximally entangled, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges. This new equilibrium corresponds to the strategy pair `(Q, Q)`. The remarkable feature of this equilibrium is that when both players choose strategy `Q`, the outcome is the same as the classical (Cooperate, Cooperate) case.\n    *   **Payoff for (Q, Q):** If both Alice and Bob play the quantum strategy `Q`, the final state `|ψ_final>` becomes `|CC>`. This yields the optimal payoff of **(5, 5)**.\n\n*   **Stability of the Quantum Equilibrium:** For `(Q, Q)` to be a Nash Equilibrium, neither player should have an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.\n    *   Let's assume Alice considers deviating while Bob sticks with `Q`.\n    *   If Alice deviates to the classical strategy `D` (Defect), she attempts to exploit Bob for a payoff of 7. However, due to the entanglement and the structure of the quantum game, this deviation does not result in the classical (D, C) outcome. Instead, the \"punishment\" for unilateral defection is built into the game's quantum structure. The outcome of playing `(D, Q)` results in the payoff **(1, 1)**. Alice's payoff would drop from 5 to 1, so she has no incentive to defect.\n    *   By symmetry, if Bob were to unilaterally defect, his payoff would also drop from 5 to 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Equilibria:** In the maximally entangled quantum game, there are two Nash Equilibria:\n    1.  The classical equilibrium (D, D), with a payoff of (1, 1).\n    2.  The new quantum equilibrium (Q, Q), with a payoff of (5, 5).\n\n**4. Identifying the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" equilibrium point, and states that we design the setup for an \"optimal\" outcome and that players pick the \"best strategy\".\n*   The (Q, Q) equilibrium gives a payoff of (5, 5).\n*   The (D, D) equilibrium gives a payoff of (1, 1).\n*   The (5, 5) outcome is **Pareto-superior** to the (1, 1) outcome because both players are strictly better off.\n*   Given that rational players would choose the better equilibrium, and the game is set up to enable this optimal outcome, the relevant equilibrium point is the one corresponding to the payoff (5, 5). This resolves the original \"dilemma\".\n\nThe equilibrium point in game theory can refer to the strategies or the payoffs. Given the context of finding a solution to the dilemma, the payoff is the most meaningful answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe equilibrium point, representing the payoffs for the two players in the optimally designed quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, is (5, 5).\n\n<<(5, 5)>>>"
