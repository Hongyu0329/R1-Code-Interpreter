    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation.**\nThe equation to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nThe term on the right, $i^z$, is a complex exponentiation, which is multi-valued. We use the definition $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. The complex logarithm $\\ln a$ is defined as $\\ln a = \\text{Log}|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\ln i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\nSo, $i^z = e^{z \\ln i} = e^{z \\cdot i C_k}$ for any integer $k$.\n\nThe problem is to find all $z$ for which the equality $z \\cdot i = i^z$ holds for at least one choice of integer $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Express the equation in terms of the real and imaginary parts of z.**\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe Left-Hand Side (LHS) is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe Right-Hand Side (RHS) is:\n$i^z = e^{z \\cdot i C_k} = e^{(x+iy)iC_k} = e^{(ix-y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$:\n$i^z = e^{-yC_k} \\left(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)\\right)$.\n\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k) + i e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts gives a system of two equations:\n1. Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2. Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of equations by considering special cases.**\n\n**Case 1: $y=0$ (Real solutions, $z=x$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1. $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2. $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, we must have $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation: $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi)$ is either $1$ (for even $m$) or $-1$ (for odd $m$).\n*   If $x=1$: This requires $m$ to be even. Let $m=2j$.\n    The condition on $x$ becomes $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$.\n    $\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4j) \\implies k=j$.\n    This is consistent for any integer $k=j$. We can simply choose $k=0$ (which corresponds to $m=0$). Let's check $z=1$ in the original equation:\n    LHS = $1 \\cdot i = i$.\n    RHS = $i^1 = i$ (using the principal value, $k=0$).\n    Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$: This requires $m$ to be odd. Let $m=2j+1$.\n    The condition on $x$ becomes $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2j+1)\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$.\n    $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(3+4j) \\implies -(1+4k)=3+4j \\implies -4-4j=4k \\implies k=-1-j$.\n    This is also consistent for any integer $j$. We can choose $j=0$ (so $m=1$), which gives $k=-1$. Let's check $z=-1$:\n    LHS = $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$.\n    RHS = $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. As shown in the thinking process, $i^z$ is single-valued if $z$ is an integer.\n    Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case 2: $x=0$ (Purely imaginary solutions, $z=iy$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1. $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2. $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This gives no information.\n\nWe need to solve the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for roots $f(y)=0$.\n*   If $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$ (i.e., $k \\ge 0$): The derivative $f'(y) = -C_k e^{-yC_k} + 1$. The minimum of $f(y)$ occurs when $f'(y)=0$, which is at $e^{-yC_k} = 1/C_k$. The minimum value is $f_{min} = 1/C_k + y_{min} = 1/C_k - (\\ln C_k)/C_k = (1-\\ln C_k)/C_k$. For a solution to exist, $f_{min} \\le 0$. This means $1-\\ln C_k \\le 0 \\implies \\ln C_k \\ge 1 \\implies C_k \\ge e$. The smallest positive value is $C_0=\\pi/2 \\approx 1.57 < e$. Thus there is no solution for $k \\ge 0$. An alternative analysis: the equation $Y e^Y = -1/C_k$ needs $-1/C_k \\ge -1/e \\implies C_k \\le e$, which is not satisfied for $k=0,1,2...$ (as $C_k = \\pi/2, 5\\pi/2, ...$). So no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $C_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$): Let $D = -C_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yD}$. Let $g(y) = e^{yD}+y$. Then $g'(y) = De^{yD}+1 > 0$, so $g(y)$ is strictly increasing. Since $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} g(y)=-\\infty$ and $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} g(y)=\\infty$, there is exactly one real solution for $y$ for each $k \\le -1$. Let's call this solution $y_k$.\nIn the equation $-y_k = e^{-y_k C_k}$, the RHS is always positive. This implies $-y_k > 0$, so $y_k < 0$.\nThese solutions are on the negative imaginary axis.\n\nThese solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function. Let $Y = -y_k C_k$. The equation is $y_k = -e^{-y_k C_k}$, so $-Y/C_k = -e^Y \\implies Y = C_k e^Y \\implies Y e^{-Y} = C_k$.\nLet $X = -Y$. Then $(-X)e^X = C_k \\implies Xe^X = -C_k$. So $X = W(-C_k)$.\n$y_k = -Y/C_k = X/C_k = W(-C_k)/C_k$.\nSince $k \\le -1$, $C_k < 0$, so $-C_k > 0$. Thus $W(-C_k)$ uses the principal branch $W_0$ and is real and positive. Since $C_k<0$, $y_k$ will be negative, as expected.\nSo, for each integer $k \\le -1$, we have a solution:\n$z_k = i y_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\nIt is common to re-index with positive integers. Let $j = -k \\ge 1$.\nThen $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1-4j)$ and $-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)$.\nThe solutions are $z_j = i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1-4j)} = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)}$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**Case 3: $x\\ne0, y\\ne0$ (General complex solutions)**\nDividing the imaginary part equation by the real part equation gives $\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k)$. Squaring and adding the two equations gives $x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$. This is a complicated system of transcendental equations. Besides the solutions on the real and imaginary axes, there are no other \"simple\" solutions, and it's generally understood that for this type of problem, these are the only solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Final Summary of Solutions.**\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ consist of three sets:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions, located on the negative imaginary axis. These are given for each integer $j \\ge 1$ by $z_j = -ia_j$ where $a_j$ is the unique positive solution to $a = e^{a\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1-4j)}$.\n3.  These imaginary solutions can be written compactly using the principal branch of the Lambert W function, $W_0(x)$.\n\nThe full list of solutions is:\n*   $z=1$\n*   $z=-1$\n*   $z_j = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)}$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_j = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4j-1)}$ for all positive integers $j=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.>>>"
