After the operation Q on the first ququint of the entangled pair and a subsequent measurement on it, the system collapses into one of the following five states with the given probabilities:
1.  With probability **2/10 (or 1/5)**, the measurement outcome is $|0\rangle_A$, and the final state is $|\Psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |0\rangle_A \otimes (|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability **2/10 (or 1/5)**, the measurement outcome is $|1\rangle_A$, and the final state is $|\Psi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |1\rangle_A \otimes (|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability **3/10**, the measurement outcome is $|2\rangle_A$, and the final state is $|\Psi_2\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} |2\rangle_A \otimes (|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability **2/10 (or 1/5)**, the measurement outcome is $|3\rangle_A$, and the final state is $|\Psi_3\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |3\rangle_A \otimes (|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability **1/10**, the measurement outcome is $|4\rangle_A$, and the final state is $|\Psi_4\rangle = |4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
