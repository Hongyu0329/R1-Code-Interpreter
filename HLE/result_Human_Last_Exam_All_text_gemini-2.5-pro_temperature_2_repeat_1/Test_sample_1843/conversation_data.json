    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Structure of Primitive Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$. If $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nA crucial property is that $\\chi$ is **primitive** modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive modulo its respective prime power $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nIn our case, a primitive character $\\chi \\pmod{36036}$ must be of the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\cdot \\chi_9 \\cdot \\chi_7 \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^a$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Order of the Character to its Components**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. Let $k_{p^a} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$. The condition is:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}) = 6$\n\nThis implies two things for the orders $k_{p^a}$ of the component characters:\n1.  Each order $k_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., $k_{p^a} \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$).\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Relevant Primitive Characters for Each Factor**\n\nWe need to count the number of choices for each primitive component $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that its order $k_{p^a}$ divides 6. Note that a primitive character cannot be the trivial character, so its order must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **For modulus $4 = 2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The trivial character is imprimitive (conductor 1). The other character is primitive with conductor 4. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    -   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (This character has order $k_4=2$).\n\n*   **For modulus $9 = 3^2$**:\n    The character group modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The imprimitive characters are those induced from modulo 3, which form a subgroup isomorphic to $C_2$. So, primitive characters mod 9 have orders that are not in $\\{1, 2\\}$. The possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$. (The order $k_9$ will be either 3 or 6).\n\n*   **For modulus $7$**:\n    The character group modulo 7 is $C_6$. Primitive characters are all non-trivial characters. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **For modulus $11$**:\n    The character group modulo 11 is $C_{10}$. The possible primitive orders are 2, 5, 10. We only need orders that divide 6. Only order 2 satisfies this.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    -   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (This character has order $k_{11}=2$).\n\n*   **For modulus $13$**:\n    The character group modulo 13 is $C_{12}$. The primitive orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We need orders that divide 6. These are 2, 3, and 6.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    -   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results and finalize the count**\n\nThe total number of primitive characters is the product of the number of choices for each component character. Let's analyze the resulting order.\nLet $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$ be the orders of the chosen components.\n- The order of $\\chi_4$ must be $k_4=2$. This guarantees that $\\text{lcm}(\\dots)$ is a multiple of 2.\n- The order of $\\chi_9$ must be $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. This guarantees that $\\text{lcm}(\\dots)$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Furthermore, since every component's order divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nTherefore, any combination of our selected component characters will result in a character of *exactly* order 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$\n\nThus, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6."
