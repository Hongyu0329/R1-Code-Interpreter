    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Organism:** Adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite.\n    *   **Source Neuron:** ASJ, which is a bilateral pair of sensory neurons (ASJL and ASJR).\n    *   **Source Process:** Axons of the ASJ neurons.\n    *   **Target:** The postsynaptic cell (neuron or muscle) that receives synapses from ASJ axons.\n    *   **Metric:** The \"main\" target is defined by the highest number of synapses.\n\n2.  **Identify the Necessary Data:** To answer this question, we need to consult the *C. elegans* connectome, which is a detailed wiring diagram of its nervous system. This data is derived from serial section electron microscopy. The most current and complete connectome for the adult hermaphrodite is described in publications by Cook et al. (2019) and Witvliet et al. (2021).\n\n3.  **Locate ASJ in the Connectome:** We need to find the synaptic outputs from the ASJ neurons. ASJ senses specific environmental cues, including dauer pheromone, and relays this information to downstream interneurons. Its axons run in the nerve ring, which is the main neuropil of *C. elegans*, where most synapses are located.\n\n4.  **List Major Postsynaptic Partners of ASJ:** By querying connectome databases (like WormWiring) or reviewing the data from the primary literature, we can compile a list of cells that are postsynaptic to ASJ. The most prominent targets are other interneurons. These include:\n    *   **AIY:** A pair of interneurons (AIYL/AIYR) that play a key role in integrating sensory information to regulate locomotion and behavioral states like local search.\n    *   **AIA:** A pair of interneurons (AIAL/AIAR) that are involved in turning behavior.\n    *   **AIB:** A pair of interneurons (AIBL/AIBR) involved in navigation and chemotaxis strategies.\n    *   **RIA:** A pair of interneurons (RIAL/RIAR) that integrate sensory input and are associated with head movements.\n\n5.  **Quantify and Compare Synapse Numbers:** The crucial step is to compare the number of synapses from ASJ (summing the contributions from both ASJL and ASJR) to each of its major targets.\n    *   **ASJ → AIY:** The connection between ASJ and AIY is known to be one of the strongest in this circuit. Published connectome data (e.g., from Cook et al., 2019) shows that the total number of synapses from the ASJ pair to the AIY pair is consistently the highest. For instance, the number of synapses is typically reported in the range of 40-50.\n    *   **ASJ → AIA:** This connection is also significant, but the total synapse count is considerably lower than that to AIY, typically around 20-30 synapses.\n    *   **ASJ → AIB:** Similar to AIA, AIB receives a substantial number of synapses from ASJ, but this number is also less than the input to AIY.\n    *   **ASJ → RIA:** This is another important connection, with a synapse count comparable to that for AIA and AIB, but lower than that for AIY.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on a quantitative comparison using the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite connectome, the interneuron class **AIY** receives the highest number of synapses from the axons of the ASJ sensory neurons. Therefore, AIY is considered the main projection target of ASJ.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Data Source:** It is important to rely on recent and comprehensive connectome datasets, as earlier reconstructions were less complete. The conclusions drawn here are based on the datasets from the 2019-2021 period.\n*   **Neuron Class vs. Individual Cell:** The question asks for a \"cell\". AIY is a class consisting of two symmetric neurons, AIYL and AIYR. In *C. elegans* connectomics, symmetrically paired neurons often have similar connectivity and are functionally grouped. The total projection to the AIY class is the standard metric.\n*   **Life Stage:** The connectivity can change during development. The question specifies \"adult,\" so data from larval stages is not applicable.\n*   **Axon vs. Dendrite:** The question specifies ASJ \"axons\". In *C. elegans*, neuronal processes can have both pre- and postsynaptic specializations. However, the major outputs of ASJ are located on its axonal process in the nerve ring, which is consistent with the question.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
