The picnic table must change its shape. When the sun rises, it must bend or contract to mimic the molecule's change from the stable trans-isomer to the less stable cis-isomer upon exposure to UV light. When the sun sets, it must flatten or elongate, returning to the trans-isomer shape as it would in the dark.
