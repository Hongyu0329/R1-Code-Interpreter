    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific character from a particular piece of media. The key elements are:\n*   **Media:** \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoon series.\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event in the episode:** Junior prom.\n*   **The Performer:** A cardboard cutout of a fictional singer.\n*   **The Goal:** Name the fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode centers on the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior prom. A significant part of any prom is the musical entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the scene with the musical performer.**\nIn classic Teen Girl Squad style, the prom's budget is low, and the entertainment is not a live band. The narrator, Cheerleader, introduces the musical act.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the dialogue that names the singer.**\nCheerleader's narration explicitly states the performer's name. She says:\n*\"Live... from a cardboard cutout... it's indie-folk-tronica darling, Tomas P.'s tote bag!\"*\n\n**Step 5: Identify the careful points and potential pitfalls.**\n*   **The singer vs. the object:** The performer is technically a cardboard cutout of the singer's *tote bag*, not the singer himself. This is a crucial part of the joke. However, the question asks for the name of the *fictional singer*, not what the cutout depicts. The singer's name is clearly stated as \"Tomas P.\".\n*   **Fictional status:** The question specifies a \"fictional singer,\" which Tomas P. is within the context of the Homestar Runner universe. He is a parody of a certain type of indie musician.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Tomas P.\".\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the direct dialogue from the episode, the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout (of his tote bag) performs at the Junior prom is Tomas P.\n\n<<<Tomas P.>>>"
