    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces required to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Decompose the Number\n\nThe goal is to find the number of red and blue pieces in a standard Hackenbush game representation whose value is the dyadic rational number $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe most straightforward way to represent a dyadic rational number is to use its binary expansion. This breaks the number down into a sum of powers of 2.\n\nThe binary representation of 13 is $1101_2$, since $13 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$.\nTherefore, we can write $\\frac{13}{16}$ as:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1101_2}{10000_2} = 0.1101_2 $$\nThis binary fraction corresponds to the sum:\n$$ \\frac{13}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} $$\n\n### Step 2: Use the Additive Property of Hackenbush Games\n\nA fundamental property of impartial games like Hackenbush is that the value of a sum of disjoint games (games placed side-by-side, each connected to the ground but not to each other) is the sum of their individual values.\nThis means we can represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ by constructing the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$ and placing them side-by-side. The total number of pieces will be the sum of the pieces used in each of these component games.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Canonical Representation of $1/2^n$\n\nWe need to find the standard, or canonical, Hackenbush representation for a game with value $1/2^n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe value $1/2^n$ is defined recursively in surreal numbers as $\\{0 | 1/2^{n-1}\\}$. This structure can be created in Hackenbush.\n\nThe canonical game for the value **1** is a single red piece connected to the ground.\nThe canonical game for the value **1/2** (which is $\\{0 | 1\\}$) is a single blue piece stacked on top of a single red piece.\n*   **Analysis:** If the Red player (Left) cuts the red piece, the game ends (value 0). If the Blue player (Right) cuts the blue piece, a single red piece remains (value 1). So the game value is indeed $\\{0|1\\}=1/2$.\n\nThe canonical game for the value **1/4** (which is $\\{0 | 1/2\\}$) is constructed by placing a blue piece on top of the game for 1/2. This results in a stack of two blue pieces on top of a single red piece.\n*   **Analysis:** Left's move on this stack is to cut the bottom red piece, ending the game (value 0). Right can cut either of the two blue pieces. Cutting the top one leaves the game for 1/2. Cutting the bottom one leaves the game for 1. Since Right will make the move most favorable to them (resulting in the smallest value for Left), Right's best move results in the game for 1/2. Thus, the value is $\\{0 | 1/2\\} = 1/4$.\n\nBy extension, the canonical representation for a game with value **$1/2^n$** is a stack consisting of **one red piece** at the base and **$n$ blue pieces** stacked on top.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Pieces for Each Component Game\n\nUsing the rule from Step 3, we can count the pieces for each component of $\\frac{13}{16}$.\nThe number of pieces for a game of value $1/2^n$ is $1 \\text{ (red)} + n \\text{ (blue)} = n+1$ pieces.\n\n1.  **Game for 1/2:** Here, $n=1$. The game consists of 1 red and 1 blue piece.\n    *   Number of pieces = $1+1 = 2$.\n2.  **Game for 1/4:** Here, $n=2$. The game consists of 1 red and 2 blue pieces.\n    *   Number of pieces = $2+1 = 3$.\n3.  **Game for 1/16:** Here, $n=4$. The game consists of 1 red and 4 blue pieces.\n    *   Number of pieces = $4+1 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Sum the Piece Counts\n\nTo get the total number of pieces needed to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$, we sum the pieces from the three disjoint component games.\n\nTotal pieces = (Pieces for 1/2) + (Pieces for 1/4) + (Pieces for 1/16)\nTotal pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThe final structure would consist of three separate stacks connected to the ground:\n*   Stack 1: 1 blue on 1 red.\n*   Stack 2: 2 blue on 1 red.\n*   Stack 3: 4 blue on 1 red.\n\nThe total number of red pieces is $1+1+1=3$.\nThe total number of blue pieces is $1+2+4=7$.\nThe total number of pieces is $3+7=10$."
