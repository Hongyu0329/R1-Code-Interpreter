    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a \"unique architectural feature\" that was present in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" but was removed by the city in 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Research on Piazza della Rotonda:** The piazza is famous for the Pantheon and a central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) topped with an Egyptian obelisk. These key features still exist, so they are not the answer. The query requires us to find something that is *no longer there*.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Timeline (Pre-1950):** Historical photographs and accounts of the piazza from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are crucial. A review of these sources reveals a key difference from the modern layout. The piazza was not a flat, unified space. It had to accommodate modern traffic, which included one of Rome's tram lines.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Unique Architectural Feature\":** To manage the tram and vehicle traffic circulating the fountain, a special roadway was constructed. This feature was a **lowered ring road** that circled the central island where the fountain stands. In Italian, this was known as a *scivolo anulare* (annular slide/slope) or *anello stradale* (street ring).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Feature's Uniqueness:** This design created a distinct two-tiered effect in the square. There was a higher pedestrian area immediately around the fountain, and then a sunken, paved ring for the trams and cars. This separation of levels to manage traffic within a historic piazza was a notable and specific architectural/urban planning solution of its time.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Removal in 1950:** After World War II, city planners sought to restore the historical integrity of many sites and improve pedestrian access. The tram lines in the city center were gradually dismantled. In the case of Piazza della Rotonda, the tram service was stopped, the tracks were removed, and the sunken ring road was filled in and paved over. This project, which culminated around 1950, leveled the entire square to create the single, continuous surface that exists today. The removal was a deliberate action by the city administration to \"restore\" the piazza.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to simply say \"the tram tracks.\" While the tracks were part of it, the more significant and \"architectural\" feature was the entire lowered roadway structure built to accommodate them, which fundamentally altered the topography of the square.\n*   The timeline is key. The removal project aligns perfectly with the 1950 date specified in the question.\n*   The feature was indeed removed by the \"city administration\" as part of a post-war urban renewal and beautification project.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in 1950 was the lowered, ring-shaped roadway designed to carry traffic (including a tram line) around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A lowered, ring-shaped roadway (known in Italian as a \"scivolo anulare\" or \"anello stradale\") that circled the central fountain to accommodate vehicle and tram traffic.>>>"
