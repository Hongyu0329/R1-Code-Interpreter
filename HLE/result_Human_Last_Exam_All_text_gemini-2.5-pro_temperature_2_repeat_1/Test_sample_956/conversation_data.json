    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group G and its generators.\nThe group G is a subgroup of the group of permutations of the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$, which has 12 elements. So, $G \\le S_{12}$.\nThe generators are given as:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\n### Step 2: Determine key properties of the group G.\n\n1.  **Parity of the generators:** We check if the generators are even or odd permutations.\n    *   $a$ is an 11-cycle. An $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k-1$ is even, and odd if $k-1$ is odd. For $a$, $k=11$, so $k-1=10$ is even. Thus, $a$ is an even permutation.\n    *   $b$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is odd. The product of two odd permutations is an even permutation. So, $b$ is even.\n    *   $c$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). A transposition is odd. The product of an even number of odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is even.\n    Since all generators are even permutations, the group $G$ they generate is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$. That is, $G \\le A_{12}$.\n\n2.  **Transitivity of G:** We check if G acts transitively on the set S. An action is transitive if for any two elements $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, there is a group element $g \\in G$ such that $g(s_1) = s_2$. This is equivalent to showing that the orbit of any element is the entire set $S$.\n    *   The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle that permutes the subset $S' = \\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\}$. The only element fixed by $a$ is $z$. So the orbit of any element in $S'$ under $\\langle a \\rangle$ is $S'$ itself.\n    *   The generator $c$ maps $3$ to $z$ (i.e., $c(3) = z$). Since $3$ is in $S'$, and the orbit of $3$ under $G$ contains all of $S'$, the orbit of $z$ under $G$ must also contain all of $S'$.\n    *   Specifically, let $s$ be any element in $S'$. Since $\\langle a \\rangle$ is transitive on $S'$, there is a power $k$ such that $a^k(3) = s$. Then $(a^k c^{-1})(z) = a^k(3) = s$. So every element of $S'$ is in the orbit of $z$.\n    *   Since the orbit of $z$ contains $S'$ and $z$ itself, the orbit of $z$ is all of $S$. Therefore, the group $G$ is transitive on the 12 elements of $S$.\n\n3.  **2-Transitivity of G:** A standard theorem in permutation group theory states that if a transitive group on $n$ elements contains an $(n-1)$-cycle, then the group is 2-transitive.\n    *   In our case, $G$ is a transitive group on $n=12$ elements.\n    *   The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle, which is an $(n-1)$-cycle.\n    *   Therefore, G is a 2-transitive group on 12 elements.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the group G using classification theorems.\n\nThe 2-transitive permutation groups on 12 points have been classified. The possibilities are:\n1.  The alternating group, $A_{12}$.\n2.  The symmetric group, $S_{12}$.\n3.  The projective special linear group, $PSL(2, 11)$.\n4.  The Mathieu group $M_{11}$ (in its 2-transitive representation on 12 points).\n5.  The Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n\nWe can eliminate some of these possibilities:\n*   We already established that $G \\le A_{12}$, so G cannot be $S_{12}$.\n*   The generator $b$ has order 4, since it is the product of two disjoint 4-cycles. However, the group $PSL(2, 11)$ has no elements of order 4. So, $G \\ne PSL(2, 11)$.\n*   The generator $c$ has cycle type $2^6$. It is an involution (order 2) with no fixed points. In the 2-transitive action of $M_{11}$ on 12 points, every involution has fixed points. (Specifically, the permutation character for the class of involutions is non-zero). Thus, $G$ cannot be this representation of $M_{11}$.\n\nThis leaves two possibilities for G: $G=A_{12}$ or $G=M_{12}$.\nWhile it's possible to distinguish these two, for this problem, it is not necessary.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Schur Multiplier A.\nThe question asks for information about the Schur multiplier of G, denoted by A. The Schur multiplier of a group H is also known as its second homology group with integer coefficients, $H_2(H, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nWe need to know the Schur multipliers for our candidate groups, $A_{12}$ and $M_{12}$. These are standard, well-known results in group theory:\n*   The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 5$ and $n \\ne 6, 7$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $Z_2$. So, $M(A_{12}) = Z_2$.\n*   The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is also the cyclic group of order 2, $Z_2$. So, $M(M_{12}) = Z_2$.\n\nIn either case, the Schur multiplier $A$ of our group $G$ is isomorphic to $Z_2$.\n$A \\cong Z_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism.\nThe group $A$ is isomorphic to $Z_2 = \\{0, 1\\}$. We need to find its proper subgroups. A proper subgroup of A is any subgroup H such that $H \\ne A$.\n\nThe subgroups of $Z_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, which is isomorphic to the trivial group $Z_1$.\n2.  The group $Z_2$ itself.\n\nThe only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. The question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*. All trivial subgroups are isomorphic to each other.\nSo, there is only one isomorphism class of proper subgroups: the class of the trivial group.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of A, up to isomorphism, is 1."
