    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Compound and Reaction:** The goal is to synthesize Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common method for this is the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Conditions:** The synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the reactants. Different conditions favor the formation of different xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆).\n    *   **Activation Energy:** This reaction has a significant activation energy, meaning that a certain amount of energy (usually in the form of heat) must be supplied to initiate the reaction at a practical rate. Reactions at very low temperatures (like 0 °C or -78 °C) would be infinitesimally slow and therefore not \"efficient.\"\n    *   **Product Selectivity:**\n        *   To form **XeF₂**, a large excess of xenon is typically used at around 400 °C.\n        *   To form **XeF₄**, a stoichiometric excess of fluorine is used (e.g., a Xe:F₂ molar ratio of 1:5). The reaction is typically carried out by heating the mixture.\n        *   To form **XeF₆**, a large excess of fluorine (e.g., a Xe:F₂ molar ratio of 1:20) and higher temperatures (e.g., 500-600 °C) and pressures are required.\n\n3.  **Evaluate \"Efficient Production\" of XeF₄:** The word \"efficiently\" implies achieving a good yield of the desired product in a reasonable amount of time. We need to find the temperature that meets this criterion.\n    *   According to established chemical literature and standard inorganic chemistry textbooks, the optimal conditions for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄ involve heating a 1:5 mixture of xenon and fluorine in a sealed nickel container at approximately **400 °C** and 6 atmospheres of pressure.\n    *   At temperatures significantly *lower* than 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate would be too slow for the process to be considered efficient.\n    *   At temperatures significantly *higher* than 400 °C (e.g., 600 °C), the reaction begins to favor the formation of XeF₆, reducing the efficiency of XeF₄ production.\n\n4.  **Examine the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 600 C: This temperature favors the formation of XeF₆, not XeF₄.\n    *   B. 400 C: This is the widely cited and established temperature for the efficient, high-yield synthesis of XeF₄.\n    *   C. 200 C: The reaction rate would be very low, making the synthesis inefficient.\n    *   D. 78 C: Far too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    *   E. 0 C: Far too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    *   F. -78 C: Far too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard, well-documented synthetic methods, 400 °C is the conventional and lowest temperature at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently. While some reaction might technically occur at lower temperatures, it would not meet the practical definition of an \"efficient\" process. Therefore, 400 °C is the correct answer among the given choices.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The question specifies \"efficiently.\" This rules out conditions where the reaction is extremely slow or yields are very low.\n*   The question allows \"any method of synthesis.\" However, the direct thermal reaction is the most common and benchmark method for producing XeF₄. Other methods, like photochemical synthesis, are generally used for XeF₂ or are less efficient for XeF₄.\n*   The product distribution (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆) is a key concept. The temperature of 400°C represents a balance—it's high enough for a good reaction rate but not so high as to promote over-fluorination to XeF₆.\n\n<<<B>>>"
