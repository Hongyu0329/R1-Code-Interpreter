    "This question is a linguistic puzzle that requires careful step-by-step analysis and attention to specific constraints, some of which may be interpreted in different ways.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Constraints:**\nThe question asks for three specific things:\n*   **Two Languages:** They must be distinct.\n*   **From Two Asian Cultures with No Direct Contact:** This is a crucial and ambiguous constraint. \"No direct contact\" can be interpreted strictly (no historical trade, political, or migration links) or loosely (not neighbors, culturally distinct today). The languages should also ideally be from different language families (unrelated).\n*   **Three Similar Words:** The words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\" must be \"nearly identical or highly similar\".\n\n**2. Analyze \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" Words (The Easy Part):**\nWords for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often \"nursery words\"—simple sounds like *ma, pa, ba, da* that are among the first sounds infants can produce. This results in similar-sounding words for parents in many unrelated languages across the globe. This is a case of convergent evolution, not borrowing.\n\n*   **Excellent Example:** A striking similarity exists between **Korean** and **Tamil** (a Dravidian language of Southern India and Sri Lanka).\n    *   Mom: Korean is **Eomma** (엄마); Tamil is **Amma** (அம்மா).\n    *   Dad: Korean is **Appa** (아빠); Tamil is **Appa** (அப்பா).\n*   This pair (Korean/Tamil) is a perfect fit for the \"no direct contact\" and \"different cultures\" rules, as they are from unrelated language families and their speakers had virtually no historical interaction.\n\n**3. The \"Broom\" Challenge (The Hard Part):**\nThe real difficulty lies in the word \"broom.\" Unlike parental terms, this is a specific cultural object with no reason to have a similar name across unrelated languages by chance. We must now test our candidate pair (Korean/Tamil) against this third word.\n\n*   **Korean** for \"broom\" is **빗자루 (bitjaru)**.\n*   **Tamil** for \"broom\" is **துடைப்பம் (thudaippam)** or **விளக்குமாறு (vilakkumaru)**.\n\nThese words are not similar at all. Therefore, the Korean/Tamil pair, despite the amazing match for \"mom\" and \"dad,\" fails this part of the test. Many other \"no contact\" pairs (e.g., Tagalog/Turkish) show similar results: they may match for parental terms but fail on \"broom.\"\n\n**4. Re-evaluating the \"No Direct Contact\" Rule:**\nSince finding a pair that meets all criteria strictly is extremely difficult, it's possible the question assumes a looser definition of \"no direct contact.\" This invites us to examine language pairs that might be historically related or have had contact but belong to what are considered separate modern cultures. This leads us to the Indo-Iranian language family.\n\n**5. Analyzing Persian (Farsi) and Hindi:**\n*   **Cultures and Contact:** Persian is the language of Iran (West Asia), while Hindi is a primary language of India (South Asia). While their modern cultures are distinct, their languages are related (both are Indo-European), and the cultures have a deep, shared history, including centuries of contact during the Mughal Empire where Persian was a courtly and administrative language in India. **Therefore, this pair violates a strict interpretation of the \"no contact\" and \"unrelated\" rule.**\n*   **Word Comparison:** Let's check the three words.\n    *   **Mom:** The formal words are Persian **Mâdar** and Hindi **Mātā**. They are nearly identical and both come from the same Proto-Indo-European root.\n    *   **Dad:** The common, informal words are Persian **Bâbâ** and Hindi **Bāp**. These are extremely similar. (The formal words **Pedar** and **Pitā** are also cognates).\n    *   **Broom:** The Persian word is **Jâru** (جارو) and the Hindi word is **Jhāṛū** (झाड़ू). These are also highly similar, likely stemming from a shared ancestral root.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe language pair **Persian and Hindi** provides a perfect match for all three words. The similarity, however, is not a coincidence but a result of shared linguistic ancestry and significant historical interaction. No known language pair satisfies the \"no contact / unrelated\" rule while also matching all three words. Therefore, Persian and Hindi is the most plausible intended answer to this puzzle, assuming a non-technical understanding of \"no direct contact.\"\n\n***\n\nThe two languages are **Persian (Farsi)** and **Hindi**.\n\n*   **Mom:** Persian: *Mâdar* / Hindi: *Mātā* (formal)\n*   **Dad:** Persian: *Bâbâ* / Hindi: *Bāp* (informal)\n*   **Broom:** Persian: *Jâru* / Hindi: *Jhāṛū*\n\n<<<Persian and Hindi>>>"
