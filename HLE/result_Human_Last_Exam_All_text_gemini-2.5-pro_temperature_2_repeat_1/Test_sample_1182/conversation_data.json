    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Curve and its Initial Reduction**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We are interested in its stable reduction over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is 5, so the genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nLet $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nTo find the reduction of the curve modulo 2, we reduce the coefficients of the equation modulo 2:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis can be rewritten as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe special fiber of this model is a \"double line\" $y=x$ in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A double line is not a reduced curve, so this model is not stable. The reduction is singular at every point, which means this is a \"bad\" model.\n\n**2. Finding a Better Model**\n\nWe need to find a new model of the curve through a change of variables that has a better reduction property. The equation can be written as:\n$y^2 = x^2 + 4(2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5)$.\nThis form, $y^2 = h(x)^2 + 4g(x)$ with $h(x)=x$ and $p=2$, suggests the transformation $y_1 = (y - h(x))/2 = (y-x)/2$. This is a standard step in finding a minimal model for a hyperelliptic curve. For this to be a morphism over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, $y-x$ must be divisible by 2 for all integral points. From the equation, $y^2-x^2=4g(x)$, so $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 4$. This implies $y \\equiv x \\pmod 2$ for integral solutions. So $y-x=2k$. Thus, $y_1=k$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting $y=2y_1+x$ into the original equation:\n$(2y_1+x)^2 = x^2 + 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$4y_1^2 + 4xy_1 + x^2 = x^2 + 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$4y_1^2 + 4xy_1 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nDividing the entire equation by 4 (which is valid as the coefficients are integers):\n$y_1^2 + xy_1 = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5$\n\nThis is our new model, let's call it $C_1$. This model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Reduction of the New Model**\n\nThe reduction of $C_1$ modulo 2 is:\n$\\tilde{C_1}: y_1^2 + xy_1 \\equiv x^3 + x^4 \\pmod{2}$\n$\\tilde{C_1}: y_1(y_1+x) = x^3(x+1)$\nThis is a reduced curve, which is an improvement. However, it may still be singular. A singular point is a point where both partial derivatives vanish. Let $F(x,y_1) = y_1^2+xy_1-x^3-x^4$.\n$\\partial F/\\partial y_1 = 2y_1 + x \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$\n$\\partial F/\\partial x = y_1 - 3x^2 - 4x^3 \\equiv y_1 - x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nFor a singular point, we need $x=0$ and $y_1-x^2=0$, which implies $x=0$ and $y_1=0$.\nSo, the affine curve $\\tilde{C_1}$ has a unique singular point at $(0,0)$.\n\n**4. Further Change of Variables to Resolve the Singularity**\n\nThe model $C_1$ has a special fiber $\\tilde{C_1}$ that is singular at the origin $(0,0)$. We can try to find an even better model by \"zooming in\" on this singularity. This corresponds to another change of variables.\nConsider the equation for $C_1$: $y_1^2 + xy_1 = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5$.\nLet's test the substitution $x=2X, y_1=2Y$. This is motivated by the fact that if $v_2(x)>0$, then $v_2(RHS) \\ge 2$, which forces $v_2(y_1)\\ge 1$.\n$(2Y)^2 + (2X)(2Y) = 2(2X) + (2X)^3 + (2X)^4 + 2(2X)^5$\n$4Y^2 + 4XY = 4X + 8X^3 + 16X^4 + 64X^5$\nDividing by 4, we get a new model $C_2$:\n$Y^2 + XY = X + 2X^3 + 4X^4 + 16X^5$\n\nLet's look at the reduction of $C_2$ modulo 2:\n$\\tilde{C_2}: Y^2 + XY = X \\pmod{2}$\nLet's check if $\\tilde{C_2}$ is singular. Let $G(X,Y) = Y^2+XY-X$.\n$\\partial G/\\partial Y = 2Y + X \\equiv X \\pmod{2}$\n$\\partial G/\\partial X = Y - 1 \\pmod{2}$\nA singular point requires $X=0$ and $Y-1=0 \\implies Y=1$.\nLet's check if $(X,Y)=(0,1)$ is on the curve $\\tilde{C_2}$: $1^2 + 0 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\implies 1 = 0$. This is a contradiction.\nSo, the curve $\\tilde{C_2}$ is smooth (non-singular).\n\n**5. Potentially Good Reduction and the Structure of Stable Reduction**\n\nThe existence of a model ($C_2$) that is isomorphic to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ and which has a smooth special fiber $\\tilde{C_2}$ means that the curve $C$ has **potentially good reduction** at $p=2$.\n\nHowever, the genus of the smooth reduction $\\tilde{C_2}: Y^2+XY=X$ is 0 (it is a conic), while the genus of the original curve $C$ is 2. The genus drops, so the reduction is not good, but potentially good.\n\nFor a curve of genus $g=2$ with potentially good reduction at a prime $p$, the structure of its stable reduction over the base field (here $\\mathbb{Q}_2$) is well-known. The special fiber of the stable model must be a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. For a curve with potentially good reduction, this stable fiber is a configuration of rational curves (curves of genus 0, i.e., copies of $\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\nLet the stable reduction be a union of $V$ rational curves, joined at $E$ nodes (ordinary double points). The arithmetic genus of such a configuration (if connected) is given by the formula $g_a = E - V + 1$.\nWe need $g_a = 2$. So we need to find integers $E \\ge V-1$ such that $E-V+1=2$, which means $E = V+1$.\nThe simplest such configurations are:\n*   $V=1$ (one irreducible rational curve): $E=1+1=2$. This is a rational curve with 2 nodes (double points).\n*   $V=2$ (two rational curves): $E=2+1=3$. This means two rational curves intersecting at 3 points.\n*   $V=3$ (three rational curves): $E=3+1=4$. This is a cycle of 3 curves plus one more attachment.\n\nThe theory of stable reduction for genus 2 curves with potentially good reduction shows that the stable model over $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is typically the first case: a single rational curve with two nodes, or a chain of rational curves also resulting in two nodes overall. In both cases, the number of nodes is 2.\n\nThus, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points."
