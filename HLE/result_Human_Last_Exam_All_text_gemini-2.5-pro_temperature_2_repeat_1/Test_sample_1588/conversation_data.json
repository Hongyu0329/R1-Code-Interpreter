    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides a solution `Z` for the equation `e^Z = e^X e^Y`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting operators or matrices. The solution `Z` is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`:\n`Z = X + Y + Z_2 + Z_3 + ... + Z_k + ...`\nHere, `Z_k` is the \"term of order `k`\" or \"homogeneous component of degree `k`\". It is a linear combination of all possible linearly independent nested commutators involving `X` and `Y` with a total degree of `k`. The degree of a term is the total count of `X`'s and `Y`'s in it.\n\n**2. Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe set of all formal linear combinations of commutators of `X` and `Y` forms a mathematical structure called a **free Lie algebra** with two generators (`X` and `Y`). The number of non-zero coefficients of order `k` in the BCH expansion corresponds to the number of linearly independent commutators of degree `k`. This number is precisely the dimension of the `k`-th graded subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\n**3. Use Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the `k`-th graded subspace of a free Lie algebra on `n` generators is given by **Witt's formula**:\n`L_n(k) = (1/k) * Σ_{d|k} μ(d) * n^(k/d)`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the degree (or order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   `n` is the number of generators, which is 2 (`X` and `Y`).\n*   The sum `Σ_{d|k}` is over all positive divisors `d` of `k`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**4. Define and Calculate the Möbius Function `μ(d)`**\n\nThe Möbius function is defined as:\n*   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors (or `d=1`).\n*   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n*   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n**5. Apply Witt's Formula to our specific problem (k=10, n=2)**\n\n*   **Step 5a: Identify the divisors of k=10.**\n    The divisors `d` of 10 are {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n\n*   **Step 5b: Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor.**\n    *   `μ(1)`: 1 is square-free and has 0 (an even number) prime factors. So, `μ(1) = 1`.\n    *   `μ(2)`: 2 is a prime (a single prime factor). So, `μ(2) = -1`.\n    *   `μ(5)`: 5 is a prime (a single prime factor). So, `μ(5) = -1`.\n    *   `μ(10)`: 10 = 2 × 5. It is square-free with two prime factors (an even number). So, `μ(10) = 1`.\n\n*   **Step 5c: Substitute these values into Witt's formula.**\n    `L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10) ]`\n\n*   **Step 5d: Perform the calculations.**\n    `L_2(10) = (1/10) * [ 1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 ]`\n\n*   **Step 5e: Evaluate the powers of 2.**\n    *   `2^10 = 1024`\n    *   `2^5 = 32`\n    *   `2^2 = 4`\n    *   `2^1 = 2`\n\n*   **Step 5f: Compute the sum inside the brackets.**\n    `Sum = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2`\n    `Sum = 992 - 4 + 2`\n    `Sum = 988 + 2`\n    `Sum = 990`\n\n*   **Step 5g: Complete the final calculation.**\n    `L_2(10) = (1/10) * 990`\n    `L_2(10) = 99`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly identifying the problem:** The core of the question is to find the dimension of a specific mathematical space (the degree-10 part of the free Lie algebra on two generators), not to compute the coefficients themselves, which would be extremely complex.\n2.  **Using the right formula:** Witt's formula is the correct tool for this task.\n3.  **Möbius function calculation:** Ensure the rules for the Möbius function are applied correctly, especially for `μ(1)` and composite numbers like `μ(10)`.\n4.  **Arithmetic accuracy:** Double-check the evaluation of powers and the final summation and division. Any small error here will lead to the wrong answer.\n5.  **Assumption:** The question implies that none of the coefficients for the basis elements are \"accidentally\" zero. In the context of the generic BCH formula, this is a standard and safe assumption. All basis elements of the free Lie algebra are required to express the result.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators. By applying Witt's formula with `k=10` and `n=2`, we find this number to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
