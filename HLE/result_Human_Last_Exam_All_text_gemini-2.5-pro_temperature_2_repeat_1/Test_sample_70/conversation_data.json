    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark:**\n    *   **Visual Structure:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of one horizontal stripe and one vertical stripe that extend to the edges of the flag.\n    *   **Matrix Representation:** We can represent the flag as an `m x n` matrix. To maximize the rank, as per the question's requirement, we assign distinct numerical values to the different colors. Let Red be represented by the number `r` and White by `w`, where `r ≠ w`. For simplicity, let's use `r=1` and `w=0`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** The resulting matrix will have zeros along one specific row (the horizontal part of the cross) and one specific column (the vertical part of the cross). All other entries will be 1.\n        Let's consider an example matrix based on this structure:\n        ```\n        1 1 0 1\n        1 1 0 1\n        0 0 0 0\n        1 1 0 1\n        ```\n        The row vectors are `(1, 1, 0, 1)`, `(1, 1, 0, 1)`, `(0, 0, 0, 0)`, and `(1, 1, 0, 1)`.\n        The row space is spanned by the set of unique non-zero row vectors, which is `{ (1, 1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0) }`. Oh, I made a mistake here, the horizontal bar is white (0).\n        Let's correct the example. Let the cross be on row `i` and column `j`.\n        `M(i, :) = w`\n        `M(:, j) = w`\n        `M(k, l) = r` for `k≠i, l≠j`.\n        So, at the intersection `M(i,j)`, the value is `w`.\n        Using `r=1, w=0`:\n        ```\n        1 1 0 1\n        1 1 0 1\n        0 0 0 0  <-- Horizontal bar\n        1 1 0 1\n           ^--- Vertical bar\n        ```\n        The non-zero, unique row vectors are `(1, 1, 0, 1)` and `(0, 0, 0, 0)`. The space is spanned by `(1, 1, 0, 1)`, which means the rank is 1. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Recalculation:** Let's reconsider the matrix again. `r=1, w=2`.\n        ```\n        1 1 2 1\n        1 1 2 1\n        2 2 2 2\n        1 1 2 1\n        ```\n        The unique row types are `R1 = (1, 1, 2, 1)` and `R2 = (2, 2, 2, 2)`. All rows are either `R1` or `R2`.\n        The row space is spanned by `R1` and `R2`. Are they linearly independent? Yes, because `R2` is a multiple of `(1,1,1,1)`, but `R1` is not. Therefore, they are linearly independent. The dimension of the row space is 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify General Flag Structures with Rank 2:**\n    *   The task is to find African flags whose structure, when represented as a matrix, yields a rank of 2. The rank is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns).\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags:** These flags have rows that are all scalar multiples of each other. This typically includes flags with only horizontal stripes or only vertical stripes (e.g., Gabon, Nigeria).\n    *   **Rank > 2 Flags:** These flags have complex geometric arrangements that result in three or more linearly independent row types. This includes flags with diagonal bands, triangles, complex multi-part emblems, or combinations of several simple elements (e.g., South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tunisia).\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags:** These flags have structures that generate exactly two linearly independent row types. Common patterns include:\n        *   **Field + Emblem:** A single-color field with a central emblem of another single color (e.g., Morocco's red flag with a green pentagram). The two row types are the plain field row and the row(s) modified by the emblem.\n        *   **Stripes + Emblem:** A striped flag (which would be rank 1 on its own) with an emblem placed over one of the stripes (e.g., Egypt's tricolor with the Eagle of Saladin). The plain stripe rows are all multiples of a single vector, and the emblem-modified rows form the second basis vector.\n        *   **Vertical Bar + Horizontal Stripes:** A design like the flag of Benin, which has a vertical bar at the hoist and horizontal stripes on the fly. This creates two distinct types of rows that are linearly independent.\n        *   **Stripes + Canton:** A flag with a field of stripes and a rectangular canton in the corner (like the flag of Liberia). The rows that go through the canton are different from the rows that do not, creating two linearly independent row types.\n\n3.  **Survey Flags of African Nations:**\n    By applying the principles above, we can categorize the flags of African nations.\n\n    *   **Flags with Rank 1:** Botswana, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone.\n    *   **Flags with Rank > 2:** Burundi, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Comoros, DR Congo, Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Tunisia.\n    *   **Flags with Rank 2:** The remaining flags fit one of the Rank 2 patterns.\n\n        *   **Algeria:** Vertical bicolor with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Angola:** Horizontal bicolour with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Benin:** Vertical bar and horizontal stripes. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Burkina Faso:** Horizontal bicolour with central star. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Cameroon:** Vertical tricolor with central star. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Egypt:** Horizontal tricolor with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Ethiopia:** Horizontal tricolor with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Ghana:** Horizontal tricolor with central star. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Guinea-Bissau:** Vertical bar with star and horizontal stripes. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Lesotho:** Horizontal tricolor with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Liberia:** Stripes with a canton. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Libya:** Horizontal tricolor with central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Madagascar:** Vertical bar and horizontal stripes. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Malawi:** Horizontal tricolor with an emblem on one stripe. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Mauritania:** Field with top/bottom stripes and a central emblem. The stripes make it a Rank 1 base, and the emblem raises it to Rank 2.\n        *   **Morocco:** Single-color field with a central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Niger:** Horizontal tricolor with a central emblem. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Rwanda:** Horizontal tricolor with an emblem on one stripe. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Senegal:** Vertical tricolor with a central star. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Somalia:** Single-color field with a central star. (Rank 2)\n        *   **Togo:** Stripes with a canton. (Rank 2)\n\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Togo>>>"
