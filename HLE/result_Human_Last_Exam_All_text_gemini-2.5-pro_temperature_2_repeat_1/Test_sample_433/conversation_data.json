    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What is being asked?** The Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For what item?** A single-dose container that is specifically an **ampule**.\n    *   **What action has occurred?** It has been punctured (more accurately for an ampule, it has been broken open).\n    *   **In what environment?** A sterile environment (this implies an ISO Class 5 environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench or biological safety cabinet, as defined by USP standards).\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or opened container must not be used, stored, or transported. It is determined from the moment of compounding or opening.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container holding a sterile medication intended for use in a single patient during a single procedure. It contains no antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of single-dose container, typically made of glass, which is hermetically sealed. To access the contents, the neck of the ampule is broken. **Crucially, an ampule cannot be resealed after it is opened.**\n\n3.  **Consult Authoritative Standards (USP <797>):**\n    *   The primary source for rules on sterile compounding and medication handling in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"\n    *   USP <797> provides specific rules for handling different types of containers to maintain sterility and prevent patient harm.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Rule for Ampules:**\n    *   The standards clearly differentiate between ampules and vials. While both can be single-dose containers, their physical properties lead to different handling requirements.\n    *   A vial has a rubber stopper that can be repeatedly punctured and reseals after the needle is withdrawn.\n    *   An **ampule**, once broken open, is an open system. Its contents are directly and continuously exposed to the surrounding air.\n    *   Because it cannot be resealed, USP <797> mandates that the contents of an opened ampule must be used **immediately**.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication remaining in the ampule must be discarded and cannot be stored for future use, regardless of the environment's quality.\n\n5.  **Consider the \"Sterile Environment\" Clause:**\n    *   Performing the opening and withdrawal within an ISO Class 5 sterile environment is essential for conducting the *aseptic transfer* of the drug into a syringe or a final compounded preparation.\n    *   However, this clean environment **does not extend the usable life or assign a storage BUD** to the opened ampule itself. The purpose of the sterile hood is to protect the drug during the immediate transfer process, not to allow for the storage of an open container.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most critical distinction. A single-dose **vial** punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment has a BUD of up to 12 hours (according to the updated USP <797>). An **ampule** does not share this rule because it cannot be resealed.\n*   **\"Immediate Use\" Meaning:** In the context of USP standards, \"immediate use\" means the task should be performed promptly and without delay. It is not a defined period like 1 hour; it implies a continuous procedure where the opened ampule is not set aside for later use.\n*   **No Storage Permitted:** The fundamental principle for an opened ampule is that it cannot be stored. The contents are either used in their entirety at once or the remainder is discarded.\n*   **Discarding Unused Contents:** It is mandatory to discard any unused contents of the ampule immediately after the required dose has been withdrawn. This prevents potential contamination and use of a compromised product.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe BUD for a single-dose ampule from the time of opening in a sterile environment is **immediate use only**. There is no storage time allotted. The contents must be withdrawn immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<An opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately, and any remaining contents must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any period of time.>>>"
