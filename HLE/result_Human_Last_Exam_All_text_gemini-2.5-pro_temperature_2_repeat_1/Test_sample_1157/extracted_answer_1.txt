The specific procedures start with immediate systemic management of her uncontrolled diabetes, followed by local wound care including irrigation and suturing, but specifically avoiding replantation due to the 28-hour delay. Antibiotics are essential. The cells of primary interest are the non-viable Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells, which contraindicate replantation, and compromised immune cells (neutrophils) which heighten infection risk. For definitive replacement, the best option is a cast metal framework Removable Partial Denture made of a Cobalt-Chromium alloy. The abutment teeth would be the left second premolar and left central incisor as primary abutments, with the right-side molars used as crucial secondary abutments for cross-arch stabilization. This design is chosen for its stability, durability, and for being the safest option given her systemic health and complex dental situation.
