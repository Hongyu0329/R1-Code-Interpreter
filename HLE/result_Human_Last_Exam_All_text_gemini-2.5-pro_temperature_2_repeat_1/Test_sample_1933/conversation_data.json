    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ consists of four unary predicates. A structure (or model) for this schema will have a universe of elements, and for each predicate $P_i$, a corresponding subset of the universe where the predicate is true.\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic over the schema $S$.\n    *   `$\\exists$`: Only existential quantifiers are allowed.\n    *   `$\\land$`: Only conjunction is allowed as a logical connective.\n    *   `$\\top, \\bot$`: The logical constants for TRUE and FALSE are allowed.\n    *   This logic defines a class of queries. Because it lacks negation and disjunction, it's a relatively simple, monotonic logic.\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension measures the complexity of a concept class. We need to define the concept class associated with our logic fragment.\n    *   A formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$, from our logic defines a \"concept\".\n    *   For a given structure $M$ with universe $U_M$, the concept defined by $\\phi(x)$ corresponds to the set of elements $\\{a \\in U_M \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n    *   The **concept class** for a given structure $M$, denoted $\\mathcal{H}_M$, is the collection of all such sets definable by formulas $\\phi(x)$ in our logic.\n    *   The VC dimension of the logic is the maximum VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_M$ over all possible structures $M$.\n    *   Recall: A set of points $C$ is **shattered** by a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ if for every subset $C' \\subseteq C$, there exists a concept $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $h \\cap C = C'$. The VC dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Formulas and Definable Concepts\n\nLet's analyze the form of any formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\nAny formula in this logic is equivalent to a *primitive positive formula*, which has the form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nSince all predicates in $S$ are unary, an atomic formula can only involve one variable, e.g., $P_i(x)$ or $P_j(y_m)$. There are no atoms that relate $x$ and a quantified variable, like $R(x, y_m)$.\n\nThis allows us to separate the variables in the conjunction $\\psi$:\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\underbrace{(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x))}_{\\text{atoms with } x} \\land \\underbrace{(\\dots)}_{\\text{atoms with } y_1, \\dots, y_k}$\n\nSo, the full formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written as:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\left[ \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\psi'(\\vec{y}) \\right]$\nwhere $\\psi'(\\vec{y})$ is a conjunction of atoms involving only the quantified variables $\\vec{y}$.\n\nSince the part $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ does not contain any quantified variables, we can pull it out of the quantifier scope:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi'(\\vec{y})\\right)$\n\nLet's look at the second part, $C = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k \\psi'(\\vec{y})$. This is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables). For any given structure $M$, the sentence $C$ is either true or false.\n\nThis means that for any structure $M$, the concept (set) defined by $\\phi(x)$ is one of two things:\n1.  If $M \\models \\neg C$, the defined set is **the empty set, $\\emptyset$**.\n2.  If $M \\models C$, the defined set is $\\{a \\in U_M \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)\\}$. This is precisely the **intersection** of the sets corresponding to the predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in I$.\n\nSo, for any structure $M$ with predicate extensions $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is a subset of:\n$\\{ \\emptyset \\} \\cup \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$\n\nThe problem now boils down to finding the VC dimension of a concept class consisting of all possible intersections of 4 base sets.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge 4$)\n\nWe need to show that there exists a structure $M$ and a set of points $C \\subseteq U_M$ of size 4 that can be shattered.\n\nLet's construct such a structure.\n*   Let the universe be $U_M = C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$.\n*   Define the extensions of the four predicates, $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, on this universe as follows: $S_i = C \\setminus \\{c_i\\}$ for $i=1, \\dots, 4$.\n    *   $S_1 = \\{c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $S_2 = \\{c_1, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $S_3 = \\{c_1, c_2, c_4\\}$\n    *   $S_4 = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$\n*   The concepts we can form are intersections of these sets. Let's see if we can generate any arbitrary subset $C' \\subseteq C$.\n*   Let $C' = \\{c_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$ be the target subset, where $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. We need to find an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i = C'$.\n*   Consider an element $c_k \\in C$. By our definition of $S_i$, $c_k \\in S_i$ if and only if $k \\neq i$.\n*   Therefore, $c_k$ is in the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ if and only if $c_k \\in S_i$ for all $i \\in I$, which means $k \\neq i$ for all $i \\in I$. This is equivalent to $k \\notin I$.\n*   So, the resulting set is $\\{c_k \\mid k \\notin I\\}$. To make this equal to our target $C' = \\{c_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$, we must have $\\{k \\mid k \\notin I\\} = \\{j \\mid j \\in J\\}$.\n*   We can achieve this by choosing $I$ to be the complement of $J$: $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$.\n\nThis construction successfully produces every possible subset of $C$. Thus, the set $C$ of size 4 is shattered. This implies that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le 4$)\n\nNow we need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\n*   Let $C$ be any set of 5 points. To shatter $C$, we must be able to generate all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets.\n*   The concepts are generated by the formulas in our logic. For any structure $M$, we found that the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is a subset of $\\{ \\emptyset \\} \\cup \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\n*   The number of possible index sets $I$ is $2^4=16$. This means there are at most 16 distinct intersections. Including the empty set, the total number of distinct concepts we can possibly form is at most $16 + 1 = 17$.\n*   Since we need to realize 32 different subsets to shatter a set of size 5, and we only have at most 17 concepts available, it is impossible to shatter any set of size 5, regardless of the structure.\n*   Therefore, the VC dimension cannot be 5 or greater. This implies the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we have VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nFrom Step 4, we have VCdim $\\le 4$.\nCombining these two results, the VC dimension must be exactly 4.\n\nThe general result is that the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ consists of $k$ unary predicates is $k$. In this problem, $k=4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
