    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and her Subject Matter**\nLady Elizabeth Butler (1846â€“1933) was a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. Her most famous works were created in the Victorian era, depicting conflicts of the 19th century. However, she lived through World War I and also painted scenes from that conflict.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Paintings and the Historical Dates of the Events Depicted**\nTo find the latest battle, we need to list her significant military paintings and the dates of the events they portray. Here are some of her key works in chronological order of the events depicted:\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras** on **June 16, 1815**, part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo** on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts Dr. William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad as the lone survivor of a British column after the **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts an infantry roll call after an engagement during the **Crimean War (1853-1856)**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the **Battle of Balaclava** on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** on **January 22-23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** on **January 28, 1881**, during the First Boer War.\n*   ***After the Battle*** (painted 1885): Depicts the aftermath of the **Battle of Tel El Kebir** on **September 13, 1882**, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition, which included engagements like the **Battle of Abu Klea** on **January 17, 1885**, during the Mahdist War.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Lady Butler's Later Works (Post-19th Century)**\nA crucial point is not to stop with her most famous Victorian-era paintings. Lady Butler lived until 1933 and her work extended into the 20th century. She painted several scenes related to World War I (1914-1918). These include:\n\n*   ***British Troops on the road to Mons, August 23, 1914***: This painting depicts soldiers during the **Battle of Mons** on **August 23, 1914**.\n*   ***Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt, 1916***: This work depicts a specific cavalry charge during the **Action at Agagia** on **February 26, 1916**. This engagement was part of the Senussi Campaign, a theatre of World War I.\n\n**Step 4: Compare All Dates to Find the Latest Battle**\nNow we compare the dates of the latest battles identified from each period of her work:\n\n*   Battle of Abu Klea (Mahdist War): **1885**\n*   Battle of Mons (World War I): **1914**\n*   Action at Agagia (World War I): **1916**\n\nComparing these dates, the Action at Agagia in 1916 is the latest historical event.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile Lady Butler is most famous for her depictions of 19th-century colonial wars, the latest historical battle she depicted was the **Action at Agagia**, which took place on February 26, 1916, during the First World War.\n\n<<<The Action at Agagia"
