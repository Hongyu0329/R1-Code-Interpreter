    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the new sequence:**\n    Let the new 8-point sequence be `y(n)`. It is formed by interleaving the sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n    This can be expressed mathematically as:\n    *   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n2.  **Interpret the question:**\n    The question asks for the **4-point DFT** of the **8-point sequence** `y(n)`. In standard Discrete Fourier Transform theory, this implies finding the DFT of a 4-point sequence derived from `y(n)` by time-domain aliasing.\n    *   Let the aliased 4-point sequence be `y_a(n)`. It is defined as `y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n=0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   A key DFT property states that the DFT of this aliased sequence, let's call it `Y_4(k)`, can be obtained by taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`.\n    *   Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Then the desired 4-point DFT is `Y_4(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   Therefore, our goal is to find the values of `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n3.  **Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`:**\n    The 8-point DFT of `y(n)` is defined as `Y(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = exp(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n    We can split the sum into even and odd indices of `n` (let `n=2m` for even and `n=2m+1` for odd):\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n    Substitute `y(2m)=x(m)` and `y(2m+1)=h(m)`:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_8^(2mk)`\n    Using the property `W_8^2 = W_4`, we get:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n    The sums are the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n    This is the standard decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) butterfly formula. This formula allows us to compute the first half of the `Y(k)` sequence (`k=0,1,2,3`). The second half is given by:\n    `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the required values `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`:**\n    *   **Given DFTs:**\n        `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n        `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n    *   **Required Twiddle Factors:**\n        `W_8^0 = exp(0) = 1`\n        `W_8^2 = exp(-j*2*pi*2/8) = exp(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n\n    *   **Calculate `Y(0)`:**\n        Using the first formula with `k=0`:\n        `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * 0 = 1`\n\n    *   **Calculate `Y(2)`:**\n        Using the first formula with `k=2`:\n        `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n    *   **Calculate `Y(4)`:**\n        Using the second formula with `k=0` (since `4=0+4`):\n        `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1) * 0 = 1`\n\n    *   **Calculate `Y(6)`:**\n        Using the second formula with `k=2` (since `6=2+4`):\n        `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Answer:**\n    The required 4-point DFT is the sequence `[Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)]`.\n    Substituting the calculated values, we get:\n    `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]}$.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
