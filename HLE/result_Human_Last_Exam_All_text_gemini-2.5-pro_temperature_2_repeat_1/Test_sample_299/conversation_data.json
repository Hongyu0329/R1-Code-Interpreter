    "An analysis of the problem of finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Basic properties of the function `f`**\n\nThe function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ has the following properties:\n*   It is strictly increasing.\n*   It is continuous.\n*   Its range is $(0, \\infty)$.\n*   It is injective (one-to-one).\n\nFrom the given equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we can deduce properties of $f$.\n1.  **Injectivity of f**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n2.  **Monotonicity of f**: Since $f$ is a continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n3.  **Range of f**: The range of $f \\circ f$ is the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. Let $R(f)$ be the range of $f$. The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f))$. Thus, $f(R(f)) = (0, \\infty)$. This means for any $y \\in R(f)$, we must have $f(y) > 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function, it must be surjective onto its range. We analyze the limits:\n*   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must tend to some limit $L_2$.\n*   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must tend to some limit $L_1$.\nSince $f$ is decreasing, its range is $(L_2, L_1)$.\n\nWe have $f(R(f)) = f((L_2, L_1)) = (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $f((L_2, L_1)) = (\\lim_{y \\to L_1^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to L_2^+} f(y))$.\nSo, $\\lim_{y \\to L_1^-} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to L_2^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n\nLet's evaluate the limits $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n*   $L_1 = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$. Applying $f$ and using continuity: $f(L_1) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$. So, we have $f(L_1)=0$. This implies $L_1$ must be a finite value, which is the unique root of $f$. Let's call it $c$. So, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = c$.\n*   $L_2 = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$. By continuity, if $L_2$ were finite, $f(L_2) = \\lim_{y \\to L_2^+} f(y) = \\infty$, which is impossible for a function mapping to $\\mathbb{R}$. So, $L_2$ must be $-\\infty$. Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nSo, any strictly decreasing solution must satisfy $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = c$ (for some constant $c$) and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n\nNow, let's test for fixed points. A fixed point $p$ satisfies $f(p)=p$.\n*   **Argument for existence of a fixed point**: Consider the auxiliary function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is continuous.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = c - (-\\infty) = +\\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    Since $g(x)$ is continuous and goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ where $g(p)=0$, which implies $f(p)=p$.\n*   **Argument against existence of a fixed point**: If $f$ has a fixed point $p$, then $f(p)=p$. Applying $f$ again gives $f(f(p))=f(p)$. Substituting the known relations, we get $\\exp(p)=p$. However, the equation $e^p=p$ has no real solutions (the graph of $y=e^x$ is always above the graph of $y=x$).\n\nThis is a contradiction. A strictly decreasing continuous function $f$ must have a fixed point, but the equation $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$ forbids it. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nA similar analysis of limits shows that any strictly increasing solution must satisfy:\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   $f(c) = 0$.\n\nThe construction of such functions reveals a large family of solutions. The core idea is that the behavior of the function on a single key interval determines its behavior everywhere else.\n1.  Let $f(0)=a$. From $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$, we get $f(a)=1$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we need $a > f(c)=0$ (since $0>c$, a fact we can deduce as $e^c = f(f(c))=f(0)=a>0$, so $c$ is finite. $f(c)=0 < a = f(0)$ and $f$ is increasing, so $c<0$). We also need $a=f(0)<f(a)=1$, which gives $a<1$. So, we must have $a \\in (0,1)$. Each choice of $a \\in (0,1)$ will define a family of solutions.\n2.  Now, consider the interval $[0, a]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, it maps $[0, a]$ to $[f(0), f(a)] = [a, 1]$. Let $h_0$ be the restriction of $f$ to $[0, a]$. So, $h_0: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ is an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function satisfying $h_0(0)=a$ and $h_0(a)=1$.\n3.  This choice of $h_0$ determines $f$ on all other intervals. For example, for any $x \\in [a, 1]$, we can write $x = h_0(z)$ for some $z \\in [0, a]$. Then $f(x) = f(h_0(z)) = f(f(z)) = e^z = e^{h_0^{-1}(x)}$.\n4.  This process can be extended to define $f$ on $[0, \\infty)$ and, by a similar procedure, on $(-\\infty, 0)$. It can be shown that the entire function $f$ is uniquely determined by the pair $(a, h_0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Cardinality Calculation**\n\nThe set of all solutions is the set of all strictly increasing functions constructed as described above. Each solution corresponds to a unique pair $(a, h_0)$, where:\n*   $a$ is a real number in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n*   $h_0$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function mapping $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$.\n\nWe need to find the cardinality of the set of these pairs.\n1.  **Cardinality of choices for `a`**: The set of possible values for $a$ is the interval $(0, 1)$, which has cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n2.  **Cardinality of choices for `h_0`**: For any fixed $a \\in (0,1)$, we need to find the cardinality of the set of valid functions $h_0$. This is the set of all homeomorphisms from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$.\n    *   This cardinality is at least $c$. We can construct a continuum of such functions. For example, for each $p \\in (a,1)$, define a piecewise linear function that passes through $(0,a), (a/2, p), (a,1)$. Each choice of $p$ gives a distinct function.\n    *   This cardinality is at most $c$. Any continuous function on a closed interval is uniquely determined by its values on a countable dense subset (like the rationals). The number of ways to map the countable set $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, a]$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $c^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c$. So, there are at most $c$ such continuous functions.\n    *   Therefore, for each choice of $a$, there are $c$ possible functions for $h_0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $a$ and the number of choices for $h_0$.\nCardinality = (Number of choices for $a$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $h_0$)\nCardinality = $c \\times c = c$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n>>>c"
