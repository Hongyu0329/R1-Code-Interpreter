    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Duality Principle\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe observer canonical form of a system (A, C) is dual to the controller canonical form of the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\nLet the original system be `Σ = (A, C)`.\nThe dual system is `Σ_d = (A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n\nIf we find a transformation `T` that converts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into its controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`, where:\n`A_c = T A_d T^{-1}`\n`B_c = T B_d`\n\nThen, the observer canonical form of the original system `(A, C)` will be `(A_o, C_o)` given by:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nOur goal is to find the new matrix C, which is `C_o`. Therefore, we only need to find `B_c` for the dual system.\n\n### Step 2: Define and Analyze the Dual System\nThe matrices for the dual system are:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input system. We need to check its controllability. The controllability matrix `W_c` for the dual system is constructed from columns `[B_d, A_d*B_d, ...]`. Let the columns of `B_d` be `b_{d1}` and `b_{d2}`:\n`b_{d1} = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b_{d2} = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\nCalculate `A_d * b_{d1}` and `A_d * b_{d2}`:\n`A_d * b_{d1} = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`\n`A_d * b_{d2} = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [3, 2, 1]^T`\n\nTo check controllability, we select `n=3` linearly independent columns from `[b_{d1}, b_{d2}, A_d*b_{d1}, A_d*b_{d2}, ...]`.\nLet's choose `v_1 = b_{d1} = [0, 1, 0]^T`, `v_2 = b_{d2} = [1, 1, 0]^T`, and `v_3 = A_d*b_{d1} = [2, 1, 1]^T`.\nThe determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is:\n`det([v_1, v_2, v_3]) = det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = -1 * (1*1 - 2*0) = -1`.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, these three vectors are linearly independent, and the dual system is controllable. This implies the original system is observable.\n\nThe controllability indices `(μ_1, μ_2)` are determined by this selection. We used two vectors from the chain of `b_{d1}` (`b_{d1}` and `A_d*b_{d1}`) and one from the chain of `b_{d2}` (`b_{d2}`). Therefore, the controllability indices are `μ_1 = 2` and `μ_2 = 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Transformation to Controller Canonical Form\nA standard method to transform `(A_d, B_d)` to controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` involves finding a transformation matrix `T` such that `z = T x_d`.\nThe transformation `T` is given by the inverse of a specific controllability matrix `S_c`. `S_c` is constructed from the selected linearly independent columns in the order corresponding to the controllability indices `μ_1=2, μ_2=1`.\n`S_c = [b_{d1}, A_d*b_{d1}, b_{d2}] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nSo, `T = S_c^{-1}`. The canonical `B_c` matrix is then given by `B_c = T B_d = S_c^{-1} B_d`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Canonical Matrix `B_c`\nFirst, we need to calculate the inverse of `S_c`:\n`S_c = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`det(S_c) = 0 - 2(1*0 - 1*1) + 1(1*1 - 1*0) = -2(-1) + 1(1) = 3`\n\nThe adjugate matrix of `S_c` is the transpose of its cofactor matrix.\n`Cofactor(S_c) = [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, -2], [1, 1, -2]]`\n`Adj(S_c) = Cofactor(S_c)^T = [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, -2, -2]]`\n\n`S_c^{-1} = (1/det(S_c)) * Adj(S_c) = (1/3) * [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, -2, -2]]`\n\nNow we calculate `B_c = S_c^{-1} B_d`:\n`B_c = (1/3) * [[-1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, -2, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = (1/3) * [[(-1*0 + 1*1 + 1*0), (-1*1 + 1*1 + 1*0)], [(1*0 + 0*1 + 1*0), (1*1 + 0*1 + 1*0)], [(1*0 - 2*1 - 2*0), (1*1 - 2*1 - 2*0)]]`\n`B_c = (1/3) * [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-2, -1]]`\n`B_c = [[1/3, 0], [0, 1/3], [-2/3, -1/3]]`\n\nThis is the `B` matrix for one particular controller canonical form.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Final Matrix `C_o`\nThe new output matrix `C_o` of the observer canonical form is the transpose of `B_c`:\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n`C_o = [[1/3, 0, -2/3], [0, 1/3, -1/3]]`\n\n**Careful points:**\n1.  The choice of \"canonical form\" is not unique for MIMO systems. The procedure followed here is a standard one that results in one of the possible forms.\n2.  The ordering of columns in `S_c` is crucial and depends on how the controllability indices are assigned to the inputs. Here `b_{d1}` corresponds to `μ_1=2` and `b_{d2}` to `μ_2=1`.\n3.  Matrix inversion and multiplication must be performed carefully. Errors in these steps are common and lead to incorrect results.\n\nAnother widely used controller canonical form (Luenberger form) yields `B_c` with 0s and 1s, leading to a different `C_o`. However, the method based on `T=S_c^{-1}` is a direct application of the theory.\n\nLet's check the result from another choice of canonical form to be thorough. If one uses the controllable form from MATLAB (`canon(sys, 'companion')`), the `B` matrix, `B_c`, would have unit vectors at the bottom of each block. For indices `μ_1=2, μ_2=1`, this would give:\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\nThis form `(A_c, B_c)` is achievable through a different transformation `T`. If this were the intended canonical form, then `C_o` would be:\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the first method which relies on a direct construction `T = S_c^{-1}` is more systematic if less \"clean\". Let's stick with the first result.\n\n`C_o = [[1/3, 0, -2/3], [0, 1/3, -1/3]]`\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is the value of the new matrix C.\n\n<<<[[1/3, 0, -2/3], [0, 1/3, -1/3]]>>>"
