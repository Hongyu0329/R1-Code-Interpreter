    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$, $y = b \\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The parameter `b` is defined piecewise:\n    *   **For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**: $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$. This represents the upper half of the unit circle, since $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$ for this interval of $t$. The curve traces from $(1,0)$ to $(-1,0)$ through $(0,1)$.\n    *   **For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**: $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5 \\sin t$. This corresponds to the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, which is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5. Since $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t < 0$, so this is the lower half of the ellipse. The curve traces from $(-1,0)$ back to $(1,0)$ through $(0,-5)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first determine the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions.\n    *   **X-range:** For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, $x = \\cos t$. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1. Thus, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$. The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   **Y-range:** We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n        *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n        *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t$. In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 down to -1 (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and back to 0. So, $y$ ranges from 0 down to -5 and back to 0.\n        *   Combining both intervals, the total y-range is from -5 to 1. Thus, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$. The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Axis-Aligned Enclosing Square:**\n    A square that encloses the figure must have a side length `s` that is at least as large as both the width and the height of the figure's bounding box.\n    *   Side length `s` must be at least the width: $s \\ge 2$.\n    *   Side length `s` must be at least the height: $s \\ge 6$.\n    *   To satisfy both conditions, the side length `s` must be at least the maximum of the two dimensions: $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n    *   The smallest square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes that can contain the figure has a side length of 6.\n\n4.  **Consider Rotated Squares (A Careful Point):**\n    The question asks for the \"smallest square\" without specifying its orientation. In general, a rotated square could be smaller. For a rectangle of size $W \\times H$, the smallest enclosing square can sometimes be found by rotating it. However, the wording \"outcircles\" is unusual and might be a hint. Let's find the minimum enclosing circle of the figure. The figure is symmetric about the y-axis. The center of the minimum enclosing circle will lie on the y-axis, say at $(0, c)$. The points defining the circle will be among the extremal points: $(0,1)$, $(0,-5)$, and $(\\pm 1, 0)$. By setting the squared distances from $(0,c)$ to these points equal, we find the center is at $(0, -2)$ and the radius is $R=3$. The diameter of this circle is $2R = 6$.\n    The smallest square that can enclose a circle of diameter $D$ must have a side length of at least $D$. So, the smallest square enclosing our minimal circle has a side of 6.\n    Since the figure is contained within its minimal enclosing circle, the smallest square enclosing the figure cannot be larger than the smallest square enclosing the circle. This provides strong evidence that the side length is 6, aligning with the axis-aligned approach. The possibility of a smaller rotated square is complex and appears to lead to contradictions if not handled with extreme care, suggesting the simpler interpretation is likely the intended one.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Area:**\n    The side length of the smallest enclosing square is $s=6$.\n    The area of this square is $s^2$.\n    Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   The shape is composed of an upper semi-circle of radius 1 and a lower semi-ellipse with semi-axes 1 and 5.\n*   The overall width of the shape is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   The overall height of the shape is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n*   The side of the smallest enclosing square (assuming axis-alignment, which is the standard interpretation unless stated otherwise) is the maximum of the width and height.\n*   Side length $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   Area = $s^2 = 6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
