    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of regions created by the fold lines of a standard origami crane.\n\nThe process of folding an origami crane creates a specific set of creases on the square paper. We can count the number of regions by analyzing the creases added at each major stage of the folding process.\n\n**Step 1: The Initial Folds (The Preliminary Base Creases)**\n\n1.  A standard sheet of origami paper is a square. We begin with **1** region.\n2.  Fold and unfold along one diagonal. This single line divides the square into **2** regions.\n3.  Fold and unfold along the other diagonal. This second line crosses the first one, dividing two existing regions into two each. This adds 2 new regions, for a total of **4** regions.\n4.  Fold and unfold the paper in half horizontally (connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides). This line passes through the center, crossing two of the existing four triangular regions. This adds 2 more regions, bringing the total to **6**.\n5.  Fold and unfold the paper in half vertically. This line also passes through the center, crossing two regions. This adds a final 2 regions for this step.\n6.  At the end of this initial phase, we have two diagonals and two perpendicular bisectors. These lines all intersect at the center and divide the square into **8** triangular regions.\n\n**Step 2: Folding the Bird Base**\n\nThe bird base is the foundation for many origami models, including the crane. It is formed from the preliminary base using squash and petal folds. When unfolded, these folds add two new sets of creases.\n\n1.  **\"Kite\" Folds:** To form the bird base, the four corners of the paper are brought towards the center. This creates creases that, on the unfolded paper, run from each of the four corners towards the center. In total, 8 such creases are formed (two for each original corner). Each of these 8 creases splits one of the existing 8 regions into two. This adds **8** new regions.\n    *   *Current total: 8 + 8 = 16 regions.*\n2.  **\"Petal\" Folds:** The petal fold step creates a small, 45-degree rotated square (a diamond shape) of creases in the center of the paper. This square consists of 4 crease lines. Each of these 4 lines splits an existing region. This adds **4** new regions.\n    *   *Current total: 16 + 4 = 20 regions.*\n    *   The crease pattern for a flat-unfolded Bird Base divides the paper into 20 regions.\n\n**Step 3: Forming the Head and Tail**\n\nThe head and the tail of the crane are created using a technique called an \"inside reverse fold\" on two opposite points of the bird base.\n\n1.  Each inside reverse fold adds a small V-shaped pair of creases to the pattern. This \"V\" is formed within one of the existing long, thin triangular regions along the main diagonals.\n2.  A V-shaped crease pattern inside a single region divides it into 3 smaller regions, meaning a net addition of 2 regions.\n3.  Since we perform one inside reverse fold for the head and one for the tail, we add 2 regions for the head and 2 regions for the tail. This is a total addition of **4** regions.\n    *   *Current total: 20 + 4 = 24 regions.*\n\n**Step 4: Folding the Wings**\n\nThe final step is to fold down the wings.\n\n1.  This action creates one primary new crease on each of the two wings.\n2.  On the unfolded crease pattern, each of these wing folds corresponds to a single new line segment. Each line segment is typically located in one of the large outer regions and splits that region in two.\n3.  Therefore, the crease for the first wing adds **1** new region, and the crease for the second wing adds another **1** new region. This is a total addition of **2** regions.\n    *   *Current total: 24 + 2 = 26 regions.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSumming the regions created at each step:\n*   Initial paper: 1\n*   Basic folds (diagonals and bisectors): 8 regions total\n*   Bird base folds: +12 regions (for a total of 20)\n*   Head and tail folds: +4 regions (for a total of 24)\n*   Wing folds: +2 regions (for a final total of 26)\n\nThe fold lines of a standard origami crane divide the paper into 26 distinct regions.\n\n<<<26>>>"
