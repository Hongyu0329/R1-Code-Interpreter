    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify the most probable mechanism that allows a duplicated gene to be kept (retained) in the genome and to evolve to be different from its original copy (diverge). Gene duplication creates a redundant copy of a gene. Without selective pressure to maintain it, this new copy is likely to be lost or become non-functional. The question is about the evolutionary processes that prevent this loss and instead lead to two distinct, functional genes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a genetic process where a DNA sequence in one region is replaced by the sequence from a homologous region. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies identical or very similar. Therefore, gene conversion works *against* divergence and does not explain why duplicate genes become different. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. One of the copies accumulates inactivating mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. While this involves sequence divergence, it does not result in the *retention* of a functional gene pair. It represents a loss of the duplicated gene's function. Thus, this is not a mechanism for functional retention. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the second copy, being redundant, is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may confer a completely new, beneficial function. Both genes are then retained by natural selection: one for the old function and one for the new one. This process clearly leads to both retention and divergence. It is a valid and important mechanism. However, it relies on the relatively rare occurrence of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation arising before the gene becomes a pseudogene.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the original, single-copy gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., it was active in several different tissues). After duplication, degenerative (function-losing) mutations occur in both copies, but in a complementary way. For example, copy 1 loses the ability to function in tissue A, while copy 2 loses the ability to function in tissue B. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. Both genes are retained, and they diverge as they specialize. This process is considered highly likely because it relies on the relatively common occurrence of degenerative mutations, rather than the rare occurrence of gain-of-function mutations.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for such an event, adaptive radiation is a pattern of speciation, not a molecular mechanism for retaining a specific gene. This choice operates at the wrong level of biological organization. This choice is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the strongest candidates (C and D).**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are valid and accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the **\"most likely\"** mechanism.\n\n*   **Likelihood:** Subfunctionalization is often considered more likely to be the initial driver of retention. This is because the process relies on the loss of partial function, which can be caused by common, randomly occurring degenerative mutations. In contrast, neofunctionalization requires a specific, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation to occur, which is a much rarer event. The subfunctionalization model provides a \"passive\" route to preserving the two gene copies from being lost, after which they have more evolutionary time to potentially evolve new functions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBecause subfunctionalization provides a more frequent and passive pathway for preserving duplicate genes from the immediate threat of pseudogenization, it is often argued to be the \"most likely\" or more common mechanism responsible for the large number of duplicate genes retained in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
