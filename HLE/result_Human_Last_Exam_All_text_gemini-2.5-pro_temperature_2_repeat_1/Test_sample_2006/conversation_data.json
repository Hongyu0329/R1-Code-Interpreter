    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe prompt asks for an analysis of a riddle contained within a haiku. The core components are:\n*   **The Question:** The title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a question.\n*   **The Clues:** The three lines of the haiku provide the clues to find the answer.\n*   **The Format:** The final answer should be a list of words, presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Question**\nThe title \"The Bays\" is a homophone, which means it sounds like another phrase. \"The Bays\" sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku must contain clues to identify three things that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku Clues**\n\nThe haiku has a consistent meteorological theme (\"tempest\", \"winds\"). This theme is a critical point for interpreting each line.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word \"August\" has two meanings: the eighth month of the year, or an adjective meaning majestic, respected, and impressive. In the context of a riddle, the adjectival form is a strong possibility.\n    *   **Analysis:** Interpreting \"August\" as majestic, the line describes a \"majestic tempest\". A tempest is defined by its violent winds. The **Beaufort** scale is the scientific scale used to measure and classify wind force, from calm (0) to hurricane (12). The description of a grand storm directly points to this method of classification. Thus, the first \"B\" is **Beaufort**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Twice fifteen\" literally means 30. The phrase \"winds of change\" is the key part of the clue.\n    *   **Analysis:** In meteorology, a significant indicator of changing weather (\"winds of change\") is a shift in wind direction. A wind that changes direction in a counter-clockwise manner is said to be \"backing\". A backing wind often signals the approach of a low-pressure system and stormy weather. The \"twice fifteen\" (30) can be interpreted as a 30-degree shift on a compass, a quantifiable change. Therefore, this line points to the meteorological term **Backing**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word \"divine\" has two meanings. It can mean god-like, or it can be a verb meaning \"to forecast or perceive by insight.\" The word \"yields\" means to produce or provide.\n    *   **Analysis:** Using the verb form, \"to divine\" means to forecast. An instrument that allows one to forecast weather and that \"yields\" a reading is a **barometer**. A barometer measures atmospheric pressure, and a drop in pressure yields a forecast of worsening weather. The double meaning fits perfectly: one uses a barometer to *divine* the weather, and the instrument *yields* a reading. This points to the third \"B\", **Barometer**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\nThe three \"B's\" revealed by the clues in the haiku are:\n1.  Beaufort\n2.  Backing\n3.  Barometer\n\nThe final step required by the prompt is to place these words in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Backing\n2.  Barometer\n3.  Beaufort\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<Backing, Barometer, Beaufort>>>"
