    "An analysis of the infinite product is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Decompose the general term of the product.**\nThe product in question is $P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\nThe general term is $a_n = 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}$. We can factor this term using the roots of unity. The roots of the equation $x^3 = 1$ are $1$, $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$.\nThe polynomial $1-t^3$ can be factored as $(1-t)(1-\\omega t)(1-\\omega^2 t)$. By setting $t = z/n$, we obtain the factorization of the general term:\n$$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n**Careful Point 1:** This factorization into three linear terms in $z$ is the crucial first step. It allows us to connect the problem to known product expansions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known identity, specifically for a product starting from n=1.**\nIt is generally easier to first evaluate an infinite product starting from $n=1$ and then adjust for the given starting index. Let's analyze the product $P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\nUsing the factorization from Step 1:\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n**Careful Point 2:** For the product to converge absolutely, the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left| \\frac{z^3}{n^3} \\right| = |z|^3 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$ must converge. Since the p-series with $p=3$ converges, our product is absolutely convergent for all complex $z$. This justifies rearranging the terms.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce convergence factors and use the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function.**\nWhile the overall product $P_{full}$ converges, if we try to split it as $\\left(\\prod(1-z/n)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\prod(1-\\omega z/n)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\prod(1-\\omega^2 z/n)\\right)$, each individual product diverges. We introduce convergence factors to resolve this. We can multiply the $n$-th term by $1 = e^{z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega z/n} \\cdot e^{\\omega^2 z/n}$, since the property of roots of unity gives $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, so $e^{(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)z/n} = e^0=1$.\n$$ P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n} \\right] $$\nNow, we can separate the products, as each is a standard convergent product:\n$$ P_{full} = \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)e^{z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega z/n}\\right] \\left[\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)e^{\\omega^2 z/n}\\right] $$\nWe use the Weierstrass product representation related to the Gamma function:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Applying this to our three products by setting $x=z$, $x=\\omega z$, and $x=\\omega^2 z$:\n$$ P_{full} = \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma z}}{\\Gamma(1-z)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{e^{\\gamma \\omega^2 z}}{\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)}\\right) $$\n$$ P_{full} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)}}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} = \\frac{e^0}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nThus, we find the expression for the product starting from $n=1$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n**Careful Point 3:** The use of convergence factors and the specific Gamma function product formula is a standard technique in complex analysis but requires care in its application.\n\n**Step 4: Adjust for the correct starting index of the product.**\nThe question asks for the product from $n=3$ to $\\infty$. We can find this by taking the full product from $n=1$ and dividing by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\nThe denominator is $(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)$.\n**Careful Point 4:** A common mistake is to forget to adjust for the starting index of the product.\n\n**Step 5: Final expression.**\nSubstituting the result from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4 gives the final answer:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nSubstituting $\\omega=e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $\\omega^2=e^{i4\\pi/3}$, we get the final result. The expression can also be written as:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i2\\pi/3}z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i4\\pi/3}z)} $$\n\n<<<The infinite product is given by $\\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-\\frac{z^3}{8})\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i2\\pi/3}z)\\Gamma(1-e^{i4\\pi/3}z)}$.>>>"
