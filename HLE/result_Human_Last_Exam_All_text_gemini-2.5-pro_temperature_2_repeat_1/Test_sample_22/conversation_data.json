    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population-level parameter. It quantifies the proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that can be attributed to the additive effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) being measured (typically common SNPs on a genotyping array).\n    *   Crucially, h²_SNP represents the **theoretical upper limit** or the \"ceiling\" of predictive power. It is the amount of variance that could be explained if we knew the *true* causal effect of every single SNP and used them in a perfect predictive model.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A Polygenic Score is a practical tool, an actual score calculated for an individual. It's constructed by taking an individual's genotype data and summing the alleles they carry, with each allele weighted by its estimated effect size.\n    *   These effect sizes are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of the PGS is typically measured by R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can account for in an independent validation or testing dataset.\n\n3.  **Compare the Nature of the Two Metrics:**\n    *   **h²_SNP** is a theoretical, population-level parameter representing the *total explainable variance* by a set of genetic markers. It's the \"target\" or the \"potential\".\n    *   **PGS R²** is a measure of the performance of a *specific predictor* that tries to capture that heritability. It's the \"achieved\" prediction.\n\n4.  **Identify the Key Limiting Factor: Estimation Error:**\n    *   The weights (effect sizes) used to build a PGS are derived from a GWAS with a **finite sample size**.\n    *   Because the sample size is finite, the estimated effect sizes will inevitably contain some statistical noise and will not be perfectly accurate. They are estimates, not the true values.\n    *   This \"estimation error\" means that the PGS is an imperfect representation of the true underlying genetic liability.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Relationship:**\n    *   Since the PGS is built with imperfect (noisy) weights, its ability to predict the phenotype will be degraded compared to a hypothetical perfect model using true weights.\n    *   Therefore, the variance explained by the PGS (R²_PGS) must be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable (h²_SNP).\n    *   The predictive ability of the PGS (R²_PGS) can get closer and closer to the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) as the sample size of the discovery GWAS increases (approaching infinity), but for any real-world, finite sample GWAS, the R²_PGS will be lower. The PGS is an *estimate* of the genetic component, and the accuracy of this estimate caps its predictive power below the total variance of the component it is trying to estimate.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Necessarily\":** This is a strong word. It means this relationship isn't just a common observation but a fundamental consequence of how these terms are defined. The variance explained by an *estimator* (the PGS) cannot exceed the variance of the *true quantity* it is trying to estimate (the full genetic signal captured by h²_SNP).\n*   **Testing in an Independent Sample:** This entire comparison assumes the PGS is validated in a sample that is independent of the GWAS discovery sample. If tested in the same sample, overfitting could artificially inflate the PGS R² to be higher than the h²_SNP. Standard practice avoids this.\n*   **h²_SNP vs. Total Heritability:** SNP heritability itself is lower than the total \"broad-sense\" heritability of a trait, as h²_SNP only includes additive effects of common SNPs and ignores rare variants, structural variants, and non-additive (dominance, epistasis) effects. The statement, however, correctly compares the PGS only to the relevant **SNP heritability**.\n\nThe predictive ability of the PGS is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability of the trait and the statistical power of the GWAS used to train it. The PGS R-squared will always be less than or equal to the SNP heritability. Given that any real-world GWAS has a finite sample size, the PGS R-squared will in practice be lower.\n\n<<<True>>>"
