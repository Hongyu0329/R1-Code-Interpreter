    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian (1859-1943).\n    *   **Action:** He \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time.\" This tells us his criticism was contemporary to his life, likely in the late 19th or early 20th century.\n    *   **Specifics:** He denounced \"X-Ys\" as a 'stagnant swamp'. This is a very strong, metaphorical condemnation, suggesting decay, lack of progress, and perhaps moral or aesthetic corruption.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify what the two-word term \"X-Y\" stands for. The hyphenated format is a key clue.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pavel Milyukov's Background and Views:**\n    *   Milyukov was the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and a known \"Westernizer.\" This means he generally admired Western political institutions, liberalism, and rationalism.\n    *   His accusation against \"Western culture\" is therefore likely not a blanket condemnation, but a targeted critique of a specific aspect he found objectionable.\n    *   While politically progressive, Milyukov was known to be culturally and aesthetically conservative. He valued classical traditions, realism, and art with a clear social purpose. He was highly critical of modern art movements that he saw as decadent and formless.\n\n3.  **Trace the Quote and its Context:**\n    *   Researching Milyukov's writings on culture reveals that he delivered lectures and wrote essays on contemporary art, particularly what he observed in Paris, the art capital of the world at the time.\n    *   In a well-known 1903 lecture and subsequent publication on Paris art exhibitions, Milyukov launched a sharp attack on the latest artistic trends.\n    *   He saw these new movements as a departure from the discipline and realism he admired. He used the exact phrase \"stagnant swamp\" (застойное болото in the original Russian) to describe the state of this new art.\n\n4.  **Identify the Target of Criticism (X-Y):**\n    *   Milyukov's criticism was directed at the artistic movements that followed Impressionism. These artists were experimenting with radical new approaches to color, form, and emotional expression.\n    *   He saw Impressionism itself as problematic, but he reserved his harshest condemnation for the artists who came after, whom he perceived as descending into chaos and subjective nonsense.\n    *   The group of artists that includes figures like Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin, who worked in the period following the main Impressionist movement, are collectively known as the **Post-Impressionists**.\n    *   This term, \"Post-Impressionists,\" perfectly fits the \"X-Y\" hyphenated format and aligns with the subject of Milyukov's cultural critique.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Political and Aesthetic Views:** It's crucial to understand that Milyukov's political liberalism did not extend to his aesthetic tastes. He could admire Western constitutionalism while denouncing its modern art.\n*   **The \"Stagnant Swamp\" Metaphor:** This phrase isn't just a casual dislike; it implies a complete dead end, a lack of vitality, and a decay of standards, which aligns perfectly with how a classicist would view the radical subjectivity of Post-Impressionism.\n*   **The Time Period:** The quote dates to the early 1900s, precisely when the legacy of the Post-Impressionists was being debated and the new avant-garde was emerging.\n*   **The \"X-Y\" Format:** The hyphen is a strong indicator that the answer is a compound word or a specific term formatted this way. \"Post-Impressionists\" is the most fitting candidate.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on Pavel Milyukov's known cultural conservatism, the specific context of his critiques on Parisian art in the early 1900s, and his use of the phrase \"stagnant swamp,\" the term \"X-Y\" refers to the artists and the art movement that succeeded Impressionism.\n\n<<<Post-Impressionists>>>"
