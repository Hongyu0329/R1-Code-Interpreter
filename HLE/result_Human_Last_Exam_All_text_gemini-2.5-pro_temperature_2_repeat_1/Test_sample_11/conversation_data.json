    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  **A statute:** This means a law passed by the legislature (the Knesset), not a judicial ruling or a principle from religious law.\n2.  **In the modern State of Israel:** This means the law must have been enacted or formally adopted as an Israeli statute after the state's establishment in 1948. Pre-state British Mandate or Ottoman laws only count if they were re-enacted or adopted into a new Israeli statute.\n3.  **The first:** We are looking for the earliest example chronologically.\n4.  **Explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\":** The statute's text must use the specific legal term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). A law that merely implies a duty of fairness without using the term would not qualify.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Candidates and Common Misconceptions\nA common first thought is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for making \"good faith\" a foundational and overarching principle of Israeli contract law, mandating it in both pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and in the performance of contractual obligations (Section 39). While incredibly important, its date (1973) means we must look for earlier examples.\n\nAnother set of candidates comes from the wave of original Israeli civil legislation in the late 1960s, designed to replace older laws. These include:\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 6 of this law states that certain obligations should be fulfilled \"in an acceptable manner and in good faith\" (\"בדרך מקובלת ובתום-לב\"). This predates the Contracts Law of 1973.\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law refers to a second purchaser of a property prevailing over the first if they acted \"in good faith and for consideration\" (\"בתום-לב ובתמורה\"). This is later than the Sale Law.\n\nSo far, the Sale Law of 1968 is the leading candidate from this group.\n\n### Step 3: Searching for Earlier Statutes (1948-1968)\nThe analysis must extend to the period before the major civil law reforms of the late 1960s. During its early years, the State of Israel re-enacted many British Mandate-era laws as Israeli statutes, often designated as a \"[New Version]\". We need to check if any of these early statutes contained the term \"good faith\".\n\nOne of the most important commercial laws from that era is the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance**. The British Mandate-era ordinance was re-enacted by the Knesset as the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**. We must examine its text.\n\nThe concept of a \"holder in due course\" is central to the law of negotiable instruments. Section 28(a) of the 1957 Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who has taken a bill of exchange under specific conditions, one of which is that they took it \"**in good faith** and for value\". The original Hebrew text explicitly uses the term \"**בתום-לב**\" (*be'tom-lev*).\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Candidates and Final Conclusion\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law:** Enacted in **1973**. Too late.\n*   **Sale Law:** Enacted in **1968**. Contains the term.\n*   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]:** Enacted as an Israeli statute in **1957**. Contains the term.\n\nComparing the dates, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] of 1957 clearly precedes the Sale Law of 1968. It is a statute of the modern State of Israel that explicitly uses the term \"good faith\". Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Origin vs. Enactment:** The Bills of Exchange Ordinance originated in the British Mandate period, but the question is about the first statute *in* the modern State of Israel. The 1957 [New Version] was an act of the Israeli Knesset, making it an Israeli statute.\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question's requirement for an \"explicit\" introduction is key. The statute must use the words \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\". The Bills of Exchange Ordinance does this clearly.\n*   **General vs. Specific Application:** The \"good faith\" concept in the Bills of Exchange Ordinance is specific to the \"holder in due course\" definition, whereas its use in the later Contracts Law is a broad, overriding principle. This distinction is irrelevant to the question, which only asks for the *first* introduction of the concept, not the broadest or most significant one.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
