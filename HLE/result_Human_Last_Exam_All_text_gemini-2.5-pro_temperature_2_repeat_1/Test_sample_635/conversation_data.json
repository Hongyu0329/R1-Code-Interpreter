    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix:\n\\[ H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe factorization must be in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices that are left coprime.\n\n**2. Formulate Conditions for Polynomial Matrices**\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let $D(s)$ be a general 2x2 polynomial matrix:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, the product $D(s)H(s)$ must result in a matrix with polynomial entries.\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe entries $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ are already polynomials by definition of $D(s)$.\nThe entries $n_{11}(s)$ and $n_{21}(s)$ must also be polynomials. Let's analyze the general expression for $n_{i1}(s)$:\n\\[ n_{i1}(s) = d_{i1}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{i2}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} \\]\nThe least common denominator is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. Let's rewrite the expression with this denominator:\n\\[ n_{i1}(s) = \\frac{d_{i1}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{i2}(s)}{s^2-1} \\]\nFor $n_{i1}(s)$ to be a polynomial for $i=1, 2$, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator, which means the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**3. Derive Conditions for the Elements of D(s)**\nLet's apply the zero conditions to the numerator for each row $i=1, 2$:\n*   **At s = 1:** The numerator becomes $d_{i1}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{i2}(1) = 2d_{i2}(1)$. For this to be zero, we must have $d_{i2}(1) = 0$. This implies that both $d_{12}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n*   **At s = -1:** The numerator becomes $d_{i1}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{i2}(-1) = 4d_{i1}(-1) + 2d_{i2}(-1)$. For this to be zero, we must have $4d_{i1}(-1) + 2d_{i2}(-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d_{i1}(-1) + d_{i2}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Construct the Matrix D(s)**\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial entries for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions and for which $D(s)$ is invertible (i.e., $\\det(D(s)) \\not\\equiv 0$).\n\n*   **For the first row (i=1):**\n    *   $d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    *   $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    Let's choose the simplest possible polynomials. Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$. Then the second condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{12}(-1)=-2$. Since we also need $d_{12}(1)=0$, $d_{12}(s)$ must be a polynomial that is 0 at $s=1$ and -2 at $s=-1$. The simplest such polynomial is linear: $d_{12}(s)=c(s-1)$. At $s=-1$, $d_{12}(-1)=c(-1-1)=-2c$. We require $-2c = -2$, so $c=1$. Thus, we can choose $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    First row of $D(s)$ is: $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **For the second row (i=2):**\n    *   $d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n    *   $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n    We must choose $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ to make this row linearly independent from the first row. Let's try choosing $d_{21}(s) = s$. The second condition becomes $2(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{22}(-1)=2$. Since we also need $d_{22}(1)=0$, let's try a linear polynomial $d_{22}(s)=k(s-1)$. At $s=-1$, $d_{22}(-1)=k(-1-1)=-2k$. We require $-2k=2$, so $k=-1$. Thus, we can choose $d_{22}(s)=-(s-1) = 1-s$.\n    Second row of $D(s)$ is: $[s \\quad 1-s]$.\n\nSo, our candidate matrix $D(s)$ is:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & 1-s \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nLet's check its determinant: $\\det(D(s)) = 1(1-s) - s(s-1) = 1-s - s^2+s = 1-s^2$. Since this is not identically zero, $D(s)$ is a valid choice.\n\n**5. Calculate the Matrix N(s)**\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n$n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s-1)^2+2d_{12}}{s^2-1} = \\frac{1(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{s^2-1} = 1$.\n$n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n$n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s-1)^2+2d_{22}}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s(s-1)^2 + 2(1-s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s(s-1)^2 - 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s(s-1)-2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s^2-s-2}{s+1} = \\frac{(s-2)(s+1)}{s+1} = s-2$.\n$n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = s$.\nSo, the matrix $N(s)$ is:\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n**6. Verify Left Coprimeness**\n$D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex values of $s$. The rank can only drop at the roots of $\\det(D(s)) = 1-s^2=0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\nThe composite matrix is:\n\\[ [D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s & 1-s & s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n*   **At s = 1:**\n    \\[ [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    The rows are linearly independent (for instance, the submatrix of columns 1 and 3 has determinant $1(-1) - 1(1) = -2 \\neq 0$). Thus, the rank is 2.\n*   **At s = -1:**\n    \\[ [D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -3 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    The second row is not a multiple of the first row (e.g., in column 3, $-3 \\neq -1 \\times 1$). The rows are linearly independent. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\nSince the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & 1-s \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & 1-s \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
