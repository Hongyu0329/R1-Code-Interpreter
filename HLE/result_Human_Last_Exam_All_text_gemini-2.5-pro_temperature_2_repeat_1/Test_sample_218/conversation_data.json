    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a sequence of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$. The partitions are visually represented by Young diagrams. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is denoted by $d_\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of irreps of $S_{25}$ with dimension strictly less than 500,000. This is equivalent to finding the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{ij}}$, where $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\nWe also know that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$, this pair accounts for two irreps. If $\\lambda = \\lambda'$ (a self-conjugate partition), it accounts for one irrep. We will systematically search for partitions $\\lambda$ satisfying the condition, which will give us their conjugates as well. Partitions that are \"close\" to a straight row or a straight column tend to have smaller dimensions.\n\nWe will list partitions and their calculated dimensions. We only need to check one from each pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$.\n\n1.  **Trivial and Sign Representations:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: $d_{(25)} = 1$. Conjugate $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$. $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n    These are 2 irreps.\n\n2.  **Partitions with two parts, $\\lambda=(n-k, k)$:** The dimension is given by $d_{(n-k,k)} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n    *   $\\lambda = (24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{25}{1} - \\binom{25}{0} = 25 - 1 = 24$. This and its conjugate $(2, 1^{23})$ give 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,4)$: $d_{(21,4)} = \\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,5)$: $d_{(20,5)} = \\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,7)$: $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (17,8)$: $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875 > 500,000$.\n\n3.  **Hook partitions, $\\lambda=(n-k, 1^k)$:** The dimension is given by $d_{(n-k,1^k)} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$:\n    *   $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. Dimension 24. Already counted.\n    *   $k=2: \\lambda=(23,1^2)=(23,1,1)$. $d=\\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Pair with $(3,1^{22})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=3: \\lambda=(22,1^3)$. $d=\\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. Pair with $(4,1^{21})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=4: \\lambda=(21,1^4)$. $d=\\binom{24}{4} = 10626$. Pair with $(5,1^{20})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=5: \\lambda=(20,1^5)$. $d=\\binom{24}{5} = 42504$. Pair with $(6,1^{19})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=6: \\lambda=(19,1^6)$. $d=\\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. Pair with $(7,1^{18})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=7: \\lambda=(18,1^7)$. $d=\\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. Pair with $(8,1^{17})$ gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $k=8: \\lambda=(17,1^8)$. $d=\\binom{24}{8} = 735471 > 500,000$.\n\n4.  **Other \"nearly straight\" partitions:** We continue by checking partitions with a large first part.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$. $d=4025$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,3,1)$. $d=31350$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,2)$. $d=21000$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,1,1)$. $d=330000$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,4,1)$. $d=164220$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,2)$. $d=229425$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,1,1)$. $d=150480$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,2,1)$. $d=209000$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,1,1,1)$. $d=168245$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,5,1)$. $d=316250$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,4,2)$. $d=384560$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,3,2,1)$. $d=484100$. Pair gives 2 irreps.\n\nFurther calculations show that other partitions, such as $(19,3,3)$ or $(18,6,1)$, have dimensions greater than 500,000. Any self-conjugate partition of 25 is very \"jagged\" and also has a dimension greater than 500,000.\n\n**Tally:**\n*   (25) and its conjugate (1^25): 2 irreps.\n*   (24,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (23,2) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (23,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (22,3) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (22,2,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (22,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (21,4) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (21,3,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (21,2,2) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (21,2,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (21,1,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,5) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,4,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,3,2) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,3,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,2,2,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,2,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (20,1,1,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (19,6) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (19,5,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (19,4,2) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (19,3,2,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (19,1,1,1,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (18,7) pair: 2 irreps.\n*   (18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) pair: 2 irreps.\n\nNone of these partitions are self-conjugate, so each distinct partition listed (lexicographically first in its pair) corresponds to a pair of irreps $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$.\nWe have found 26 such partitions.
