    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard, with the constraint that no two bishops can attack each other. The final question is to determine how many edge squares are left empty (lacking a bishop).\n\n**2. Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n*   An 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total.\n*   The edge squares are those in the first and last ranks (rows 1 and 8) and the first and last files (columns 'a' and 'h').\n*   Number of squares in row 1 = 8\n*   Number of squares in row 8 = 8\n*   Number of squares in column 'a' (excluding corners) = 6\n*   Number of squares in column 'h' (excluding corners) = 6\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n*   Alternatively, the board is 8x8=64 squares, and the inner part is 6x6=36 squares. So, edge squares = 64 - 36 = 28.\n\n**3. Analyze the Bishop's Movement and Constraints**\n*   A bishop moves diagonally and can attack any piece on the same diagonal.\n*   Crucially, a bishop always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack bishops on other white squares. A bishop on a black square can only attack bishops on other black squares.\n*   This property allows us to solve the problem for the two colors independently.\n\n**4. Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, half are white and half are black. So, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n*   We want to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares.\n*   Consider the white squares on the first rank: b1, d1, f1, h1. Placing bishops on all four of these squares is possible, as they are on the same row and thus on different diagonals.\n*   Now consider the white squares on the last rank: a8, c8, e8, g8.\n*   A bishop on h1 attacks along the h1-a8 diagonal. Therefore, if we place a bishop on h1, we cannot place one on a8.\n*   A simple strategy for maximization is to fill one edge completely and see what can be added. Let's place bishops on all 4 white squares of the first rank: **b1, d1, f1, h1**.\n*   Now, which of the remaining white edge squares can we place bishops on? The remaining white edge squares are: a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7, c8, e8, g8.\n*   Let's check for attacks from our placed bishops:\n    *   b1 attacks a2 and h7.\n    *   d1 attacks a4 and h5.\n    *   f1 attacks a6 and h3.\n    *   h1 attacks a8.\n*   This means we cannot place bishops on any of a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7.\n*   The only remaining white edge squares are c8, e8, g8. These are on the 8th rank and do not attack each other. Do they attack the bishops on the 1st rank? No. For example, a bishop on c8 attacks b7 and d7, not any square on the 1st rank.\n*   So, we can add bishops to **c8, e8, g8**.\n*   The maximum number of bishops on white edge squares is 4 (on row 1) + 3 (on row 8) = **7**.\n\n**5. Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\n*   The logic is identical for the 14 black edge squares due to the board's symmetry.\n*   Let's place bishops on all 4 black squares of the first rank: **a1, c1, e1, g1**.\n*   Now check which of the remaining black edge squares are attacked:\n    *   a1 attacks h8.\n    *   c1 attacks a3 and h6.\n    *   e1 attacks a5 and h4.\n    *   g1 attacks a7 and h2.\n*   The only remaining black edge squares are b8, d8, f8. We can safely place bishops here.\n*   So, we can add bishops to **b8, d8, f8**.\n*   The maximum number of bishops on black edge squares is 4 (on row 1) + 3 (on row 8) = **7**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Total number of bishops placed = Maximum on white squares + Maximum on black squares\n*   Total number of bishops placed = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Total number of bishops placed\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nTherefore, if they succeeded in placing the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares, 14 edge squares would be occupied, and 14 would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
