    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of X**\n\nThe space $X = C^{(d)}$ is the d-th symmetric power of the curve $C$. It is the space of effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$. In this problem, $C$ is a curve of genus $g=3$, and we are considering its 15th symmetric power, so $d=15$.\n\nThere is a classical result in algebraic geometry concerning the structure of symmetric powers of a curve in the \"stable range\". The stable range is defined by the condition $d \\ge 2g-1$.\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. We calculate $2g-1 = 2(3)-1 = 5$. Since $15 > 5$, we are in the stable range.\n\nIn this range, the Abel-Jacobi map $\\phi: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ gives $C^{(d)}$ the structure of a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of the curve $C$.\nThe fiber of this bundle over any point is a projective space $\\mathbb{P}^r$. The dimension $r$ is constant and can be calculated using the Riemann-Roch theorem. For any line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ of degree $d > 2g-2$, the dimension of the space of global sections is $h^0(C, \\mathcal{L}) = d-g+1$. The fiber is the projectivization of this space, so its dimension is $r = h^0(C, \\mathcal{L}) - 1 = d-g$.\nFor our case, $r = 15 - 3 = 12$.\nSo, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the Neron-Severi Rank of X to that of J(C)**\n\nThe Neron-Severi group $NS(V)$ of a projective variety $V$ is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, $\\rho(V)$, is the Picard number. For a projective bundle $p: E \\to B$ with fiber $\\mathbb{P}^r$ over a smooth projective variety $B$, the Picard group (and thus the Neron-Severi group) has a simple structure: $NS(E) \\cong NS(B) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot c_1(\\mathcal{O}_E(1))$, where $\\mathcal{O}_E(1)$ is the relative hyperplane line bundle.\nTaking the ranks, we get the formula:\n$\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nApplying this to our situation where $X=E$ and $J(C)=B$, we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Range of œÅ(J(C))**\n\n$J(C)$ is the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. It is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ satisfies the inequality $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A)$, where $h^{1,1}(A)$ is the (1,1)-Hodge number. For an abelian variety of dimension $g$, $h^{1,1}(A)=g^2$.\nFor $J(C)$, we have $g=3$, so $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\nWe need to determine if these bounds are sharp, i.e., if there exist genus 3 curves for which $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1 and for which it is 9.\n\n**Step 4: The Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nThe smallest possible rank is $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$. This occurs when the only algebraic divisor classes on $J(C)$ (up to rational multiples) are integer multiples of the principal polarization (the theta-divisor class).\nThis is the case for a \"generic\" Jacobian. More precisely, for a *very general* curve $C$ of genus $g \\ge 2$ in the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has a Neron-Severi group of rank 1. Such a Jacobian is simple and its ring of endomorphisms is just $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1.\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for $X$:\n$\\min \\rho(X) = \\min \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: The Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe largest theoretical rank is $\\rho(J(C)) = h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 9$. An abelian variety for which this equality holds is one for which every Hodge class of type (1,1) is algebraic. This typically occurs for abelian varieties with Complex Multiplication (CM). We need to show that there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ such that its Jacobian $J(C)$ has $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\n\nConsider the case where the Jacobian is not simple but is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with CM.\nA well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a smooth, non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. It is a classical result that its Jacobian, $J(C)$, is isogenous to the cube of a specific elliptic curve $E$, namely $J(C) \\sim E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (the Gaussian integers).\n\nLet's compute the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $A = E^3$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve with CM. The rank of $NS(A)$ is the same as the rank for any isogenous variety, so $\\rho(J(C)) = \\rho(E^3)$.\nFor a product of abelian varieties $A_1 \\times A_2$, the Neron-Severi rank is given by $\\rho(A_1 \\times A_2) = \\rho(A_1) + \\rho(A_2) + \\text{rank}(Hom(A_1, \\hat{A_2}))$. Since our varieties are principally polarized, we can identify $\\hat{A_i}$ with $A_i$.\nApplying this iteratively:\n$\\rho(E^2) = \\rho(E \\times E) = \\rho(E) + \\rho(E) + \\text{rank}(End(E))$.\nFor any elliptic curve, $\\rho(E) = h^{1,1}(E)=1$. Since $E$ has CM, its endomorphism ring has rank 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., $End(E) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}(i)$).\nSo, $\\rho(E^2) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4$.\n\nNow for $E^3 = E^2 \\times E$:\n$\\rho(E^3) = \\rho(E^2) + \\rho(E) + \\text{rank}(Hom(E^2, E))$.\n$Hom(E^2, E) = Hom(E \\times E, E) \\cong Hom(E,E) \\oplus Hom(E,E) = End(E) \\oplus End(E)$.\nSo, $\\text{rank}(Hom(E^2,E)) = 2 \\cdot \\text{rank}(End(E)) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nTherefore, $\\rho(E^3) = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9$.\n\nAlternatively, for an abelian variety of the form $A=B^n$ where $End_{\\mathbb{Q}}(B)$ is an imaginary quadratic field, the rank of $NS(A)$ is $n^2$. Here $n=3$, so $\\rho(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nSo, we have found a curve $C$ of genus 3 for which $\\rho(J(C))=9$. This means the maximum possible rank is achieved.\nThis gives the largest possible rank for $X$:\n$\\max \\rho(X) = \\max \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ can vary depending on the specific choice of the genus 3 curve $C$.\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, achieved for a very general curve.\nThe largest possible rank is 10, achieved for special curves like the Fermat quartic whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
