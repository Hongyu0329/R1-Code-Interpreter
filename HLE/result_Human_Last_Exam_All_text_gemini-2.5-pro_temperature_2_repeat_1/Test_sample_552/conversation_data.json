    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper:** The paper in question is Albert Einstein's 1905 publication titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This is one of the four famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers.\n\n2.  **Examine the context of Einstein's work:** The paper on Brownian motion is deeply rooted in the principles of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat. The central idea is to show that the random, observable motion of particles suspended in a fluid (Brownian motion) is a direct consequence of the thermal motion of the fluid's own invisible molecules, as predicted by the kinetic theory.\n\n3.  **Search for direct citations within the paper:** A careful review of the 1905 Brownian motion paper itself shows that it contains very few formal citations, which was not unusual for papers of that era. Einstein mentions the experimental observations of M. G. Gouy, but he does not provide a formal bibliographic citation to a specific work. He does not directly cite anyone's *lectures* within the body or footnotes of this particular paper.\n\n4.  **Widen the search to closely related work:** The question's premise might be based on a broader view of Einstein's work in 1905. In the same year, Einstein also completed his PhD dissertation, titled \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\". This thesis is fundamentally connected to the Brownian motion paper. In his thesis, Einstein derived an equation for the diffusion coefficient of suspended spherical particles, a result that was then crucially applied in the Brownian motion paper to link the motion of the particles to Avogadro's number and the size of molecules.\n\n5.  **Examine the citations in the PhD thesis:** Einstein's 1905 PhD thesis *does* contain a formal bibliography. In this bibliography, he cites the foundational work on which his own analysis is built.\n\n6.  **Identify the specific cited work and author:** In the bibliography of his thesis, Einstein cites the book **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\") by Ludwig Boltzmann.** Boltzmann was a pioneering figure in statistical mechanics, and his work provided the theoretical foundation for Einstein's statistical treatment of thermodynamics and molecular motion.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Indirect Citation:** The citation to Boltzmann's lectures is not found *in* the Brownian motion paper itself, but in the contemporaneous PhD thesis that provided the mathematical and theoretical groundwork for the paper. Given their close temporal and intellectual connection, this reference is widely considered the relevant citation for his 1905 work on the topic.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Published Book:** The cited work, \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie,\" translates to \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" It was a highly influential book published in two volumes (1896 and 1898) that compiled and presented Boltzmann's extensive work in the field. So, Einstein cited a published book whose title includes the word \"Lectures.\"\n*   **Intellectual Debt:** The citation reflects Einstein's intellectual debt to Boltzmann for establishing the principles of statistical mechanics, which Einstein then independently applied in a novel way to explain the phenomenon of Brownian motion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing Einstein's related work from 1905, we can determine that the person whose published lectures he cited was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n***\n\nIn his 1905 work on Brownian motion (specifically in his closely related PhD thesis from the same year), Albert Einstein cited the published lectures of **Ludwig Boltzmann**. The cited work was **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\")**.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
