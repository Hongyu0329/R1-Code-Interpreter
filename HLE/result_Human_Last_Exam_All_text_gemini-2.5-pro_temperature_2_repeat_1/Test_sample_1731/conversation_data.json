    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta (photons) using the framework of large deviation theory, specifically mentioning the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. Here's a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Interpretation of the Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to correctly interpret how the mentioned theorems apply to a system of bosons, which are not independent particles.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem, in its basic form, deals with the probability of the empirical measure of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. It states that this probability is governed by a rate function given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. For a system of indistinguishable and interacting particles like bosons, the theorem generalizes. The core idea remains: the probability of observing a particular macroscopic state (e.g., a certain distribution of particles over energy levels) follows a large deviation principle. The rate function in this generalized context is no longer the simple KL divergence but is given by the negative of the system's combinatorial entropy. This is the \"Boltzmann\" part of Boltzmann's principle, $P \\propto e^{S/k_B}$, framed in the language of large deviations, where the entropy $S$ is identified with the negative of the rate function.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of deviations of the sample mean of i.i.d. variables. Its underlying mechanism, often called the Gibbs conditioning principle, is to find the most probable way a rare event occurs. When we fix a macroscopic observable like the mean energy, which is a constraint on the system, this principle states that the system will overwhelmingly be found in the microscopic configuration that maximizes the probability (i.e., maximizes entropy) subject to that constraint. This leads to a constrained optimization problem.\n\nTherefore, the task is to:\n1.  Identify the entropy functional for the Bose case (as suggested by the generalized Boltzmann-Sanov theorem).\n2.  Maximize this entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy (as suggested by the Cramér-Chernoff principle) to find the equilibrium distribution of photons.\n3.  Use this equilibrium distribution to calculate the system's total mean energy and entropy.\n\n**2. Identifying the Entropy Functional for Bosons**\n\nFor indistinguishable bosons, the number of ways to distribute $n_i$ particles into $g_i$ states at energy level $\\epsilon_i$ is given by $\\Omega_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$. The total number of microstates is $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$.\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, and defining the average occupation number per state as $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$, the entropy functional becomes:\n$S[\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}] = k_B \\sum_i g_i [(\\bar{n}_i + 1)\\ln(\\bar{n}_i + 1) - \\bar{n}_i \\ln(\\bar{n}_i)]$\nThis is the correct entropy expression that serves as the negative of the rate function for the system.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe seek the distribution $\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}$ that maximizes $S$ subject to a fixed total mean energy, $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i$. For light quanta, the total number of particles is not conserved, so the chemical potential is zero, and there is no particle number constraint.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing the function:\n$L = S/k_B - \\beta(\\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i - \\langle E \\rangle)$\nSetting the partial derivative with respect to $\\bar{n}_j$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial (S/k_B)}{\\partial \\bar{n}_j} - \\beta \\frac{\\partial (\\sum_i g_i \\bar{n}_i \\epsilon_i)}{\\partial \\bar{n}_j} = 0$\n$g_j [\\ln(\\bar{n}_j+1) + 1 - \\ln \\bar{n}_j - 1] - \\beta g_j \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+1}{\\bar{n}_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\nThis gives the equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n$\\bar{n}^{eq}_j = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, and $T$ is the temperature of the system.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$**\n\nTo find the total mean energy, we sum over all energy levels. For a continuous spectrum of energies for photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, we replace the sum with an integral and use the density of states $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$.\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}^{eq}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon$\nLet $x = \\beta\\epsilon$. Then $\\epsilon = x/\\beta$ and $d\\epsilon = dx/\\beta$.\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\right)^4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1} dx$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this back with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\nThis is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy $S$**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy can be found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy functional. However, a simpler method is to use the thermodynamic relation $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - F)/T$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz free energy. For a gas with $\\mu=0$, $F$ is equal to the grand potential $\\Phi_{GC} = -k_B T \\ln Z_{GC}$.\n\n$Z_{GC} = \\prod_i (1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})^{-g_i} \\implies \\ln Z_{GC} = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n$F = -k_B T \\ln Z_{GC} = k_B T \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n$F = k_B T \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nIntegrating by parts yields the result $F = -\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle$.\nNow we can find the entropy:\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle)}{T} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Generalized LDT**: The standard Sanov's theorem for i.i.d. variables is insufficient. The Bose-Einstein statistics require a generalized rate function, which is the negative of the combinatorial entropy.\n2.  **Photon Properties**: Light quanta (photons) are bosons whose total number is not conserved, implying a chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n3.  **Density of States**: The calculation of the final values requires the correct density of states for photons in a 3D volume, including the factor of 2 for polarization.\n4.  **Integral Evaluation**: The calculations rely on a standard integral involving the Riemann zeta function, $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n5.  **Thermodynamic Relations**: Using established thermodynamic identities, like $S = (\\langle E \\rangle - F)/T$ and $F = - \\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle$ for a photon gas, significantly simplifies the derivation of entropy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are derived as functions of the system's temperature $T$ and volume $V$.\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is:\n$S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\nThese are the well-known results for black-body radiation, derived here through the lens of large deviation theory as requested.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy is $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$ and the equilibrium entropy is $S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$, where $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.>>>"
