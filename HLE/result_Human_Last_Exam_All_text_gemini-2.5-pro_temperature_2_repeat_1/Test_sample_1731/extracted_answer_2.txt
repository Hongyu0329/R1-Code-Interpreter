The equilibrium mean energy is $\langle E \rangle = \frac{8\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$ and the equilibrium entropy is $S = \frac{32\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$, where $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.
