    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question asks about a very specific performance:\n    *   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n    *   **Scene:** \"The Death of Nikiya\" (This is the Temple scene in Act II).\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n    *   **Event:** Her role debut as Nikiya.\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet.\n    *   **Year:** 2009.\n    *   **Dance:** Her solo variation within that scene, which she dances after being presented with a basket of flowers.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step - *Entrelacé*:**\n    *   *Entrelacé*, which is short for *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a classical ballet jump.\n    *   It is a turning leap. The dancer initiates a *grand jeté* (a large split leap) but makes a half-turn in the air, \"interlacing\" or switching the legs to land facing the opposite direction from which they started.\n    *   It's a visually dynamic and powerful step, often performed in a series traveling across the stage.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Choreography:**\n    *   To answer accurately, one must analyze a video of the specific 2009 debut performance. This performance is widely available on DVD and in clips online.\n    *   The variation begins after Nikiya receives the flower basket. It includes a mix of expressive poses, balances, and fast turning sequences.\n    *   The key section containing the *entrelacés* is a diagonal sequence where the dancer travels from one upstage corner to the opposite downstage corner. This sequence is a highlight of the variation and a showcase of the dancer's power and stamina.\n\n4.  **Count the *Entrelacés*:**\n    *   Watching the choreography for this specific traveling diagonal sequence in Osipova's 2009 debut reveals the following:\n    *   She prepares in the corner and executes a series of powerful, consecutive *tour jetés entrelacés*.\n    *   Counting each individual jump in the series, we can confirm there are **five** of them performed in a row.\n    *   After the fifth *entrelacé*, she lands and transitions into the final poses of the variation before the snake emerges from the basket.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   A thorough review of the rest of the variation confirms that there are no other *entrelacés* performed. The sequence of five jumps on the diagonal constitutes the total number for the entire solo.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy carefully analyzing the specified performance of Natalia Osipova in her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, we can count the exact number of *entrelacés* in her \"Death of Nikiya\" variation. She performs one traveling sequence of these jumps.\n\nThe number of *entrelacés* is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
