    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The problem asks to find the value of $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. These are the steady-state probabilities. Let's denote them by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. So, we need to find $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\n2.  **Formulate Steady-State Equations**: In the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities no longer change with time. This means that all the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero.\n    $$P_0'(\\infty) = P_1'(\\infty) = P_2'(\\infty) = P_3'(\\infty) = 0$$\n    By setting the derivatives in the given system of equations to zero, we get a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$.\n\n3.  **Substitute Rates and Set Up the System**: Substitute the given $\\lambda_{ij}$ values into the equations with derivatives set to zero:\n    *   From $P_0'(t) = 0$:\n        $$0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad 0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\quad \\text{(1)}$$\n    *   From $P_2'(t) = 0$:\n        $$0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 \\quad \\implies \\quad 0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - 0.4 \\pi_2 \\quad \\text{(2)}$$\n    *   From $P_3'(t) = 0$:\n        $$0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3 \\quad \\implies \\quad 0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\quad \\text{(3)}$$\n    *   The normalization condition must hold:\n        $$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1 \\quad \\text{(4)}$$\n    (Note: The equation for $P_1'(t)=0$ is also available, but the four equations (1)-(4) are sufficient to solve for the four unknowns.)\n\n4.  **Solve the System of Equations**: The strategy is to express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2,$ and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\n    *   From equation (3):\n        $$0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$$\n    *   From equation (2):\n        $$0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$$\n    *   Combining these, we have:\n        $$\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$$\n    *   From equation (1):\n        $$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$$\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Equation**: Substitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (4):\n    $$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1\\right) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$$\n    $$\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 + 1 + 1 \\right) = 1$$\n    $$\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$$\n\n6.  **Calculate $\\pi_1$**: First, simplify the term in the parenthesis.\n    $$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$$\n    Now substitute this back:\n    $$\\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1$$\n    $$\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Required Sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$**: The goal is to find $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n    $$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 \\right) + \\pi_1 = \\pi_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 \\right)$$\n    Simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n    $$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.669}{0.019}$$\n    Now substitute this and the value of $\\pi_1$ into the expression for the sum:\n    $$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\right) \\times \\pi_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right)$$\n    The factor of `0.019` cancels out:\n    $$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Perform the final division to get the numerical answer.\n    $$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Steady State**: Recognizing that $P_i(+\\infty)$ implies a steady-state condition where $P_i'(t)=0$ is the crucial first step.\n*   **System of Equations**: The original system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations. It's important to set this up correctly.\n*   **Linear Dependence**: The sum of the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ is zero, which means the resulting algebraic equations (for $i=0,1,2,3$) are linearly dependent. One equation is redundant. This is why the normalization condition $\\sum \\pi_i = 1$ is essential for finding a unique solution.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation**: Solving for all unknown probabilities in terms of a single one (e.g., $\\pi_1$) simplifies the process significantly and reduces the chance of error.\n*   **Numerical Precision**: It is advisable to keep expressions in fractional form as long as possible before the final calculation to avoid rounding errors and to simplify the result (e.g., the cancellation of the `0.019` term).\n*   **Final Answer**: Ensure you answer the specific question asked, which is the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$, not the individual probability values.\n\nThe final result is the numerical value of the fraction $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
