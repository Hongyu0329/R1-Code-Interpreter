6. The formula is $L = L_0 \sqrt{1+v^2}$, where $L$ is the measured length, $L_0$ is the proper length, and $v$ is the relative velocity. This represents length expansion.
7. The formula is $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}$, where $\Delta t$ is the measured time interval, $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval, and $v$ is the relative velocity. This represents time contraction.
8. The formula is $u = \frac{u' + v}{1 - u'v}$, where $u$ is the object's speed in frame S, $u'$ is its speed in frame S', and $v$ is the speed of S' relative to S.
