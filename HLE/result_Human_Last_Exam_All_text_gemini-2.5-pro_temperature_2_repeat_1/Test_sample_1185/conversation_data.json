    "To determine the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2, we need to classify the possible combinatorial structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected, projective curve with only nodal singularities (ordinary double points) and a finite automorphism group.\n\nThe analysis relies on the formula for the arithmetic genus `g` of a nodal curve:\n`g = 1 - c + n + Σ g_i`\nwhere:\n*   `c` is the number of irreducible components.\n*   `n` is the number of nodes.\n*   `g_i` is the geometric genus of the i-th component.\nFor our case, `g=2`. So, `1 + c = n + Σ g_i`.\n\nA key condition for stability is that for any subcurve `Z` of the whole curve `C`, the inequality `2*p_a(Z) - 2 + r > 0` must hold, where `p_a(Z)` is the arithmetic genus of `Z` and `r` is the number of nodes connecting `Z` to the rest of the curve `C-Z`.\nHowever, for curves of genus 2, which are all hyperelliptic, the stability condition is relaxed. A component `Z` which is a smooth rational curve (`p_a(Z)=0`) and connects to the rest of the curve at two points (`r=2`), leading to `2*p_a(Z) - 2 + r = 0`, can still be part of a stable curve if it is stabilized by the hyperelliptic involution. These components are often referred to as \"hyperelliptic bridges\" or \"semistable but not stable in the general sense\".\n\nWe classify the stable curves by the number of their irreducible components `c`.\n\n**Step 1: One Component (c=1)**\nThe curve is irreducible. The formula becomes `2 = n + g_1`.\n1.  **g₁=2, n=0:** A smooth, non-singular curve of genus 2. (Good reduction).\n2.  **g₁=1, n=1:** An irreducible elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  **g₁=0, n=2:** An irreducible rational curve with two nodes.\n\nThis gives **3** types of irreducible stable curves.\n\n**Step 2: Two Components (c=2)**\nThe formula is `3 = n + g₁ + g₂`.\n4.  **g₁=1, g₂=1:** Then `n=1`. The two elliptic curves must be joined by this single node.\n5.  **g₁=1, g₂=0:** Then `n=2`.\n    a) One component is an elliptic curve, the other is a rational curve with a node, joined at a single point. This is stable.\n    b) An elliptic curve meeting a smooth rational curve at two points. This is stabilized by the hyperelliptic involution.\n6.  **g₁=0, g₂=0:** Then `n=3`.\n    a) Two rational curves, each with one node, meeting at a single point.\n    b) Two smooth rational curves meeting at three distinct points.\n    c) A rational curve with one node meeting a smooth rational curve at two points (stabilized by hyperelliptic involution).\n\nThis gives **1 + 2 + 3 = 6** types of stable curves with two components.\n\n**Step 3: Three Components (c=3)**\nThe formula is `4 = n + g₁ + g₂ + g₃`.\n7.  The dual graph (components as vertices, nodes as edges) is a cycle of three smooth rational curves, connected by a total of 4 nodes distributed as (2,1,1) edges between the vertices. The genus is `g = h¹(graph) + Σgᵢ - c + n = 1 + 0 - 3 + 4 = 2`.\n8.  The dual graph is a chain of three components. `g = h¹(graph) + Σgᵢ - c + n = 0 + Σgᵢ - 3 + n = 2`, so `n + Σgᵢ = 5`.\n    a) A chain of three components: Elliptic -- smooth Rational -- Elliptic. The middle rational curve is a hyperelliptic bridge.\n    b) A chain: Elliptic -- smooth Rational -- nodal Rational.\n    c) A chain: nodal Rational -- smooth Rational -- nodal Rational.\n\nThis gives **1 + 3 = 4** types of stable curves with three components.\n\n**Step 4: Four Components (c=4)**\nThe formula is `5 = n + Σ g_i`. All components must be rational (`g_i=0`), so `n=5`.\n9.  A chain of four rational components: nodal Rational -- smooth Rational -- smooth Rational -- nodal Rational. The two central components are hyperelliptic bridges.\n\nThis gives **1** type of stable curve with four components.\n\n**Step 5: Five or more components**\nNo stable curves of genus 2 with five or more components exist.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSumming up the number of types from each case:\n*   c=1: 3 types\n*   c=2: 6 types\n*   c=3: 4 types\n*   c=4: 1 type\n\nTotal number of different types = 3 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 14.\n\nThis classification is standard in the literature on the moduli space of curves of genus 2.\n\n<<<14>>>"
