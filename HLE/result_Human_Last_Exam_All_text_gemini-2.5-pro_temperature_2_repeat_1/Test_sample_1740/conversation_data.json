    "To accurately determine the number of members in the human let-7 microRNA family, we need to follow a systematic approach based on established biological databases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\nFirst, we must clarify what \"members of the let-7 family\" means. In the context of microRNAs (miRNAs), a family is a group of miRNAs with highly similar sequences, particularly in the crucial \"seed region\" which dictates target recognition. A \"member\" typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence, not the gene that encodes it. It's important to distinguish between mature miRNAs and their precursor genes, as multiple genes can sometimes produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n\n**Step 2: Consult the Authoritative Source**\nThe definitive and most widely accepted repository for microRNA sequence data and annotation is **miRBase**. Any accurate count of miRNA family members should be based on the latest data from this database. \"To date\" implies using the current version of miRBase.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate the Members of the Human let-7 Family**\nBy querying miRBase for the let-7 family in humans (*Homo sapiens*, prefix \"hsa\"), we can list all recognized members. The canonical members are named with the \"let-7\" prefix followed by a letter.\n\nThe primary members are:\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Address Nuances and Special Cases (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **Point 1: The absence of let-7h:** You will notice that `let-7h` is missing from the list. While let-7h exists in other species like mice, it has not been identified in humans.\n\n*   **Point 2: Inclusion of non-\"let-7\" named members:** Due to very high sequence homology and shared function, **miR-98** is universally considered a member of the let-7 family, despite its different name. Its sequence is highly similar to other let-7 members. Therefore, it must be included in the count.\n\n*   **Point 3: Distinguishing Members from Genes:** It is crucial not to confuse the 9 unique mature miRNA members with the number of genes that produce them. In humans, these 9 members are transcribed from **12 different precursor genes** located at various positions across the genome. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three distinct genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, and `let-7a-3`). The question asks for the number of *members* (unique products), not genes.\n\n*   **Point 4: Exclusion of other related miRNAs:** Some other miRNAs, such as `miR-202`, have similar seed sequences and are sometimes discussed in relation to the let-7 family. However, based on the official classification in miRBase, `miR-202` belongs to its own separate family and is not considered a canonical member of the let-7 family. Therefore, it should not be included in the final count.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nSumming up the identified members:\n*   8 members with the \"let-7\" name (`let-7a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `i`).\n*   1 additional member (`miR-98`).\n\nTotal = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current annotation in the miRBase database, the human let-7 family consists of 9 distinct members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
