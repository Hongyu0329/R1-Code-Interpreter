    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Game Conditions\n*   **Game:** No-Limit Hold'em Cash Game.\n*   **Stack Depths:** 100 Big Blinds (BB), which is the standard depth.\n*   **Positions:** We are on the Button (BTN) and opening the pot. The blinds (SB and BB) are left to act.\n*   **Action:** We are making a standard open-raise of 2.5x the big blind.\n*   **Rake:** The game is specified as \"rake-free\". This is a crucial detail. The absence of rake increases the profitability of playing marginal hands, leading to wider opening ranges compared to a typical online or live game where rake is a factor.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Goal and Define \"Worst\"\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack you should open\". This means we are looking for the suited jack hand (JXs) that is on the absolute borderline between being a profitable open-raise and a fold.\n*   It must be a hand that *should be opened*. This means it has a long-term expected value (EV) slightly greater than zero. Hands that are clear folds (EV < 0) are not candidates.\n*   \"Worst\" refers to the hand in this category with the lowest EV. In Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play, these are the hands that are often played as a \"mixed strategy\" (i.e., opened only a percentage of the time), as their EV is very close to the EV of folding (which is zero).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Suited Jacks and the Button's Opening Strategy\nThe Button is the most powerful pre-flop position because it guarantees you will act last on all post-flop streets (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows the button to profitably open a very wide range of hands, often around 45-50% of all possible hands in a 100BB game.\n\nLet's rank the suited jack hands (from strongest to weakest):\n1.  **Premium/Very Strong:** JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs. These are obviously opened 100% of the time.\n2.  **Strong Connectors/Gappers:** J9s, J8s, J7s. These hands have excellent playability due to their flush and straight potential. They are standard opens from the button.\n3.  **Weak/Marginal:** J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. These hands have less straight potential due to the large gap between the cards. Their value comes primarily from making flushes or a pair of jacks with a very weak kicker. This is the group where we will find our answer.\n\n### Step 4: Apply GTO Principles to Find the Borderline Hand\nModern poker strategy relies on GTO solvers to construct pre-flop ranges. In a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is higher, and the pot odds are better, pushing the button's opening range even wider.\n\n*   **J5s:** This hand is generally considered a \"pure open\" from the button in nearly all GTO charts. It has some connectivity, allowing it to flop open-ended straight draws (e.g., on a 4-3-X board).\n*   **J4s:** This hand is also strong enough to be a pure open in most rake-free models. It's slightly weaker than J5s but still a profitable open.\n*   **J3s:** This hand is getting very marginal. In many GTO solutions, this becomes a mixed strategy. You should open it, but not 100% of the time.\n*   **J2s:** This is the weakest suited jack. It has the worst connectivity (it's impossible to flop an open-ended straight draw) and the lowest kicker. In GTO solutions, this hand will either be a pure fold or a mixed strategy with the lowest opening frequency of all the suited jacks. Given the rake-free condition, solvers will include J2s as a low-frequency open-raise.\n\nSince J2s has the lowest opening frequency, it means its EV is the lowest among all suited jacks that are considered part of the opening range. It is the last suited jack to be added to a GTO opening strategy. Therefore, it is the \"worst\" suited jack that you should still open (some of the time).\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
