    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A fundamental ballet movement meaning \"arched backward.\" The dancer bends the upper body backward from the waist, maintaining balance and alignment.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet method developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, epaulement (the artistic use of the head and shoulders), and a holistic approach that coordinates the entire body. It emphasizes core stability.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet method developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, musicality, athleticism, and elongated, dramatic lines. It often pushes classical technique to its extremes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principle:** Stability and control. The bend is initiated from the upper back (thoracic spine).\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova method, the pelvis is held firmly in place and pushed slightly *forward* to act as a counterbalance to the upper body bending back. The hips must remain square to the front. This stabilizes the lower back and ensures the bend is happening in the intended part of the spine, creating a long, unbroken curve.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. The arms are held in specific, controlled positions (port de bras), maintaining their classical shape and supporting the back.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principle:** Achieving a deep, dramatic line and visual effect.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the primary point of difference. In the Balanchine style, to achieve a deeper and more extreme backbend, the hip of the standing leg is allowed to release or push slightly *backward*. This creates a \"break\" at the hip, which facilitates a greater range of motion for the torso to bend back.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head is often more released, thrown back dramatically. The port de bras is typically more open and less rigidly classical, emphasizing the long line.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods based on the analysis and evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the arms (port de bras), this is not the fundamental mechanical distinction. The core difference lies in how the torso and pelvis work.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key difference. Vaganova pushes the hips forward for stability. Balanchine allows the hip to release backward for a deeper bend. This is the most significant and defining mechanical difference between the two styles for this specific step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed slowly in either method as a stretching or strengthening exercise. Speed is a general stylistic tendency, not the defining difference in the technique of this particular movement.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine method is a *result* of the difference in hip placement. The hip release *allows for* a deeper bend. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the more fundamental cause of the difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine. Any difference is stylistic and a consequence of the overall bend, not the primary distinguishing factor.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most fundamental and taught difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the action and placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
