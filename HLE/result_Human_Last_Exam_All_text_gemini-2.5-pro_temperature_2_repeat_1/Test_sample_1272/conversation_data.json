    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for a specific geographical location: the **current Vietnamese province** where the **Ming General Mu Sheng** experienced his **first major defeat**.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n*   **Identify the specific General:** We must focus on Mu Sheng (沐晟), a key Ming dynasty general, and distinguish his actions from other Ming generals active in Vietnam at the time, such as Zhang Fu (张辅), Liu Sheng (柳升), or Wang Tong (王通).\n*   **Identify the specific conflict:** Mu Sheng was involved in two major Ming campaigns in Vietnam (known as Jiaozhi/Giao Chỉ to the Ming). The first was the successful invasion of 1406-1407 which overthrew the Hồ dynasty. The second was the prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful war against the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427). A \"defeat\" points to the second conflict.\n*   **Define \"Major Defeat\":** This implies a significant battle or engagement where the army under Mu Sheng's direct command was routed or suffered a catastrophic loss, fundamentally changing the strategic situation. It is distinct from a tactical retreat or a campaign failure where he was the overall commander but not the direct field commander of the defeated force.\n*   **Determine \"First\":** We need to examine the timeline of Mu Sheng's involvement in the Lam Sơn war to see if he suffered multiple major defeats and, if so, which one came first.\n*   **Map to a \"Current Vietnamese Province\":** The historical battlefield's location must be identified on a modern map of Vietnam.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Mu Sheng's role in the Lam Sơn War:** Mu Sheng, based in Yunnan, was a high-ranking commander overseeing the Ming efforts to quell the Lam Sơn rebellion. In the early years of the war, the Ming forces largely contained the rebels to the mountainous regions, and Mu Sheng did not suffer a personal, major battlefield defeat.\n\n2.  **Eliminating other famous defeats:** The Lam Sơn War is famous for two catastrophic Ming defeats:\n    *   **Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426):** A massive Ming army was destroyed near modern-day Hanoi. However, the field commander who suffered this defeat was **Wang Tong**, not Mu Sheng.\n    *   **Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (1427):** A huge Ming relief army was ambushed and annihilated, and its commander **Liu Sheng** was killed. Again, this was not Mu Sheng's army.\n\n3.  **Identifying Mu Sheng's Defeat:** Mu Sheng was the commander of the *second* relief army in the final 1427 campaign, advancing from Yunnan while Liu Sheng advanced from Guangxi. Upon receiving news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction at Chi Lăng, Mu Sheng's army lost all morale and began to retreat.\n\n4.  **The Decisive Engagement:** As Mu Sheng's forces fled back toward Yunnan, they were pursued and attacked by Vietnamese forces commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả. Mu Sheng's army was decisively routed in a series of attacks. The most notable of these engagements occurred at **Lãnh Câu pass (隘留關)** and **Đan Xá (丹舍)**. He was forced to abandon his supplies and weaponry and flee in disarray back to Yunnan.\n\n5.  **Verifying \"First Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng had faced strategic setbacks before, this was the first instance in the war where an army under his personal command was met in the field and decisively shattered. Therefore, the rout at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in late 1427 qualifies as his first and only major defeat in this conflict.\n\n6.  **Locating the Battlefield:** The battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá took place along the army's retreat route, which followed the major river systems (the Lô River and Gâm River) leading from the Red River Delta back towards Yunnan. Historical and geographical analyses place these sites within the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the rout of Mu Sheng's army at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427 was his first and most significant personal defeat during the Lam Sơn War. These historical locations are in the region of modern Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
