    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$). A separatrix is a curve (or a set of curves) in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points are points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n    From the second equation, $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibria: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: u = 0**\n        Substitute $u=0$ into the first equation set to zero:\n        $2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n        This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: u = 1**\n        Substitute $u=1$ into the first equation set to zero:\n        $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n        This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n        This gives two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n3.  **Classify the Equilibrium Points:**\n    We determine the stability of these points by linearizing the system, which involves calculating the Jacobian matrix $J(d,u)$.\n    Let $F(d, u) = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$ and $G(d, u) = u^3 - u^2$.\n    The Jacobian is $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    *   **At (0, 1):**\n        $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0)-3(1)+5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(0)-3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2-2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n    *   **At (-1, 1):**\n        $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1)-3(1)+5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(-1)-3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2-2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one is positive and one is negative, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n    *   **At (0, 0):**\n        $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Identify the Separatrices:**\n    The separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n    *   The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -2$. Its eigenvector is $(1,0)^T$. This implies the stable separatrix is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the point $(-1,1)$.\n    *   The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Its eigenvector is $(2,-1)^T$. The unstable separatrix leaves the saddle point in this direction.\n\n5.  **Find an Equation for a Separatrix:**\n    We search for an invariant curve, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. A common method is to test simple functional forms $d=f(u)$. Let's test the candidate curve $d=-u^2$.\n    *   This curve passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n        If $u=0$, $d = -0^2=0$, so it passes through (0, 0).\n        If $u=1$, $d = -1^2=-1$, so it passes through (-1, 1), the saddle point.\n    *   Let's verify if $d=-u^2$ is a solution to the system. This means that if a point $(d(t), u(t))$ is on the curve, its velocity vector $(d'(t), u'(t))$ must be tangent to the curve at that point. We can check this by substituting $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation.\n        From $d=-u^2$, we have $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'$.\n        Substitute $u' = (u-1)u^2$:\n        $d' = -2u((u-1)u^2) = -2u^4+2u^3$.\n        Now, let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first given ODE:\n        $2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3+u^4$\n        $= 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - u^3 + u^4$\n        $= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    *   The results match. Thus, $d' = -2u^4+2u^3$ is satisfied for any point on the curve $d=-u^2$. This means the curve $d=-u^2$ is an invariant manifold.\n\n6.  **Conclude which Separatrix it is:**\n    An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. To determine which, we check the tangent direction at the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n    The curve is given by $\\vec{r}(u) = (-u^2, u)$. The tangent vector is $\\vec{r}'(u) = (-2u, 1)$.\n    At the saddle point, $u=1$, the tangent is $(-2, 1)$.\n    The eigenvector for the unstable manifold was found to be $(2, -1)^T$. The vector $(-2,1)$ is just a scalar multiple (by -1) of this eigenvector, so they define the same direction.\n    Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It divides the phase plane into regions of different dynamic behavior. Trajectories on one side of this curve will have a different fate than trajectories on the other side. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is the separatrix.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
