    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is also in this group but is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally, so it is not considered.\n\n2.  **Understand the Metric:** The question asks for the rarest gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" For gases, the most significant reservoir is the Earth's atmosphere, and its composition is a standard measure of abundance. While some gases are trapped in the crust, their atmospheric concentrations provide a clear ranking of rarity. The timeframe of \"2002\" is not a significant factor, as the natural abundances of these elements are stable over human history.\n\n3.  **Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases:** First, let's examine the non-radioactive (stable) noble gases. Their concentrations in Earth's atmosphere are the primary indicator of their abundance.\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** The next most abundant, at approximately 0.0018% or 18 parts per million (ppm).\n    *   **Helium (He):** Present at about 0.00052% or 5.2 ppm.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Present at about 0.00011% or 1.1 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable noble gases, with a concentration of only about 0.000009% or 0.09 ppm.\n\n4.  **Consider the Radioactive Noble Gas, Radon (Rn):** This is a critical point. Radon is fundamentally different from the others.\n    *   **Origin:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. It is constantly being formed by the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium found in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Half-life:** Radon itself is radioactive and decays quickly. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   **Resulting Abundance:** Because it decays so rapidly, it never accumulates to any significant amount. Its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low and variable, estimated to be around 1 part per sextillion (1 in 10^21). This is many billions of times rarer than Xenon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, Radon is far rarer overall. The question asks for the rarest noble gas without qualification. Because Radon's existence is fleeting and its concentration at any given moment is minuscule compared to all other noble gases, it is the correct answer.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Stable vs. Unstable:** It is crucial to distinguish between the stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive one (Rn). The question does not specify \"stable,\" so all naturally occurring candidates must be considered.\n*   **Source of Abundance:** Radon's constant production is balanced by its rapid decay, leading to an extremely low \"steady-state\" concentration, which represents its actual abundance at any point in time.\n*   **Synthetic Elements:** Man-made elements like Oganesson are not part of \"all terrestrial matter\" in a natural sense and are thus excluded.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation: By comparing the minuscule, transient concentration of radioactive Radon to the low but stable concentration of Xenon, it is clear that Radon is orders of magnitude rarer in Earth's matter at any given moment.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
