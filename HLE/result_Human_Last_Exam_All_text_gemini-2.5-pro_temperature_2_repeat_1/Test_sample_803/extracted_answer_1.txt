The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the generalized dihedral groups $Dih(Q)$, where $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$. These are groups of the form $G = Q \rtimes C_2$, where the non-identity element of $C_2$ acts on every element of $Q$ by inversion.
