    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and a natural number $m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n1.  **Product-free set**: A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for all $x, y \\in S$, their product $xy$ is not in $S$. This also implies $x^2 \\notin S$.\n2.  **Maximal product-free set**: A product-free set $S$ is maximal if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n3.  **Filled Group**: A group $G$ is called filled if every maximal product-free set $S$ in $G$ is a generating set for $G$ (i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$).\n4.  **The group structure**: The group $G$ has order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. By Sylow's theorems, $G$ must have a unique, and therefore normal, Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$. Thus, $G$ is a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes P$, where $|Q|=q^m$ and $P \\cong C_2$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup. Since $G$ is nonabelian, the semidirect product must not be a direct product with $Q$ abelian, i.e., either $Q$ is nonabelian or the action of $C_2$ on $Q$ is non-trivial.\n\n### Step 2: Use a known characterization of filled groups\nA crucial theorem by G. L. Walls (2009) provides a more tractable criterion for a group to be filled:\n**Theorem:** A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if for every proper subgroup $H$ of $G$, there exists an element $x \\in G \\setminus H$ such that $x^2 \\in H$.\nWe only need to check this condition for all maximal subgroups $H$ of $G$, because any proper subgroup is contained within a maximal one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the maximal subgroups of $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$\nLet the generator of $C_2$ be denoted by $a$. Let the action of $a$ on an element $y \\in Q$ be denoted by $\\phi_a(y) = aya^{-1}$.\n\nThe maximal subgroups of $G$ are of two types:\n1.  The normal subgroup $Q$. Since $[G:Q]=2$ (a prime), $Q$ is a maximal subgroup.\n2.  Maximal subgroups that do not contain $Q$.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the criterion to the maximal subgroup Q\nLet $H = Q$. We must find an element $x \\in G \\setminus Q$ such that $x^2 \\in Q$.\nAny element $x \\in G \\setminus Q$ can be written as $x = ya$ for some $y \\in Q$.\nThen $x^2 = (ya)^2 = y(aya^{-1}) = y\\phi_a(y)$.\nSince $y \\in Q$ and $\\phi_a(y) \\in Q$ (because $Q$ is normal), their product $y\\phi_a(y)$ is in $Q$.\nSo for any $x \\in G \\setminus Q$, we have $x^2 \\in Q$. The condition holds for the maximal subgroup $Q$ regardless of the structure of $Q$ or the nature of the semidirect product.\n\n### Step 5: Exclude direct products\nConsider the case where $G = Q \\times C_2$. Since $G$ is nonabelian, $Q$ must be a nonabelian group of order $q^m$. For $Q$ to be nonabelian, we must have $m \\geq 3$ (since groups of order $p^2$ are abelian).\nLet $M_Q$ be a maximal subgroup of $Q$. Since $Q$ is a $q$-group, $M_Q$ is normal in $Q$ and $|Q:M_Q|=q$.\nConsider the subgroup $H = M_Q \\times C_2$. Since $[G:H] = [Q \\times C_2 : M_Q \\times C_2] = [Q:M_Q]=q$, $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$.\nAccording to the criterion, there must be an element $x \\in G \\setminus H$ with $x^2 \\in H$.\nAn element $x \\in G \\setminus H$ is of the form $(y, c)$, where $y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$ and $c \\in C_2$.\nThen $x^2 = (y^2, c^2)$. For $x^2 \\in H = M_Q \\times C_2$, we need $y^2 \\in M_Q$.\nSo, there must exist a $y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$ such that $y^2 \\in M_Q$.\nConsider the quotient group $Q/M_Q \\cong C_q$. For an element $y \\notin M_Q$, its image $\\bar{y}$ in $Q/M_Q$ is non-trivial. The condition $y^2 \\in M_Q$ translates to $\\bar{y}^2 = \\bar{e}$ in $Q/M_Q$.\nHowever, $Q/M_Q$ is a group of odd order $q$. No non-identity element can have order 2. Therefore, for any $y \\notin M_Q$, $y^2 \\notin M_Q$.\nThis means the condition fails for the maximal subgroup $H=M_Q \\times C_2$. Thus, no group of the form $G = Q \\times C_2$ can be a filled group.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze non-trivial semidirect products\nThe semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes_\\phi C_2$ must be non-trivial. Let $\\phi_a$ be the automorphism of $Q$ defining the action.\nThere always exists a maximal subgroup $M_Q$ of $Q$ that is invariant under $\\phi_a$ (i.e., $\\phi_a(M_Q)=M_Q$).\nFor such an $M_Q$, the set $H = M_Q \\rtimes C_2$ is a subgroup of $G$. Since $[G:H] = [Q:M_Q]=q$, $H$ is a maximal subgroup.\nLet's apply the criterion to this subgroup $H$. There must be an $x \\in G \\setminus H$ with $x^2 \\in H$.\nElements of $G \\setminus H$ are of the form $y$ (where $y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$) or $ya$ (where $y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$).\n-   If we take $x=y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$, we need $x^2 \\in H$. Since $x^2 \\in Q$, this implies $x^2 \\in H \\cap Q = M_Q$. As shown in Step 5, this is impossible.\n-   So we must take $x=ya$ for some $y \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$. We need $x^2 = y\\phi_a(y) \\in H$. Since $x^2 \\in Q$, we need $y\\phi_a(y) \\in M_Q$.\n\nThis condition must hold for every $\\phi_a$-invariant maximal subgroup $M_Q$. Let's analyze the condition in the quotient group $Q/M_Q \\cong C_q$. Let $\\bar{y}$ be the image of $y$ and $\\bar{\\phi_a}$ be the induced automorphism on $Q/M_Q$. The condition is that for some $\\bar{y} \\neq \\bar{e}$, we have $\\bar{y}\\bar{\\phi_a}(\\bar{y}) = \\bar{e}$. The automorphism $\\bar{\\phi_a}$ must be of the form $\\bar{z} \\mapsto \\bar{z}^k$ for some $k \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^*$. So $\\bar{y}^{1+k} = \\bar{e}$. Since $\\bar{y}$ has order $q$, we need $q \\mid (1+k)$. As $1 \\leq k \\leq q-1$, we must have $k+1=q$, which means $k=q-1$. Thus, $\\bar{\\phi_a}$ must be the inversion automorphism ($\\bar{z} \\mapsto \\bar{z}^{-1}$) on $Q/M_Q$.\n\nThis must hold for any invariant maximal subgroup $M_Q$. This implies that the automorphism induced by $\\phi_a$ on the vector space $Q/\\Phi(Q)$ (where $\\Phi(Q)$ is the Frattini subgroup of $Q$) must be inversion.\nBy a known theorem of group theory, for a $q$-group $Q$ with $q$ odd, if an automorphism of order 2 acts as inversion on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$, then $Q$ must be abelian.\nFurthermore, for an abelian $q$-group ($q$ odd), if an automorphism $\\alpha$ acts as inversion on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$, then $\\alpha$ must be the inversion map on all of $Q$.\nThus, we must have $\\phi_a(y)=y^{-1}$ for all $y \\in Q$.\n\nThis constrains the structure of $G$ to be $G \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2$ where $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$ and the action is inversion. These groups are known as **generalized dihedral groups**, denoted $Dih(Q)$.\n\n### Step 7: Verify that generalized dihedral groups are filled\nLet $G = Dih(Q)$, where $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$, $q$ odd. $G$ is nonabelian because $q^m > 1$. Let's verify it is filled by checking all maximal subgroups $H$.\n1.  **H = Q**: Checked in Step 4. Condition holds as $(ya)^2=y(y^{-1})=e \\in Q$.\n2.  **Maximal subgroups not containing Q**: Such a subgroup $H$ is of the form $M \\rtimes \\langle a \\rangle$ where $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $Q$, or it is a subgroup of order 2, like $\\langle ya \\rangle$.\n    a. **$H = M_Q \\rtimes \\langle a \\rangle$**, where $M_Q$ is a maximal subgroup of $Q$. Let's pick $x=y'a$ for some $y' \\in Q \\setminus M_Q$. Then $x \\notin H$. And $x^2 = (y'a)^2 = y'(y')^{-1} = e$. Since $e \\in H$, the condition holds.\n    b. **$H = \\langle ya \\rangle$ for some $y \\in Q$**. Every element in the coset $Qa$ has order 2. So $\\langle ya \\rangle$ is a group of order 2. One can show that for any $y \\in Q$, its normalizer is $N_G(\\langle ya \\rangle)=\\langle ya \\rangle$. Since $G$ is solvable, this implies $\\langle ya \\rangle$ is a maximal subgroup. Let's check the condition for $H=\\langle ya \\rangle$. Pick another element of order 2, for example $x=a$ (if $y \\neq e$). Then $x \\notin H$. And $x^2 = a^2=e$. Since $e \\in H$, the condition holds.\n\nSince the condition holds for all types of maximal subgroups, this family of groups is indeed filled.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the groups $G$ that are isomorphic to a semidirect product $Q \\rtimes C_2$, where:\n-   $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$.\n-   The non-trivial element of $C_2$ acts on $Q$ by inversion, i.e., for all $g \\in Q$, $aga^{-1}=g^{-1}$, where $a$ is the generator of $C_2$.\n\nThese groups are the generalized dihedral groups over the abelian group $Q$.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the generalized dihedral groups $Dih(Q)$, where $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$. These are groups of the form $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$, where the non-identity element of $C_2$ acts on every element of $Q$ by inversion.>>>"
