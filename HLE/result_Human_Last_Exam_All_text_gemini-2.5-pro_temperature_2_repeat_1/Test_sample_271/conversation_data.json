    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nIn the first parenthesis, we can factor by grouping again:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2 - 2) - 9(x^2 - 2) = (x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2)$\nSo, we can rewrite $f(x)$ as:\n$f(x) = x(x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow we can factor out the term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x(x^4 - 9) + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor**\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor $h(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we first check for irreducibility. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n1. The prime 3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n2. The prime 3 divides all other coefficients: -9 and 3.\n3. The square of the prime, $3^2=9$, does not divide the constant term 3.\nTherefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $g(x)$ is irreducible of prime degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\nTo determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\n$g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n$g(x_0) = x_0(x_0^4 - 9) + 3 = x_0(9/5 - 9) + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}x_0$. Since $x_0 \\approx \\sqrt[4]{1.8} \\approx 1.16$, $g(x_0) \\approx 3 - 7.2(1.16) < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n$g(-x_0) = -x_0(9/5 - 9) + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}x_0 > 0$. This is a local maximum.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots.\nA theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots in $\\mathbb{C}$, then its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\nHere $p=5$, so $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors, $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] / [K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\n$K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. $K_g$ is the splitting field of an $S_5$-polynomial. The only proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_5$ is $A_5$. This corresponds to a unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g})$, where $D_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^n+ax+b$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D_g = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049)) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nSo the quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, their intersection is just $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| \\cdot |\\mathbb{Z}_2| = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all normal intermediate extensions and their degrees**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ where $G_1=S_5$ and $G_2=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are of two types:\n1.  Products of normal subgroups: $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are $\\{e\\}, \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    This gives the following proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$:\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=60$. $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2|=120$. $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$: $|H_3|=2$. $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$: $|H_4|=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n2.  \"Diagonal\" subgroups arising from isomorphisms between quotient groups.\n    The quotient groups of $S_5$ by its normal subgroups are $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$, $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $S_5/S_5 \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n    The quotient groups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are $\\mathbb{Z}_2/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\\mathbb{Z}_2/\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong \\{e\\}$.\n    The only non-trivial isomorphism is between $S_5/A_5$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2/\\{e\\}$. Let $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ be this isomorphism. It maps even permutations to the identity and odd permutations to the non-identity element. This corresponds to the sign homomorphism, sgn.\n    This gives one more normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(s, \\text{sgn}(s)) | s \\in S_5\\}$. $|H_5|=120$. $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\nThe degrees of the normal intermediate fields $L$ correspond to the indices $[G:H]$ we calculated.\nThe possible indices are:\n*   From $H_1$: degree 4. (This is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g}, \\sqrt{2})$)\n*   From $H_2$: degree 2. (This is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$)\n*   From $H_3$: degree 120. (This is the field $K_g$)\n*   From $H_4$: degree 2. (This is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D_g})$)\n*   From $H_5$: degree 2. (This is the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D_g})$)\n\nThese subgroups are all proper and non-trivial, so the corresponding fields $L$ satisfy $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nThe set of possible values for the degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the set of these calculated index values.\nCombining the results, the possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
