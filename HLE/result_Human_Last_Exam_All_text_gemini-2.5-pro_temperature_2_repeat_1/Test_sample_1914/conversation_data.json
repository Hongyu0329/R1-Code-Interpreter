    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Define the basic structure**\n\nLet the two objects be `A` and `B`. A category requires an identity morphism for each object.\n*   `id_A ∈ Hom(A, A)`\n*   `id_B ∈ Hom(B, B)`\n\nWe are given a total of 4 morphisms. Since `id_A` and `id_B` must exist, we have 2 additional morphisms to distribute among the four `Hom`-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n\nLet `n_AA`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n_BB` be the number of morphisms in `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)` respectively. We have the following conditions:\n*   `n_AA ≥ 1`\n*   `n_BB ≥ 1`\n*   `n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4`\n\nLet the two extra morphisms (other than identities) be `f` and `g`. We analyze the possible distributions of `f` and `g`.\n\n**Step 2: Case-by-case analysis based on the distribution of morphisms**\n\nWe will categorize the problem based on where the two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` are located.\n\n**Case 1: Both extra morphisms are endomorphisms.**\n\n*   **Subcase 1.1: Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A, A)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 3`, `n_BB = 1`, `n_AB = 0`, `n_BA = 0`. The category is a disjoint union of two categories: one with object `B` and just `id_B`, and one with object `A` and `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}`. The structure of `Hom(A,A)` with composition forms a monoid of order 3. It is a known result that there are **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each defines a unique category structure.\n    *(The symmetric case, with `f,g` in `Hom(B,B)`, i.e., `n_AA=1, n_BB=3`, is isomorphic by simply relabeling `A` and `B`)*.\n    *   **Contribution: 5 categories.**\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: `f` is in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` is in `Hom(B, B)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 2`, `n_BB = 2`, `n_AB = 0`, `n_BA = 0`. The category is a disjoint union of a 2-morphism monoid on `A` and a 2-morphism monoid on `B`.\n    There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n    1.  The group `Z_2` (`f ∘ f = id_A`).\n    2.  The idempotent monoid (`f ∘ f = f`).\n    Let's call them `C(Z_2)` and `C(Idem)`. We can combine them:\n    *   `C(Z_2)` on `A` and `C(Z_2)` on `B`.\n    *   `C(Idem)` on `A` and `C(Idem)` on `B`.\n    *   `C(Z_2)` on `A` and `C(Idem)` on `B`. (The case `C(Idem)` on `A` and `C(Z_2)` on `B` is isomorphic).\n    *   **Contribution: 3 categories.**\n\n**Case 2: Both extra morphisms are between `A` and `B`.**\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A, B)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 1`, `n_BB = 1`, `n_AB = 2`, `n_BA = 0`. There are no non-identity morphisms that can be composed. For instance, `f: A -> B` and `g: A -> B`. The domain of `f` (`A`) is not the codomain of `g` (`B`). Associativity is trivially satisfied as no compositions of length 2 (of non-identity morphisms) exist. The identities of `f` and `g` are interchangeable. Thus, there is only one such category structure.\n    *(The symmetric case `f,g` in `Hom(B,A)` is isomorphic)*.\n    *   **Contribution: 1 category.**\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: `f` is in `Hom(A, B)` and `g` is in `Hom(B, A)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 1`, `n_BB = 1`, `n_AB = 1`, `n_BA = 1`. Here, composition is possible.\n    *   `g ∘ f : A -> A`. The result must be in `Hom(A,A) = {id_A}`. So, `g ∘ f = id_A`.\n    *   `f ∘ g : B -> B`. The result must be in `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`. So, `f ∘ g = id_B`.\n    The composition laws are forced. This structure describes an isomorphism between objects `A` and `B`. This is a unique structure known as the \"walking isomorphism\".\n    *   **Contribution: 1 category.**\n\n**Case 3: One extra morphism is an endomorphism, the other is between `A` and `B`.**\n\n*   **Subcase 3.1: `f` in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` in `Hom(A, B)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 2`, `n_BB = 1`, `n_AB = 1`, `n_BA = 0`.\n    *   The structure on `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}` must be one of the two monoids of order 2: `f ∘ f = id_A` or `f ∘ f = f`.\n    *   We must define the composition `g ∘ f : A -> B`. The result must be in `Hom(A,B) = {g}`. Thus, the composition is forced: `g ∘ f = g`.\n    *   Associativity `(g ∘ f) ∘ f = g ∘ (f ∘ f)` must hold. The LHS is `g ∘ f = g`. So we need `g = g ∘ (f ∘ f)`. This holds for both `f ∘ f = id_A` (`g ∘ id_A = g`) and `f ∘ f = f` (`g ∘ f = g`).\n    *   So, we have two distinct categories, depending on the monoid structure on `A`.\n    *   **Contribution: 2 categories.**\n\n*   **Subcase 3.2: `f` in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` in `Hom(B, A)`.**\n    This means `n_AA = 2`, `n_BB = 1`, `n_AB = 0`, `n_BA = 1`.\n    *   Again, `f ∘ f` can be `id_A` or `f`.\n    *   The composition `f ∘ g : B -> A` must be in `Hom(B,A) = {g}`. Thus, `f ∘ g = g`.\n    *   Associativity `f ∘ (f ∘ g) = (f ∘ f) ∘ g` must hold. The LHS is `f ∘ g = g`. So we need `g = (f ∘ f) ∘ g`. This holds for both `f ∘ f = id_A` (`id_A ∘ g = g`) and `f ∘ f = f` (`f ∘ g = g`).\n    *   This gives two more categories. These are not isomorphic to those in Subcase 3.1 (an isomorphism cannot map the non-empty `Hom(A,B)` from 3.1 to the empty `Hom(A,B)` in 3.2, and swapping objects fails due to `Hom(A,A)` having 2 elements while `Hom(B,B)` has 1).\n    *   **Contribution: 2 categories.**\n\n*   **Subcase 3.3 and 3.4 (Symmetric cases):** The cases where the endomorphism `f` is on `B` (`n_BB=2`) are isomorphic to the cases above by swapping the labels of `A` and `B`. For instance, `{f: B->B, g: A->B}` (`n_BB=2, n_AB=1`) is isomorphic to Subcase 3.2 (`n_AA=2, n_BA=1`). Therefore, they do not contribute new categories.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the results**\n\nWe sum the number of non-isomorphic categories from each unique case:\n*   Case 1.1: 5 categories\n*   Case 1.2: 3 categories\n*   Case 2.1: 1 category\n*   Case 2.2: 1 category\n*   Case 3.1: 2 categories\n*   Case 3.2: 2 categories\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
