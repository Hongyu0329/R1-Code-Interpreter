    "An analysis of the question about the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on a face is performed step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup and identify key physical and geometric principles.**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. A key property of the icosahedron is that it has a center of symmetry.\n*   **Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base of the tank. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is another triangular face on the exact opposite side that is parallel to the base, forming the top of the tank.\n*   **Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **Water Surface:** In a static state under uniform gravity, the free surface of a liquid forms a horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the position and orientation of the water's surface plane.**\n*   Because the icosahedron is a centrally symmetric solid, any plane passing through its geometric center divides the solid into two parts of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water occupies half the volume.\n*   Combining these facts, the surface of the water must be a plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n*   As established in Step 1, the water surface is also horizontal.\n*   Therefore, the shape of the water surface is defined by the cross-section created by a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the symmetry of the resulting cross-section.**\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron rests on a face, the vertical line passing through the center of the bottom face and the center of the top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the icosahedron by 120° (or 240°) around this axis leaves the icosahedron unchanged. Since the cutting plane (the water surface) is horizontal, it is perpendicular to this axis and is also unchanged by this rotation. Consequently, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also possess 3-fold rotational symmetry. This implies the polygon must have a number of sides that is a multiple of 3 (e.g., 3, 6, 9, ...).\n*   **Point Symmetry:** The cutting plane passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. This means the resulting cross-section must also be centrally symmetric. A polygon with a center of symmetry must have an even number of sides, and its opposite sides must be parallel and equal in length.\n*   **Combining Symmetries:** The number of sides of the polygon must be both a multiple of 3 and an even number. The smallest integer that satisfies both conditions is 6. Thus, the shape of the water surface is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the hexagon is regular.**\n*   A hexagon that has 3-fold rotational symmetry and a center of symmetry must be equiangular (all internal angles are 120°), but its side lengths could potentially alternate between two different lengths (a, b, a, b, a, b).\n*   To determine if the sides are all equal, we must consider another symmetry of the icosahedron: reflectional symmetry. An icosahedron has 15 planes of symmetry. Each of these planes passes through the center of the icosahedron and a pair of opposite edges.\n*   We can find such a plane of symmetry that also passes through a pair of opposite vertices of our hexagonal cross-section.\n*   When the hexagon is reflected across this plane, it must map onto itself. This geometric constraint forces the two sides adjacent to a vertex on the plane of reflection to be equal in length.\n*   Because we can apply this argument to vertices all around the hexagon (by using the 3-fold rotational symmetry), it proves that all side lengths must be equal.\n*   A hexagon that is both equiangular and equilateral is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces is half-filled with water, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The resulting cross-section, and thus the shape of the water surface, is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
