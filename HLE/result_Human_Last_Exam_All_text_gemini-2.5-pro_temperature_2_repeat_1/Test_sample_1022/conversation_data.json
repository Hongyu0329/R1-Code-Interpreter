    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the problem**\n\n*   **Thompson's Group T:** This is the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle $S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ whose breakpoints are dyadic rational numbers and whose slopes are integer powers of 2.\n*   **Bounded Cohomology:** This is a variant of group cohomology defined using bounded cochains instead of all cochains. We are interested in $H_b^n(G, \\mathbb{R})$, the bounded cohomology of a group $G$ with trivial real coefficients.\n*   **Direct Product $T \\times T$:** We are considering the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself. The cohomology of a direct product is related to the cohomology of its factors via a K端nneth-type formula.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T**\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is well-understood. The key results, established by mathematicians like Thurston, Ghys, and Sergiescu, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Degree 0:** For any non-empty group $G$, $H^0(G, \\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$, which is one-dimensional. The same holds for bounded cohomology:\n    $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n2.  **Degree 1:** The first bounded cohomology group with real coefficients is isomorphic to the space of homomorphisms from the group to $\\mathbb{R}$: $H_b^1(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(G, \\mathbb{R})$. Thompson's group T is a simple group, which implies it is perfect (i.e., $T = [T, T]$, its commutator subgroup is T itself). For a perfect group, any homomorphism to an abelian group (like $\\mathbb{R}$) must be trivial. Therefore:\n    $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n3.  **Degree 2:** There is a natural action of T on the circle $S^1$. This action gives rise to a characteristic class called the Euler class. A major result by Ghys and Sergiescu shows that this Euler class is a non-zero **bounded** cohomology class. Furthermore, it spans the entire second bounded cohomology group. So:\n    $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n4.  **Degree $\\ge 3$:** Higher characteristic classes for groups of piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle (like the Godbillon-Vey class in degree 3) are known to vanish. This implies that the higher bounded cohomology groups of T are trivial:\n    $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 3$.\n\n**Summary of $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$:**\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 3$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**\n\nTo compute the bounded cohomology of a direct product, we use the K端nneth formula. For bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients, a powerful result by M. Bucher and N. Monod states that for any two countable groups $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$, there is a natural isomorphism:\n$$ H_b^n(\\Gamma_1 \\times \\Gamma_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(\\Gamma_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\widehat{\\otimes} H_b^q(\\Gamma_2, \\mathbb{R}) $$\nwhere $\\widehat{\\otimes}$ denotes the completed projective tensor product of Banach spaces.\n\nThompson's group T is countable. Since all the cohomology groups $H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces, the completed projective tensor product is the same as the standard algebraic tensor product $\\otimes$. Thus, for dimensions, we have a simple formula:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the dimension for degree 4**\n\nWe need to compute $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. Using the formula from Step 3 with $n=4$:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\nWe list the terms for all pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$:\n*   **p=0, q=4:** $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   **p=1, q=3:** $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   **p=2, q=2:** $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   **p=3, q=1:** $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   **p=4, q=0:** $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n\nSumming these values gives the total dimension:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 $$\n\nThe single generator for this group is the image of the tensor product of the generators of $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$. If $e_T$ is the generator of $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$, the generator of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$ corresponds to $e_T \\otimes e_T$ under the K端nneth isomorphism.\n\nThe final answer is the computed dimension.\n<<<1>>>"
