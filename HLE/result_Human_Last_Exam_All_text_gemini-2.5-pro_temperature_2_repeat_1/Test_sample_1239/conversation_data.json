    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the governing equations\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by the following system of partial differential equations:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We are looking for the dimension of the Lie group of transformations of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that leave the solution set of these equations invariant.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Galilean Symmetries\nThese equations describe fluid motion in a classical mechanics framework, so we expect them to be invariant under Galilean transformations.\n\n*   **Time translations:** $t' = t + s_1$. The equations do not explicitly depend on the origin of time. This gives **1 dimension**.\n*   **Space translations:** $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{s_2}$. The equations are invariant under a shift of the spatial origin. Since $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, this gives **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Space rotations:** $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R$ is a constant rotation matrix ($R \\in SO(3)$). Velocity and the gradient are vectors, pressure is a scalar, and the differential operators are isotropic. The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, has $\\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3$ dimensions. This gives **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u}'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) + \\mathbf{v}_0$, and $p'(\\mathbf{x}',t') = p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$. The equations are invariant under a transformation to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. The choice of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ provides **3 dimensions**.\n\nSumming these up, the Galilean group of symmetries provides $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ dimensions.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Scaling Symmetries\nLet's test for scaling symmetries of the form:\n$t' = a^{\\alpha} t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = a^{\\beta} \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = a^{\\gamma} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = a^{\\delta} p$.\n\nBy transforming the derivatives and substituting into the Navier-Stokes equations, we enforce invariance for any scaling factor $a$. This yields a set of linear equations for the exponents:\n*   From comparing the time derivative term with the advection term: $\\alpha - \\gamma = \\beta - 2\\gamma \\implies \\alpha + \\gamma - \\beta = 0$.\n*   From comparing the time derivative term with the viscosity term: $\\alpha - \\gamma = 2\\beta - \\gamma \\implies \\alpha = 2\\beta$.\n*   From comparing the advection term with the pressure term: $\\beta - 2\\gamma = \\beta - \\delta \\implies \\delta = 2\\gamma$.\n\nSubstituting $\\alpha = 2\\beta$ into the first equation gives $2\\beta + \\gamma - \\beta = 0$, which implies $\\gamma = -\\beta$.\nThen, from the third equation, we get $\\delta = 2\\gamma = -2\\beta$.\nSo all exponents are determined by a single parameter, say $\\beta$:\n$\\alpha = 2\\beta, \\quad \\gamma = -\\beta, \\quad \\delta = -2\\beta$.\n\nThis represents a one-parameter family of scaling transformations. Choosing $\\beta=1$ for convenience, we have the scaling group:\n$t' = a^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = a \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = a^{-2} p$.\nThis symmetry adds **1 dimension** to the Lie group.\n\n### Step 4: Identify Other Symmetries (Pressure Symmetries)\nNotice that the pressure $p$ appears only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This implies that the equations are invariant under the transformation $p \\rightarrow p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, because $\\nabla(p + f(t)) = \\nabla p$.\n\nSince $f(t)$ can be any function, this symmetry is generated by an infinite-dimensional algebra (e.g., generators $t^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ for all $n \\ge 0$). Therefore, the full Lie group of symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude and Final Answer\nThe question \"What is the dimension of the Lie group\" is standard in the context of symmetry analysis of differential equations. When a system admits an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries, the question is typically interpreted as asking for the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra*. The infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure is often treated as a \"gauge\" symmetry and separated from the geometric spacetime symmetries.\n\nThe finite-dimensional part consists of the Galilean symmetries and the scaling symmetry.\nTotal dimension = (Dimension of Galilean group) + (Dimension of scaling group)\nTotal dimension = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nCareful points to consider:\n*   The problem is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The result is different for $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where the symmetry group is infinite-dimensional even without considering the pressure term.\n*   The viscosity term $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ is crucial for determining the specific scaling symmetry. For the Euler equations ($\\nu=0$), there are two independent scaling symmetries.\n*   The infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra is a key feature, but by convention, the \"dimension\" refers to the finite part unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
