    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Core Task:** The main goal is to determine the correct reading frame of a given nucleotide sequence and then translate it into its corresponding protein sequence.\n2.  **Key Information:** The sequence is from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). This is the most crucial piece of information.\n3.  **Implication of \"Middle of an ORF\":** An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. If this sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame must not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n4.  **Possible Reading Frames:** Any given DNA sequence has three potential forward reading frames.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts reading from the 1st nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts reading from the 2nd nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts reading from the 3rd nucleotide.\n5.  **Method:** We must analyze each of the three frames. We will translate the codons in each frame and check for the presence of a stop codon. The frame that results in a continuous chain of amino acids without any stop codons is the correct one.\n6.  **Required Tool:** We need the standard genetic code table to translate the three-letter nucleotide codons into their corresponding one-letter amino acid codes.\n7.  **Final Output:** The answer requires stating the correct frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer**\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's analyze each of the three possible reading frames.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Frame 1**\n\n*   We group the sequence into codons starting from the first nucleotide.\n*   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag ...`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a premature stop codon (`tag`) at the 5th position. Since the sequence is from the middle of an ORF, this frame is incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Frame 2**\n\n*   We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and group the rest of the sequence into codons.\n*   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg` (the final nucleotide of the original sequence is `gag` so the codon should be `gag`). Let me recheck the end of the sequence. `...gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`. Okay, my mistake, the original analysis was correct. Let me re-group the codons from the actual sequence carefully.\n*   Sequence for Frame 2: `g` is ignored. `acattgtt...tgg` are translated. The last `c` is a remainder.\n*   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   Translation:\n    *   D - I - V - V - S - E - D - L - N - G - T - V - K - F - S - S - S - L - P - Y - P - N - N - L - N - S - V - L - A - E - R - L - E - K - W\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous protein sequence with no stop codons. This is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF. Therefore, Frame 2 is the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Frame 3**\n\n*   We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and group the rest of the sequence into codons.\n*   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga ...`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a premature stop codon (`tga`) at the 8th position. This frame is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 yields a valid open reading frame. We will now write down the full translated sequence for Frame 2.\n\n*   **Correct Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
