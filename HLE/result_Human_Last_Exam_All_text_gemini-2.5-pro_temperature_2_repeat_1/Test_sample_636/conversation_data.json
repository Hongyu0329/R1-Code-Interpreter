    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system described by the state-space equation `ẋ = Ax + Bu`.\n*   State matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe want to design a state feedback controller `u = -Fx`. When this controller is applied, the closed-loop system dynamics become `ẋ = (A - BF)x`. The problem states the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`, which implies the feedback law `u = +Fx`. Let's assume the standard form `u = -Fx`, making the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`. We will solve for `F` in `A_cl = A-BF`. If the question implies `A_cl = A+BF`, the final gain would just be the negative of our result. Given the standard formulation of the problem, we will use `A_cl = A - BF` and adjust if needed, but it seems the user meant `A-BF` and wrote `A+BF`. Let's solve it for `A_cl = A + BF` as asked in the prompt, to avoid confusion.\n*Let's recalculate with `A_cl = A + BF`*. This matches the prompt's notation.\n\nOur goal is to find a feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A_cl = A + BF` are at `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Dimensions of F**\n*   The state vector `x` is 2x1.\n*   The input vector `u` is 2x1 (since B is 2x2).\n*   In the feedback law `u = -Fx` (or `u=Fx`), for the matrix dimensions to be consistent (`[2x1] = [F] * [2x1]`), the gain matrix `F` must be 2x2.\nLet `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**4. Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\n`A_cl = A + BF`\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNow, calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n    `= -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n    `= -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n    `= -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n\n**6. Equate the Polynomials and Solve for F**\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial `λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `-(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2`\n    `-f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ + 1 = 2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term (λ⁰):**\n    `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2`\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of 2 equations with 4 unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). This means there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can simplify the problem by making some assumptions to find one possible solution.\n\nA common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero. Let's try setting `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first input channel `u₁` for feedback.\n\nSubstituting `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0` into our equations:\n\n*   **Equation 1 becomes:**\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2(0) = -1`\n    `f₁ + f₂ = -1` (Equation A)\n\n*   **Equation 2 becomes:**\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂(0) - 2(0) - 2f₁(0) = 3`\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3` (Equation B)\n\nNow we have a simple system of 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns. We can solve for `f₁` and `f₂`:\nAdd Equation A and Equation B:\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into Equation A:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nSo, a valid solution for the feedback gain matrix `F` is `f₁ = 1`, `f₂ = -2`, `f₃ = 0`, `f₄ = 0`.\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nThe resulting state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification (Optional but recommended):**\nLet's check if this `F` gives the correct eigenvalues.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1 + 1, 1 - 2], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ + 2]]) = λ(λ + 2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis is the desired characteristic polynomial. The roots are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 4*1*2)) / 2 = (-2 ± sqrt(-4)) / 2 = -1 ± j`. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
