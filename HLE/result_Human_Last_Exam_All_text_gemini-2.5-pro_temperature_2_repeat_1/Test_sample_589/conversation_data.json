    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks to identify a specific Hollywood feature film with the following key elements:\n1.  **Hollywood feature film:** A movie made for theatrical release.\n2.  **Produced by a major film studio:** Not an independent or foreign film without major distribution.\n3.  **A teenager:** The character performing the action is an adolescent.\n4.  **Rides a pink bike:** The color of the bicycle is a crucial and specific detail.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This describes the specific, confrontational action in the scene.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Elements and Search for Candidates**\n\n*   **The Pink Bike:** This is the most distinctive visual cue. Few famous movie scenes feature a specifically pink bicycle. Titles like *Pretty in Pink* might come to mind, but the protagonist in that film famously drives a pink car, not a bike.\n*   **Teenager + Bike + Car Confrontation:** This combination points toward a coming-of-age story or a quirky comedy. The action itself—pedaling toward a car—suggests either extreme defiance, a \"game of chicken,\" or an accidental confrontation.\n*   **Combining the Elements:** A search for these combined elements leads strongly to one particular film: **Napoleon Dynamite (2004)**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Candidate Film Against All Criteria**\n\nLet's check if *Napoleon Dynamite* fits all the points from Step 1.\n\n1.  **Hollywood Feature Film?** Yes, *Napoleon Dynamite* was a feature film that received a wide theatrical release and became a major box office success and cult classic.\n2.  **Produced by a Major Film Studio?** Yes. It was produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures (the specialty division of 20th Century Fox, a major studio) and MTV Films (a division of Paramount Pictures, another major studio).\n3.  **A Teenager?** Yes. The character in the scene is **Deb Bradshaw** (played by Tina Majorino), who is a high school student and friend of the titular teenage character.\n4.  **Rides a Pink Bike?** Yes. Deb is frequently shown with her belongings for her various businesses (like keychains and glamour shots) in the front basket of her bicycle, which is a distinctive light pink/magenta color.\n5.  **Pedals Directly Toward an Oncoming Car?** Yes, this exact scene occurs in the film.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Specific Scene**\n\n*   **The Context:** Napoleon's older brother, Kip, is training to be a cage fighter under the tutelage of Rex Kwon Do. As part of his \"training,\" Kip decides to test his reflexes while driving his van.\n*   **The Action:** Deb is riding her pink bike along the side of a rural road. Kip, driving from the opposite direction, sees her and decides to use her as a target. He yells a warning and then deliberately swerves his van directly at her. For a moment, Deb is pedaling straight into the path of the oncoming vehicle. The sudden, aggressive maneuver by Kip causes her to lose her balance and crash, scattering her craft supplies on the ground.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to note the nuance of the phrase \"pedal directly toward.\" In this scene, Deb is not initiating a game of chicken. Rather, the driver of the car (Kip) creates the confrontation by swerving into her path. However, the visual result is precisely as the question describes: a teenager on a pink bike finding herself pedaling directly toward an oncoming car that is aimed at her.\n*   The combination of all the specific details—the major studio production, the teenage character, the *pink* bike, and the confrontation with a car—makes this scene from *Napoleon Dynamite* the unique and correct answer.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
