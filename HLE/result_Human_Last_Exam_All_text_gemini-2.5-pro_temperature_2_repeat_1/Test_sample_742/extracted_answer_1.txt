No, it is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary setting of the mathematics used for quantum mechanics.

There are three primary reasons for this impossibility:

1.  **Fundamental Category Mismatch:** Gödel's proof is an *a priori* argument in formal modal logic, which deals with abstract concepts of possibility, necessity, and properties. The mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators) is a framework designed to model the *a posteriori*, empirical behavior of physical systems. There is no established, non-arbitrary way to translate metaphysical concepts like "positive property" or "necessary existence" into the language of state vectors, operators, or quantum probabilities.

2.  **Unjustifiable Axioms:** The strength of Gödel's proof rests entirely on its foundational axioms (e.g., "Necessary existence is a positive property"). The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics provides no principles, theorems, or physical reasons to accept these purely philosophical axioms as true. Without QM justifying the axioms, it cannot be said to be proving the conclusion; it would merely be a linguistic reformulation of a philosophical argument that remains unproven by physics.

3.  **Incompatible Logical Systems:** Standard versions of Gödel's proof rely on classical logic. However, the logical structure of propositions within quantum mechanics ("quantum logic") is non-classical and non-distributive. Key logical steps in the classical proof would not be valid if one were to attempt a genuine reformulation within the native logic of quantum mechanics.
