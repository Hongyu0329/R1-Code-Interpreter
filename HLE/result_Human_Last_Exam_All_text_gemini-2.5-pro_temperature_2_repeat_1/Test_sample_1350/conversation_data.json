    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Character Trait 1:** Must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character Trait 2:** Must describe Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Specific Detail:** The description must contain a recognizable reference to the founding myth of Rome, featuring Romulus and Remus, who were famously suckled by a she-wolf.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the name of this specific character.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Novel's Plot and Characters:**\n    *   The novel is set during the late Roman Empire and centers on a Germanic (Gothic) tribe called the Wolfings, who live in a great forest (Mirkwood) and are preparing to defend their home against an invading Roman army.\n    *   Most of the main characters, such as the war-leader Thiodolf and his foster-daughter Hall-Sun, are members of the Wolfing tribe and have not visited Roman cities. Their knowledge of Romans is primarily as an approaching enemy.\n    *   Therefore, the character in question must be someone with a unique background that gave them access to Roman society. This suggests the character is likely not a Wolfing by birth or may have a past that involves captivity or travel.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    *   We need to look for a character who acts as an informant or guide concerning Roman ways. In the story, the Wolfings seek intelligence about the invaders.\n    *   In Chapter VI, \"They Hear News of the Romans,\" a character is brought before the leaders of the House to share his knowledge. This character is **Otter**.\n    *   Otter is not originally a Wolfing but a man from a nearby tribe who was captured by the Romans as a child and lived among them as a slave before escaping. This background makes him the most plausible candidate.\n\n4.  **Examine Otter's Testimony:**\n    *   During his account to the Wolfing elders, Otter describes the strength, organization, and beliefs of the Romans.\n    *   He speaks specifically about what he saw inside the Roman city and their temples.\n    *   Crucially, he describes a recurring image and the story behind it. He tells the Wolfings that in the Roman city, he often saw carvings and paintings of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-babies.\"**\n    *   He further explains that the Romans have a tale that these two infants were the founders of their great city.\n\n5.  **Connect the Testimony to the Myth:**\n    *   The image of a she-wolf nursing twin infants is the most iconic element of the Roman founding myth of **Romulus and Remus**.\n    *   Otter's description is a direct and unmistakable reference to this legend, framed from the perspective of an outsider who is relaying it to his people. He provides the exact visual details that a reader familiar with Roman history would immediately recognize.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Otter is the character who was a captive in a Roman city.\n    *   He describes Roman religious beliefs and founding myths to the Wolfings.\n    *   His description explicitly includes the imagery of the she-wolf nursing the twin founders, a clear allusion to Romulus and Remus.\n    *   Therefore, the character who fits all the criteria of the question is Otter.\n\n***\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
