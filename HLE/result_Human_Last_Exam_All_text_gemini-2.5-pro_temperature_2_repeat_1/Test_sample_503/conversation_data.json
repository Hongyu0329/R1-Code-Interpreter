    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a generalization of the concept of an adjunction between categories. We are asked to find the number of internal adjunctions from the object $[23]$ to the object $[37]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category\n1.  **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n2.  **1-morphisms:** The morphisms (or 1-morphisms) between $[m]$ and $[n]$ are the order-preserving (monotone) maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$. That is, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n3.  **2-morphisms:** Since $\\Delta$ is considered a locally posetal 2-category, the hom-sets are posets. For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. This means $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction in this context\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of:\n*   A 1-morphism $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint).\n*   A 1-morphism $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint).\n*   A 2-morphism called the **unit**, $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$.\n*   A 2-morphism called the **counit**, $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nThe triangle identities, which are part of the full definition of an adjunction, are automatically satisfied because the hom-sets are posets.\n\nIn our specific setting with $m=23$ and $n=37$:\n*   $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ are monotone maps.\n*   The unit $\\eta$ corresponds to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(k) \\le (R \\circ L)(k)$ for all $k \\in [23]$, which simplifies to **$k \\le R(L(k))$**.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon$ corresponds to the inequality $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to **$L(R(j)) \\le j$**.\n\nThese two conditions are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing the adjoint maps\nA fundamental property of Galois connections is that one adjoint determines the other. For instance, if $L$ is given, $R$ is determined by the formula $R(j) = \\max\\{ k \\in [23] \\mid L(k) \\le j \\}$. Therefore, we can find the total number of adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$.\n\nA monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ between complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The posets $[m]$ are complete lattices, where the supremum of a set is its maximum element, and the supremum of the empty set is the bottom element, $0$.\n\nLet's check this condition for a monotone map $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n1.  For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [23]$, its supremum is $\\max(S)$. Since $L$ is monotone, $L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$. So $L$ preserves suprema of non-empty sets.\n2.  For the empty set $\\emptyset \\subseteq [23]$, its supremum is the minimum element of $[23]$, which is $0$. The image set $L(\\emptyset)$ is the empty set in $[37]$, and its supremum is the minimum element of $[37]$, which is $0$.\n    For $L$ to preserve the supremum of the empty set, we must have $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$.\n    This translates to **$L(0) = 0$**.\n\nA monotone map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint (i.e., part of an adjunction) if and only if $L(0)=0$. If this condition holds, a corresponding right adjoint $R$ is guaranteed to exist.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the valid maps\nThe problem is now reduced to counting the number of monotone maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$.\nA monotone map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$, where each $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe full condition is:\n$0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nWith the constraint $L(0)=0$, this becomes:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nWe need to choose the 23 values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This set has $38$ elements. Since the sequence must be non-decreasing, this is a combination with repetition problem.\n\nWe can model this using the \"stars and bars\" method. Choosing 23 numbers from a set of 38 with replacement is equivalent to finding the number of multisets of size 23 from a set of size 38. The formula for the number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $n$ is $\\left(\\!\\!{n\\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\n*   $k = 23$ (the number of values we are choosing, i.e., $L(1)$ through $L(23)$).\n*   $n = 38$ (the number of possible values, i.e., $0$ through $37$).\n\nThe total number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nEach such map $L$ corresponds to exactly one internal adjunction. Therefore, the number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n#### Careful points summary:\n*   An internal adjunction in $\\Delta$ is equivalent to a Galois connection between the linear orders $[m]$ and $[n]$.\n*   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint (part of a Galois connection) if and only if it is monotone and preserves all suprema.\n*   Preserving the supremum of the empty set translates to the condition $L(0) = 0$.\n*   The problem then becomes a combinatorial one of counting non-decreasing sequences, which can be solved using multiset coefficients (stars and bars).\n*   Verifying by counting the right adjoints $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (which must satisfy $R(n)=m$) gives the same result: $\\binom{(m+1) + (n-1+1) - 1}{n-1+1} = \\binom{m+n+1}{m}$. Hmm, my previous calculation was counting for $R(0), ..., R(n-1)$, while $R(n)$ is fixed. So $n$ values. My previous calculation for $R$ was $R: [37] \\to [23]$. We are choosing 37 values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$. Range is $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$, size 24. Number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, which is correct. The argument holds.\n\nThe final answer is the binomial coefficient.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
