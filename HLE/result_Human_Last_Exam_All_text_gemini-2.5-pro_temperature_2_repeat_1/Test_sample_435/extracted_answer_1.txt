Given that IL-15 enhances T cell fitness, survival, and effector function, CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 would be predicted to exhibit an increased release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon target cell recognition compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.
