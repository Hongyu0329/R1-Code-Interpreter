    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The goal is to determine the oligomeric state (i.e., the number of polypeptide chains) of the protein sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. The method of determination is specified: using the principles of coiled-coil structure, specifically \"knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure where the helices interact. To find this pattern, we look for a repeating sequence of hydrophobic residues.\n    *   The sequence is: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    *   Let's test possible registrations for the `(abcdefg)` repeat. The most stable arrangement will place hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   If we assign the Alanine (A) at position 4 as the first `a` position, a clear and consistent pattern emerges:\n        *   Heptad positions:  `a   b   c   d   e   f   g`\n        *   Repeat 1:          `A   Q   S   L   K   E   I`\n        *   Repeat 2:          `A   K   S   L   K   E   I`\n        *   Repeat 3:          `A   W   S   L   K   E   I`\n        *   Repeat 4:          `A   Q   S   L   K   ...`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Positions (`a` and `d`):** These positions dictate the packing and, therefore, the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Position `a`:** Looking at the sequence with the established registration, the residues at the `a` positions are: A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25). All are **Alanine (A)**.\n    *   **Position `d`:** The residues at the `d` positions are: L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28). All are **Leucine (L)**.\n\n4.  **Apply Principles of Packing Efficiency (\"Knobs-into-Holes\"):**\n    *   The size and shape of the amino acid side chains at the `a` and `d` positions determine how the helices can pack together.\n    *   In a coiled-coil, the side chains at position `a` point towards the central axis of the entire oligomer. The side chains at position `d` pack against the adjacent helix.\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically stabilized by large hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions (e.g., the famous Leucine Zipper GCN4 has Leucine at `d` and mostly Valine and Asparagine at `a`).\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** This oligomeric state is strongly favored by a specific pattern: a **small** hydrophobic residue (like Alanine or Valine) at the `a` position and a **large** hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) at the `d` position. This arrangement is highly efficient. The small Alanine residues can pack neatly together at the very center of the three-helix bundle without steric clash, while the large Leucine residues from the `d` positions fit perfectly into the \"holes\" created on the surfaces of the neighboring helices.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often formed when there are large hydrophobic residues at both the `a` and `d` positions, which favors a larger core, or when specific polar interactions are present that disfavor lower-order states.\n    *   **Higher-Order Oligomers:** These are less common for canonical heptad repeats and usually involve more complex sequence features.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence exhibits a consistent pattern of **Alanine at the `a` position** and **Leucine at the `d` position**. This precise `a`=small, `d`=large pattern is a classic, well-established signature for a **trimeric coiled-coil**. This allows for optimal packing efficiency and stability by minimizing steric hindrance at the central axis. Therefore, the protein is expected to form a trimer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
