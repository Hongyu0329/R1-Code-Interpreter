    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Name:** The name \"perfluoronanocar\" can be broken down into two parts:\n    *   **\"Nanocar\"**: This refers to the base molecule. A Nanocar is a real, single-molecule machine designed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University. It consists of a chassis, axles, and wheels.\n    *   **\"Perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard chemical prefix. It means that every hydrogen atom (H) on the parent molecule has been replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n\n2.  **Identify the Structure of the Nanocar:** To know how many hydrogens can be replaced, we must first know the molecular structure of the original Nanocar.\n    *   **Chassis and Axles**: The main body, which includes the central frame and the axles that connect to the wheels, is an organic structure made of carbon and hydrogen atoms. For the most commonly cited Nanocar design, this chassis-and-axle assembly has the molecular formula **C₁₄₀H₄₀**.\n    *   **Wheels**: The wheels of the Nanocar are four **buckminsterfullerene** spheres (also known as buckyballs). The chemical formula for each fullerene wheel is **C₆₀**.\n\n3.  **Identify Atoms Available for Substitution:** The process of \"perfluorination\" involves substituting hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms.\n    *   The chassis-and-axle system (C₁₄₀H₄₀) contains **40 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   The fullerene wheels (C₆₀) are made entirely of carbon and have **zero hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   Therefore, only the 40 hydrogen atoms on the chassis and axles can be replaced.\n\n4.  **Perform the Hypothetical Perfluorination:** We apply the \"perfluoro-\" rule to the Nanocar structure.\n    *   We take the chassis-and-axle component, C₁₄₀H₄₀.\n    *   We replace every one of the 40 hydrogen atoms with a fluorine atom.\n    *   The resulting molecular formula for the perfluorinated chassis-and-axles becomes **C₁₄₀F₄₀**.\n    *   The C₆₀ wheels remain unchanged as they have no hydrogens to substitute.\n\n5.  **Count the Fluorine Atoms:** The final step is to count the total number of fluorine atoms in the resulting \"perfluoronanocar\" molecule.\n    *   The final structure consists of a C₁₄₀F₄₀ frame attached to four C₆₀ wheels.\n    *   Looking at the formula for the fluorinated frame (C₁₄₀F₄₀), the number of fluorine atoms is **40**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Which Nanocar?**: Several Nanocar designs exist. The analysis is based on the most common and well-known design which uses a C₁₄₀H₄₀ chassis/axle structure and C₆₀ wheels. The answer is dependent on this specific molecular structure.\n*   **\"Per-\" Prefix**: The prefix \"per-\" means \"completely\" or \"fully\". In this context, it signifies that *all* possible positions (i.e., all hydrogen atoms) are substituted, not just some of them.\n*   **Hypothetical Nature**: The question specifies \"hypothetically\". This is important as it allows us to focus purely on the chemical nomenclature and structure, without worrying about the practical challenges of whether such a molecule could be synthesized or if it would be stable.\n*   **Composition of Components**: A critical point is correctly identifying which parts of the molecule contain hydrogen. Mistakenly assuming the C₆₀ wheels have hydrogens would lead to an incorrect answer. Fullerenes are allotropes of pure carbon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is determined by the number of hydrogen atoms in the original Nanocar molecule. Since the Nanocar's chassis and axles contain 40 hydrogen atoms, a complete substitution (perfluorination) would result in a molecule with 40 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<40>>>"
