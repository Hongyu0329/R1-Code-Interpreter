    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   **Atomic Composition:** 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G. This notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented mathematically.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the total number of *contracted Gaussian functions* (also known as basis functions) for the entire molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of \"split-valence\" basis set. The key to solving the problem is to understand what this means for the number of functions assigned to each atom.\n\n*   The basis set splits orbitals into \"core\" and \"valence\" shells.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). The \"6-\" in 6-31G means this one CGF is formed by summing 6 primitive Gaussian functions, but this detail does not affect the final count of contracted functions.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** Each valence atomic orbital is \"split\" and represented by two CGFs. This is often called a \"double-zeta\" description of the valence shell. The \"-31\" in 6-31G means the first CGF (the \"inner\" part) is formed from 3 primitive Gaussians, and the second CGF (the \"outer\" part) is formed from 1 primitive Gaussian. Again, the final count only depends on the fact that there are *two* CGFs per valence orbital.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions for a Single Carbon (C) Atom**\n\n*   A carbon atom (atomic number 6) has the electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core Orbital:** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. According to the 6-31G rules, it is represented by **1** contracted function.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and 2p orbitals are valence orbitals.\n    *   There is one 2s orbital.\n    *   There are three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   This gives a total of 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 valence atomic orbitals.\n*   Each of these 4 valence orbitals is split into two functions. Therefore, the number of functions for the valence shell is 4 orbitals × 2 functions/orbital = **8** contracted functions.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom** = 1 (core function) + 8 (valence functions) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions for a Single Hydrogen (H) Atom**\n\n*   A hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has the electron configuration: 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is the only orbital, and it is a valence orbital.\n*   This single valence orbital is split into two functions. Therefore, the number of functions is 1 orbital × 2 functions/orbital = **2** contracted functions.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom** = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C7H8)**\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms:**\n    7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = **63 functions**\n*   **Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms:**\n    8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = **16 functions**\n*   **Total for Toluene:**\n    Total Functions = 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = **79 functions**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguish Contracted vs. Primitive Gaussians:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions (the basis functions used in the calculation), not the total number of *primitive* Gaussians they are built from. The numbers 6, 3, and 1 in the basis set name refer to primitive Gaussians.\n2.  **Identify Core vs. Valence Orbitals:** Correctly identifying which atomic orbitals are core and which are valence is critical, as they are treated differently by the basis set. For first-row elements (like C), 1s is core. For H, there is no core.\n3.  **Count p-orbitals Correctly:** Remember that a p-shell consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz), each of which must be counted.\n4.  **Correctly Interpret \"Split-Valence\":** A split-valence basis set like 6-31G assigns *one* function to each core orbital and *two* functions to each valence orbital.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, the final answer is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
