    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the location of the Waskaganish gathering place. Waskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec, Canada. It is located on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its geographic position is crucial for this analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories\nNext, we must list the Canadian provinces and territories that are adjacent to Quebec.\n*   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west and south.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the south.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory shares a maritime border with Quebec to the north across the Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay. Importantly, all islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, including those close to the Quebec coast, are part of Nunavut.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighbor to Waskaganish\nNow, we evaluate the distance from Waskaganish to each of these neighboring jurisdictions.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These provinces are located on the far eastern and southern sides of Quebec. Waskaganish is in the northwestern part of inhabited Quebec, making these two provinces very distant and clearly not the closest.\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Ontario and Quebec runs north-south, ending on the southern coast of James Bay. Waskaganish is situated just a short distance east of this border line. The shortest path to Ontario from Waskaganish is a relatively small, overland distance directly to the west.\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is one of the islands in James Bay. The largest and most prominent of these is Akimiski Island, which lies to the northwest of Waskaganish, separated by a significant stretch of open water.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Closest Contenders\nThe two main contenders are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario on the coast of James Bay is only about 55-60 kilometers (approximately 35 miles) west of Waskaganish.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The nearest landmass in Nunavut is Akimiski Island. The distance from Waskaganish across the water to the closest point of Akimiski Island is over 150 kilometers (approximately 95 miles).\n\n### Step 5: Conclude\nBy comparing the straight-line distances, the border of the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest land in the territory of Nunavut.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **\"Province or Territory\"**: The question specifically includes both, so both Ontario (a province) and Nunavut (a territory) had to be considered.\n2.  **Excluding Quebec**: The analysis correctly focuses only on jurisdictions *outside* of Quebec.\n3.  **Geography of Nunavut**: A critical point is knowing that the islands in James Bay belong to Nunavut, not Quebec. Without this knowledge, one might incorrectly assume Nunavut is much farther north.\n4.  **Shortest Distance**: The comparison is based on the shortest \"as the crow flies\" distance from the Waskaganish community to the nearest point of another jurisdiction's border or landmass.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that Ontario is the closest.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
