    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Involutions in PSU(n, q)\nAn involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are looking for the number of elements `x` in the group `G = PSU(4, 997)` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`.\n\nThe group `PSU(n, q)` is the projective special unitary group, defined as `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\n*   `SU(n, q)` consists of `n x n` matrices `A` over the field `F_{q^2}` such that `A` is unitary (`A^{-1} = (A^bar)^T`) and has determinant 1.\n*   The center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` that are in `SU(n, q)`. The size of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nAn element `x = gZ` (where `g ∈ SU(n,q)` and `Z=Z(SU(n,q))`) is an involution in `PSU(n, q)` if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element of `PSU(n,q)`, and `gZ` is not the identity.\n*   The identity in `PSU(n, q)` is `Z`. So, `gZ ≠ Z` means `g ∉ Z`.\n*   `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z`. This implies `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of cosets `gZ` where `g ∈ SU(n, q)`, `g ∉ Z`, and `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n\nLet `S = {g ∈ SU(n, q) | g^2 ∈ Z \\text{ and } g ∉ Z}`. The set of involutions in `PSU(n,q)` is the image of `S` under the projection map `π: SU(n,q) → PSU(n,q)`. For each involution `x ∈ PSU(n,q)`, its preimage `π^{-1}(x)` is a coset of `Z` containing `|Z|` elements, all of which are in `S`.\nTherefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(n, q)` is `|S| / |Z|`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the case for PSU(4, 997)\nFor `PSU(4, 997)`, we have `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n*   `q=997` is a prime number.\n*   The size of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n*   So, `|Z(SU(4, 997))| = 2`. The center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\nThe condition `g^2 ∈ Z` means either `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n### Step 3: Ruling out the `g^2 = -I` case\nLet's consider if there are any elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\nIf `g` is such an element, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. Also, since `g` is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\nFrom `λ^2 = -1`, we get `λ^(q+1) = (λ^2)^((q+1)/2) = (-1)^((q+1)/2)`.\nFor our case, `q = 997`, so `(q+1)/2 = 998/2 = 499`.\n`λ^(q+1) = (-1)^499 = -1`.\nThis leads to the equations `λ^(q+1) = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = -1`, which implies `1 = -1`. This is a contradiction since the characteristic of the field `F_{997^2}` is not 2.\nThus, there are no elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Careful point:** This conclusion holds because `(q+1)/2` is odd, which is equivalent to `q ≡ 1 \\pmod 4`. Indeed, `997 = 4 * 249 + 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the relevant involutions in SU(4, 997)\nSince the `g^2 = -I` case is empty, the set `S` simplifies to:\n`S = {g ∈ SU(4, 997) | g^2 = I \\text{ and } g ∉ Z}`.\nThis is the set of non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\nThe conjugacy classes of involutions in `SU(n, q)` are determined by the dimension `k` of the eigenspace for the eigenvalue -1. For an element to be in `SU(n,q)`, its determinant must be 1. The determinant of an involution is `(-1)^k`. So, `k` must be even.\nFor `n = 4`, the possible even values of `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   `k=0`: This corresponds to `g = I` (the identity), which is in `Z`. We exclude it.\n*   `k=4`: This corresponds to `g = -I`, which is also in `Z`. We exclude it.\n*   `k=2`: This corresponds to involutions conjugate to `t = diag(I_2, -I_2)`. These are non-central.\n\nSo, the set `S` consists precisely of the single conjugacy class `C(t)` of non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`.\n`|S| = |C(t)|`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the size of the conjugacy class\nThe size of the conjugacy class `C(t)` in `SU(4, q)` is given by the formula:\n`|C(t)| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(t)|`\nwhere `C_{SU(4, q)}(t)` is the centralizer of `t` in `SU(4, q)`.\n\nThe centralizer of `t = diag(I_2, -I_2)` in the general unitary group `U(4, q)` is isomorphic to `U(2, q) × U(2, q)`. The centralizer in `SU(4, q)` is the subgroup of `U(2, q) × U(2, q)` where the product of determinants is 1. Its size is `|C_{SU(4, q)}(t)| = |U(2, q)|^2 / (q+1)`.\nThe size of the class `|C(t)|` in `SU(4,q)` is thus `|U(4,q)|/|U(2,q)|^2` (since `|SU(n,q)| = |U(n,q)|/(q+1)`).\n\nUsing the formula for the order of the general unitary group `|U(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`:\n*   `|U(4, q)| = q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n*   `|U(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\n\nSo, `|C(t)| = (q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)) / (q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2`\n`= (q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)) / (q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2)`\n`= (q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1))`\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `|S| / |Z|`.\nWe found `|S| = |C(t)| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)` and `|Z|=2`.\nSo, the number of involutions is `(q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)) / 2`.\n\nNow, we substitute `q = 997`:\n*   `q = 997`\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994009`\n*   `q^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053848081`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994009 + 1 = 994010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(988053848081 * 993013 * 994010) / 2`\n`= 988053848081 * 993013 * (994010 / 2)`\n`= 988053848081 * 993013 * 497005`\n`= 988053848081 * (993013 * 497005)`\n`= 988053848081 * 493539946565`\n`= 487593258525048682970465`\n\nFinal verification of logic:\nIt's established that for `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, `PSU(4,q)` has exactly one conjugacy class of involutions. The total number of involutions is the size of this class. A detailed calculation shows the size of this class is indeed `|C(t)|/2`, which matches the `|S|/|Z|` formula.\n\nFinal Answer Computation:\n`997^4 * 993013 * 497005 = 487593258525048682970465`.\n\n<<<487593258525048682970465>>>"
