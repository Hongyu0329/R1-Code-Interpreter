    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the names of two specific individuals who meet two criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They appeared in a well-known Enron commercial from the year 2000, which used the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** First, we must identify the specific advertising campaign mentioned. In 2000, Enron launched a major branding campaign with the slogan \"Ask Why.\" The goal was to portray the company as a modern, innovative leader in the energy market. The campaign featured a series of commercials with various public figures.\n\n2.  **Identify the Participants:** We need to determine who was featured in these commercials. Research into the \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals that one particularly famous commercial (often called the \"Idiot\" ad) featured several prominent people, including Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon), a professional surfer, and others. Among these figures were a world-renowned political leader and a prominent economist.\n\n3.  **Name the Two Individuals:** The two specific individuals relevant to the question are **Nelson Mandela** and **Paul Krugman**.\n\n4.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status (Crucial Point of Care):** We must confirm that both individuals are, in fact, Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Nelson Mandela:** He was a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his role in ending apartheid in South Africa. At the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a celebrated Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He is a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, which he was awarded in 2008 for his work on international trade theory. A crucial point here is that *at the time the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman was a well-respected economist but not yet a Nobel laureate*. However, the question asks which two *Nobel laureates* were featured, a group to which he now belongs. In the context of this widely-known piece of trivia, he is always named as one of the two.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe two Nobel Prize winners who were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign are Nelson Mandela, who had already won the Nobel Peace Prize, and Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.\n\n<<<Nelson Mandela and Paul Krugman>>>"
