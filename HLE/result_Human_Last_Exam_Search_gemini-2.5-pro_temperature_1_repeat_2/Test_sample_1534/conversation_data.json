    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe brain of the dwarf cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, is a complex structure. The palliovisceral lobe is a significant component of the posterior subesophageal mass, which is involved in controlling various motor functions. Anatomical studies of the cuttlefish brain have identified several lobes in close proximity to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nDetailed analysis of the subesophageal mass in *Sepia* species reveals that the palliovisceral ganglion is composed of several parts, including a central palliovisceral lobe, a pair of fin lobes, and a pair of posterior chromatophore lobes. Research on the squid *Todarodes pacificus* also shows the fin lobes and posterior chromatophore lobes developing around the large palliovisceral lobe in the posterior subesophageal mass. This arrangement is further supported by research on *Sepia officinalis*, which places the posterior chromatophore and fin lobes in the posterior subesophageal mass, adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\nA comprehensive 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish, *Sepia bandensis*, has been developed, providing precise anatomical details. This atlas and associated publications confirm the presence and arrangement of these lobes. Specifically, the posterior view of the dwarf cuttlefish brain shows the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes situated posteriorly to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe. These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) of the mantle and fins, and the muscles of the fins, respectively."
