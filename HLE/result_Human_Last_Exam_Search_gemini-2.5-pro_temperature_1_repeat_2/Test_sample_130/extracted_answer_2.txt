As the local median function, which is equivalent to a median filter, is repeatedly applied to a binary image, the edges of the image undergo a smoothing process. Sharp corners on the boundaries between black and white regions are rounded off, with convex corners being eroded and concave corners being filled in. Any small, isolated features or thin lines that are smaller than half the filter's neighborhood size are eliminated from the image. This iterative process does not continue to change the image indefinitely; it eventually converges to a stable state called a "root" signal. This final image is invariant to further applications of the median filter and represents a geometrically simplified and smoother version of the original image, with the primary edges preserved but stripped of their fine details and sharp angles.
