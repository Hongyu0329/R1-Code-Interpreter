    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four primary colors: white, red, black, and violet.\n\nElemental phosphorus exists in several different forms, known as allotropes, each with unique physical and chemical properties, including their distinct colors.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear white, colorless, or yellowish. The yellowish tint is often due to the presence of impurities or its gradual conversion to the more stable red phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** As its name suggests, this allotrope is characterized by its red color, which can range from a deep red to a reddish-violet or dark red. Some forms may also exhibit an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has an appearance similar to graphite, being black and flaky. It can also possess a black metallic luster.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope is typically described as violet or purple. It can also be found as red-brown or purple-red flakes with a metallic luster. Depending on its form and preparation, it has been described as having a steely blue lustre or appearing as brown transparent plates.\n\n<<<4>>>"
