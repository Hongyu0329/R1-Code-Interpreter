    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required. In this context, \"peaks\" refers to the number of distinct signals or resonances, not the total number of lines including splitting.\n\nThe molecule can be broken down into two main parts for analysis:\n1.  A central 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n2.  Three identical chiral substituent arms attached to the core.\n\nThe central benzene ring possesses a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry makes the three large substituent arms chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in the central core and in one of the substituent arms.\n\n**Analysis of the Central Core:**\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** There are no protons directly attached to the central benzene ring, as all six positions are substituted.\n*   **Methyl Protons:** The three methyl groups attached at the 2, 4, and 6 positions of the benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These nine protons will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Signal 1:** `Ar-CH₃`\n\n**Analysis of One Substituent Arm:**\nEach arm consists of a `-CH₂-` (methylene) group linking the central ring to the complex bicyclic indazole system.\n\n*   **Methylene Protons (`-CH₂-`):** This methylene group is attached to a chiral center (the entire bicyclic indazole moiety). This makes the two protons on the methylene carbon diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will produce two separate signals.\n    *   **Signal 2:** Methylene proton Ha\n    *   **Signal 3:** Methylene proton Hb\n\n*   **Camphor-Indazole Moiety:** This part of the molecule is formally called (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole. It is a rigid, chiral structure with no internal symmetry. Therefore, every proton on this moiety is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Indazole Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring portion of the indazole system (at position C3).\n        *   **Signal 4:** Indazole H3\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor-derived skeleton.\n        *   The two methyl groups on C8 are geminal and diastereotopic due to the overall asymmetry of the molecule. They will give two distinct signals.\n            *   **Signal 5:** C8-CH₃ (one of the pair)\n            *   **Signal 6:** C8-CH₃ (the other of the pair)\n        *   The single methyl group on C7 will give one signal.\n            *   **Signal 7:** C7-CH₃\n    *   **Bicyclic Ring Protons:** There are five protons on the saturated bicyclic framework.\n        *   The proton at the C4 bridgehead is unique.\n            *   **Signal 8:** H4\n        *   The two protons on C5 form a methylene group. They are diastereotopic.\n            *   **Signal 9:** H5a\n            *   **Signal 10:** H5b\n        *   The two protons on C6 form another methylene group. They are also diastereotopic.\n            *   **Signal 11:** H6a\n            *   **Signal 12:** H6b\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming the signals from all the non-equivalent protons:\n*   1 (from `Ar-CH₃`)\n*   2 (from `-CH₂-`)\n*   1 (from Indazole H3)\n*   3 (from the three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton)\n*   5 (from the CH and CH₂ protons on the camphor skeleton)\n\nTotal Signals = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = **12**\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
