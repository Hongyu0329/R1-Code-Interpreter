    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the number of vertices in a Feynman diagram depends on the type of interaction. The number of loops in a connected diagram is given by the formula L = I - V + 1, where L is the number of loops, I is the number of internal lines, and V is the number of vertices.\n\nLet's consider the common $\\phi^4$ theory, where the interaction vertex connects four field lines. For a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines), all lines are internal. At each vertex, four lines meet. Therefore, the total number of line ends, which is 4V, must be equal to twice the number of internal lines (2I), so 4V = 2I, or I = 2V.\n\nSubstituting this into the loop formula:\nL = (2V) - V + 1 = V + 1\n\nTo have a two-loop diagram (L=2), we need:\n2 = V + 1\nV = 1\n\nThis means that a two-loop diagram is possible with just a single vertex. This diagram is a vacuum diagram that resembles the number 8, often called a \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram. It consists of one 4-point vertex with two lines looping back to connect to the same vertex, forming two distinct loops.\n\nIf we consider a $\\phi^3$ theory, where each vertex has three lines, the relationship for a vacuum diagram is 3V = 2I. To satisfy this, V must be an even number. The minimum non-zero value is V=2. For V=2, we have I=3.\nUsing the loop formula: L = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\nSo, in a $\\phi^3$ theory, the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram is 2.\n\nSince the question asks for the absolute minimum number of vertices in *an* interacting scalar field theory, and the $\\phi^4$ theory allows for a two-loop diagram with just one vertex, this is the minimum possible value.\n\n<<<1>>>"
