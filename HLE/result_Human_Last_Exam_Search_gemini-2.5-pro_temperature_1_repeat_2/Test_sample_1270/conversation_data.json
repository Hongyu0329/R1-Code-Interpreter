    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a humorous combination of a benzene ring and the Mercedes-Benz logo. Benzene, a fundamental molecule in organic chemistry, has the chemical formula C₆H₆, which means it is composed of six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal ring.\n\nThe \"Mercedes\" part of the name is represented by a three-pointed star inscribed within the benzene ring, which is a visual pun on the car's logo. In the common humorous depiction of this imaginary molecule, the lines of the star connect to the vertices of the benzene ring but do not represent additional carbon atoms. Therefore, the molecule retains the carbon backbone of benzene.\n\n<<<27>>>"
