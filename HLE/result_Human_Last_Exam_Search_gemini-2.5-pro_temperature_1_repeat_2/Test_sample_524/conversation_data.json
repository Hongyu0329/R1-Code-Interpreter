    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. A pivotal result in topology, confirmed by L. C. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen, provides a complete classification of these mathematical objects.\n\nA continuum is a compact and connected metric space, and it is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane. A space is homogeneous if it looks the same from every point; more formally, for any two points in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous, invertible map with a continuous inverse) that maps one point to the other.\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua distinguishes between degenerate and non-degenerate cases.\n\nThe single degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is the **point**, which forms its own homeomorphism class.\n\nThe non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua, meaning those containing more than one point, are exhaustively classified into three distinct types. These are:\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle)**: This is the most familiar example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc**: A fractal-like object that, despite being connected, contains no arcs. It is also hereditarily indecomposable, meaning none of its subcontinua can be split into two proper subcontinua.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**: This can be envisioned as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nThese three non-degenerate continua are topologically distinct from each other and from a single point, bringing the total number of homeomorphism classes to four. This complete classification answered a long-standing question in topology that originated in the 1920s.\n\n<<<4>>>"
