    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we first need to understand the key concepts involved:\n\n1.  **Qudit**: A quantum system of dimension $d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n2.  **Pauli Channel**: A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit is called a Pauli channel if it can be written in the form:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{kl} U_{kl} \\rho U_{kl}^\\dagger$\n    where $U_{kl} = X^k Z^l$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), and $\\{p_{kl}\\}$ is a set of coefficients. For $\\Lambda$ to be a trace-preserving channel, the coefficients must sum to one, i.e., $\\sum_{k,l} p_{kl} = 1$. For the channel to be completely positive (CP), the coefficients $\\{p_{kl}\\}$ must also satisfy certain conditions, which are equivalent to the Choi matrix of the channel being positive semidefinite.\n\n3.  **Stinespring Dilation and Complementary Channel**: Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system A to a system B can be represented by a Stinespring dilation. This involves an auxiliary system, the environment E, and an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ such that:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$\n    The complementary channel, denoted $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that \"leaks\" to the environment. It is defined by tracing over the main system instead of the environment:\n    $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$\n    The complementary channel maps states of system A to states of the environment E, i.e., $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n\n4.  **Rank of a Channel**: The rank of a quantum channel $\\Lambda$, often called the Choi rank, is the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$. This rank is also equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel. In the context of the Stinespring dilation, the Choi rank of $\\Lambda$ is the dimension of the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ in a *minimal* dilation. Let's denote this as $r = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$**. This can be interpreted in two main ways:\na) The Choi rank of the channel $\\Lambda^c$ itself.\nb) The maximal possible rank of an output state $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ of the complementary channel. This is upper-bounded by the dimension of the output space, which is the dimension of the environment, $r = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$.\n\nLet's analyze both interpretations.\n\n**Interpretation (a): Choi Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the Choi matrices of a channel $\\Lambda$ and its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$. For any unital channel (a channel for which $\\Lambda(I) = I$), the Choi rank of its complementary channel is equal to the dimension of the input system, $d$.\nPauli channels are unital because:\n$\\Lambda(I) = \\sum_{k,l} p_{kl} U_{kl} I U_{kl}^\\dagger = \\sum_{k,l} p_{kl} I = (\\sum_{k,l} p_{kl}) I = I$.\nTherefore, for any Pauli channel on a qudit system, the Choi rank of its complementary channel is exactly $d$. If this were the intended meaning, the word \"maximal\" would be redundant, as the rank is constant for all Pauli channels.\n\n**Interpretation (b): Maximal Rank of the Output of the Complementary Channel**\n\nThis interpretation considers the rank of the output density matrix $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$, which lives in the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of this space is $r = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$. The rank of the output matrix $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ can be at most $r$. The question then becomes finding the maximum possible value of $r$ for a Pauli channel.\n\nThe rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of non-zero coefficients $p_{kl}$ in its Kraus representation, provided the resulting map is completely positive. There are $d^2$ such coefficients in total. To find the maximal rank, we need to check if a valid Pauli channel can have all $d^2$ coefficients $p_{kl}$ as non-zero.\n\nConsider the qudit depolarizing channel, which is a specific type of Pauli channel:\n$\\Lambda_{dep}(\\rho) = (1-q)\\rho + q \\frac{I}{d}$\nThis can be expressed in the Pauli basis as:\n$\\Lambda_{dep}(\\rho) = (1-q+\\frac{q}{d^2})I\\rho I^\\dagger + \\sum_{(k,l)\\neq(0,0)} \\frac{q}{d^2} U_{kl} \\rho U_{kl}^\\dagger$\nFor any $q$ in the range $0 < q \\le 1$, all $d^2$ coefficients $p_{kl}$ are non-zero. The depolarizing channel is a well-defined CPTP map for a wide range of $q$.\n\nSince it is possible to have a valid Pauli channel where all $d^2$ Pauli operators contribute (i.e., all $p_{kl} > 0$), the maximum rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself is $d^2$.\n$r_{max} = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda)_{max} = d^2$.\n\nThis means the dimension of the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ in the minimal Stinespring dilation can be up to $d^2$. Consequently, the output of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ is a matrix that can be up to size $d^2 \\times d^2$.\n\nThe maximal rank of this output matrix $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$ is therefore at most $d^2$. It can indeed reach this value. For a Pauli channel with $r=\\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$ non-zero coefficients, if we choose the input state to be the maximally mixed state, $\\rho = I/d$, the output of the complementary channel is a diagonal matrix with the $r$ probabilities on the diagonal. The rank of this output is $r$.\n\nTherefore, if we choose a Pauli channel with maximal rank ($r = d^2$), the complementary channel can produce an output state of rank $d^2$.\n\nGiven that this interpretation gives a non-constant value that depends on the specific Pauli channel chosen and thus makes sense of the word \"maximal\", it is the most likely intended meaning of the question.\n\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the maximal possible dimension of the environment in the Stinespring dilation, which is equal to the maximal possible Choi rank of $\\Lambda$. This value is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
