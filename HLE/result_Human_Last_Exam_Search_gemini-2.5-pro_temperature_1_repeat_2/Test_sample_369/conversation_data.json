    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must identify the sequence of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, represented as D) and spondees (two long syllables, represented as S) across the six feet of the line. This involves analyzing syllable length (quantity), which is determined by vowel nature or position, and accounting for elisions (the blending or dropping of syllables at word boundaries).\n\nThe scansion of this particular line from Lucretius is as follows:\n\n1.  **vē-r(um)u-bĭ**: The first foot is a **dactyl**. The first syllable, `vē-`, is long by position. The `-um` of `verum` elides with the following `u` of `ubi`. The syllables `u` and `bi` are both short.\n2.  **ē-qu'āt-que**: The second foot is a **spondee**. This requires recognizing poetic license. The initial `e` of `equi` is treated as long. The `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a-` of `atque`. The syllable `āt-` is long by position.\n3.  **hŏ-mĭ-nīs**: The third foot is a **spondee**. The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `h-` of `hominis`. The syllable `hom-` is scanned as long by position, and `-nis` is long by position before the `c` of `casu`.\n4.  **cā-sū cōn-**: The fourth foot is a **spondee**. The `-ū` in the ablative `casū` is long. The syllable `cōn-` from `convenit` is long by position.\n5.  **vē-nĭt ĭ-**: The fifth foot is a **dactyl**. The line uses the perfect tense `convēnit`, making the first syllable long. The second syllable, `-nit`, is short. The `i-` of `imago` is also short, and it follows without elision.\n6.  **mā-gō**: The sixth and final foot is a **spondee**. The syllable `-mā-` is long by nature, and the final syllable `-gō` is treated as long.\n\nTherefore, the scansion pattern for the line is: Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
