a) In the absence of intermolecular interactions, the absorption cross-section σ(ωₗ) as a function of the laser frequency ωₗ is given by the sum of the cross-sections of the individual molecules. For a single molecule, the equation is:

**σ(ωₗ) = C₁ ⋅ ωₗ ⋅ |⟨φբ|μ|φᵢ⟩|² ⋅ exp[ - ( ωᵢf - ωₗ )² τ² ]**

where:
*   C₁ is a proportionality constant.
*   μ is the electric dipole operator.
*   |φᵢ⟩ and |φբ⟩ are the initial and final molecular orbitals, respectively.
*   ωᵢf = (εբ - εᵢ)/ħ is the molecular transition frequency, determined by the orbital energies εᵢ and εբ.
*   τ is the characteristic duration of the Gaussian laser pulse.

b) When near-neighbor interactions are considered, delocalized exciton states are formed. For a linear chain, absorption is typically dominated by the k=0 exciton state. The equation for the absorption cross-section of the entire chain becomes:

**σ(ωₗ) = C₂ ⋅ ωₗ ⋅ N ⋅ |⟨φբ|μ|φᵢ⟩|² ⋅ exp[ - ( ( ωᵢf + 2J/ħ ) - ωₗ )² τ² ]**

where:
*   C₂ is a proportionality constant.
*   N is the number of coherently coupled molecules in the chain.
*   J is the near-neighbor coupling energy.
*   The term N⋅|⟨φբ|μ|φᵢ⟩|² shows the coherent enhancement of the transition strength.
*   The term (ωᵢf + 2J/ħ) shows that the absorption peak is shifted by the interaction energy.
