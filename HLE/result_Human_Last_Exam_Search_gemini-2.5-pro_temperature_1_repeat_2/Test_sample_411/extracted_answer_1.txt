(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order of code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is 1.
*   The diversity order of code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is 1.
*   The diversity order of code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is 2.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
*   Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity, as it is the only code among the three to achieve full diversity order of 2.
