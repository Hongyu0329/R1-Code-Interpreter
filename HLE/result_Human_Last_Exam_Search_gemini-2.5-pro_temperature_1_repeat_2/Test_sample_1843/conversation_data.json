    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the structure of the conductor and the properties of the characters.\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo each of the prime power factors of $N$.\nSo, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ must be of the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. We require:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $k_i$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5\\}$ must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n### 4. Counting the Choices for Each Component Character\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($p^a = 2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since $2|6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1. (Order is $k_1=2$)\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($p^a = 3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The orders of these 4 characters are the divisors of 6 that are not divisors of $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, the primitive characters have orders 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So, all 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: 4.\n\n*   **Modulo 7 ($p=7$)**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(7)} = C_6$. A character is primitive if its conductor is 7, which is true for all characters except the principal character (which has conductor 1). The orders of the primitive characters are the divisors of 6, except 1. These orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    All these orders divide 6. So, the total number of valid choices is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_3$: 5.\n\n*   **Modulo 11 ($p=11$)**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(11)} = C_{10}$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, and 10. We need the order to divide 6. The only possibility is order 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1. (Order is $k_4=2$)\n\n*   **Modulo 13 ($p=13$)**: The group of characters is $C_{\\phi(13)} = C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of valid choices is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_5$: 5.\n\n### 5. Verifying the LCM Condition\nWe have selected component characters $\\chi_i$ such that their orders $k_i$ all divide 6. We must ensure their lcm is exactly 6.\n*   The order of $\\chi_1$ is $k_1=2$. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   The choices for $\\chi_2$ are characters of order 3 or 6. In either case, the order $k_2$ is a multiple of 3. This ensures the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is exactly 6 for any combination of the selected characters.\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nTotal Number = (Choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_5$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
