    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002. This is due to its radioactive nature and short half-life.\n\nThe noble gases, a group of elements in the periodic table, include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). Generally, the abundance of these gases on Earth decreases as their atomic number increases.\n\nOf the stable noble gases, xenon is the least abundant. In the Earth's atmosphere, xenon has a concentration of about 0.0000087%. The atmospheric abundances of the other stable noble gases are significantly higher: argon at approximately 0.934%, neon at 0.0018%, krypton at 0.000114%, and helium at 0.00052%. Argon is also the most abundant noble gas within the Earth's crust, with a concentration of about 0.00015%.\n\nHowever, radon is far rarer than xenon. Radon is a radioactive element with no stable isotopes; its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in rocks and soil. Because it decays so rapidly, its concentration in the environment remains exceedingly low at any given time. For instance, the mass concentration of radon in the atmosphere is estimated to be around 6 x 10⁻¹⁷ percent.\n\nThe relative abundances of the noble gases do not change significantly from year to year, so the situation in 2002 would have been the same as it is today. While xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, radon's inherent instability and rapid decay make it the least abundant noble gas overall as a percentage of the Earth's total matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
