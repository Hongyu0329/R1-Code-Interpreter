    "An upper bound for the norm of an ideal in a number field in relation to the covolume of its ring of integers is given by Minkowski's bound. This bound is a fundamental result in algebraic number theory and has significant implications, including the proof of the finiteness of the class number of a number field.\n\nA squarefree natural number, denoted by $N$, is an integer that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. Such numbers are fundamental in defining quadratic number fields, of the form $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. The properties of these fields, including the upper bound in question, depend on whether $N$ is positive or negative.\n\nThe covolume of the ring of integers $O_K$ of a number field $K$, when embedded as a lattice in a specific real vector space, is proportional to the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, $\\sqrt{|D_K|}$.\n\nMinkowski's bound, $M_K$, guarantees that every ideal class in the ideal class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal $I$ with a norm $N(I)$ that satisfies:\n\n$N(I) \\leq M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|D_K|}$\n\nHere:\n*   $n$ is the degree of the number field.\n*   $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex embeddings of $K$.\n*   $D_K$ is the discriminant of the number field $K$.\n\nFor a quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree integer, the degree is $n=2$. The values of $r_2$ and $D_K$ depend on $N$:\n\n*   **Case 1: Real Quadratic Field ($N > 0$)**\n    *   In this case, there are two real embeddings and no complex embeddings, so $r_2 = 0$.\n    *   The discriminant $D_K$ is $N$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $4N$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$.\n    *   The Minkowski bound simplifies to:\n        $M_K = \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|D_K|} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{D_K}$\n\n*   **Case 2: Imaginary Quadratic Field ($N < 0$)**\n    *   Here, there are no real embeddings and one pair of complex embeddings, so $r_2 = 1$.\n    *   The discriminant $D_K$ is $N$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $4N$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$. Note that $D_K$ will be negative.\n    *   The Minkowski bound is:\n        $M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^1 \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|D_K|} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sqrt{|D_K|}$\n\nThus, the upper bound for the norm of an ideal in a quadratic field defined by a squarefree integer $N$ is directly proportional to the square root of the discriminant, which is a measure of the covolume of the ring of integers.\n\n<<<For a real quadratic field ($N>0$), the upper bound is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{D_K}$, and for an imaginary quadratic field ($N<0$), the upper bound is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{|D_K|}$, where $D_K$ is the discriminant of the field.>>>"
