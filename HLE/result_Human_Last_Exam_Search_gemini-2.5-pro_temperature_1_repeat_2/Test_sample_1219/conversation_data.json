    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the periodicity of the tangent function**: The tangent function, tan(x), has a period of π. This means that tan(x) = tan(x + nπ) for any integer n. Consequently, to find tan(10^100), we can first calculate the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This is expressed as 10^100 mod π.\n\n2.  **Calculate the argument**: The value of 10^100 mod π is given by the formula `{10^100 / π} * π`, where `{x}` denotes the fractional part of a number x.\n\n3.  **Determine the fractional part**: To find the fractional part of 10^100 / π, we need to look at the decimal expansion of 1/π. Multiplying 1/π by 10^100 shifts the decimal point 100 places to the right. The fractional part of the resulting number is determined by the digits of 1/π that are to the right of the 100th decimal place.\n\n4.  **High-precision calculation of 1/π**: A high-precision calculation of 1/π is required. Using computational tools, the decimal expansion of 1/π begins as:\n    0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128974953346881177935933901234557938363264257741822...\n    The digits starting from the 101st decimal place are `760665...`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the value for the tangent function**: The fractional part `{10^100 / π}` is therefore approximately `0.760665...`. Let's call this value `f`. The argument of the tangent function is `x = f * π`.\n    x ≈ 0.760665 * π ≈ 0.760665 * 3.14159265... ≈ 2.38972... radians.\n\n6.  **Compute the final tangent value**: We now calculate the tangent of this value.\n    tan(2.38972...) ≈ -0.92746...\n\nThe first three digits after the decimal point are 9, 2, and 7.\n\n<<<927>>>"
