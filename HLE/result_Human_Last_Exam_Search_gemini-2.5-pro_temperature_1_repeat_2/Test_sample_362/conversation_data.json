    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, the carbonyl group of pivalaldehyde reacts with the ylide (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n\nThe key transformation in the Wittig reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom with the carbon group from the ylide.\n\nThe reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, which has the structure (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows: the double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the carbon atom that was double-bonded to phosphorus in the ylide. This results in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe structure of the resulting alkene is:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry, the ylide used is a non-stabilized ylide because the carbon atom attached to the phosphorus is bonded to an alkyl group, not an electron-withdrawing group. Typically, reactions with non-stabilized ylides favor the formation of the (Z)-alkene (cis isomer). However, the significant steric hindrance from the bulky t-butyl group of pivalaldehyde may influence the stereoselectivity, potentially favoring the more thermodynamically stable (E)-alkene (trans isomer). Therefore, a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers is the likely outcome.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
