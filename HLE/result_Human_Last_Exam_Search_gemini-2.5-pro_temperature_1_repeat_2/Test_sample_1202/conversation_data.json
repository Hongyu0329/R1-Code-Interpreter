    "After a gene is duplicated, it can have several fates. The question asks for the mechanism most likely responsible for both the *retention* of the two copies and their functional *divergence*.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene sequence replaces another homologous sequence, leading to homogenization between the duplicated genes. This process generally works *against* divergence, although it can play complex roles in the evolution of gene families. It is not the primary mechanism for divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. While this represents divergence (one copy is functional, the other is not), it does not result in the *retention* of two functional genes.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a new, beneficial function. This mechanism directly explains both the retention of the two copies (as both are now essential, one for the old function and one for the new) and their divergence.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism involves the partitioning of the ancestral gene's functions between the two new copies. Both copies accumulate mutations that degrade different aspects of the original function, making both copies necessary to carry out the complete ancestral role. Like neofunctionalization, this clearly explains both the retention of the pair and their divergence as they specialize.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary event where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is a macro-evolutionary pattern, not a specific molecular mechanism for the retention of a particular gene pair.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the correct and primary mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. The key difference is whether a novel function is created (neofunctionalization) or existing functions are partitioned (subfunctionalization). Some models suggest that subfunctionalization can act as an intermediate step that preserves duplicate genes from being lost, which then allows time for neofunctionalization to occur. Because subfunctionalization can occur through neutral, complementary loss-of-function mutations—which are more common than specific, advantageous gain-of-function mutations—it is often considered a highly likely pathway for the initial retention of duplicate genes. However, both C and D are valid and important mechanisms. Without further context to favor one over the other, and recognizing both as key processes, we must choose the best fit. Both describe a pathway to retention and divergence. In many contexts, subfunctionalization is presented as a crucial, common step that saves duplicates from extinction, thus making it a very likely mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
