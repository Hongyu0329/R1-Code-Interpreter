**A. Key requirements:**
The primary goals for the liquid crystal material are:
*   A molecular structure based on a single benzene ring core.
*   The material should exhibit nematic or smectic liquid crystal phases.
*   Phase transition temperatures should be close to room temperature, approximately 20-25Â°C.

**B. Suggested molecular design:**
To achieve a rod-like shape, which is conducive to forming calamitic liquid crystal phases, the molecule should be designed as follows:
*   **Core structure:** A single benzene ring serves as the rigid central unit.
*   **Substitution pattern:** Terminal groups should be placed at the para positions (1 and 4) of the benzene ring to create a linear molecular geometry.

**C. Recommended molecular features:**
The properties of the liquid crystal are determined by the functional groups attached to the core:
*   A flexible alkyl chain (e.g., CnH2n+1-) should be attached to one end of the ring. This feature helps to lower the melting point and promote liquid crystallinity.
*   A polar group, such as cyano (-CN), fluoro (-F), or methoxy (-OCH3), should be at the other end to create a strong dipole moment, which enhances the intermolecular interactions necessary for mesophase stability.
*   To further adjust the transition temperatures, small lateral substituents like fluorine (-F) or a methyl group (-CH3) can be attached to the side of the benzene ring. These groups increase the molecule's width, which can disrupt crystal packing and lower the melting point.

**D. Specific example structure:**
A useful reference point is the well-known room-temperature liquid crystal 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB). While 5CB has a two-ring (biphenyl) core, a design for a single-ring analogue would be 1-cyano-4-pentylbenzene.

**E. The general structure would be:**
Following the design principles above, the general chemical formula for the target molecule is:
CnH2n+1-Ph-CN
(where Ph represents the 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring)

**F. To achieve room temperature transitions:**
An iterative approach is used to fine-tune the transition temperatures:
*   A good starting point for the alkyl chain is a pentyl (n=5) or hexyl (n=6) group.
*   The clearing point (the transition from the liquid crystal phase to the isotropic liquid) can be adjusted by changing the alkyl chain length. In many homologous series, increasing the chain length tends to lower the clearing temperature. Longer chains also promote the formation of more ordered smectic phases.
*   If the transition temperatures are still not in the desired range, lateral substituents can be introduced to lower them further.
