    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided molecular formula and ¹³C NMR data, the structure of the hydrocarbon can be determined.\n\n### Analysis of the Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C₇H₁₄):** The general formula for a saturated alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond (an alkene) or one ring (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the characteristic range for alkene carbons (typically 100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond and rules out a cycloalkane structure.\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, meaning they exist in identical electronic environments. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one peak might represent these two equivalent carbons.\n    *   **Signal Multiplicity (DEPT or Off-Resonance Decoupling):**\n        *   **145 (s):** A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). Its position in the alkene region means it's part of the C=C bond.\n        *   **112 (t):** A triplet (t) signifies a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift points to it being the other carbon in the C=C bond, specifically a terminal `=CH₂` group.\n        *   **48 (t):** A triplet (t) in the alkane region corresponds to a saturated CH₂ group.\n        *   **27 (d):** A doublet (d) indicates a saturated CH group.\n        *   **22 (q):** A quartet (q) indicates a CH₃ (methyl) group.\n        *   **21 (q):** Another quartet (q) points to a second, non-equivalent CH₃ group.\n\n### Deducing the Structure:\n\nFrom the data, we can identify the following fragments:\n*   A disubstituted double bond: `>C=CH₂` (from the 145s and 112t signals).\n*   An ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃` (from the 48t and one of the quartet signals).\n*   An isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂` (from the 27d and the other quartet signal, which must represent two equivalent methyl carbons).\n\nAssembling these pieces around the quaternary carbon of the double bond gives the following structure:\n```\n      CH₂-CH₃\n     /\nH₂C=C\n      \\\n       CH(CH₃)₂\n```\nThis structure is consistent with all the data: it has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, and the carbon environments match the NMR signals.\n\n### IUPAC Nomenclature:\n\nTo name the compound, we follow IUPAC rules:\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** Identify the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond. In this case, there are two possibilities of equal length (4 carbons):\n    *   Following the ethyl group gives a chain with an isopropyl substituent.\n    *   Following the isopropyl group gives a chain with an ethyl and a methyl substituent.\n2.  **Select the principal chain:** When there is a tie in length, choose the chain with the most substituents. The second option gives two substituents.\n3.  **Number the chain:** Start numbering from the end that gives the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n4.  **Name the substituents:** The substituents are an ethyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C3.\n\nThe resulting IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. This is confirmed by a PubChem entry for this compound (CID 81818), which has the molecular formula C₇H₁₄ and lists references to its NMR spectra.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
