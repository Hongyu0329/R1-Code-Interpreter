    "The word encoded in the provided `verbatim` block is **FUN**.\n\nThis is a visual puzzle where the letters are formed by the character 't'. The structure of the code block lays out the word, with the 't's acting as the \"ink\" and the 'b's as \"blank space\". The letters are stylized and can be seen by observing the placement of the 't's across the different lines.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the letters are formed:\n\n*   **F:** The first letter is an 'F'. Its vertical line is formed by the 't's at the beginning of the first, fifth, and seventh lines. The two horizontal bars of the 'F' are formed by the 't's on the first and seventh lines.\n\n*   **U:** The second letter is a 'U'. Its shape is created by the cluster of 't's in the middle. The top of the 'U' is the `t t t t` on the first line, the bottom curve is represented by the `t t t t` on the last line, and the two `t`'s in the middle on the seventh line hint at the bottom of the curve.\n\n*   **N:** The third letter is an 'N'. Its structure is formed by the 't's on the right side. The two vertical strokes are suggested by the right-aligned `t`'s on lines 10 and 11, and the diagonal stroke is implied by the arrangement of the `t`'s on the right side of the top and bottom lines.\n\nWhen viewed as a whole, the pattern of 't's visually spells out the word \"FUN\".\n\n<<<FUN>>>"
