    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, can be found using a procedure analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers. This involves performing successive right divisions and finding the last non-zero remainder. A common method to achieve this is to use row operations on a compound matrix formed by stacking the two matrices.\n\nLet the given polynomial matrices be:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nWe form a compound matrix M by stacking P1 and P2:\nM = [s^2 + s, -s;\n     -s^2 - 1, s^2;\n     s, 0;\n     -s - 1, 1]\n\nThe goal is to reduce this matrix to a simpler form using elementary row operations, where the rows are treated as polynomial vectors. The resulting non-zero rows will form the GCRD.\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\n1.  Perform `R1 -> R1 - (s+1) * R3`:\n    `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [0, -s;\n     -s^2 - 1, s^2;\n     s, 0;\n     -s - 1, 1]\n\n2.  Perform `R2 -> R2 + s * R3`:\n    `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [0, -s;\n     -1, s^2;\n     s, 0;\n     -s - 1, 1]\n\n3.  Perform `R4 -> R4 + R3`:\n    `[-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]`\n    The matrix is now:\n    [0, -s;\n     -1, s^2;\n     s, 0;\n     -1, 1]\n\n4.  Let's rearrange the rows for easier manipulation, swapping R1 with R4:\n    [-1, 1;\n     -1, s^2;\n     s, 0;\n     0, -s]\n\n5.  Perform `R2 -> R2 - R1`:\n    `[-1, s^2] - [-1, 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]`\n    Perform `R3 -> R3 + s * R1`:\n    `[s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [-1, 1;\n     0, s^2 - 1;\n     0, s;\n     0, -s]\n\n6.  Perform `R4 -> R4 + R3`:\n    `[0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]`\n    Perform `R2 -> R2 - (s-1) * R3`:\n    `[0, s^2 - 1] - (s-1)[0, s] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2 + s] = [0, s - 1]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [-1, 1;\n     0, s - 1;\n     0, s;\n     0, 0]\n\n7.  Perform `R3 -> R3 - R2`:\n    `[0, s] - [0, s - 1] = [0, 1]`\n    The matrix is now:\n    [-1, 1;\n     0, s - 1;\n     0, 1;\n     0, 0]\n\n8.  Perform `R1 -> R1 - R3`:\n    `[-1, 1] - [0, 1] = [-1, 0]`\n    Perform `R2 -> R2 - (s-1) * R3`:\n    `[0, s - 1] - (s-1)[0, 1] = [0, s - 1 - s + 1] = [0, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [-1, 0;\n     0, 0;\n     0, 1;\n     0, 0]\n\nAfter removing the zero rows and reordering, we are left with:\nG = [-1, 0;\n      0, 1]\n\nThis matrix G is a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2. The GCRD is unique up to a left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). The determinant of our resulting G is -1, which is a non-zero constant, confirming it is unimodular.\n\nAny unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case. By convention, the identity matrix is often used as the canonical representation. To obtain the identity matrix, we can multiply our result by `[-1, 0; 0, 1]` on the left.\n\n`[-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n"
