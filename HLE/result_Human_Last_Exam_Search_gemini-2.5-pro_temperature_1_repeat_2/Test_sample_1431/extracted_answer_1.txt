The force \( F \) is given by the expression \( F = mg + \frac{mv^2}{l} \). This is derived from considering the two components of the force at the instant the rope leaves the ground: the force to support the weight of the rope (\(mg\)) and the force to impart upward momentum to the part of the rope being lifted (\(\frac{mv^2}{l}\)).
