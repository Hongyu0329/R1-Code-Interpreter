    "The island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay that shares the town's name, which is formed on a volcanic island with a caldera, is Hanga Roa.\n\nHanga Roa is the main town and capital of Easter Island, a territory of Chile located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. In the Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\". The town is situated on the bay of the same name.\n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, being over 1,900 kilometers away. The island is of volcanic origin and features several extinct volcanoes, including Terevaka and Rano Kau. Hanga Roa is located in the lowlands between these two volcanoes. Rano Kau has a large and well-defined summit caldera. While Hanga Roa Bay itself is not a caldera, the town sits on this bay on a volcanic island renowned for its calderas.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
