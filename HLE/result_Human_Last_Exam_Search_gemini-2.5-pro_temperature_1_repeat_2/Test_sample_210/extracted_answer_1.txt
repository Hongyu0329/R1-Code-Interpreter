While an exact number of destitute migrants cannot be specified, records show that by 1817, 804 families had settled on the Talbot grant. The population of the settlement had grown to approximately 20,000 immigrants by 1826. Colonel Talbot's claimed acreage exceeded his original 5,000-acre land grant by more than 60,000 acres, with his personal holdings reaching over 65,000 acres by 1821.
