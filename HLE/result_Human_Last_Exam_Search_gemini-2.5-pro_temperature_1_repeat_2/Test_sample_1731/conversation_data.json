    "The initial search has provided a good foundation, establishing that large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff are indeed used to analyze the statistical mechanics of Bose gases, including photons. The search results confirm that these theorems provide a rigorous framework for understanding equilibrium properties and fluctuations.\n\nSpecifically, result and are from the same research paper which directly addresses the application of these theorems to a Bose gas of photons to reproduce the results of Bose and Planck. It connects the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy to the probability of spatial distributions and the Cramér-Chernoff theorem to the probability of internal energy distributions. It also states that at thermodynamic equilibrium, the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy is maximized, while the Cramér-Chernoff large deviation function is minimized. This confirms the core idea of how these theorems are applied.\n\nResults and provide the standard textbook definitions and thermodynamic properties of a photon gas, such as its zero chemical potential and the formulas for mean energy and entropy in terms of temperature and volume. These will be the target expressions to be justified by the large deviation framework.\n\nResult explains the historical and conceptual link between Boltzmann's work, Sanov's theorem, and equilibrium statistical mechanics, reinforcing the idea that large deviation theory provides a formal basis for Boltzmann's insights.\n\nHowever, a detailed, step-by-step derivation of the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the photon gas starting from the formal statements of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems is not explicitly laid out in the search results. While the conceptual connection is clear, the mathematical steps to go from the theorems to the final formulas for U and S are missing.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on bridging this gap. I need to find resources that either show this derivation or provide the necessary intermediate formulas (like the explicit form of the rate functions) that would allow me to construct the derivation.The previous searches have successfully established the conceptual link between large deviation theorems and the statistical mechanics of a photon gas. I have confirmed that Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous foundation for the principle of maximum entropy, which in turn leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (Planck's law). The search results also provide the standard formulas for the mean energy (related to the Stefan-Boltzmann law) and entropy of a photon gas.\n\nHowever, a detailed, step-by-step derivation that starts from the formal statements of the large deviation theorems and arrives at the explicit equilibrium expressions for mean energy and entropy is still missing. While the searches confirm that such a derivation is possible and conceptually sound, they do not provide the explicit mathematical steps. I have the starting point (the theorems) and the end point (the physical laws), but the intermediate derivation is not yet fully illuminated.\n\nFor instance, I need to explicitly formulate the rate function for the empirical distribution of photon occupation numbers (related to Sanov's theorem) and for the empirical mean energy (related to Cramér's theorem) and then show how minimizing these rate functions (which is equivalent to maximizing entropy) under the relevant constraints (like fixed total energy) yields the Planck distribution and the resulting thermodynamic quantities.\n\nTherefore, the next steps will focus on finding resources that detail this specific derivation.The previous searches have established a strong conceptual foundation. I understand that the equilibrium state of a system, such as a photon gas, corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration. Large deviation theory, through Sanov's and Cramér's theorems, quantifies the probability of observing configurations that deviate from this equilibrium state. Minimizing the large deviation rate function is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy, which is the core principle for finding the equilibrium distribution.\n\nI have found a key research paper that explicitly states it uses Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems to reproduce the results of Bose and Planck for a photon gas, confirming the direct applicability of these theorems. The paper also clarifies that the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy acts as the rate function for the spatial/state distribution, while the Cramér-Chernoff theorem provides the rate function for the energy distribution.\n\nHowever, the detailed mathematical steps to perform the minimization of the specific rate functions for the Bose case and derive the explicit forms of the equilibrium entropy and mean energy are not yet fully laid out in the search results. I have the general principle but need to solidify the specific application to the photon gas case, including the explicit form of the rate function for a system of indistinguishable bosons.\n\nThe next steps should focus on obtaining this explicit mathematical derivation. I will aim to find a resource that shows how to set up and solve the constrained minimization problem for the relevant large deviation rate function for a Bose gas to arrive at the Planck distribution, from which the entropy and mean energy can be calculated.I have gathered significant information connecting large deviation theory with the statistical mechanics of a photon gas. The search results, particularly the paper \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators\", explicitly state that Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems can be used to derive the results of Bose and Planck. This confirms the theoretical framework. I also have the standard expressions for the entropy and mean energy of a photon gas from multiple sources.\n\nHowever, the explicit mathematical derivation, starting from the rate function for a Bose gas and performing the constrained minimization to obtain the Planck distribution and subsequently the formulas for entropy and mean energy, is still not laid out in a step-by-step manner in the search results. While the conceptual steps are clear—that minimizing the rate function is equivalent to maximizing entropy—the specific calculations for the bosonic case are what I still need to formulate a complete answer.\n\nI believe I have enough information to construct the argument conceptually, but to provide a more rigorous and detailed answer as requested, I need to find a more explicit derivation of the Planck distribution from the large deviation principle. The next search will be highly targeted to find this missing mathematical link. After this, I should have all the necessary components to answer the user's request.\n\nGiven the highly technical and specific nature of the user's question, providing a complete derivation is essential. I will proceed with one more targeted search to ensure the answer is as thorough and accurate as possible.\nI have successfully gathered the necessary conceptual and mathematical pieces to answer the user's request. The key steps are:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Large Deviation Principle:** Explain that Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems are pillars of Large Deviation Theory (LDT), which provides a rigorous framework for statistical mechanics. The core idea is that the probability of a macroscopic state (e.g., a particular distribution of energy) deviating from equilibrium is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by a \"rate function.\"\n\n2.  **Equilibrium as the Most Probable State:** The equilibrium state of a system is the most probable macroscopic state. In the language of LDT, this is the state that minimizes the rate function.\n\n3.  **Sanov's Theorem and Entropy:** For a system of particles, the empirical distribution of states describes the macroscopic configuration. Sanov's theorem states that the rate function for the empirical distribution is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, between the empirical distribution and the underlying \"true\" distribution. Minimizing this rate function to find the equilibrium state is equivalent to the principle of maximum entropy in statistical mechanics.\n\n4.  **Application to the Photon Gas (Bose Case):**\n    *   The system is a gas of photons (bosons) in a cavity at a certain temperature. The photons can occupy different energy levels `ε_i = hν_i`.\n    *   The macroscopic state is defined by the empirical distribution of occupation numbers `{n_i}` for each energy level `ε_i`.\n    *   A crucial feature of a photon gas in equilibrium with its container is that the number of photons is not conserved, which implies the chemical potential is zero (`μ=0`).\n\n5.  **Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution (Planck's Law):** The equilibrium distribution `{<n_i>}` is found by maximizing the entropy of the system under the constraint of a fixed total mean energy `U`.\n    *   The entropy for a Bose gas is given by:\n        `S = k_B * Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) * ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i * ln(n_i) - g_i * ln(g_i) ]`\n        where `n_i` is the number of photons in the i-th energy bin and `g_i` is the number of states in that bin (degeneracy).\n    *   The total energy is:\n        `U = Σ_i n_i * ε_i`\n    *   Using the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` subject to the constraint on `U` (i.e., `δ(S/k_B - βU) = 0`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier), one arrives at the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean occupation number `<n_i>`:\n        `<n_i>/g_i = 1 / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1)`\n        This is Planck's law for the distribution of photons. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified as `1/(k_B*T)`.\n\n6.  **Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    *   The mean energy `U` is found by summing the energy of each state multiplied by its mean occupation number:\n        `U = Σ_i <n_i> * ε_i = Σ_i g_i * ε_i / (exp(β*ε_i) - 1)`\n    *   To get a concrete value, the sum is converted into an integral over frequencies, using the density of states `g(ν)dV = (8πV/c^3) * ν^2 dν`.\n        `U/V = ∫ (8πhν^3 / c^3) * (1 / (exp(hν/k_BT) - 1)) dν`\n    *   Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n        `U/V = (8π^5 * k_B^4 / (15 * h^3 * c^3)) * T^4 = aT^4`\n\n7.  **Calculating Equilibrium Entropy:**\n    *   The entropy `S` is calculated by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers back into the entropy formula. This can also be derived from the thermodynamic relation `S = (U - F)/T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy (`F = -k_BT * ln(Z)`).\n    *   The logarithm of the grand canonical partition function for a photon gas is:\n        `ln(Z) = -Σ_i g_i * ln(1 - exp(-β*ε_i))`\n    *   From this, one can derive the entropy. The final result is:\n        `S = (4/3) * (U/T) = (4/3) * aVT^3`\n\n8.  **Role of Cramér's Theorem:** While the derivation above primarily uses the logic of Sanov's theorem (maximizing entropy), Cramér's theorem provides a complementary view. It states that the probability of the *mean energy* deviating significantly from its equilibrium value `U` is also governed by a rate function. The equilibrium value `U` is the one that minimizes this energy-specific rate function, reinforcing the conclusion that the system will overwhelmingly be found at the mean energy calculated from the most probable distribution. The theorems are linked by the \"contraction principle,\" which shows that the rate function for a macroscopic observable (like mean energy) can be derived from the rate function for the underlying empirical measure (the distribution of states).\n\nI have all the necessary components and the logical flow to construct the final answer.\n\n### The Equilibrium State of Photon Gas: A Large Deviation Perspective\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a photon gas, which adheres to Bose-Einstein statistics, can be fundamentally understood through the lens of large deviation theory, particularly leveraging the principles established by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics, asserting that the equilibrium state of a system is its most probable macroscopic state, and any significant deviation from this state is exponentially unlikely.\n\n#### Conceptual Framework: Large Deviations and Equilibrium\n\nAt its core, large deviation theory (LDT) quantifies the probability of rare events. For a physical system, the \"rare events\" are macroscopic states (e.g., a specific distribution of energy among particles) that differ from the overwhelmingly likely equilibrium state.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem:** This theorem is concerned with the empirical distribution of microscopic states. It states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution `p` that is different from the true underlying distribution `q` is governed by a rate function given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or relative entropy) `D(p||q)`. In statistical mechanics, this implies that the probability of a system spontaneously arranging into a non-equilibrium distribution of states is exponentially small. The equilibrium distribution is the one that maximizes the entropy.\n\n*   **Cramér's Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability that the sample mean of a set of random variables deviates from the true mean. In our context, this applies to the mean energy of the system. It establishes that the probability of the mean energy `U` deviating from its equilibrium value `⟨E⟩` is also exponentially suppressed, governed by a rate function related to the free energy.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by identifying the most probable configuration, which corresponds to minimizing the large deviation rate function. This process is equivalent to the well-known postulate of statistical mechanics: maximizing the entropy of the system subject to physical constraints. For a photon gas, the key constraints are a fixed total mean energy and the fact that photons are indistinguishable bosons whose particle number is not conserved, leading to a chemical potential of zero.\n\n#### Derivation of the Equilibrium Distribution (Planck's Law)\n\nThe first step is to find the distribution of photons over the available energy levels `εᵢ` that maximizes the entropy for a given total energy `U`. The entropy for a gas of bosons (the \"Bose case\") is given by:\n\n`S = k_B * Σᵢ [ (nᵢ + gᵢ - 1)ln(nᵢ + gᵢ - 1) - nᵢln(nᵢ) - (gᵢ - 1)ln(gᵢ - 1) ]`\n\nwhere `nᵢ` is the number of photons in the energy level `εᵢ` and `gᵢ` is the degeneracy (the number of states with that energy). For a large number of states `gᵢ >> 1`, this simplifies to:\n\n`S ≈ k_B * Σᵢ [ (nᵢ + gᵢ)ln(nᵢ + gᵢ) - nᵢln(nᵢ) - gᵢln(gᵢ) ]`\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution `<nᵢ>`, we maximize this entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `U = Σᵢ nᵢεᵢ`. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers with `β = 1/(k_B T)` as the multiplier for the energy constraint, we find the distribution that minimizes the large deviation rate function (and thus maximizes entropy):\n\n`<nᵢ> = gᵢ / (exp(βεᵢ) - 1)`\n\nThis is the celebrated **Planck distribution**, which describes the average number of photons in each energy state at thermal equilibrium.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy (Stefan-Boltzmann Law)\n\nWith the equilibrium distribution established, the mean energy `U` of the photon gas is calculated by summing the energy of each state weighted by its average occupation number. It is standard to convert this sum into an integral over a continuous spectrum of frequencies `ν`, where the energy of a photon is `ε = hν`. The density of states `g(ν)dν` (the number of available modes in a volume `V` between frequencies `ν` and `ν + dν`) for photons is given by:\n\n`g(ν)dν = (8πV / c³)ν² dν`\n\nThe total mean energy is then:\n`U = ∫ <n(ν)> hν dν = ∫ ( (8πV / c³)ν² ) * (hν / (exp(hν / k_B T) - 1)) dν`\n\n`U/V = (8πh / c³) ∫ (ν³ / (exp(hν / k_B T) - 1)) dν`\n\nSolving this integral yields the famous **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the energy density (`u = U/V`):\n\n`u = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) T⁴ = aT⁴`\n\nwhere `a` is the radiation constant. This shows that the equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.\n\n#### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe equilibrium entropy `S` can be calculated by substituting the Planck distribution back into the entropy formula. An alternative and more direct thermodynamic approach is to use the relationship between entropy, internal energy `U`, and Helmholtz free energy `F`, where `S = (U - F) / T`. The free energy is derived from the grand canonical partition function `Z`. For a photon gas:\n\n`ln(Z) = -Σᵢ gᵢ ln(1 - exp(-βεᵢ))`\n\nFrom this, the entropy can be derived, and the result is directly related to the mean energy `U`:\n\n`S = (4/3) * (U/T) = (4/3) * aVT³`\n\nThus, the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature.\n\nIn conclusion, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems provide the formal justification for the principle of maximum entropy. By applying this principle to a system of bosons with zero chemical potential (the photon gas), we derive the Planck distribution as the unique, overwhelmingly probable equilibrium state. From this distribution, the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy are determined to be `U = aVT⁴` and `S = (4/3)aVT³`, respectively.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):** The equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n`U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴`\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is the Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light. The energy density `u = U/V` is thus proportional to `T⁴`.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):** The equilibrium entropy of the photon gas is:\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³`\nThis can be expressed in terms of the mean energy as `S = (4/3) * (U/T)`.\n>>>"
