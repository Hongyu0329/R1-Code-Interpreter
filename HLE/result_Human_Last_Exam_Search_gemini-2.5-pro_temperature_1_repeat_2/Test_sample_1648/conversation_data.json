    "Recent breakthroughs in algebraic K-theory, particularly the work of Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus, have provided powerful tools to understand the structure of K-groups for rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. These results indicate that for such rings, the even-indexed K-groups vanish for sufficiently high degrees.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}/3^3$, we can apply the specific theorems developed in this new framework. The K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ are 3-primary torsion groups. A key result provides a condition for the vanishing of the even K-groups. According to Theorem 2.5 of the announcement by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus, the syntomic cohomology group $H^2_{syn}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k, \\mathbb{Z}_p(i))$ vanishes for $i \\ge p \\cdot \\lfloor \\frac{k-1}{p-1} \\rfloor + 1$. The vanishing of this cohomology group implies the vanishing of the corresponding even K-group, $K_{2(i-1)}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. The condition for vanishing becomes:\n$i \\ge 3 \\cdot \\lfloor \\frac{3-1}{3-1} \\rfloor + 1 = 3 \\cdot \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor + 1 = 4$.\n\nThis means that for $i \\ge 4$, the group $K_{2(i-1)}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero. Let $n = i-1$. The condition on $n$ is $n+1 \\ge 4$, which implies $n \\ge 3$. Therefore, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for all $n \\ge 3$. This includes $K_6(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, $K_8(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, and all subsequent even-indexed K-groups.\n\nNow we must check the K-groups for $n < 3$.\n*   For $n=1$, we consider $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. Here $i=2$, which does not satisfy $i \\ge 4$, so the vanishing theorem does not apply.\n*   For $n=2$, we consider $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. Here $i=3$, which also does not satisfy $i \\ge 4$, so again, the group is not expected to be zero.\n\nTo confirm that $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is indeed nonzero, we can refer to another result from the same body of work. For the range of indices where the even K-groups do not vanish, there is a relationship between the orders of consecutive K-groups:\n$\\frac{\\#K_{2i-1}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; \\mathbb{Z}_p)}{\\#K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; \\mathbb{Z}_p)} = p^{i(k-1)}$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ and $n=2$ (which corresponds to $i=3$), this formula is:\n$\\frac{\\#K_5(\\mathbb{Z}/27)}{\\#K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)} = 3^{3(3-1)} = 3^6 = 729$.\n\nSince the odd-indexed K-groups $K_{2n+1}$ are generally non-trivial in this range, we can expect $\\#K_5(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be a positive integer. For the ratio to be a well-defined positive number, the denominator $\\#K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ must also be a non-zero integer. Thus, $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is not zero.\n\nSince $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero and $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for all $n \\ge 3$, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
