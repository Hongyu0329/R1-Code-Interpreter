    "The next number in the sequence is 124.\n\nThis sequence is based on the number of days in a month, but with a twist. Each number represents the total number of days from the beginning of a year, alternating between a standard year and a leap year, corresponding to the end of each month.\n\nThe sequence is constructed as follows:\n*   **111:** April (30) + March (31) + February (28) + January (31) in a standard year, starting from April.\n*   **142:** May (31) + April (30) + March (31) + February (29) in a leap year, starting from May.\n\nThe full logic is not straightforward and appears to be a custom-made puzzle rather than a standard mathematical sequence. The provided answer is based on the continuation of the most recent pattern found within the sequence which is a repetition of the number 124.\n\n<<<124>>>"
