    "The space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. To find the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we need to calculate them from the metric.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ is given by:\n$ds^2 = -(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r})c^2dt^2 + (1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r})^{-1}dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)$\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are calculated from the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ using the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}g^{\\rho\\sigma}(\\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma})$\n\nDue to the symmetries of the Schwarzschild metric (it is time-independent and spherically symmetric), many of the Christoffel symbols will be zero. The non-zero components of the metric are diagonal, and they depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$.\n\nBy calculating the Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric, we find that there are 9 unique non-zero symbols. These are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\Gamma^t_{rt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta}$\n\nIt is important to note that due to the symmetry of the lower indices of the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), some of these represent the same value. The list above accounts for this symmetry. Some sources might list 13 non-zero symbols if they count the symmetric pairs separately. However, the number of independent, non-zero Christoffel symbols is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
