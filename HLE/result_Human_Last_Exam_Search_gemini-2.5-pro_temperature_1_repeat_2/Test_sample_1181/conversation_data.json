    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is deeply affected by his separation from Earth and misses the sound of rustling leaves.\n\nWhile a direct quote explicitly stating he is \"ashamed\" of missing this specific sound is not present, his actions and dialogue throughout the film point to his profound sense of loss and longing for his home planet. A key scene shows Kris attaching strips of paper to the air vents within the space station, a deliberate act to replicate the sound of leaves rustling in the wind. This action serves as a poignant visual and auditory representation of his nostalgia and the sterile, unnatural environment of the Solaris station.\n\nFurthermore, the theme of shame is directly linked to Kelvin's character. In a conversation, he utters the line, \"Shame, the feeling that will save mankind.\" This, combined with his attempts to recreate a piece of Earth's sensory experience, strongly implies that he is the character who feels this complex emotion tied to his homesickness.\n\n<<<A>>>"
