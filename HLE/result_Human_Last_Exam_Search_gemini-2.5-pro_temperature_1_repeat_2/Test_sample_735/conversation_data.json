    "## The Finite Groups Hosting Smallest Maximal Product-Free Sets\n\n**An infinite number of finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.** This is a consequence of a classification of such groups, which reveals that their orders are bounded and they fall into specific families.\n\nA \"product-free set\" within a group is a collection of elements where the product of any two elements (including an element with itself) is not in the set. A \"maximal by inclusion product-free set\" is a product-free set that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property.\n\nResearch by Giudici and Hart, later completed by Anabanti and Hart, established a significant constraint on the size of a group that can host a maximal product-free set of size 3. They proved that if a group *G* contains such a set, then the order of *G* must be less than or equal to 24. This finding drastically narrows down the search for these groups.\n\nThe classification of these groups reveals that they belong to several well-known families of finite groups, including cyclic groups, dihedral groups, and dicyclic groups (also known as generalized quaternion groups). For instance, the cyclic group of order 12, denoted as C12, and the dicyclic group of order 24, denoted as Q24, are examples of groups that contain maximal product-free sets of size 3.\n\nSince there are infinitely many prime numbers, and for many of these, one can construct a finite group of an order less than or equal to 24 (for example, cyclic groups of various orders), and since it has been shown that groups of specific small orders within this bound do contain these sets, it follows that there is an infinite number of such finite groups. While the orders of the groups are bounded, the variety of groups that can be constructed within those orders is not.\n\nThe study of these small maximal product-free sets is part of a broader effort to understand the structure of product-free sets in both abelian (where they are often called sum-free sets) and non-abelian groups. The classification for sets of size 1 and 2 has also been completed, and research continues for sets of size 4 and larger.\n\n<<<An infinite number of finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.>>>"
