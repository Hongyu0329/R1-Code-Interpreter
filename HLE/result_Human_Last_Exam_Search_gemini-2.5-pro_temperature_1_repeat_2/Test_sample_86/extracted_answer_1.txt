The minimum total number of prototypes required is given by the formula:

Total Prototypes = (N+1) * k_min

where k_min is the smallest integer `k` that satisfies the inequality:

cos(π/k) > 1 - 1/(2N)

This can be expressed as:

k_min = floor(π / arccos(1 - 1/(2N))) + 1

Therefore, the final expression for the minimum total number of prototypes is:

(N+1) * (floor(π / arccos(1 - 1/(2N))) + 1)
