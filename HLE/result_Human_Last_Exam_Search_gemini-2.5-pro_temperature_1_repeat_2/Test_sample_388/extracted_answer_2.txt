A pharmacist could counsel Allison on several key points. Firstly, her headache could be a side effect of her new medications, Fluoxetine and/or Atorvastatin, as headache is a common initial side effect for both. Secondly, the smell of sea water itself can be a trigger for headaches in sensitive individuals. The pharmacist should also advise caution with the use of Excedrin. Its aspirin component, when combined with Fluoxetine, can increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, she should use it sparingly and be aware of any signs of unusual bleeding. Finally, the pharmacist should provide brief counseling on each of her medications, including other potential side effects to watch for, the importance of adherence, and specific warnings such as the increased risk of blood clots with Junel Fe if she smokes, and the potential for muscle pain with Atorvastatin.
