    "This is a cellular automaton problem. The state of each cell in the next generation (the output) is determined by its current state and the state of its 8 neighbors (including diagonals).\n\nFirst, let's deduce the rules from the given examples. We'll denote the number of neighbors with value 0, 1, and 2 as `n0`, `n1`, and `n2` respectively.\n\n**1. Rule for cells with value '1'**\nIn both `Input_A` -> `Output_A` and `Input_B` -> `Output_B`, every cell with the value `1` remains a `1`.\n*   **Rule 1: A cell with value `1` always stays `1`.**\n\n**2. Rule for cells with value '2'**\n*   In `Input_A`, the cell at `(1,1)` is `2`. Its neighbors are two `0`s and six `1`s (`n0=2, n1=6, n2=0`). It becomes `0`.\n*   In `Input_B`, the cell at `(3,6)` is `2`. Its neighbors are four `0`s and three `1`s (`n0=4, n1=3, n2=0`). It also becomes `0`.\nIn both cases, the cell `2` becomes `0` when it has zero neighbors with the value `2`.\n*   **Rule 2: A cell with value `2` becomes `0` if it has no neighbors with value `2` (`n2 == 0`).**\n\n**3. Rule for cells with value '0'**\nThis is the most complex rule. Let's analyze the cases.\n*   `Input_A[0][0]` is `0` and becomes `2`. Its neighbors are one `0`, one `1`, and one `2` (`n0=1, n1=1, n2=1`).\n*   `Input_B[2][7]` is `0` and becomes `2`. Its neighbors are four `0`s, three `1`s, and one `2` (`n0=4, n1=3, n2=1`).\n*   `Input_A[0][1]` is `0` and stays `0`. Its neighbors are one `0`, three `1`s, and one `2` (`n0=1, n1=3, n2=1`).\n*   Other `0`s that stay `0` (like `Input_B[1][2]`) have no `2`s as neighbors (`n2=0`).\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that a `0` can only become a `2` if it has exactly one `2` as a neighbor (`n2 == 1`). However, this is not sufficient, as `Input_A[0][1]` shows. We need an additional condition.\n\nLet's compare the cases where `n2=1`:\n*   `0` -> `2`: (`n0=1, n1=1, n2=1`) and (`n0=4, n1=3, n2=1`)\n*   `0` -> `0`: (`n0=1, n1=3, n2=1`)\n\nThe pattern is that the cell stays `0` only in the specific case where `n0=1` and `n1=3`. If the neighbor count is anything else (while `n2=1`), it becomes `2`.\n*   **Rule 3: A cell with value `0` becomes `2` if `n2 == 1` AND (`n0 != 1` OR `n1 != 3`). Otherwise, it stays `0`.**\n\n**Applying the rules to Input_C**\n\nInput_C Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 2 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nWe will now calculate the new value for each cell.\n\n*   **Cells with value '1'**: All cells in the bottom row (`111111`) and the three `1`s in the middle row will remain `1`.\n*   **Cell `(1,4)` (value `2`)**: Neighbors are four `0`s and four `1`s. `n2=0`. According to Rule 2, it becomes `0`.\n*   **Cells with value '0'**:\n    *   `(0,3)`: Neighbors are two `0`s, two `1`s, one `2` (`n0=2, n1=2, n2=1`). Rule 3 applies: `n2==1` is true, and (`n0 != 1` or `n1 != 3`) is true. It becomes `2`.\n    *   `(0,4)`: Neighbors are three `0`s, one `1`, one `2` (`n0=3, n1=1, n2=1`). Rule 3 applies: `n2==1` is true, and (`n0 != 1` or `n1 != 3`) is true. It becomes `2`.\n    *   `(0,5)`: Neighbors are two `0`s, zero `1`s, one `2` (`n0=2, n1=0, n2=1`). Rule 3 applies: `n2==1` is true, and (`n0 != 1` or `n1 != 3`) is true. It becomes `2`.\n    *   `(1,0)`: Neighbors are two `0`s, three `1`s (`n0=2, n1=3, n2=0`). `n2` is not 1. Stays `0`.\n    *   `(1,5)`: Neighbors are two `0`s, two `1`s, one `2` (`n0=2, n1=2, n2=1`). Rule 3 applies: `n2==1` is true, and (`n0 != 1` or `n1 != 3`) is true. It becomes `2`.\n    *   The remaining `0`s (`(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`) do not have any `2`s as neighbors, so they stay `0`.\n\n**Constructing the Output**\n\n*   **Row 0**: `000` followed by `222` -> `000222`\n*   **Row 1**: `0`, `111`, `0`, `2` -> `011102`\n*   **Row 2**: `111111` -> `111111`\n\nCombining these rows gives the final answer.\n\n<<<000222,011102,111111>>>"
