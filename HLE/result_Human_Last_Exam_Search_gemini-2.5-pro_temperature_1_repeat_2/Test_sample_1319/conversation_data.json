    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is **Mount Ida on Crete**.\n\nHomer's epic poem references several significant mountains, both as settings for divine intervention and as geographical markers. After the abode of the gods, Mount Olympus, the highest of these is Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which stands at an impressive 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). This mountain is famously known in Greek mythology as the birthplace of Zeus.\n\nAnother notable mountain called Ida, located in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) near the site of Troy, is also prominently featured in the *Iliad*. It was from the summit of this Mount Ida that the gods were said to have watched the Trojan War unfold. This Anatolian peak, also known as Kaz Dağı, has an elevation of approximately 1,770 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nOther mountains mentioned in the epic include:\n*   **Mount Athos**, a peninsula in northeastern Greece, which reaches an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). It is mentioned by Homer and was a significant landmark in antiquity.\n*   **Mount Pelion** in Thessaly, the mythical home of the Centaurs. The wood for Achilles' famous spear was said to have come from this mountain. Its highest peak is 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n*   **Mount Saos** (also called Fengari) on the island of Samothrace, rises to 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). According to the *Iliad*, the sea god Poseidon watched the Trojan War from its summit.\n\nWhile several mountains play a role in the narrative of the *Iliad*, the Cretan Mount Ida is the tallest among them, second only to Mount Olympus itself.\n\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
