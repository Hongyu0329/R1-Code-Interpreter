    "In a barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/21.\n\nA 10-node barbell graph is typically constructed by joining two complete graphs of 5 nodes (K5) with a single edge. This connecting edge is referred to as the bottleneck edge.\n\nTo calculate the probability of sampling this specific edge, we first need to determine the total number of edges in the graph.\n\nA complete graph with 'n' nodes has n(n-1)/2 edges. For a K5, the number of edges is:\n5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n\nSince the barbell graph consists of two K5 graphs, the total number of edges in these two cliques is:\n2 * 10 = 20 edges.\n\nIn addition to the edges within the two complete graphs, there is the single bottleneck edge that connects them. Therefore, the total number of edges in the 10-node barbell graph is:\n20 (from the two K5 cliques) + 1 (the bottleneck edge) = 21 edges.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, each edge has an equal probability of being selected. Given that there is only one bottleneck edge, the probability of sampling it is 1 divided by the total number of edges.\n\nProbability = 1 / 21\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
