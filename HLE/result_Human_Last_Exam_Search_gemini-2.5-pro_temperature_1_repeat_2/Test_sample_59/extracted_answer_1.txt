The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) between nodes \(i\) and \(j\) is given by the value of a symmetric, measurable function \(W(U_i, U_j)\), where \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are latent variables drawn independently from a uniform measure \(U\) on \(\) for each node. The function \(W\), known as a graphon, is itself a random function whose distribution is determined by the random measure \(F\). Therefore, the probability is \(P(y_{ij} = 1 | U_i, U_j, W) = W(U_i, U_j)\).
