    "To determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we first need to identify the fundamental group of the complement of this knot and then use this to find the fundamental group of the double branched cover.\n\n### The Knot and its Complement's Fundamental Group\n\nThe knot in question is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a 2-sphere ($S^2$) embedded in the 4-sphere ($S^4$). Let's denote this knot by $K$. The fundamental group of the complement of this knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$, was famously studied by E.C. Zeeman.\n\nAccording to Zeeman's work, the complement of the k-twist-spun knot of the trefoil fibers over the circle $S^1$. For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the fundamental group of the complement is the direct product of the fundamental group of the fiber and the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. The fiber is the punctured 5-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot. The fundamental group of the (unpunctured) 5-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil is the binary dodecahedral group, often denoted $I^*$ or $G$. This group has order 120.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot is:\n$\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$\nwhere $G$ is the binary dodecahedral group.\n\n### The Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover\n\nLet $X$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the knot $K$. A standard result in knot theory states that the fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(X)$, is obtained by taking the quotient of the fundamental group of the knot complement by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element.\n\nIn the case of a fibered knot like the 5-twist-spun trefoil, a meridian corresponds to a generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}$ factor in the fundamental group of the complement. Let this generator be $t$. Since the group is a direct product, $t$ is central. The relation to be added is $t^2 = 1$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong (G \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle t^2 \\rangle$\n\nSince $t$ is central, the normal subgroup generated by $t^2$ is simply the subgroup of even integers. The quotient group is therefore:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong G \\times (\\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\n### Minimal Number of Generators\n\nThe final step is to determine the minimal number of generators for the group $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n1.  **The Binary Dodecahedral Group ($G$)**: This group has a well-known presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^5 = y^3 = (xy)^2 \\rangle$. It is a perfect group and can be generated by two elements, for example, $x$ and $y$. Thus, the minimal number of generators for $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is 2.\n\n2.  **The Cyclic Group of Order 2 ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$)**: This group is generated by one element. So, $d(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = 1$.\n\n3.  **The Direct Product ($G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$)**: We need to find the minimal number of generators for this product group. Let the generators of $G$ be $x$ and $y$, and the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ be $a$. The group $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ consists of pairs $(g, z)$ where $g \\in G$ and $z \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nConsider the set of two elements: $\\{(x, a), (y, e)\\}$, where $e$ is the identity in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   From these, we can generate $(y,e)$.\n*   We can also generate $(x,a)$.\n*   Let's see if we can generate the individual generators of each component group. Consider $(x,a)^2 = (x^2, a^2) = (x^2, e)$. We can also form $(x,a)^5 = (x^5, a^5) = (e, a)$. Since we have $(e,a)$, which generates the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ part, we can then obtain $(x,e) = (x,a)(e,a)^{-1} = (x,a)(e,a)$. With $(x,e)$ and $(y,e)$, we can generate all of $G \\times \\{e\\}$. As we also have $(e,a)$, we can generate the entire group $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nTherefore, the set $\\{(x, a), (y, e)\\}$ with two elements is a generating set. Can the group be generated by a single element? No, because $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is not a cyclic group (it's not even abelian). Thus, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\nThere are some sources that state the double branched cover of an odd-twist-spun knot is the 4-sphere $S^4$. If this were the case, the fundamental group would be trivial, and the minimal number of generators would be 0. However, the calculation based on the established structure of the knot group of the complement leads to the non-trivial group $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The latter approach is based on foundational and widely cited papers in the field.\n\nBased on the standard and well-documented method for calculating the fundamental group of a branched cover, the result is $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
