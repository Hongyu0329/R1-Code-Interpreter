    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), two isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands in the starting complex, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, by the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. The resulting product is a tris-chelate ruthenium(II) complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`, where L represents the new ligand.\n\nThis type of octahedral complex, which contains three bidentate ligands, is inherently chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers. These enantiomers are designated as delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ). Since the ligands 2,2'-bipyridine and 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole are both symmetrical, no geometric isomers (like *mer* or *fac*) are possible. Therefore, the reaction yields two stereoisomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
