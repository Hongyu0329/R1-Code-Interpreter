    "A hyperelliptic curve given by the equation `z² = f(x)` has **good reduction** at an odd prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. The curve has **ordinary reduction** if its `p`-rank (a term related to the number of points on the curve over finite fields) is equal to its genus. The question asks for the curve that has \"good ordinary reduction above 2,\" which implies for all odd primes `p`.\n\nA rigorous analysis of each option reveals the following:\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** The discriminant has prime factors of 3 and 5, so it has bad reduction at these primes.\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** The discriminant is a power of 5, leading to bad reduction at p=5. Furthermore, it is known to have supersingular reduction (the opposite of ordinary) for primes `p` such that `p ≡ 2, 3, or 4 (mod 5)`.\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** The discriminant has a prime factor of 3, causing bad reduction. It also has supersingular reduction for primes `p ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** The discriminant of the polynomial `2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1` is 87696, which factors into `2⁴ * 3³ * 7 * 29`. Therefore, this curve has bad reduction at primes 3, 7, and 29.\n*   **E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵:** The discriminant of `4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x` is `-5135296 = -2⁶ * 80239`. It has bad reduction at the large prime 80239.\n\nBased on a strict interpretation of the question (\"for all primes p > 2\"), none of the options have good reduction everywhere. This suggests a potential ambiguity in the question's phrasing. However, if one were to analyze the behavior at small primes like `p=3` and `p=5`, curve E is the only one that has good and ordinary reduction at both, whereas curve D, for instance, has bad reduction at `p=3` and supersingular reduction at `p=5`.\n\nGiven the standard context of such problems in algebraic geometry, the question is likely flawed or implies a very specific theoretical context not readily apparent. However, based on the calculation of discriminants, curve D has several odd primes of bad reduction (3, 7, 29).\n\n<<<D>>>"
