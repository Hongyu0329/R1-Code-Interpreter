    "The user wants to find the probability of a particle in a 1D box being in a specific small interval.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Identify the system:** Particle in a 1D box of length 'a'.\n2.  **Identify the state:** The particle is in the n=2 state.\n3.  **Identify the interval:** From x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a.\n4.  **Recall the formula for probability:** The probability P of finding the particle in the interval [x1, x2] is given by the integral of the probability density |ψ(x)|² over that interval.\n    P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψ(x)|² dx\n5.  **Recall the wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box:** The normalized wavefunction is ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a).\n6.  **Write the specific wavefunction for n=2:** ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a).\n7.  **Calculate the probability density for n=2:** |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a).\n8.  **Set up the integral:**\n    P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n9.  **Approximate the integral:** Since the interval is very small (0.01a) and centered at x = 0.5a, we can approximate the integral by assuming the probability density is constant over this small interval. The value of the probability density at the center of the interval (x = 0.5a) can be used.\n    P ≈ |ψ₂(0.5a)|² * Δx\n    where Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a.\n10. **Calculate the probability density at x = 0.5a:**\n    |ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a)/a)\n    |ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * sin²(π)\n    |ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * (0)² = 0.\n11. **Re-evaluate the approximation:** The center of the interval is a node for n=2, where the probability is zero. This means the approximation of a constant probability density is not ideal, as the function is changing rapidly from zero. A more accurate approach is needed. However, let's consider the shape of the sin²(2πx/a) function. It looks like a sine wave squared, with a node at x=a/2. The function is symmetric around its peaks, but near a node, it is increasing.\n\n12. **Solve the integral directly:**\n    P = (2/a) ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] sin²(2πx/a) dx\n    Use the identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\n    P = (2/a) ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n    P = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n    P = (1/a) * [(0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a))]\n    P = (1/a) * [0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))]\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π))\n    Using sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ):\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\n    P = 0.01 - (1/4π)(2sin(0.02π))\n    P = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\n13. **Use the small angle approximation:** For small θ, sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n    0.02π is a small angle.\n    sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.02π\n    P ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π)(0.02π)\n    P ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 = 0.\n\nThis seems incorrect. Let's re-check the approximation step.\n\nThe approximation P ≈ |ψ(x_center)|² * Δx is good if the function is flat. Here, the function is zero at the center.\n\nLet's use a Taylor expansion of the probability density around x = a/2.\nf(x) = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a)\nf(a/2) = 0\nf'(x) = (2/a) * 2sin(2πx/a) * cos(2πx/a) * (2π/a) = (8π/a²)sin(2πx/a)cos(2πx/a) = (4π/a²)sin(4πx/a)\nf'(a/2) = (4π/a²)sin(2π) = 0\nf''(x) = (4π/a²) * cos(4πx/a) * (4π/a) = (16π²/a³)cos(4πx/a)\nf''(a/2) = (16π²/a³)cos(2π) = 16π²/a³\n\nSo the Taylor expansion around x = a/2 is:\nf(x) ≈ f(a/2) + f'(a/2)(x-a/2) + (f''(a/2)/2)(x-a/2)²\nf(x) ≈ (1/2) * (16π²/a³) * (x-a/2)²\nf(x) ≈ (8π²/a³)(x-a/2)²\n\nNow, integrate this approximation from 0.495a to 0.505a.\nLet u = x - a/2, so dx = du.\nThe limits become -0.005a to 0.005a.\nP ≈ ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] (8π²/a³)u² du\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) [u³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³]\nP ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005)³ * a³\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25e-7)\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 52.638 * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.57975e-6\n\nLet's re-do the direct integration calculation, as the approximation might have been wrong.\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nsin(0.02π) = sin(0.06283) ≈ 0.06281\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * 0.06281\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.15915 * 0.06281\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.009995\nP ≈ 0.000005\n\nThe direct integration and the Taylor expansion seem to agree. Let's recalculate the Taylor expansion more carefully.\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 52.6378 * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nLet's re-do the integral calculation.\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a) - (a/4π)sin(4π*0.505) - (0.495a) + (a/4π)sin(4π*0.495) ]\nP = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π))\nsin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(2π - 0.02π) = sin(-0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (2 * sin(0.02π))\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\nThis part is correct.\n\nNow, let's use a calculator for sin(0.02π).\n0.02 * π = 0.06283185\nsin(0.06283185) = 0.062791\nP = 0.01 - (1 / (2 * π)) * 0.062791\nP = 0.01 - 0.159155 * 0.062791\nP = 0.01 - 0.0099905\nP = 9.5e-5\n\nSomething is wrong. Where did the Taylor expansion go wrong?\nf(x) ≈ (8π²/a³)(x-a/2)²\nP = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (8π²/a³)(x-a/2)² dx\nP = (8π²/a³) ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] u² du\nP = (8π²/a³) [u³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP = (8π²/3a³) [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\nP = (8π²/3a³) [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³ ]\nP = (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP = (16 * π² / 3) * (1/200)³\nP = (16 * π² / 3) * (1 / 8,000,000)\nP = (2 * π² / 3) * (1 / 1,000,000)\nP = (2 * 9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁶\nP = 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶\n\nLet's re-evaluate the integral result.\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\nThis must be wrong. The probability cannot be negative.\nLet's check the integral of cos.\n∫ cos(bx) dx = (1/b)sin(bx)\nb = 4π/a\nSo ∫ cos(4πx/a) dx = (a/4π)sin(4πx/a). This is correct.\n\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = [ (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a) ] from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = [ (0.505) - (1/4π)sin(4π*0.505) ] - [ (0.495) - (1/4π)sin(4π*0.495) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nWait, sin(x) ≈ x - x³/6 for small x.\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.02π - (0.02π)³/6\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ 0.02π - (0.02π)³/6 ]\nP ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)² / 12 ]\nP ≈ (0.02π)² / 12\nP ≈ (0.0004 * π²) / 12\nP ≈ (0.0004 * 9.8696) / 12\nP ≈ 0.00394784 / 12\nP ≈ 0.0003289\n\nLet's check the Taylor expansion result again.\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25e-7)\nP ≈ 52.6378 * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nLet's re-do the approximation from the integral result more carefully.\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 + ... ]\nP = 0.01 - 0.01 + (1/2π) * (0.02π)³/6\nP = (1/2π) * (0.000008π³) / 6\nP = 0.000004π² / 6\nP = (4e-6 * π²) / 6\nP = (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶\nP = (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶\nP = 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶\n\nThe results now match. The first-order approximation `sin(x) ~ x` was not sufficient. The third-order expansion is needed.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nLet's try the initial approximation method again, but this time averaging the function over the interval. Since it is a parabola-like shape near the node, the average value is not simply the midpoint.\nThe integral of f(x) from a to b is (b-a) * average_value.\nWe calculated the integral as P = (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶\nThe interval width is Δx = 0.01a.\nWait, the P has no 'a' in it.\n\nLet's revisit the probability density function:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\nThe integral is:\nP = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\nLet u = x/a, du = dx/a.\nP = ∫[0.495, 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πu) du\nUse sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2\nP = ∫[0.495, 0.505] 2 * (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πu)) du\nP = ∫[0.495, 0.505] (1 - cos(4πu)) du\nP = [u - (1/4π)sin(4πu)] from 0.495 to 0.505\nP = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π)[sin(4π*0.505) - sin(4π*0.495)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - sin(-0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[2sin(0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nUsing Taylor expansion for sin(x) = x - x³/6:\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]\nP ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)² / 12 ]\nP ≈ (0.02π)² / 12\nP ≈ (0.0004 * π²) / 12\nP ≈ (π² / 3) * 10⁻⁴\nP ≈ (9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁴\nP ≈ 3.2898 * 10⁻⁴\n\nWhere did I make a mistake in the previous calculation?\nP = (1/2π) * (0.02π)³/6\nP = (1/2π) * (8e-6 * π³) / 6\nP = (4e-6 * π²) / 6\nP = (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶\nAh, (0.02)³ = 8e-6, not 4e-6.\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nLet's re-evaluate:\nP ≈ (0.02π)² / 12 = (0.0004 * π²) / 12 = (4e-4 * π²) / 12 = (π²/3) * 1e-4 = 3.289 * 1e-4\n\nLet's check the Taylor expansion of the function itself again.\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25e-7)\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 52.6378 * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.5797 e-6\n\nThere is a discrepancy. Let's trace back.\nP = ∫[0.495, 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πu) du\nLet's approximate the integrand. Let v = u - 0.5, so u = v + 0.5.\nThe limits are -0.005 to 0.005.\nIntegrand = 2 * sin²(2π(v+0.5)) = 2 * sin²(2πv + π)\nsin(θ + π) = -sin(θ), so sin²(θ+π) = sin²(θ).\nIntegrand = 2 * sin²(2πv)\nFor small v, sin(2πv) ≈ 2πv.\nIntegrand ≈ 2 * (2πv)² = 8π²v²\nP ≈ ∫[-0.005, 0.005] 8π²v² dv\nP ≈ 8π² [v³/3] from -0.005 to 0.005\nP ≈ (8π²/3) [ (0.005)³ - (-0.005)³ ]\nP ≈ (8π²/3) [ 2 * (0.005)³ ]\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the integral calculation with the expansion of sin.\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nLet's use a calculator directly.\n0.02 * π = 0.06283185...\nsin(0.06283185) = 0.062791...\nP = 0.01 - (1/(2π)) * 0.062791\nP = 0.01 - 0.0099905...\nP = 9.44 x 10⁻⁵\n\nThe two methods are giving different results. Let's find the error.\n\nLet's re-check the integral of the approximation.\nThe probability density is |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a).\nLet x = a/2 + δ, where δ is small.\n|ψ₂(a/2 + δ)|² = (2/a)sin²(2π(a/2 + δ)/a)\n= (2/a)sin²(π + 2πδ/a)\n= (2/a)sin²(2πδ/a)\nFor small arguments, sin(y) ≈ y.\n≈ (2/a) * (2πδ/a)² = (8π²/a³)δ²\nThe probability is the integral of this from δ = -0.005a to δ = 0.005a.\nP ≈ ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] (8π²/a³)δ² dδ\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) [δ³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * 2 * (0.005)³ * a³\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25e-7\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\nThis approximation seems robust.\n\nNow, what is wrong with the other calculation?\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nIs there a problem with the precision of the calculator or my subtraction?\nLet's use a high-precision calculator.\n0.01 - (sin(0.02 * pi) / (2 * pi)) = 9.44486... x 10⁻⁵\nThe results are genuinely different.\nLet's re-check the integral evaluation.\nP = [u - (1/4π)sin(4πu)] from 0.495 to 0.505\nThis seems to be the source of the problem.\nThe approximation P ≈ |ψ(x_center)|² * Δx is simpler.\nLet's try that.\nx_center = 0.5a.\n|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a)sin²(π) = 0.\nSo P ≈ 0 * 0.01a = 0.\nThis approximation is too simple because the function is zero at the center.\n\nLet's take the value at the edge of the interval, say 0.505a.\n|ψ₂(0.505a)|² = (2/a)sin²(2π*0.505) = (2/a)sin²(1.01π) = (2/a)sin²(0.01π)\nsin(0.01π) ≈ 0.01π\n|ψ₂(0.505a)|² ≈ (2/a)(0.01π)² = (2/a) * 0.0001π²\nP ≈ |ψ₂(0.505a)|² * Δx = (2/a) * 0.0001π² * 0.01a = 2 * 10⁻⁶ * π² ≈ 19.7 x 10⁻⁶.\nThis is also different.\n\nLet's assume the probability density is a triangle in this small region.\nThe peak height is at x=0.505a, which is |ψ₂(0.505a)|² ≈ (2/a) * (0.01π)².\nThe base of the triangle is 0.01a.\nThe area would be (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * (0.01a) * [(2/a) * (0.01π)²] * (something for both sides)\nLet's stick to the Taylor expansion of the integrand, which seems the most reliable method.\n\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³ = 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nWhy is the direct integral calculation P = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π) giving a different answer?\nLet's re-derive it one more time.\nP = ∫[0.495, 0.505] (1 - cos(4πu)) du\nP = [u] from 0.495 to 0.505 - ∫[0.495, 0.505] cos(4πu) du\nP = 0.01 - [ (1/4π)sin(4πu) ] from 0.495 to 0.505\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ sin(4π*0.505) - sin(4π*0.495) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ sin(0.02π) - sin(-0.02π) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [ 2sin(0.02π) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nThe derivation seems flawless.\nLet's re-calculate the value.\n0.01 - sin(0.02*pi)/(2*pi) = 9.444863e-5\n\nLet's re-calculate the Taylor series approximation.\nP ≈ (16 * pi^2 / 3) * (0.005)^3 = 6.5797e-6.\n\nThere is an order of magnitude difference. Let me check my Taylor series of sin²(x).\nf(u) = 2sin²(2πu).\nCenter u₀ = 0.5.\nf(0.5) = 2sin²(π) = 0.\nf'(u) = 2 * 2sin(2πu)cos(2πu) * 2π = 8πsin(2πu)cos(2πu) = 4πsin(4πu).\nf'(0.5) = 4πsin(2π) = 0.\nf''(u) = 4π * cos(4πu) * 4π = 16π²cos(4πu).\nf''(0.5) = 16π²cos(2π) = 16π².\nf'''(u) = -16π²sin(4πu) * 4π = -64π³sin(4πu).\nf'''(0.5) = 0.\nf''''(u) = -64π³cos(4πu) * 4π = -256π⁴cos(4πu).\nf''''(0.5) = -256π⁴.\n\nThe Taylor expansion of the integrand f(u) around u=0.5 is:\nf(u) ≈ f(0.5) + f'(0.5)(u-0.5) + (f''(0.5)/2!)(u-0.5)² + (f'''(0.5)/3!)(u-0.5)³ + (f''''(0.5)/4!)(u-0.5)⁴\nf(u) ≈ (16π²/2)(u-0.5)² - (256π⁴/24)(u-0.5)⁴\nf(u) ≈ 8π²(u-0.5)² - (32π⁴/3)(u-0.5)⁴\n\nNow integrate this. Let v = u - 0.5. Limits are -0.005 to 0.005.\nP ≈ ∫[-0.005, 0.005] (8π²v² - (32π⁴/3)v⁴) dv\nP ≈ [ (8π²/3)v³ - (32π⁴/15)v⁵ ] from -0.005 to 0.005\nThe v⁵ term will be much smaller. Let's just use the v² term first.\nP ≈ (8π²/3) * [ (0.005)³ - (-0.005)³ ] = (16π²/3)(0.005)³ ≈ 6.58e-6.\n\nNow let's calculate the correction term.\nCorrection = -(32π⁴/15) * [ (0.005)⁵ - (-0.005)⁵ ] = -(64π⁴/15) * (0.005)⁵\nCorrection = -(64π⁴/15) * 3.125e-12 ≈ -(64*97.4/15) * 3.125e-12 ≈ -1.3e-9.\nSo the first term of the Taylor series is very accurate.\n\nSo, the problem must be in the \"exact\" calculation.\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nMaybe I am making a thinking error somewhere.\nLet's consider the function g(x) = x - (1/k)sin(kx).\nIf k is large, and x is small.\ng(x) ≈ x - (1/k)(kx - (kx)³/6) = x - (x - k²x³/6) = k²x³/6.\nHere, our function is evaluated at the difference.\nLet's call F(u) = u - (1/4π)sin(4πu).\nWe want to calculate F(0.505) - F(0.495).\nLet's use the Taylor expansion of F(u) around u=0.5.\nF(u) ≈ F(0.5) + F'(0.5)(u-0.5) + (F''(0.5)/2)(u-0.5)² + (F'''(0.5)/6)(u-0.5)³ + ...\nF'(u) = 1 - cos(4πu)\nF'(0.5) = 1 - cos(2π) = 0.\nF''(u) = 4πsin(4πu)\nF''(0.5) = 4πsin(2π) = 0.\nF'''(u) = 16π²cos(4πu)\nF'''(0.5) = 16π²cos(2π) = 16π².\nF(u) ≈ F(0.5) + (16π²/6)(u-0.5)³ = F(0.5) + (8π²/3)(u-0.5)³.\nNow, let's calculate F(0.505) - F(0.495).\nF(0.505) ≈ F(0.5) + (8π²/3)(0.005)³\nF(0.495) ≈ F(0.5) + (8π²/3)(-0.005)³ = F(0.5) - (8π²/3)(0.005)³\nF(0.505) - F(0.495) ≈ 2 * (8π²/3)(0.005)³ = (16π²/3)(0.005)³.\nThe result is the same as the integral of the Taylor-expanded integrand. P ≈ 6.58e-6.\n\nSo why is `0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)` wrong?\nAh, it is a numerical precision issue.\n0.01 is a number. (1/2π)sin(0.02π) is a number very close to 0.01.\nsin(x) = x - x³/6 + x⁵/120 - ...\n(1/2π)sin(0.02π) = (1/2π) [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 + (0.02π)⁵/120 - ...]\n= 0.01 - (0.02π)²/12 + (0.02π)⁴/240 - ...\n= 0.01 - (0.0004π²)/12 + ...\n= 0.01 - (π²/3) * 10⁻⁴ + ...\nSo, P = 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (π²/3) * 10⁻⁴ + ... ]\nP ≈ (π²/3) * 10⁻⁴ ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁴.\n\nI keep getting different powers of 10.\nLet's redo P ≈ (16π²/3)(0.005)³.\n(0.005)³ = (5e-3)³ = 125e-9.\nP ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 125e-9\nP ≈ 52.6378 * 125e-9\nP ≈ 6579.7 e-9 = 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's re-check the expansion of the \"exact\" formula.\nP = F(0.505) - F(0.495) ≈ (16π²/3)(0.005)³.\nF(u) = u - (1/4π)sin(4πu)\nF'(u) = 1 - cos(4πu)\nF''(u) = 4πsin(4πu)\nF'''(u) = 16π²cos(4πu)\nLet f(x) = F(c+x) - F(c-x).\nf(x) ≈ [F(c) + xF'(c) + x²F''(c)/2 + x³F'''(c)/6] - [F(c) - xF'(c) + x²F''(c)/2 - x³F'''(c)/6]\nf(x) ≈ 2xF'(c) + (x³/3)F'''(c)\nHere, c = 0.5, x = 0.005.\nF'(0.5) = 0.\nF'''(0.5) = 16π².\nSo, f(0.005) ≈ (0.005³/3) * 16π² = (1.25e-7 / 3) * 16π² = (20e-7 / 3)π² = (20/3)π² * 10⁻⁷ = 6.66... * 9.86... * 10⁻⁷ = 6.58e-6.\n\nAll roads lead to P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\nThe calculation `P = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)` is correct in principle, but suffers from catastrophic cancellation, also known as loss of significance. The two numbers being subtracted are almost equal.\n`0.01`\n`sin(0.02*pi)/(2*pi) = 0.009990555...`\nThe difference is `0.000009444...` = 9.44 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nWait, 9.44e-6 and 6.58e-6 are still not that close. Where is the discrepancy?\nLet's check the Taylor expansion again.\nP = (16π²/3)(0.005)³ ≈ 6.58e-6.\n\nLet's check the direct evaluation again.\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.06283185) / (2π)\nP = 0.01 - 0.06279052 / 6.283185\nP = 0.01 - 0.00999342\nP = 0.00000658\nP = 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nMy previous calculation using the calculator was wrong.\n`0.01 - sin(0.02*pi)/(2*pi) = 6.5797e-6`\nThe issue was my calculator usage or transcription. Now the direct calculation and the approximation match.\n\nSo the steps are:\n1.  Write down the probability formula: P = ∫|ψ|² dx\n2.  Write down the integrand: |ψ₂|² = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a)\n3.  Set up the definite integral: P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a)sin²(2πx/a) dx\n4.  Solve the integral. The antiderivative of (2/a)sin²(2πx/a) is (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a).\n5.  Evaluate the definite integral: [ (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a) ] from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n6.  Plug in the limits and calculate the final value.\n\nLet's do it carefully now.\nLet I = (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a).\nUpper limit: x = 0.505a\nI_upper = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(4π * 0.505a / a) = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)\nLower limit: x = 0.495a\nI_lower = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(4π * 0.495a / a) = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)\nP = I_upper - I_lower\nP = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(2π + 0.02π) - sin(2π - 0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\nUsing a calculator:\n0.02 * π ≈ 0.06283185\nsin(0.06283185) ≈ 0.06279052\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / 6.283185) * 0.06279052\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.1591549 * 0.06279052\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.009993420\nP ≈ 0.00000658\nSo, P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nAlternative method: approximation.\nP ≈ |ψ₂(x_avg)|² * Δx. This is not good as the function is not constant.\nP ≈ (Area of triangle) - also not great as the function is not linear.\nP ≈ ∫ (Taylor series of integrand) dx - this worked and gave the same result.\nP ≈ Taylor expansion of the evaluated integral - this also worked and gave the same result.\n\nThe probability is very small, which is expected as the interval is small and centered on a node where the probability density is zero.\n\nThe question is simple enough that I do not need to perform any more searches. I have the formula, the wave function, and the method to solve it. I've double and triple-checked my work. I am ready to provide the final answer.The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box in a given interval is determined by integrating the probability density, |ψ(x)|², over that interval. The length of the box is denoted by 'a'.\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box for a given quantum number *n* is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the state n = 2, the wavefunction is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is therefore:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding the particle in the interval from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a. This probability (P) is calculated by the integral of the probability density over this interval:\nP = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\nLet θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\nP = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * [1/2 * (1 - cos(4πx/a))] dx\nP = (1/a) ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nIntegrating the expression gives:\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the given limits:\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = [ (x/a) - (1/4π)sin(4πx/a) ] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = [ 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π) ] - [ 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π) ]\nP = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing the properties of the sine function, sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ):\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation for P:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nTo get a numerical value, we can use a calculator:\n0.02π ≈ 0.06283\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06279\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1 / (2 * 3.14159)) * 0.06279\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099934\nP ≈ 0.0000066\n\nSince the interval is very small and centered around x = 0.5a, which is a node for n=2 (a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero), we expect the probability to be very small.\n\nA more precise calculation gives:\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
