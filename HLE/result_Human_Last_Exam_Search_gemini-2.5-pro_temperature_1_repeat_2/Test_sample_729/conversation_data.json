    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by Q_128. Its structure is defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nA power subgroup, denoted as Gᵏ, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group G. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of Q_128, we analyze Gᵏ for different integer values of k.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of `a`, which form a cyclic subgroup < a > of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form `aⁱx`, where `0 ≤ i < 64`. These elements have an order of 4, since (aⁱx)² = aⁱ(xaⁱx⁻¹)x² = aⁱ(a⁻ⁱ)x² = x² = a³².\n\nWe can categorize the values of k:\n\n### Case 1: k is an odd integer\nFor any element `g` in Q_128, its order |g| is a power of 2. Since k is odd, the greatest common divisor gcd(k, |g|) = 1. This implies that the subgroup generated by gᵏ is the same as the subgroup generated by g (<gᵏ> = <g>). Therefore, the subgroup generated by all k-th powers, Gᵏ, will be the entire group G itself.\nSo, for any odd k, Gᵏ = Q_128. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n\n### Case 2: k is an even integer\nLet k be an even integer. We can write k = 2ʲm, where j ≥ 1 and m is an odd integer.\nThe power subgroup Gᵏ is generated by the set {gᵏ | g ∈ Q_128}. We need to evaluate gᵏ for the two types of elements:\n*   For elements of the form `aⁱ`: (aⁱ)ᵏ = aⁱᵏ. The set of all such elements generates the subgroup <aᵏ> = <a²ʲ>.\n*   For elements of the form `aⁱx`: (aⁱx)ᵏ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵏᐟ² = (a³²)ᵏᐟ² = a¹⁶ᵏ = a¹⁶(²ʲm) = aᵐ²ʲ⁺⁴.\n\nSo, the power subgroup Gᵏ is generated by <a²ʲ> and aᵐ²ʲ⁺⁴.\n\nLet's examine the distinct subgroups that arise for different values of j:\n*   **j = 1** (k = 2m): Gᵏ = <a², a³²ᵐ> = <a², a³²>. Since a³² is a power of a², this simplifies to <a²>, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n*   **j = 2** (k = 4m): Gᵏ = <a⁴, a⁶⁴ᵐ> = <a⁴, 1> = <a⁴>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n*   **j = 3** (k = 8m): Gᵏ = <a⁸, a¹²⁸ᵐ> = <a⁸, 1> = <a⁸>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   **j = 4** (k = 16m): Gᵏ = <a¹⁶, a²⁵⁶ᵐ> = <a¹⁶, 1> = <a¹⁶>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **j = 5** (k = 32m): Gᵏ = <a³², a⁵¹²ᵐ> = <a³², 1> = <a³²>. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   **j = 6** (k = 64m): Gᵏ = <a⁶⁴, a¹⁰²⁴ᵐ> = <1, 1> = {1}. This is the trivial subgroup.\n\nFor any j > 6, the resulting power subgroup will also be the trivial subgroup.\n\nThe set of distinct power subgroups of Q_128 is:\n1.  Q_128 (for k odd)\n2.  <a²> (a cyclic group of order 32)\n3.  <a⁴> (a cyclic group of order 16)\n4.  <a⁸> (a cyclic group of order 8)\n5.  <a¹⁶> (a cyclic group of order 4)\n6.  <a³²> (a cyclic group of order 2)\n7.  {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we find there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
