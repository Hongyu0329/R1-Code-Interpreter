    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space `X` in a Banach space `B` is 0.\n\nAn isometric embedding is a function `f` from a metric space `X` to another metric space `B` that preserves the distances between points. That is, for any two points `x₁` and `x₂` in `X`, the distance `d(x₁, x₂)` must be equal to the distance between their images in `B`, `d(f(x₁), f(x₂))`. A Banach space is a complete normed vector space, where the distance is given by the norm of the difference between two vectors: `d(a, b) = ||a - b||`.\n\nTo show that the smallest possible number of such embeddings is zero, it is sufficient to provide an example of a finite ultrametric space `X` and a Banach space `B` for which no such embedding exists.\n\n**Example:**\n\n1.  **The Finite Ultrametric Space `X`**:\n    Let `X` be a set with three distinct points, `{p₁, p₂, p₃}`. We can define a metric `d` on `X` as follows:\n    *   `d(pᵢ, pᵢ) = 0` for any `i`.\n    *   `d(pᵢ, pⱼ) = 1` for any `i ≠ j`.\n\n    This space `(X, d)` is a finite ultrametric space because it satisfies the strong triangle inequality, `d(x, z) ≤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z))`. For any three distinct points, the inequality becomes `1 ≤ max(1, 1)`, which is true.\n\n2.  **The Banach Space `B`**:\n    Let `B` be the set of real numbers `ℝ`, with the standard norm `||x|| = |x|`. The space `(ℝ, |·|)` is a well-known Banach space.\n\n3.  **Proof of Non-existence of an Isometric Embedding**:\n    An isometric embedding `f` from `X` to `B` would require finding three real numbers, `b₁ = f(p₁)`, `b₂ = f(p₂)`, and `b₃ = f(p₃)`, that satisfy the following distance conditions:\n    *   `||b₁ - b₂|| = |b₁ - b₂| = d(p₁, p₂) = 1`\n    *   `||b₂ - b₃|| = |b₂ - b₃| = d(p₂, p₃) = 1`\n    *   `||b₁ - b₃|| = |b₁ - b₃| = d(p₁, p₃) = 1`\n\n    Let's try to find such numbers. Assume, without loss of generality, that `b₁ = 0`.\n    *   From `|b₁ - b₂| = 1`, we have `|0 - b₂| = 1`, which means `b₂ = 1` or `b₂ = -1`.\n    *   Let's take `b₂ = 1`.\n    *   Now we must satisfy both `|b₂ - b₃| = 1` and `|b₁ - b₃| = 1`.\n        *   `|1 - b₃| = 1` implies `1 - b₃ = 1` (so `b₃ = 0`) or `1 - b₃ = -1` (so `b₃ = 2`).\n        *   `|0 - b₃| = 1` implies `b₃ = 1` or `b₃ = -1`.\n    *   The possible values for `b₃` from the first condition (`{0, 2}`) and the second condition (`{1, -1}`) have no overlap. Therefore, there are no three points in `ℝ` that are all at a distance of 1 from each other.\n\nSince no such function `f` exists, the number of isometric embeddings from this specific finite ultrametric space `X` into the Banach space `ℝ` is 0. Because the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
