    "To find the number of stable equilibrium points, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. So we need to solve the equation:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $-x$, we get:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around each equilibrium point.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n- If $x$ is slightly greater than 0 (e.g., $x = 0.1$), then $f(x) = -0.1(0.1-1)^2 = -0.1(-0.9)^2 = -0.1(0.81) = -0.081 < 0$. This means that $x'(t) < 0$, so the value of $x(t)$ will decrease towards 0.\n- If $x$ is slightly less than 0 (e.g., $x = -0.1$), then $f(x) = -(-0.1)(-0.1-1)^2 = 0.1(-1.1)^2 = 0.1(1.21) = 0.121 > 0$. This means that $x'(t) > 0$, so the value of $x(t)$ will increase towards 0.\nSince trajectories on both sides of $x=0$ move towards $x=0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\n\nFor the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n- If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), then $f(x) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$. This means that $x'(t) < 0$, so the value of $x(t)$ will decrease towards 1.\n- If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), then $f(x) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$. This means that $x'(t) < 0$, so the value of $x(t)$ will decrease away from 1 (towards 0).\nSince trajectories on one side of $x=1$ move towards it, but trajectories on the other side move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is considered semi-stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. So, the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
