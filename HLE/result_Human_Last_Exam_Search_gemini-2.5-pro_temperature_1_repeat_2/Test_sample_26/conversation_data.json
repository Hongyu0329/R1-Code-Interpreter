    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\nThis result is derived using rational homotopy theory and the properties of Kähler manifolds. Here is a summary of the argument:\n\n1.  **Topological Preliminaries**: Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Since $X$ is a smooth complex hypersurface in a projective space, it is a compact Kähler manifold. The complex dimension of $X$ is 2. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that for $k < 2$, the inclusion map induces an isomorphism $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n2.  **Betti Numbers**: The Betti numbers of $X$ are required.\n    *   $b_0(X) = 1$ since $X$ is connected.\n    *   $b_1(X) = 0$ since $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   By Poincaré duality, $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$ and $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   The second Betti number, $b_2(X)$, is determined using the topological Euler characteristic, $\\chi(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Euler characteristic is given by the formula $\\chi(X) = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d$. For a quintic ($d=5$), this yields $\\chi(X) = 125 - 100 + 30 = 55$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$. Substituting the known values gives $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1$, which implies $b_2(X) = 53$. Thus, the rational homology groups are $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$ and $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3.  **Rational Homotopy Theory**: The rank of a homotopy group is determined by its rationalization, $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. A foundational result by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that compact Kähler manifolds are \"formal\". For a simply connected formal space, its rational homotopy type is entirely determined by its rational cohomology algebra.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Rank**: For a simply connected formal space, the rank of the third homotopy group is given by the dimension of the kernel of the cup product map on the second cohomology group:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\ker[\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})]) $$\n    *   We have $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$ and $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   The space $\\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the space of alternating 2-tensors on a 53-dimensional vector space, so its dimension is $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 1378$.\n    *   The cup product map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53}) \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is a non-zero map (it represents the intersection form on the surface). Therefore, its image is $\\mathbb{Q}$, which has dimension 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel is the dimension of the domain minus the dimension of the image: $\\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n\nThus, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
