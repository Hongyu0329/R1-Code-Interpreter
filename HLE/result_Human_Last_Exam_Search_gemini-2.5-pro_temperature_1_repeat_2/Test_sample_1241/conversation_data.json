    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $P_i$, we need to solve the system of linear equations that arises when we set the time derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero. This is because, in the long run (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities are expected to reach a steady state where they no longer change with time.\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = 0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392 + 0.008)P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\nAnd the normalization condition is:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nIn the steady state, $P_{i}'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. The system becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $-0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1 = 0$\n2.  $0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n3.  $0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2 = 0$\n4.  $0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3 = 0$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (4), we can deduce:\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3), we get:\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n\nCombining these results, we have:\n$P_1 = P_2 = P_3$\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nWe can now use the normalization condition (equation 5) to find the value of $P_1$. We substitute the expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)P_1 = 1\n$$\nTo solve for $P_1$, we first calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}\n$$\nSo, the equation for $P_1$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right)P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n$$\n$P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$$\nP_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} = \\frac{650}{707}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$$\nP_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}\n$$\nThe numerical value is approximately 0.94625.\n\n<<<\n669/707\n>>>"
