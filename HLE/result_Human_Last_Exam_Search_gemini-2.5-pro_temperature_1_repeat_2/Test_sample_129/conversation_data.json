    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must systematically construct and evaluate all possible valid expressions of that length. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |, and binary operators are assumed to be left-associative.\n\nA valid boolean expression of length 5 can be categorized into one of the following mutually exclusive forms, based on its top-level structure:\n\n1.  **Expressions of the form `((A))`**: For the total length to be 5, the inner expression `A` must have a length of 1. The only single-character expressions are `T` and `F`.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to True.\n    *   `((F))` evaluates to False.\n    This gives us **1** true expression.\n\n2.  **Expressions of the form `(A)`**: Here, `A` must be a valid expression of length 3, and `A` itself must not be of the form `(B)`.\n    The valid, un-parenthesized expressions of length 3 are of the form `X op Y` (e.g., `T&T`) or `!A` (e.g., `!(T)`).\n    The true expressions of length 3 that are not parenthesized are: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, and `!(F)`.\n    Placing these inside parentheses gives 5 true expressions of length 5:\n    *   `(T&T)`\n    *   `(T|T)`\n    *   `(T|F)`\n    *   `(F|T)`\n    *   `(!(F))`\n    This gives us **5** true expressions.\n\n3.  **Expressions of the form `!A`**: For the total length to be 5, `A` must be a false expression of length 4. We must count the number of false expressions of length 4.\n    *   Expressions of the form `(B)` where `B` has length 2: `(!T)` is false. (1)\n    *   Expressions of the form `!(B)` where `B` has length 2: `!(!F)` is false. (1)\n    *   Expressions of the form `(X op Y)` where `X` and `Y` are length 1: `(T&F)`, `(F&T)`, `(F&F)`, `(F|F)`. (4)\n    *   Expressions of the form `X op Y` where one operand is length 1 and the other is length 2: `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F`, `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F`, `F|!T`, `!T|F`. (8)\n    The total number of false expressions of length 4 is 1 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 14.\n    Negating each of these gives a true expression. This gives us **14** true expressions.\n\n4.  **Expressions of the form `A | B` (where `|` is the operator of lowest precedence)**: The combined length of `A` and `B` must be 4. Due to left-associativity, `A` can be any expression, but `B` cannot be an un-parenthesized OR expression.\n    *   **Length(A)=3, Length(B)=1**: `A` can be any of the 12 valid expressions of length 3. `B` can be `T` or `F`.\n        *   `A | T`: `A` can be any of the 12 expressions. All 12 resulting expressions are true.\n        *   `A | F`: `A` must be true. There are 6 true expressions of length 3. This gives 6 true expressions.\n    *   **Length(A)=1, Length(B)=3**: `A` can be `T` or `F`. `B` must be an expression of length 3 that is not an un-parenthesized OR expression. There are 8 such expressions (`T&T`, `T&F`, etc., `!(T)`, `!(F)`, `(T)`, `(F)`), 3 of which are true.\n        *   `T | B`: `B` can be any of the 8 expressions. All 8 are true.\n        *   `F | B`: `B` must be true. This gives 3 true expressions.\n    *   **Length(A)=2, Length(B)=2**: Both `A` and `B` must be expressions of length 2 (i.e., `!T` or `!F`).\n        *   The combinations that are true are: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3)\n    Total for this category: (12 + 6) + (8 + 3) + 3 = **32** true expressions.\n\n5.  **Expressions of the form `A & B` (where `&` is the operator of lowest precedence)**: The combined length of `A` and `B` is 4. `A` and `B` cannot be un-parenthesized OR or AND expressions.\n    *   **Length(A)=3, Length(B)=1**: `A` must be a length-3 expression without un-parenthesized `&` or `|`. There are 8 such expressions, 3 of which are true. `B` is `T` or `F`.\n        *   `A & T`: `A` must be true. This gives 3 true expressions (`(T)&T`, `!(F)&T`, `(T&T)&T` which is written `T&T&T`).\n    *   **Length(A)=1, Length(B)=3**: `A` is `T` or `F`. `B` is a length-3 expression with no `&` or `|` operators. There are 4 such expressions (`(T)`, `(F)`, `!(T)`, `!(F)`), 2 of which are true.\n        *   `T & B`: `B` must be true. This gives 2 true expressions (`T&(T)`, `T&!(F)`).\n    *   **Length(A)=2, Length(B)=2**: Both `A` and `B` must be from `{!T, !F}`.\n        *   The only true combination is `!F & !F`. (1)\n    Total for this category: 3 + 2 + 1 = **6** true expressions.\n\nSumming up the counts from all categories:\n1 + 5 + 14 + 32 + 6 = 58.\n\n<<<58>>>"
