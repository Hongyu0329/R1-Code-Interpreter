    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is 2,7,12-triethynyltriphenylene.\n\nThe symmetry group of this molecule is determined by the arrangement of its atoms in three-dimensional space. The core of the molecule is triphenylene, a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of four fused benzene rings. Unsubstituted triphenylene possesses a high degree of symmetry and belongs to the D3h point group.\n\nThe key features of the D3h point group are:\n*   A principal C3 axis of rotation, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n\nIn the given molecule, three ethynyl (–C≡CH) groups are attached to the triphenylene core at positions 2, 7, and 12. These positions are symmetrically distributed around the periphery of the triphenylene core. Assuming the molecule remains planar, the addition of these substituents does not break the essential symmetry elements of the parent triphenylene. The C3 axis, the three perpendicular C2 axes, and the horizontal mirror plane are all preserved.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry group of 2,7,12-triethynyltriphenylene is D3h.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
