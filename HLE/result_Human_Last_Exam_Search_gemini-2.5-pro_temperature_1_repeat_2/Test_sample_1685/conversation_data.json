    "To find an approximate analytical expression for the solution of the differential equation in the large $x$ regime, we first analyze the behavior of each term as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe given third-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$, we make the following observations:\n1.  The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ becomes negligible, assuming that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n2.  The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is a periodic forcing term that oscillates and has singularities.\n\nIn many physical and mathematical systems, the long-term behavior of a solution is governed by the dominant, non-oscillatory parts of the equation. An approximation for large $x$ often involves ignoring such oscillatory terms, especially when seeking a stable, smooth behavior. This approach focuses on the underlying dynamics dictated by the other terms.\n\nBy neglecting the vanishing and oscillatory terms, we obtain a simplified, autonomous differential equation that describes the dominant behavior of the system for large $x$:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$\n\nWe seek an asymptotic solution to this simplified equation, typically in the form of a power law, $y(x) \\approx A x^n$. Let's analyze the balance between the terms for large $x$:\n*   $y''' \\approx A n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}$\n*   $y^4 \\approx A^4 x^{4n}$\n*   $y'^4 \\approx (A n x^{n-1})^4 = A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n\nFor large $x$, the term $y^4$ (proportional to $x^{4n}$) will dominate over $y'^4$ (proportional to $x^{4n-4}$) if $n>0$, and the reverse is true if $n<0$. Let's test for a decaying solution where $n<0$, which would mean $y'^4$ is less significant than $y^4$.\nThe dominant balance must occur between $y'''$ and $y^4$.\n\nEquating the powers of $x$:\n$n - 3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$\n\nThis is consistent with our assumption that $n<0$. Now, we equate the coefficients:\n$A n(n-1)(n-2) = A^4$\nSubstituting $n = -1$:\n$A(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = A^4$\n$A(-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n$-6A = A^4$\n\nSince we are looking for a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we can divide by $A$:\n$A^3 = -6$\n$A = -\\sqrt{6}$\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{x}$\n\nNow, we round the constant to two decimal places:\n$\\sqrt{6} \\approx 1.81712$\nRounding to two decimal places gives $1.82$.\n\nSo, the final approximate expression is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\n<<<y(x) \\approx -1.82/x>>>"
