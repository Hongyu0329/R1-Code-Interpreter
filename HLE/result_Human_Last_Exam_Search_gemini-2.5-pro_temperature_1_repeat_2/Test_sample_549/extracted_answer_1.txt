The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, a phenomenon known as weak localization, is given by the formula: `δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * (1/l_e - 1/L_φ)`. In this expression, `e` represents the elementary charge, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `l_e` is the elastic mean free path, and `L_φ` is the phase coherence length. This correction is negative, signifying a reduction in conductivity due to the constructive interference of time-reversed electron paths, which increases the probability of an electron returning to its starting point. The effect is most prominent at low temperatures where the phase coherence length `L_φ` is significantly larger than the mean free path `l_e`.
