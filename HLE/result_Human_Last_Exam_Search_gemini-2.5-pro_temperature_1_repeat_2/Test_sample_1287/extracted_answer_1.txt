Based on the differential stability of sialic acid linkages to the specified reaction conditions, the three isomeric glycans will yield products with different masses. The chemical derivatization involves two main processes: the linkage-dependent loss of sialic acid and the amidation of the remaining stable sialic acids, followed by permethylation. The expected singly-sodiated monoisotopic masses ([M+Na]+) for the final products are as follows:

**1. A2G(4)2S(3)2 → Permethylated A2G2**

The α-2,3 linkages are the most labile under the acidic (pH 6.5) and high-temperature (60°C) conditions applied for 15 hours. It is expected that both sialic acid residues will be hydrolyzed and lost from the parent glycan. The remaining asialo-glycan (A2G2) is then permethylated.

*   The expected mass for the singly-sodiated, permethylated A2G2 glycan is **2294.29 Da**.

**2. A2G(4)S(3)S(6) → Permethylated A2G2S1-amide**

In this glycan, the labile α-2,3 linked sialic acid is expected to be lost, while the more stable α-2,6 linked sialic acid will persist. The carboxyl group of this remaining sialic acid will be converted to a primary amide by the DMT-MM/ammonium chloride reagent. The entire resulting monosialylated, amidated glycan is then permethylated.

*   The expected mass for the singly-sodiated, permethylated A2G2S1-amide is **2668.49 Da**.

**3. A2G(4)2S(6)2 → Permethylated A2G2S2-diamide**

Both sialic acids are in the stable α-2,6 linkage and are expected to withstand the reaction conditions. Both carboxyl groups will be converted to primary amides. The resulting disialylated, di-amidated glycan is then permethylated.

*   The expected mass for the singly-sodiated, permethylated A2G2S2-diamide is **3070.73 Da**.

Therefore, the respective masses you should observe are approximately 2294.29 Da, 2668.49 Da, and 3070.73 Da.
