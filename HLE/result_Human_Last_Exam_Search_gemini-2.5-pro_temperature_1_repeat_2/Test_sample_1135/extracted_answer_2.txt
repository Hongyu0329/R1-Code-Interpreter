In CCSD, besides the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants for which the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zeroed by definition to solve for the amplitudes, these matrix elements are also identically zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the electronic Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interactions, which results in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ having at most four-body effective operators. Therefore, when $\bar{H}$ acts on the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$, it can generate excitations up to, but not exceeding, quadruply excited determinants.
