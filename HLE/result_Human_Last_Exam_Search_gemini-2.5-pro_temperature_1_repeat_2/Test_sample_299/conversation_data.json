    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a justification for this conclusion:\n\n### Properties of the Solution\n\nFirst, we can deduce several properties that any such function $f$ must have:\n1.  **Injectivity**: If $f(a) = f(b)$, then $f(f(a)) = f(f(b))$, which implies $e^a = e^b$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective (one-to-one) function, it follows that $a=b$. Therefore, $f$ must be injective.\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n3.  **Strictly Increasing**: Let's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing. Then $f \\circ f$ would be a strictly increasing function, which is consistent with $\\exp(x)$. However, a strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. At this point, $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$, an equation which has no real solutions. Thus, no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists, and $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n4.  **No Fixed Points**: As shown above, $f$ cannot have any fixed points, because if $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $\\exp(x_0)=x_0$, which is impossible.\n5.  **$f(x) > x$**: Since $f$ is a continuous function with no fixed points, it must be the case that either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $f(x) < x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $\\exp(x) < x$, which is never true. Therefore, any solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Constructing the Solutions\n\nThe existence of infinitely many solutions can be demonstrated through a constructive method. This construction reveals that there are arbitrary choices to be made, leading to a large number of solutions. The argument, in brief, is as follows:\n\n1.  A solution $f$ is uniquely determined by its behavior on a specific \"fundamental\" interval.\n2.  We can choose a negative number, let's call it $c < 0$. This choice determines the range of the function $f$ to be $(c, \\infty)$ and establishes key points, such as $f(c) = 0$ and $f(0) = e^c$.\n3.  We can then define $f$ on the interval $(-\\infty, c]$ as any continuous, strictly increasing function $\\psi$ that maps $(-\\infty, c]$ to $(c, 0]$. Such a function is a homeomorphism between these two intervals.\n4.  The choice of this \"bridge\" function $\\psi$ is arbitrary, apart from the monotonicity and continuity requirements. For any choice of $c<0$, there are infinitely many such functions $\\psi$. The number of ways to choose such a function is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n5.  Once $\\psi$ is chosen for the interval $(-\\infty, c]$, the function $f$ becomes uniquely determined for all other real numbers through the original equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the commuting property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ which can be derived from it.\n\n### Cardinality\n\nThe number of solutions is determined by the number of possible choices in the construction:\n*   There is a choice for the constant $c \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For each choice of $c$, there is a choice of a homeomorphism $\\psi$ from $(-\\infty, c]$ to $(c, 0]$. The set of such functions also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these choices, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers. Since the set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality can be at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nGiven that we can construct at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions and the total number of candidates is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude that the cardinality of the set of these functions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$)>>>"
