    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use, and it should not be stored for any period.\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed, which makes it highly susceptible to microbial contamination. Therefore, the contents should be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\nThe guidance for single-dose *vials* differs. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, provided it is stored according to the manufacturer's requirements. However, this does not apply to ampules.\n\nFor preparations intended for immediate use that are prepared from a single-dose container, administration must begin within 4 hours of the start of preparation, and any unused starting component from the single-dose container must be discarded after the preparation for an individual patient is complete.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period and must be used immediately; any unused portion should be discarded.>>>"
