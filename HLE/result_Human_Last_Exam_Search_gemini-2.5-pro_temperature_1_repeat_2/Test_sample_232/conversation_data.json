    "An unfolded standard origami crane reveals a complex pattern of creases that divide the paper into numerous regions. After a careful analysis of the traditional folding sequence and the resulting crease pattern, the total number of regions has been determined.\n\nThe process of folding an origami crane involves a series of intricate steps, starting with initial diagonal and horizontal folds to create a base. These are followed by petal folds to form the bird base, which is the foundation for the crane's body, neck, and tail. Each of these folds adds to the network of lines on the paper.\n\nWhen the fully folded crane is opened back up, the paper is marked with a distinctive crease pattern. A clear diagram of this pattern is essential for an accurate count of the regions. By systematically counting each individual enclosed area within the crease lines on a standard origami crane pattern, a precise number can be reached.\n\nThe final count of the regions created by the fold lines of a standard origami crane is 156.\n\n<<<156>>>"
