    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field ϕ is expressed through the functional integral formalism. This is achieved by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time, τ = it, where the time integration runs from 0 to the inverse temperature β = 1/T.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\nZ = ∫ Dϕ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ]</sup>\n\nwhere S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. The integration is over all field configurations ϕ(τ, **x**) that are periodic in the imaginary time direction with period β, i.e., ϕ(0, **x**) = ϕ(β, **x**).\n\nThe Euclidean action, S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ], can be written in a quadratic form involving a differential operator, which we can denote as D. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass *m*, the Euclidean action is:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d-1</sup>**x** [ ½(∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½(∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½*m*<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nThrough integration by parts, and assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity, this action can be expressed as:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d-1</sup>**x** ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + *m*<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThis expression defines the inner product in the exponent of the functional integral. The term (ϕ, Dϕ) corresponds to this Euclidean action.\n\nTherefore, the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is given by:\n\n(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d-1</sup>**x** ϕ(τ, **x**) D ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere the operator D is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n\nD = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + *m*<sup>2</sup>\n\nThe full term that appears in the exponent of the partition function is -½(ϕ, Dϕ).\n\n<<<S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d-1</sup>**x** ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + *m*<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)>>>"
