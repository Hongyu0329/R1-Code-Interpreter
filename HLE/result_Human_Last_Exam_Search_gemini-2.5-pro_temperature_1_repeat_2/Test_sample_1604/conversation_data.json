    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Charge at Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. The painting is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nElizabeth Butler, a prominent British battle artist, created works depicting various 19th and early 20th-century conflicts. While many of her famous pieces portray the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, she also painted several scenes from the First World War.\n\nAmong her paintings of First World War battles are:\n*   ***The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons, 1914***, showing the retreat from the Battle of Mons in August 1914.\n*   A depiction of the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos in September 1915, famously known as the **\"Footballers at Loos\"**.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916***, which portrays a cavalry charge in Egypt.\n\nThe Charge at Huj, immortalized by Lady Butler's painting, was a cavalry charge by the British 5th Mounted Brigade against a rearguard of German, Austrian, and Turkish forces. The successful charge captured the position, along with artillery and prisoners. This engagement is considered one of the last classic, unsupported cavalry charges in British military history.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj (November 8, 1917)>>>"
