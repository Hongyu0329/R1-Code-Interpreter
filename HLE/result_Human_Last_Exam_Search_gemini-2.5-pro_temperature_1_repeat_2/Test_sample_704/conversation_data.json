    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue—which is green—and blue itself corresponds to the musical notes G and A.\n\nIn his work \"Opticks,\" Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a diatonic musical scale. He arranged the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet in a circle, assigning each a note from a Dorian musical scale starting on D. This arrangement created a correspondence between the colors and specific musical tones.\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. On Newton's color wheel, green is associated with the musical note G. The color blue, which follows green in the spectrum, corresponds to the note A. Therefore, the musical range between green and blue on Newton's color circle is from G to A.\n\n<<<G to A>>>"
