    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This value is known in graph theory as the bipartite covering number of \\( K_n \\), sometimes denoted as $bc(K_n)$.\n\nA key result in this area, established by Hansel and later by Katona and Szemer√©di, provides a formula for this quantity. The theorem states that the minimum sum of the orders (number of vertices) of a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. The bipartite graphs in such a covering are typically considered to be subgraphs of the complete graph on the same vertex set.\n\nTo solve the problem for n = 35, we apply this formula:\n1.  First, we need to calculate the value of $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n2.  The powers of 2 surrounding 35 are $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$.\n3.  Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, the logarithm to the base 2 of 35 is between 5 and 6.\n4.  The ceiling of this value, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$, is therefore 6.\n5.  Finally, we multiply this by n: $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
