    "There is no finite upper bound on the number of components of the intersection. We can construct examples with any finite number of components, as well as with a countably or uncountably infinite number of components.\n\n### Construction for any finite number *n*\n\nLet the unit square be denoted by $S = \\times$. We want to construct two closed connected sets, $A$ and $B$, such that their union is $S$ and their intersection has a specified number of connected components.\n\nLet's construct an example where the intersection has *n* components for an arbitrary positive integer *n*.\n\n1.  **Define the intersection:** Let the desired intersection be a set $I$ consisting of *n* disjoint horizontal line segments:\n    $I = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} \\left( \\times \\left\\{\\frac{2k-1}{2n}\\right\\} \\right)$\n    This set $I$ is closed and has *n* connected components.\n\n2.  **Define connecting \"spines\":** To make the sets $A$ and $B$ connected, we will add vertical \"spines\" that connect the components of $I$.\n    *   Let the \"left spine\" be $S_L = \\{0\\} \\times$.\n    *   Let the \"right spine\" be $S_R = \\{1\\} \\times$.\n\n3.  **Define the core of A and B:**\n    *   Let the core of A be $A_{core} = I \\cup S_L$. This set is connected because all horizontal segments in $I$ are connected to the vertical segment $S_L$.\n    *   Let the core of B be $B_{core} = I \\cup S_R$. Similarly, this set is connected.\n\n4.  **Fill the remaining space:** The parts of the square not yet included are the open rectangular \"strips\" between the lines of $I$. Let's define the closed versions of these strips:\n    *   $R_0 = \\times \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2n}\\right]$\n    *   $R_k = \\times \\left[\\frac{2k-1}{2n}, \\frac{2k+1}{2n}\\right]$ for $k=1, \\dots, n-1$\n    *   $R_n = \\times \\left[\\frac{2n-1}{2n}, 1\\right]$\n\n5.  **Define A and B:** We partition these strips between A and B, assigning the even-indexed strips to A and the odd-indexed strips to B.\n    *   $A = A_{core} \\cup \\bigcup_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} R_{2k}$\n    *   $B = B_{core} \\cup \\bigcup_{k=0}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} R_{2k+1}$\n\n**Verification:**\n\n*   **Closed:** A and B are unions of closed sets, so they are closed.\n*   **Union is the square:** The union $A \\cup B$ includes $I$, both spines $S_L$ and $S_R$, and all the strips $R_k$. Thus, $A \\cup B = S$.\n*   **Connected:**\n    *   A is connected because $A_{core}$ is connected, and each strip $R_{2k}$ is connected to $A_{core}$ along the horizontal lines of $I$ that form its boundary.\n    *   Similarly, B is connected because $B_{core}$ is connected, and each strip $R_{2k+1}$ is connected to it along the boundary lines in $I$.\n*   **Intersection:** The intersection of A and B is $A \\cap B = A_{core} \\cap B_{core} = (I \\cup S_L) \\cap (I \\cup S_R) = I$, since the spines $S_L$ and $S_R$ are disjoint except for their endpoints which are not part of I. The intersection of the strips is empty by construction. The intersection of a spine with a strip assigned to the other set occurs only at the boundary lines which are in I. Thus, the intersection is precisely $I$.\n\nThe set $I$ has *n* connected components. Since we can construct such sets for any integer *n*, there is no finite maximum.\n\n### Infinite Components\n\nThis construction can be extended to create an intersection with a countably infinite number of components (e.g., by letting the intersection be the set of lines $ \\times \\{1/k\\}$ for $k=1, 2, ...$ along with the limit line $ \\times \\{0\\}$).\n\nFurthermore, a similar construction can be made where the intersection has uncountably many components. For example, we can use the Cantor set. Let $C$ be the standard Cantor set on the y-axis. Define the intersection as $I = \\times C$. This is a closed set with uncountably many connected components (one for each point in the Cantor set). The complement of $I$ in the square is a countable union of open rectangles. These rectangles can be partitioned between two connected sets $A$ and $B$ (containing $I$ and spines at $x=0$ and $x=1$ respectively) in a similar alternating fashion.\n\nSince there is no finite upper bound on the number of components, the answer is infinity.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
