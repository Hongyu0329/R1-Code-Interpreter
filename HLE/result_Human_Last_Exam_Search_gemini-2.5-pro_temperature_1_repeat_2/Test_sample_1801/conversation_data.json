    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, was identified in multiple sources as having appeared in the commercial. One source explicitly states that a YouTube video of an Enron commercial titled \"Metalman\" features Gell-Mann.\n\nThe second Nobel laureate was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. While initial searches referred to an \"Indian commentator\" and \"public intellectual,\" further investigation confirms that it was indeed Amartya Sen.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a significant marketing effort by Enron before its eventual collapse due to one of the largest accounting scandals in U.S. history. The commercials featured various prominent figures to bolster the company's image as an innovative and forward-thinking corporation.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
