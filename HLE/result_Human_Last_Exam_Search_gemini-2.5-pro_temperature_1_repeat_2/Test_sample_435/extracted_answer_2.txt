Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with Interleukin-15 (IL-15) are predicted to exhibit a more robust, sustained, and polyfunctional cytokine release profile upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This includes the enhanced and more durable secretion of key effector cytokines like IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, which is indicative of a more potent and persistent anti-tumor response. While this heightened functionality could be associated with an increased incidence of cytokine release syndrome, some studies suggest the profile might be more controlled, potentially mitigating the most severe toxicities.
