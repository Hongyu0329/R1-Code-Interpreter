    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of X. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>.\n\nHere is the justification for this conclusion:\n\nFirst, the dense open subset *U* is a 1-dimensional topological manifold because every point in *U* has a neighborhood homeomorphic to ℝ. Since *X* is a metric space, its subspace *U* is also a metric space and is therefore Hausdorff. A connected Hausdorff manifold is second-countable, which in turn implies it is separable.\n\nA space is defined as separable if it contains a countable, dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of *U* by the name *D*.\n\nBecause *U* is a dense subset of *X*, and *D* is a dense subset of *U*, it follows that *D* is also a dense subset of *X*. Therefore, *X* is a separable metric space.\n\nIt is a well-established theorem in topology that any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most the cardinality of the continuum (2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>). This is because every point in the space can be uniquely identified by its distances to the points in the countable dense set.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of *X* is at most 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>.\n\nFurthermore, for any connected metric space with more than one point, the cardinality is at least that of the continuum. This means that if *X* is not a single point, its cardinality is exactly 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>.\n\n<<<2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>>>>"
