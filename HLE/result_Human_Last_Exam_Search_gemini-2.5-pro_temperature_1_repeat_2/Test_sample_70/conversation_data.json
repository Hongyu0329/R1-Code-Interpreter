    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. When viewed as a matrix of color values, and assuming these values are chosen to maximize the rank, the complexity of the flag's geometric pattern determines its rank. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns), which corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design features both horizontal and vertical elements. An analysis of the flag's matrix reveals that its row vectors are combinations of a vector representing the all-red portions and another vector type representing the rows that intersect the white vertical cross. These two types of row vectors are linearly independent, resulting in a **rank of 2**.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify African flags whose geometric designs also result in a rank of 2.\n\nA flag's design has a rank of 1 if it consists of a single color or stripes in only one direction (either horizontal or vertical). This is because all row vectors (for vertical stripes) or column vectors (for horizontal stripes) are scalar multiples of each other, spanning a one-dimensional space.\n\nA flag's design has a rank of 2 if its pattern combines simple horizontal and vertical elements without additional complexity. The African flags that fit this structural criterion are:\n\n*   **Flags with horizontal stripes and a triangle at the hoist:** This design combines a horizontal pattern (the stripes) with a feature that breaks the uniformity across columns (the triangle). The row vectors of such a flag can be shown to span a two-dimensional space.\n    *   **Equatorial Guinea:** Features horizontal green, white, and red stripes with a blue triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Sudan:** Consists of a red-white-black horizontal tricolor with a green triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Djibouti:** Has horizontal light blue and green bands with a white triangle at the hoist. (Note: Djibouti's flag has a red star within the triangle, which adds complexity. If the emblem is considered, the rank would be greater than 2. However, based on the fundamental geometric structure of bands and a triangle, it is often grouped with rank-2 designs).\n\n*   **Flags with a vertical band and horizontal bands:** This design combines a vertical element with a horizontal one, similar to the structure above.\n    *   **Benin:** Comprises a vertical green band at the hoist with horizontal yellow and red bands.\n    *   **Madagascar:** Features a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands.\n\nFlags with more complex features, such as central emblems (shields, stars, etc.) on a striped or solid background, or designs with diagonal or multiple intersecting elements, will generally have a rank greater than 2. This is because the emblems or complex patterns introduce additional linearly independent row or column vectors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the flags of the following African nations have the same linear algebraic rank (rank 2) as the flag of Denmark:\n<<<Benin, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, and Sudan>>>"
