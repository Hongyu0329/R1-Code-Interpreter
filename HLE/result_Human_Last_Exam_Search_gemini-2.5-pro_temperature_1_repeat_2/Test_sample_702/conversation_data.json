    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 10.\n\nThis conclusion is based on results from algebraic topology concerning loop spaces and their relationships. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. The Spaces and the Map\n*   **Source Space:** $S = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Here, $\\Omega X$ is the loop space of $X$, $\\wedge$ is the smash product, and $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension.\n*   **Target Space:** $T = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since the smash product of spheres $S^p \\wedge S^q$ is homeomorphic to $S^{p+q}$, the target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   **The Map $\\phi$:** The map $\\phi: S \\to T$ is a well-known map in homotopy theory, often constructed as the adjoint of the smash product of evaluation maps. Specifically, we have evaluation maps $ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$ and $ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$. Their smash product is a map $\\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$. Using the homeomorphism $\\Sigma X \\wedge \\Sigma Y \\cong \\Sigma^2 (X \\wedge Y)$, we get a map $\\Sigma^2 (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^{10}$. The adjoint of this map is the map $\\phi$ in question.\n\n### 2. Connectivity and Homotopy Groups\nThe connectivity of a map is determined by its effect on homotopy groups. A map $f: A \\to B$ is $n$-connected if the induced map $f_*: \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(B)$ is an isomorphism for $k < n$ and an epimorphism for $k=n$. To determine this, we analyze the homotopy groups of the source and target spaces.\n\n*   **Target Space Homotopy:** The homotopy groups of the target space are given by the property of loop spaces: $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$. Since $S^{10}$ is 8-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(S^{10})=0$ for $i \\le 8$), the target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\n\n*   **Source Space Homotopy:** The homotopy groups of the source space are more complex. A result by Brayton Gray, cited in David Anick's work, provides a crucial isomorphism:\n    $\\pi_k(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q)) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^{p+q})$.\n    For our case with $p=4$ and $q=6$, this means:\n    $\\pi_k(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$.\n\n### 3. Connectivity of the Map\nWith these isomorphisms, the map $\\phi$ induces a map on homotopy groups:\n$\\phi_*: \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10}) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$.\n\nThe connectivity of $\\phi$ now depends on for which values of $k$ this induced map $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism. A theorem by Anick states that the map $\\phi$ induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups for $k < p+q+\\min(p,q)-3$.\n\nFor $p=4$ and $q=6$, this bound is:\n$k < 4+6+\\min(4,6)-3 = 10 + 4 - 3 = 11$.\n\nThis means that $\\phi_*: \\pi_k(S) \\to \\pi_k(T)$ is an isomorphism for all $k < 11$, i.e., for $k \\le 10$.\n\nAccording to the definition of connectivity, since the map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism for all $k \\le 10$, the map is **10-connected**. This implies that the map fails to be an isomorphism on $\\pi_{11}$.\n\n"
