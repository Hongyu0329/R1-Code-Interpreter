    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" can refer to various molecular structures designed to resemble a car at the nanoscale. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms, a specific nanocar model must be chosen as a reference.\n\nA well-documented example is a flexible nanocar model with four C60 fullerene \"wheels\". This particular nanocar has the chemical formula C310H34. The \"perfluoro-\" prefix in chemistry indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nFollowing this definition, if the 34 hydrogen atoms in the C310H34 nanocar were replaced with fluorine atoms, the resulting perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
