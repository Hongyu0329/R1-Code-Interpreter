The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not radial due to the Parker spiral. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is justified because the solar wind flows predominantly in the radial direction at L1. Under Taylor's "frozen-in" hypothesis, this radial direction represents the sampling direction of the spacecraft. Therefore, a coordinate system aligned with the radial flow is a practical and standard choice for analyzing the polarization of waves convected with the solar wind.
