    "The haiku's title, \"The Bays,\" is a question, and its content provides the clues to the answer. The \"August tempest\" refers to the tumultuous and decisive events of August 1945 that concluded the Second World War. The line \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" alludes to the roughly 30-year period of Japanese military expansionism that preceded the war's end, a period of significant upheaval in East Asia. Finally, \"A divine one yields\" points to the surrender of Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure by his people. His radio address on August 15, 1945, marked the first time an emperor had spoken directly to the nation and signified the acceptance of the Allies' terms of surrender.\n\nThe answer to the question posed by the title lies in the key geographical locations associated with these events, which are all situated on bays:\n\n*   The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a city on Hiroshima Bay.\n*   The second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, a city at the head of Nagasaki Bay.\n*   The formal surrender of Japan was signed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"The Bays\" is:\n\n<<<Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo>>>"
