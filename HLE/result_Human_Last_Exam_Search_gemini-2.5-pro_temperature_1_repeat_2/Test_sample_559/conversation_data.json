    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior, and such trajectories are typically the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nEquilibrium points $(u, d)$ are the solutions to $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d -3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ -3(1)^2+4(1)^3 & 4(0)-3(1)+5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3+10(1))(-1)-3(1)^2+4(1)^3 & 4(-1)-3(1)+5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\n**3. Find the equation of the separatrix**\n\nWe look for an invariant manifold, which is a curve $d=f(u)$ that is a trajectory of the system. The slope of such a curve must satisfy the differential equation of the trajectories:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\nLet's test if a simple function, like a parabola, can be a solution. We try $d = -u^2$.\nThe derivative of this proposed solution is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n\nNow we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side (RHS) of the trajectory equation:\nRHS = $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\nRHS = $\\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u-1)}$\nRHS = $\\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)}$\nRHS = $\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$\n\nSince the LHS ($\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$) equals the RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold (a trajectory) of the system.\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\nIf $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it passes through (1, -1).\n\nThis invariant curve must be either the stable or the unstable manifold of the saddle point. To determine which one, we check the tangent of the curve at the saddle point against the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix $J(1, -1)$.\n\nThe tangent vector to the curve $d=-u^2$ is given by $(1, \\frac{dd}{du}) = (1, -2u)$. At $u=1$, the tangent vector is $(1, -2)$.\n\nThe eigenvectors of $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ are:\n*   For $\\lambda_1=1$ (unstable manifold): $(J-I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_1-3v_2=0 \\implies v_2=-2v_1$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   For $\\lambda_2=-2$ (stable manifold): $(J+2I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 3v_1=0 \\implies v_1=0$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe tangent vector $(1, -2)$ of the curve $d=-u^2$ at the saddle point (1, -1) is parallel to the eigenvector for the unstable manifold. Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. Given the explicit and simple analytical form of this manifold, it is \"the\" separatrix the problem asks for. It separates the phase plane into regions of different dynamic behaviors.\n\nThe other separatrix is the stable manifold, which is composed of the ray $\\{(u,d) | u=1, d<-1\\}$ and another trajectory that is not expressible in a simple form. In the context of such problems, the single analytical curve is typically the expected answer.\n\nThus, the separatrix of the system is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
