It is not true that the second postulate can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. The first postulate is also consistent with Galilean relativity. One needs to either assume the universal validity of Maxwell's equations or make specific assumptions about the symmetries of spacetime to derive the mathematical structure of special relativity, which then requires experimental input to confirm the finite invariant speed.
