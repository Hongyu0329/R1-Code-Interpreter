    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms are blue in color, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nSome well-known blue-colored mushrooms and their spore print colors include:\n\n*   **Lactarius indigo:** This vibrant blue mushroom has a yellowish-cream spore print. When cut, it exudes a blue milky latex.\n*   **Stropharia caerulea (Blue Roundhead):** This blue-green mushroom has a purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n*   **Entoloma hochstetteri (Sky-blue mushroom):** Native to New Zealand, this striking blue mushroom has a pink to reddish-pink spore print.\n*   **Panaeolus cyanescens:** This mushroom is known for its blue-staining reaction when bruised and has a black spore print.\n\nThe phenomenon of \"blue stain fungi\" refers to fungi that cause wood to turn a blue-green color and is not related to the color of the spores. Based on available mycological information, a mushroom with a blue spore print has not been documented.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
