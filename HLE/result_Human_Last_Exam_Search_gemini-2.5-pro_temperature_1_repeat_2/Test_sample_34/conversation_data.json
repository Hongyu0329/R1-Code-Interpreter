    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x is J5s.\n\nPoker strategy, especially when guided by Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles, dictates a very wide opening range from the button due to the positional advantage and only having to get through the small and big blinds. In a rake-free environment, this range can be even wider as the pot odds for the opener are slightly better.\n\nA baseline button opening range in a 100bb cash game includes all suited aces, most suited kings, and a significant number of other suited and offsuit hands. When looking at suited jack holdings, GTO charts for these specific conditions generally include hands down to J5s. For example, one recommended baseline opening range from the button includes suited jacks down to J5s. Another source suggests opening J6s as the weakest suited jack. However, more detailed GTO charts for rake-free environments will often include the slightly weaker J5s as a standard open, while J4s and below are typically folded.\n\nOffsuit jack combinations are generally weaker, with a common baseline being to open J8o or stronger. Therefore, J5s represents the bottom of the suited jack opening range from the button in a 100BB, rake-free cash game.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
