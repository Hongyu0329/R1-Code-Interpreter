    "The volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the First Cube (C1):** Let the first cube be the standard unit cube defined by the coordinates `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Define the Shift:** The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted in geometric problems as a shift by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the Second Cube (C2):** Applying this shift to the first cube results in a second cube whose coordinates are defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection of the two cubes is the region where the coordinates satisfy the conditions for both cubes.\n    *   For the x-axis, the overlapping range is `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`. The length of this range is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   For the y-axis, the overlapping range is `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`. The length of this range is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   For the z-axis, the overlapping range is `max(0, 1/2)` to `min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. The length of this range is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is itself a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of this intersection is calculated by multiplying the lengths of its sides:\n    Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
