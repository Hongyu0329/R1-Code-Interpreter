    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) using streptavidin beads, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is crucial for obtaining accurate and reproducible results. You should prepare a minimum of 13 essential controls, which can be categorized as follows:\n\n**1. Instrument and Gating Controls (11 samples):**\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This consists of your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is essential to determine the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and to set the initial voltage settings on the flow cytometer.\n*   **Compensation Controls (5 samples):** In a multicolor experiment, the emission spectra of different fluorochromes can overlap. Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spillover. To perform this, you need single-stained controls for each fluorophore in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads. You will need one for each channel:\n    *   AF350 single-positive control\n    *   GFP single-positive control (if GFP is a reporter protein, a known positive cell line can be used)\n    *   PE single-positive control\n    *   AF647 single-positive control\n    *   AF750 single-positive control\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for populations that are dim or not well-separated. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel except for the one being evaluated. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the channel of interest. For a five-color panel, you should prepare:\n    *   FMO for AF350 (cells stained with all fluorochromes except for the one in the AF350 channel)\n    *   FMO for GFP\n    *   FMO for PE\n    *   FMO for AF647\n    *   FMO for AF750\n\n**2. Staining and Viability Controls (2+ samples):**\n\n*   **Viability Control (at least 1 sample):** Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. It is essential to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells from your analysis. You will need a control to set the gate for live cells, which is typically a sample of heat-killed or damaged cells stained with the viability dye to establish the positive signal for cell death.\n*   **Streptavidin Control (1 sample):** When using a biotinylated primary antibody followed by a streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate, it's important to have a control to assess non-specific binding of the streptavidin. This control sample would consist of your cells stained only with the streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate, without the biotinylated primary antibody.\n\n**Summary of Essential Controls:**\n\n| Control Type | Number of Samples | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Unstained | 1 | Assess autofluorescence and set initial voltages. |\n| Compensation | 5 | Correct for spectral overlap between channels. |\n| FMO | 5 | Set accurate gates for positive populations. |\n| Viability | at least 1 | Exclude dead cells from analysis. |\n| Streptavidin | 1 | Assess non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate. |\n| **Total** | **at least 13** | |\n\nIn addition to these essential controls, you should also consider including **biological controls**, such as a known negative and a known positive sample for your markers of interest, to ensure that your staining protocol is working as expected.\n\n<<<13>>>"
