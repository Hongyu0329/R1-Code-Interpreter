The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily based on the properties of the spaces X, Y, and Z, and the nature of the functions themselves. These conditions are typically established within the framework of complete metric spaces, which are often also endowed with a partial ordering.

An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The existence of such a point is guaranteed under the following general conditions:

**1. Properties of the Underlying Spaces:**
*   The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be **complete metric spaces**. This means that every Cauchy sequence in each space converges to a point within that same space. This is a fundamental requirement for the iterative sequences used in the proofs to converge.

**2. Contractive Conditions on the Mappings:**
*   The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a **mixed contractive condition**. This ensures that the mappings bring points closer together. A common form of such a condition for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z is:
    *   d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * [d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w)]
    *   Here, `k` is a **contraction constant** with 0 ≤ k < 1. More generalized contractive conditions involving altering distance functions or control functions can also be used.

**3. Continuity:**
*   Often, the mappings F, G, and H are required to be **continuous**. This ensures that the limit of a sequence of function values is equal to the function value at the limit of the arguments.

**Conditions in Partially Ordered Metric Spaces**

If the metric spaces are also equipped with a partial order, the conditions can be refined:

*   **Partially Ordered Complete Metric Spaces:** The spaces (X, ≤_X, d_X), (Y, ≤_Y, d_Y), and (Z, ≤_Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces with a partial order defined on each.
*   **Mixed Monotone Property:** The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on X, Y, and Z. For instance, F might be non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in the second, and non-decreasing in the third.
*   **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist a starting point (x_0, y_0, z_0) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies an initial ordering condition, such as:
    *   x_0 ≤_X F(x_0, y_0, z_0)
    *   y_0 ≥_Y G(y_0, x_0, y_0)
    *   z_0 ≤_Z H(z_0, y_0, x_0)
    This condition provides a basis for constructing monotone sequences that will converge to the fixed point.
*   **Relaxed Continuity and Contractive Conditions:** With a partial order, the continuity requirement can sometimes be replaced by a regularity property of the space (i.e., if a monotone sequence converges, the limit is related to the sequence in the ordering). Similarly, the contractive condition might only need to hold for elements that are comparable under the defined partial order.

In essence, the combination of a complete metric space, a contractive-type mapping, and often a partial order structure with a mixed monotone property and an initial ordered point, provides the sufficient conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point. The uniqueness of such a point often requires an additional condition, such as every pair of elements in the product space having an upper or lower bound.
