    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring of this space is denoted by $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. We are asked to find the rank of its torsion subgroup.\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms. The **torsion subgroup** of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. The **rank** of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. An important property is that abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic (or torsion) abelian groups. This means that any torsion group, by definition, has a rank of 0.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ are known to potentially contain 2-torsion. For our specific case, $G(3, 5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$ by taking the orthogonal complement, the integral cohomology groups have been computed. The cohomology groups are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups: $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group. The torsion parts of the groups listed above are:\n*   Torsion($H^0$) = 0\n*   Torsion($H^1$) = $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion($H^2$) = $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion($H^3$) = $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion($H^4$) = $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion($H^5$) = 0\n*   Torsion($H^6$) = 0\n\nTherefore, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is $T(H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis resulting group is a torsion group, as all of its non-zero elements have order 2. According to the definition, the rank of any torsion abelian group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
