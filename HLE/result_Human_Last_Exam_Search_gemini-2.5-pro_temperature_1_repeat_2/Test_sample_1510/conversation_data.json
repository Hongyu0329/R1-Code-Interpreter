    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nIn the classification of the 17 wallpaper groups, each group is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries that leave a specific point fixed. The order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups are:\n*   **p1**: Point group C1 (order 1)\n*   **p2**: Point group C2 (order 2)\n*   **pm**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **pg**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **cm**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **pmm**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **pmg**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **pgg**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **cmm**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **p4**: Point group C4 (order 4)\n*   **p4m**: Point group D4 (order 8)\n*   **p4g**: Point group D4 (order 8)\n*   **p3**: Point group C3 (order 3)\n*   **p3m1**: Point group D3 (order 6)\n*   **p31m**: Point group D3 (order 6)\n*   **p6**: Point group C6 (order 6)\n*   **p6m**: Point group D6 (order 12)\n\nThe point groups with an order of 2 are C2 and D1 (which is isomorphic to C2). The wallpaper groups associated with these point groups are **p2**, **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\nTherefore, there are four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
