The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a numerical constant but rather the set of its defining properties. The core property is that Grassmann variables (\(\theta\)) and their differentials (\(d\theta\)) are anti-commuting quantities. This means for any two Grassmann variables \(\theta_i\) and \(\theta_j\), the relation \(\theta_i \theta_j = - \theta_j \theta_i\) holds. A direct consequence of this is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (\(\theta^2 = 0\)). This property directly enforces the Pauli exclusion principle, as any state with two fermions in the same quantum state will have a corresponding term in the path integral that is proportional to the square of a Grassmann variable, and thus vanishes. The integration itself is defined by the Berezin integral rules: \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \).
