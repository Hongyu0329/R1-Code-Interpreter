    "After applying cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations, starting from a single cell in state 1, the resulting binary pattern is **11011101110111011**.\n\nRule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is defined by the binary sequence 01101110, which corresponds to the decimal number 110. This sequence specifies the outcome for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood patterns.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern starting from a single '1' surrounded by '0's can be tracked step-by-step. The pattern of active cells expands and interacts with each generation. The sequence of these developing patterns is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A070887.\n\nThe progression for the first 20 steps is as follows, where each line represents a generation:\n1.  **t=0:** 1\n2.  **t=1:** 11\n3.  **t=2:** 111\n4.  **t=3:** 1101\n5.  **t=4:** 11111\n6.  **t=5:** 110001\n7.  **t=6:** 1101011\n8.  **t=7:** 11111111\n9.  **t=8:** 100000001\n10. **t=9:** 101000011\n11. **t=10:** 111010111\n12. **t=11:** 101111101\n13. **t=12:** 1110001111\n14. **t=13:** 10101010001\n15. **t=14:** 111111101011\n16. **t=15:** 1000000111111\n17. **t=16:** 10100011000001\n18. **t=17:** 111010110100011\n19. **t=18:** 1011111111010111\n20. **t=19:** 1110100001111101\n21. **t=20:** 1011101011000111\n\nThus, after 20 applications of the rule, the binary pattern is `1011101011000111`.\n\n<<<1011101011000111>>>"
