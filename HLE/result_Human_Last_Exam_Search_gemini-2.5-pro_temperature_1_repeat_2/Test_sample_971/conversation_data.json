    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile it is widely documented that Osipova's portrayal of Kitri was celebrated for its technical brilliance, including numerous and difficult turning sequences, a specific count of this particular step from that performance is not available in the public record. Extensive searches for video footage of the 2008 Bolshoi performance have resulted in broken links, making a visual verification impossible.\n\nAnalysis of other performances by Osipova from the same period, such as the \"Bridesmaid Variation 1\" from *Don Quixote* in 2008, showcases her exceptional turning ability but does not contain the specific pirouette sequence in question. Ballet discussion forums and choreographic analyses of the Kitri variation mention a challenging series of turns at the end, though the exact type and number can vary between productions and individual dancers. For instance, some describe the sequence as \"tours piqu√©s en dehors\" rather than pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\nWithout a visual record of the specific performance or detailed choreographic notes, any stated number would be speculative.\n\n<<<unknown>>>"
