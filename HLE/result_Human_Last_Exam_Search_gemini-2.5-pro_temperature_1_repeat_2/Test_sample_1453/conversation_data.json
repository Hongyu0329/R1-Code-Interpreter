    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, typically denoted as `abcdefg`. In this pattern, the residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are predominantly hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. The nature of these residues is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **Identifying the Heptad Repeat:**\n    A coiled-coil sequence is characterized by a repeating pattern of hydrophobic (h) and polar (p) residues, often in the form of `hpphppp`, which corresponds to the `abcdefg` positions where 'a' and 'd' are hydrophobic. The hydrophobic residues in the given sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n\n    The sequence can be broken down into four similar segments:\n    *   `GEIAQSL`\n    *   `KEIAKSL`\n    *   `KEIAWSL`\n    *   `KEIAQSL`\n    *   followed by `KG`.\n\n    We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues separated by two or three other residues, which would correspond to the `a-b-c-d` spacing. Let's test potential registers:\n    *   If we assign `I` at position 3 to the 'a' position, the 'd' position (a+3) would be `S` at position 6. Serine (S) is polar, making this register unlikely.\n    *   If we assign `A` at position 4 to the 'a' position, the 'd' position (a+3) would be `L` at position 7. Both Alanine (A) and Leucine (L) are hydrophobic. This is a plausible register.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Hydrophobic Core Residues:**\n    Let's apply this register (`a` = position 4, `d` = position 7) to the entire sequence:\n    `G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\n    The 'a' and 'd' positions are assigned as follows:\n    *   **'a' positions:** A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25)\n    *   **'d' positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28)\n\n    This results in a highly consistent hydrophobic core where the 'a' position is always Alanine and the 'd' position is always Leucine.\n\n3.  **Predicting the Oligomeric State:**\n    The composition of the hydrophobic 'a' and 'd' positions dictates the packing efficiency and thus the oligomeric state:\n    *   A combination of Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' typically favors **dimers**.\n    *   Reversing this to Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' tends to form **tetramers**.\n    *   A mix of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions often results in **trimers**.\n\n    In our sequence, we have Alanine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions. Alanine is a small hydrophobic residue. The packing of a small residue like Alanine against a larger one like Leucine is crucial. Research has shown that creating a \"seam\" of small Alanine residues in the core is energetically unfavorable for higher-order oligomers like tetramers. The small side chains of Alanine would create a destabilizing cavity in the hydrophobic interface of a four-stranded structure. This principle suggests that a two-stranded coiled-coil, a dimer, would be the most stable conformation as it allows for the most efficient knobs-into-holes packing and minimizes empty space in the core. Therefore, the `a=Ala, d=Leu` pattern strongly indicates a dimeric state.\n\nBased on the analysis of the heptad repeat and the principles of knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, the protein would most likely be a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
