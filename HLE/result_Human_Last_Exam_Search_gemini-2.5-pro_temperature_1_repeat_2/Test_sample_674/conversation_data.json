    "The rule R applied to generate the sequence S4 is as follows:\n\ns = 1\ns = 2\nFor n > 2, R(s[n]) is the smallest natural number not already in the sequence which shares a factor greater than 1 with the preceding term, s[n-1].\n\nThis sequence is known as the EKG sequence and is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A064413.\n\nHere is a step-by-step generation of the first few terms of S4 to illustrate the rule:\n*   s = 1\n*   s = 2\n*   s: The previous term is 2. The smallest number not yet in the sequence that shares a factor with 2 is 4 (since gcd(2, 4) = 2). So, s = 4.\n*   s: The previous term is 4. The smallest number not yet in the sequence {1, 2, 4} that shares a factor with 4 is 6 (since gcd(4, 6) = 2). So, s = 6.\n*   s: The previous term is 6. The smallest number not yet in the sequence {1, 2, 4, 6} that shares a factor with 6 is 3 (since gcd(6, 3) = 3). So, s = 3.\n*   s: The previous term is 3. The smallest number not yet in the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} that shares a factor with 3 is 9 (since gcd(3, 9) = 3). So, s = 9.\n\nThe sequence gets its name because a plot of its terms resembles an electrocardiogram (EKG). It has been proven that every positive integer appears exactly once in this sequence.\n\n<<<R(s[n]) = smallest natural number not already in the sequence such that gcd(s[n-1], s[n]) > 1, with s = 1 and s = 2>>>"
