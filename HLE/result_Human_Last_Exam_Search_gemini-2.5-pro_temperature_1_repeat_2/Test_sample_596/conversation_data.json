    "The number of higher-dimensional rooted forests `(F,R)` of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest `F` simplicially collapse onto the root `R` is 0.\n\nA higher-dimensional forest `F` fails to simplicially collapse onto its root `R` if and only if there is a homological obstruction. For 2-dimensional complexes, this obstruction is tied to the torsion part of the first homology group of the pair `(F, R)`. While for closed non-orientable surfaces such as the real projective plane or the Klein bottle, this obstruction can be non-trivial, it vanishes for compact, non-orientable surfaces with a boundary, such as the Möbius strip. Any non-contractible loop in the Möbius strip can be homotopically deformed to the boundary. In the context of the pair `(F, R)`, if the root `R` contains the boundary cycle, this allows the forest `F` to be collapsed onto `R`. Therefore, no such failure of simplicial collapse occurs for the standard triangulations of the Möbius band.\n\nWhile some literature contains figures that are presented as examples of rooted forests on a Möbius strip with cyclic fitting orientations, which is a condition related to non-collapsibility, more formal results in the field establish that for surfaces with boundaries like the Möbius strip, the relevant homological obstruction group is trivial, leading to the conclusion that all rooted forests are collapsible to their roots.\n\n<<<0>>>"
