    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, one must first understand the structure of an HSS matrix and the algorithm for its multiplication. The multiplication process requires access to all the constituent parts of both operand matrices to compute the structure of the resulting matrix.\n\n### HSS Matrix Structure\n\nAn HSS matrix is defined by a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix, typically represented by a binary tree. For a tree of depth 4 (with levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), the submatrices that define the HSS structure are:\n\n*   **Diagonal Blocks (`D_i`):** These are dense submatrices stored only at the leaf nodes of the tree. For a depth-4 tree, the leaves are at level 4. The number of leaf nodes is 2^4 = 16.\n*   **Off-Diagonal Generators (`U_i`, `V_i`):** These matrices are used to represent the low-rank off-diagonal blocks. They are associated with all nodes that have a parent, which includes all nodes from level 1 to level 4. The total number of these nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30.\n*   **Translation Generators (`R_i`, `W_i`):** These are also known as merging or transfer matrices. They are used to relate the bases of child nodes to the basis of their parent node. They are required for all non-leaf nodes. The non-leaf nodes are at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3. The total number of non-leaf nodes is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.\n\n### Counting the Submatrices for a Single HSS Matrix\n\nBased on this structure, the total number of submatrices for a single HSS matrix with a depth-4 tree is calculated as follows:\n*   **`D` matrices:** 16\n*   **`U` matrices:** 30\n*   **`V` matrices:** 30\n*   **`R` matrices:** 15\n*   **`W` matrices:** 15\n\nTotal submatrices = 16 + 30 + 30 + 15 + 15 = 106.\n\n### Matrix Multiplication (`C = A * B`)\n\nThe algorithm for HSS matrix multiplication computes the HSS representation of the resulting matrix `C`. This involves calculating the `D`, `U`, `V`, `R`, and `W` generators for `C`. The formulas for these calculations are hierarchical and depend on the corresponding generators and diagonal blocks of the input matrices `A` and `B`.\n\nFor example, computing the diagonal blocks of `C` at the leaf level involves not only the diagonal blocks of `A` and `B` but also correction terms derived from the off-diagonal generators of `A` and `B` throughout the hierarchy. Similarly, computing the generators of `C` at any given level requires access to the generators and diagonal blocks of `A` and `B` at multiple levels. This implies that the algorithm must access all the stored submatrices of both `A` and `B`.\n\n### Total Accessed Submatrices\n\nSince the multiplication algorithm must read all the structural components of both input matrices `A` and `B`, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the submatrices in `A` and `B`. Assuming both matrices have the same depth-4 HSS structure:\n\nTotal accessed submatrices = (Submatrices in A) + (Submatrices in B)\nTotal accessed submatrices = 106 + 106 = 212.\n\n<<<212>>>"
