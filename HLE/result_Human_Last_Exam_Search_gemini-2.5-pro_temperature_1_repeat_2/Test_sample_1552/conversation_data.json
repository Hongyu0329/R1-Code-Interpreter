    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four-dimensional curved spacetime is denoted by $a_2$. The spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the squared Dirac operator, $S = \\text{Tr} f(D^2/\\Lambda^2)$. Its asymptotic expansion in powers of the cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ is given by:\n\n$S \\sim \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n a_n \\Lambda^{4-2n}$\n\nThe coefficients $a_n$ are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, which are integrals of local geometric invariants. The coefficient $a_2$ is what determines the non-minimal gravitational couplings and the Yang-Mills action term.\n\nThe local density for the coefficient $a_2(x)$, for a single Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field, is given by the trace over the spinor and gauge group representations of a combination of gravitational and gauge field curvatures. It can be separated into a purely gravitational part and a gauge field part.\n\nThe expression for the local coefficient $a_2(x)$ is:\n$a_2(x) = \\text{Tr}_{\\text{spinor}\\otimes\\text{gauge}} \\left[ \\left( -\\frac{1}{360} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{30} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{72} R^2 \\right) \\mathbf{1} + \\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\right]$\n\nLet's break this down further. The trace is over both the four-dimensional spinor space and the internal gauge group space. Let $\\text{dim}(r)$ be the dimension of the representation of the gauge group, and $\\text{tr}_r$ be the trace over the gauge group generators in that representation. For a single Dirac spinor, the trace over the spinor space ($\\text{tr}_s$) of the identity is 4.\n\n*   **Gravitational Part**: The purely gravitational contribution to the local coefficient $a_2(x)$, for a single Dirac fermion, is:\n    $a_{2, \\text{grav}}(x) = 4 \\left( -\\frac{1}{360} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{30} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{72} R^2 \\right) \\text{dim}(r)$\n    $a_{2, \\text{grav}}(x) = \\left( -\\frac{1}{90} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{2}{15} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{18} R^2 \\right) \\text{dim}(r)$\n\n*   **Gauge Field Part**: The contribution from the gauge field is:\n    $a_{2, \\text{gauge}}(x) = \\text{tr}_s(\\frac{1}{12}\\mathbf{1}) \\otimes \\text{tr}_r(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) = \\frac{4}{12} \\text{tr}_r(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_r(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$\n    Here $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the gauge field strength tensor.\n\nCombining these, the total local second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient is:\n\n$a_2(x) = \\left( -\\frac{1}{90} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{2}{15} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{18} R^2 \\right) \\text{dim}(r) + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_r(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nIt is worth noting that different bases for the curvature invariants (e.g., using the Weyl tensor and the Euler density) and different normalizations can lead to expressions that appear different but are mathematically equivalent. The expression provided uses the basis of the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor, and the Riemann tensor.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, in four dimensions, is the integral over the spacetime manifold $M$ of the local density $a_2(x)$:\n$a_2 = \\int_M d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\left[ \\left( -\\frac{1}{90} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{2}{15} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{18} R^2 \\right) \\text{dim}(r) + \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_r(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}) \\right]$\nwhere $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ is the Riemann tensor, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the gauge field strength, $\\text{dim}(r)$ is the dimension of the gauge group representation, and $\\text{tr}_r$ is the trace in that representation.>>>"
