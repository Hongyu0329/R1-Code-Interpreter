The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, in four dimensions, is the integral over the spacetime manifold $M$ of the local density $a_2(x)$:
$a_2 = \int_M d^4x \sqrt{g} \left[ \left( -\frac{1}{90} R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} + \frac{2}{15} R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{18} R^2 \right) \text{dim}(r) + \frac{1}{3} \text{tr}_r(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}) \right]$
where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is the Riemann tensor, $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the gauge field strength, $\text{dim}(r)$ is the dimension of the gauge group representation, and $\text{tr}_r$ is the trace in that representation.
