    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil protein sequences, we must analyze the arrangement of amino acid residues, particularly within the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil structure. The oligomeric state is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat, which is a repeating pattern of seven amino acids (labeled a-b-c-d-e-f-g).\n\nThe analysis relies on established principles from structural biology and protein design:\n*   **Heptad Repeat Positions:** The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and form the core of the coiled-coil. The interactions between these residues are a major determinant of the number of helices (oligomeric state).\n*   **Residue Propensities:**\n    *   **Dimers (2-helix coil):** Often specified by Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions and/or Asparagine (N) at the 'a' position.\n    *   **Trimers (3-helix coil):** Strongly favored by Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions.\n    *   **Tetramers (4-helix coil):** Can be specified by Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions (an \"isoleucine zipper\"), Leucine (L) at the 'a' position, or Glutamine (Q) at the 'a' position.\n\nTo perform the analysis, we first need to identify the 'a' and 'd' positions in each sequence. A common method is to assign the first major hydrophobic residue in the first heptad to the 'a' or 'd' position and establish the repeating pattern from there. A chemically plausible assignment for these sequences places the second residue (Isoleucine) at the 'a' position, resulting in a `g-a-b-c-d-e-f` pattern for the first heptad of each sequence.\n\nHere is the breakdown for each sequence:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:**\n    *   **Heptad Frame:** `g(a)bc(d)ef`\n    *   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **'d' positions:** A, A, A, A\n    *   The core is dominated by Isoleucine (I) at all 'a' positions. This is a very strong signal for a **trimer (3)**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:**\n    *   **Heptad Frame:** `g(a)bc(d)ef`\n    *   **'a' positions:** I, I, N, I\n    *   **'d' positions:** L, L, L, L\n    *   This sequence has Leucine (L) at all 'd' positions and one Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position. Both are powerful determinants for a **dimer (2)**.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:**\n    *   **Heptad Frame:** `g(a)bc(d)ef`\n    *   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **'d' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   This sequence has Isoleucine (I) at all 'a' and 'd' positions. While an \"isoleucine zipper\" is often a tetramer, the presence of Isoleucine at the 'a' position is a dominant signal for trimerization. Therefore, this sequence is predicted to be a **trimer (3)**.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:**\n    *   **Heptad Frame:** `g(a)bc(d)ef`\n    *   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **'d' positions:** Q, Q, Q, Q\n    *   This sequence features Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions, strongly indicating a trimer. The polar Glutamine (Q) residues at the 'd' positions can be accommodated within the core of a **trimer (3)**.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:**\n    *   **Heptad Frame:** `g(a)bc(d)ef`\n    *   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **'d' positions:** T, T, T, T\n    *   This sequence has Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions, which favors a trimer. However, the combination of Isoleucine at 'a' and the beta-branched polar Threonine (T) at 'd' is a known motif that drives the formation of a **tetramer (4)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted oligomeric states are:\n*   Sequence 1: **3**\n*   Sequence 2: **2**\n*   Sequence 3: **3**\n*   Sequence 4: **3**\n*   Sequence 5: **4**\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**.\n\n<<<E>>>"
