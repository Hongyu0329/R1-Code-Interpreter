    "The pattern in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119 is as follows: each subsequent number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by a progressively larger integer and then adding or subtracting a value.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the terms:\n*   11 = 2 * 3 + 5\n*   23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n*   51 = 23 * 2 + 5\n*   119 = 51 * 2 + 17\n\nThis does not reveal a simple pattern. Let's try another approach by looking at the differences between terms.\n\nAnother possible pattern is to multiply the previous number by 3 and subtract an increasing value. However, this does not hold for the first two terms.\n\nLet's explore a different relationship:\n*   11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n*   51 = 23 * 2 + 5\n*   119 = 51 * 2 + 17\n\nLet's try one more pattern: multiply by 3 and subtract a value.\n*   11\n*   23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n*   51 = 3 * 23 - 18 (18 = 10 + 8)\n*   119 = 3 * 51 - 34 (34 = 18 + 16)\n\nFollowing this logic, the number to be subtracted next would be 34 + 32 = 66.\n*   Next term = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\nThis reveals a consistent pattern.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
