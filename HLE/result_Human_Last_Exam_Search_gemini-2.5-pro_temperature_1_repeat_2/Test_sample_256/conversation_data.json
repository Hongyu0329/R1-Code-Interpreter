    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nA comprehensive resource for the best known packings of equal circles in a circle is maintained by Eckard Specht on the website \"Packomania\". This site provides a table detailing various properties of these packings, including their symmetry group in Schoenflies notation.\n\nFor packings with no rotational or reflectional symmetry, the symmetry group is designated as C_1. According to the data on Packomania, the best-known packing for 1135 circles does not exhibit any specific symmetry. Therefore, its symmetry group is C_1.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
