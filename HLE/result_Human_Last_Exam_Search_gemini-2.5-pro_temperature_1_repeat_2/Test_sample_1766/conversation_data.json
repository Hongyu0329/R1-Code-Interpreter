    "In the quantum mechanical treatment of a p-electron, we are concerned with the coupling of its orbital angular momentum (L) and spin angular momentum (S) to form a total angular momentum (J). The common eigenvalues of the operators J² and Jz, which represent the square of the total angular momentum and its projection onto the z-axis, respectively, can be determined by following the principles of angular momentum coupling.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. An electron is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe total angular momentum J is the vector sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta: **J = L + S**. The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are obtained by the rule:\n\n*j* = *l* + *s*, *l* + *s* - 1, ..., |*l* - *s*|\n\nSubstituting the values for a p-electron (*l* = 1, *s* = 1/2):\n\n*j* = 1 + 1/2, ..., |1 - 1/2|\n*j* = 3/2, 1/2\n\nThus, there are two possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j*: 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the J² and Jz operators are given by:\n\n*   Eigenvalue of J² = j(j + 1)ħ²\n*   Eigenvalue of Jz = m_j ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_j is the total magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nNow we can find the common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²**:\n    *   3/2 * (3/2 + 1)ħ² = (3/2) * (5/2)ħ² = **15/4 ħ²**\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz**:\n    *   m_j can be -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues are **-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ**.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   **Eigenvalue of J²**:\n    *   1/2 * (1/2 + 1)ħ² = (1/2) * (3/2)ħ² = **3/4 ħ²**\n*   **Eigenvalues of Jz**:\n    *   m_j can be -1/2, 1/2.\n    *   The corresponding eigenvalues are **-1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ**.\n\nIn summary, the common eigenvalues for the spin-orbit coupling problem of a p-electron are:\n*   For the state with **j = 3/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **15/4 ħ²**, and the Jz eigenvalues are **-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, and 3/2 ħ**.\n*   For the state with **j = 1/2**, the J² eigenvalue is **3/4 ħ²**, and the Jz eigenvalues are **-1/2 ħ and 1/2 ħ**.\n\nThese different energy levels arising from the spin-orbit interaction are responsible for the fine structure observed in atomic spectra.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, are 3/2 and 1/2.\n\nFor j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\n\nFor j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
