For a p-electron, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, are 3/2 and 1/2.

For j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.

For j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ² and the eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.
