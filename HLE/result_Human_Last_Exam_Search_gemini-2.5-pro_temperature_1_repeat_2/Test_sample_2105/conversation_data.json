    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol. This is because the reduction of a disulfide bond (-S-S-) cleaves the bond and results in the formation of two thiol groups (-SH).\n\nThe molecular structure of the product is a perylene molecule (C₂₀H₁₂) where one hydrogen atom at the 3-position is substituted with a thiol group (-SH). The resulting chemical formula is C₂₀H₁₁SH. To calculate the topological indices including hydrogen, a molecular graph with the following vertices is considered:\n\n*   20 Carbon atoms\n*   12 Hydrogen atoms (11 on the perylene ring and 1 on the sulfur)\n*   1 Sulfur atom\n\nThis results in a molecular graph with a total of 33 vertices.\n\nThe indices are defined as:\n*   **Wiener Index (W):** The sum of the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices in the graph.\n*   **Szeged Index (Sz):** For each bond (edge) in the graph, the product of the number of atoms on each side of the bond is calculated. The Szeged index is the sum of these products over all bonds.\n\nCalculating these indices for a complex graph with 33 vertices is a computationally intensive task that requires specialized chemical graph theory software. This type of specific data for perylene-3-thiol, particularly including hydrogen atoms, is not available in public chemical databases or the scientific literature found in the search results.\n\nDue to the computational complexity and the lack of available data, it is not feasible to provide the exact numerical value for the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol including hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a numerical answer>>>"
