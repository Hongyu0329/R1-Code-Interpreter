    "In the context of disordered electronic systems, symmetry class D refers to systems where time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries are broken. To study these systems, particularly to calculate higher moments of transport properties, a theoretical framework known as the supersymmetric non-linear sigma model is employed. The replica trick is often used within this framework to handle the averaging over disorder.\n\nFor a supersymmetric sigma model of class D with *n* replicas, the relevant mathematical space (the target manifold) that describes the system's low-energy degrees of freedom is the supermanifold given by the coset SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n).\n\nThe \"bosonic sector\" refers to the part of this space described by ordinary commuting numbers (non-Grassmann variables). To find the number of variables needed to parametrize this sector, we must determine the dimension of the purely bosonic part of the target manifold.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is Sp(2n, R) × O(2n). The bosonic subgroup of U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n). Therefore, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is the manifold (Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n)).\n\nThe number of variables required for parametrization is the dimension of this manifold, calculated as:\ndim(Sp(2n, R)) + dim(O(2n)) - 2 × dim(U(n))\n\nFor the specific case of two replicas, we set n=2:\ndim(Sp(4, R)) + dim(O(4)) - 2 × dim(U(2))\n\nThe dimensions of these real Lie groups are well-known:\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is n(2n+1). For n=2, dim(Sp(4, R)) is 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n(n-1)/2. For n=4, dim(O(4)) is 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For n=2, dim(U(2)) is 2² = 4.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\nNumber of variables = 10 + 6 - 2 × 4 = 8\n\nTherefore, 8 non-Grassmann variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of this model.\n\n<<<8>>>"
