    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X), is determined by the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the curve C. Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g, and X = C^(d) be its d-th symmetric power. For d ≥ 2g - 1, X is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety J(C) of C. This relationship implies that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is given by ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nIn this specific case, the genus of the curve C is g = 3, and we are considering its 15th symmetric power, so d = 15. The condition d ≥ 2g - 1 is satisfied, as 15 ≥ 2*3 - 1 = 5. Therefore, we have ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nTo find the smallest and largest possible ranks for NS(X), we need to determine the minimum and maximum possible ranks for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a curve, ρ(J(C)), is also known as its Picard number. For a \"very general\" curve C of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) has a Néron-Severi group of rank 1. A general curve's Jacobian has no complex multiplication, and its endomorphism ring is simply the integers, leading to the minimal possible Picard number. For a genus 3 curve, this minimal rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe maximum possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is g². For a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is 3² = 9. This maximum is achieved when the Jacobian variety has complex multiplication (CM) and is ρ-maximal, meaning ρ(J(C)) = h¹¹(J(C)) = g².\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian attains this maximum Picard number is the Klein quartic. The Jacobian of the Klein quartic is isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (E x E x E), where E has CM by the ring of integers in Q(√-7). For a product of n isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by ρ(Eⁿ) = n + (n(n-1)/2) * rank(End(E)). With n=3 and rank(End(E))=2 for an elliptic curve with CM, the rank is ρ(E³) = 3 + (3*2/2) * 2 = 9. Thus, the Jacobian of the Klein quartic has a Picard number of 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
