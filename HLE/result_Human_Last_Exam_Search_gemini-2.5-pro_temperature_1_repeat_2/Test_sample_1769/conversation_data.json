    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **\"suster\"** or possibly **\"soster\"**.\n\nThe modern English word \"sister\" is a hybrid, born from the Old English term *sweostor* and influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. The interaction between the Anglo-Saxons and Viking invaders led to the adoption of the Scandinavian vowel sound, which gives us the \"i\" in the modern word.\n\nHere is the linguistic journey the word would have likely taken without Norse influence:\n\n*   **Old English:** The original Anglo-Saxon word for a female sibling was *sweostor* or, in some dialects, *swuster*. These words were part of a small class of kinship nouns, along with *brōðor* (brother) and *mōdor* (mother).\n*   **Middle English:** Without the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the Old English *sweostor* evolved into forms like *suster* or *soster*. These forms were common in Middle English and represent the native English development of the word.\n*   **Modern English:** The vowel sound in the Middle English word *suster* would have likely undergone the \"Great Vowel Shift\" and other natural linguistic changes. The short \"u\" sound in words like *sunu* (son) and *lufu* (love) evolved into the modern /ʌ/ sound (the vowel in \"cup\" or \"duster\"). Therefore, *suster* would likely be pronounced similarly to how it is spelled. It might have also evolved into \"soster,\" following a different phonological path.\n\nGiven the direct lineage from Old English *sweostor* to Middle English *suster*, \"suster\" stands as the most probable form the word would have taken in Modern English had the Norse invasions never occurred.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
