    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is a fundamental property related to its algebraic structure. For the Grigorchuk group, a finitely generated infinite 2-group, all subgroups of finite index must have an index that is a power of 2. To determine the number of subgroups of index 4, we analyze the possible homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group (let's denote it by *G*) to the symmetric group on 4 elements, *S₄*.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in *G* gives rise to a transitive action on 4 elements, which corresponds to a homomorphism from *G* into *S₄* with a transitive image. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (all its elements have an order that is a power of 2), the image of any such homomorphism must also be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of *S₄* are the Klein four-group (*V₄*, isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)²) and the dihedral group of order 8 (*D₄*).\n\nA key property of the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization, the quotient group by its commutator subgroup *G'*, is isomorphic to the direct product of three copies of the cyclic group of order 2: *G*/[*G*,*G*] ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n\nThis has two important consequences:\n1.  There can be no surjective homomorphism from *G* to the cyclic group of order 4 (*C₄*), because the abelianization of *C₄* is *C₄* itself, which is not a quotient of (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n2.  Any homomorphism from *G* to the dihedral group *D₄* must have an abelian image. This is because any homomorphism must map the commutator subgroup of the domain to the commutator subgroup of the codomain. The commutator subgroup of *D₄* is its center, which has order 2. The induced homomorphism on the abelianizations is from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to (ℤ/2ℤ)². However, a more detailed analysis of the relations of the Grigorchuk group shows that any homomorphism from it to *D₄* cannot be surjective. The image must be an abelian subgroup of *D₄*, and therefore cannot be transitive on 4 elements.\n\nThis leaves the Klein four-group, *V₄*, as the only possible transitive image of a homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to *S₄*. A homomorphism with *V₄* as its image corresponds to a normal subgroup of index 4. The number of such normal subgroups is determined by the number of surjective homomorphisms from *G* to *V₄*, divided by the number of automorphisms of *V₄*.\n\nThe number of surjective homomorphisms from the abelianization of *G*, which is (ℤ/2ℤ)³, to *V₄* (isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)²) is 42. The group of automorphisms of *V₄* has order 6. Therefore, the number of normal subgroups of the Grigorchuk group with a quotient isomorphic to *V₄* is 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nSince there are no surjective homomorphisms to *D₄*, there are no non-normal subgroups of index 4. Thus, all subgroups of index 4 are normal.\n\nTherefore, the Grigorchuk group has exactly 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<7>>>"
