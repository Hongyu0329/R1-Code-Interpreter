The least number of zeros a vector field can have on a compact manifold $M$ with non-empty boundary $\partial M$ is given by the number of non-zero values in the set $\{\chi(M) - \chi(\partial M), \chi(\partial M)\}$. This can be expressed as:
- 0, if $\chi(M) = 0$ and $\chi(\partial M) = 0$.
- 1, if exactly one of $\chi(M) - \chi(\partial M)$ and $\chi(\partial M)$ is non-zero.
- 2, if both $\chi(M) - \chi(\partial M)$ and $\chi(\partial M)$ are non-zero.
