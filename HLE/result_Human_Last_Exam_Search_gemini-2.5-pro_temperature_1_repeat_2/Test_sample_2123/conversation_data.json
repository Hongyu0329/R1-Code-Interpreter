    "The English poet whose surname appears in the Russian translation of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is Auden.\n\nThe essay in question is most likely \"To Please a Shadow\" (\"Поклониться тени\") by the Russian and American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky. After being exiled from the Soviet Union in 1972, Brodsky's first stop was Vienna, Austria. His primary purpose for being there was to meet the celebrated English-American poet W. H. Auden.\n\nIn his writings, particularly in the essay \"To Please a Shadow,\" Brodsky describes his arrival in Vienna and his subsequent meeting with Auden, whom he considered \"the greatest mind of the twentieth century.\" While the essay focuses more on the personal and intellectual encounter with the poet, the setting is the city of Vienna, which is famous for its wide boulevards. The reference to the boulevards in the Russian translation of the essay is contextually linked to his journey to meet W. H. Auden in his residence near the city.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
