    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**. This is the most common and general term used, especially when the measurement is taken with photoplethysmography (PPG).\n\nOther terms you might encounter include:\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval**: This term is also frequently used and is synonymous with IBI.\n*   **R-R interval**: This specifically refers to the time between the peaks of the \"R\" wave in an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. While ECG is the gold standard for HRV measurement, IBI is the more appropriate term for PPG-derived data.\n\nIn essence, HRV is the analysis of the variation in these successive inter-beat intervals.\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
