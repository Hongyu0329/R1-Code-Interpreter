    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is given by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This represents the upper semi-circle of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin. In this part, the x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\nFor the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is given by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This represents the lower semi-ellipse described by the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$. In this part, the x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from -5 to 0.\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the entire figure, we must first determine its overall width and height.\n\n*   **Maximum and minimum x-values:** The function $x = \\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ ranges from -1 to 1. Thus, the width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Maximum and minimum y-values:** Combining both parts of the curve, the y-values range from a minimum of -5 (from the elliptical part) to a maximum of 1 (from the circular part). Thus, the height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure can be contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. The smallest square that can outcircle this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nSide length of the square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is given by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.
