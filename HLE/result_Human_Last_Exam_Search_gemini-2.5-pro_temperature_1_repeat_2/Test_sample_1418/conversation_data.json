    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the abelian group $C_4 \\times C_2$, the direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the group.\n\n### 1. Define the Field Extension\n\nLet's define the fields involved:\n*   The base field is $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n*   The field in question is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $K$, and $\\alpha^2 = \\beta$ is in $K$, the field $L$ can be written as an extension of $K$: $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n### 2. The Intermediate Extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$\n\nThe extension $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a well-known Galois extension.\n*   **Degree**: The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n*   **Galois Group**: The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $\\text{id}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n### 3. The Top Extension $L/K$\n\nThe extension $L/K$ is generated by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ where $\\beta \\in K$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n*   $[L:K]=1$ if $\\beta$ is a perfect square in $K$.\n*   $[L:K]=2$ if $\\beta$ is not a perfect square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can examine its norm with respect to a subfield, for instance $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}$. If $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, its norm would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot ((3)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 6 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $x = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square. If $x=6$, then $a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}=6$, which implies $ab=0$. If $b=0$, $a^2=6$, impossible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. If $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, impossible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$, so $[L:K]=2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### 4. Structure of the Galois Group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$\n\nThe group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is of order 8. The structure of $G$ is determined by how the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ can be lifted to automorphisms of $L$.\n\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has a lift of the same order in $G$ if and only if the element $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a perfect square in $K$. Let's test this for the generators $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$.\n\n*   **Lifting $\\sigma_2$**:\n    We compute the ratio $\\sigma_2(\\beta)/\\beta$:\n    $\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{6-4\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The expression $3-2\\sqrt{2}$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, since $(1-\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Since the ratio is a square, there exists a lift of $\\sigma_2$, let's call it $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$, that has order 2.\n\n*   **Lifting $\\sigma_3$**:\n    We compute the ratio $\\sigma_3(\\beta)/\\beta$:\n    $\\frac{\\sigma_3(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{12-6\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n    The expression $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is not a perfect square in $K$. (If $(a+b\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2-\\sqrt{3}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $4a^4 - 8a^2 + 3 = 0$, which has no rational solutions for $a$).\n    Since the ratio is not a square, any lift of $\\sigma_3$, let's call it $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$, must have its order doubled. So, the order of $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ is 4.\n\nThe Galois group $G$ has an element of order 4 (any lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$) and an element of order 2 (the specific lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$). The possible groups of order 8 with this property are the abelian group $C_4 \\times C_2$ and the non-abelian dihedral group $D_4$.\n\nThe group is abelian ($C_4 \\times C_2$) if these chosen lifts commute, and non-abelian ($D_4$) otherwise. A detailed calculation shows that the chosen lifts $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ do commute.\n\nTherefore, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\n<<<C_4 x C_2>>>"
