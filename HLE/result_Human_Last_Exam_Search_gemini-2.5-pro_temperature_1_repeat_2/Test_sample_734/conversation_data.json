    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was the medieval scholastic philosopher **John Duns Scotus** (c. 1266–1308).\n\nThe specialized terminology he utilized and significantly developed is the distinction between God's ***potentia Dei absoluta*** (absolute power) and ***potentia Dei ordinata*** (ordained power).\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei ordinata*** refers to the power of God as it is expressed in the established, orderly workings of nature and the moral law that He has ordained. This is the normal, predictable course of events governed by the laws of nature.\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei absoluta*** refers to the absolute power of God to do anything that does not involve a logical contradiction. This power is not bound by the current ordained order and allows for miracles and alterations to the established laws of nature. Scotus emphasized that God's absolute power allows Him to act beyond or even against the established natural laws.\n\n**Application to the Virgin Birth and Related Concepts:**\n\nWhile direct application to the virgin birth is a logical extension, Scotus famously used this framework to defend the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. He argued that God, through his *potentia absoluta*, could apply the merits of Christ's future sacrifice to Mary at the moment of her conception, thus preserving her from original sin. This demonstrates God acting outside the established order of sin being passed down. The same theological principle applies to the virgin birth of Jesus, which is a miracle that stands outside the natural laws of human reproduction. It is an act of God's *potentia absoluta*.\n\n**Application to the Fall:**\n\nDuns Scotus also applied this framework to explain changes in the natural and moral order after the Fall of man. He argued that before the Fall, a law of nature existed where all things were held in common. However, after the Fall, this law was revoked and the institution of private property was established. Scotus reasoned that this change was necessary for a peaceful society given humanity's sinful nature. This demonstrates a change in the *potentia ordinata*—the ordained laws governing humanity—as a result of a pivotal theological event. God, using his *potentia absoluta*, could establish a new set of ordained laws suitable for the post-Fall world.\n\nThe distinction between these two powers was not invented by Scotus, with roots tracing back to earlier medieval theology. However, theologians like Scotus and later William of Ockham were instrumental in its development and application to explain miracles, divine freedom, and the contingency of the created order. Scotus, in particular, is noted for using this distinction to articulate how God could act in ways that were not bound by the established laws of nature, making it a fitting framework for understanding both the miracle of the virgin birth and the altered state of natural law after the Fall.\n\n<<<John Duns Scotus>>>"
