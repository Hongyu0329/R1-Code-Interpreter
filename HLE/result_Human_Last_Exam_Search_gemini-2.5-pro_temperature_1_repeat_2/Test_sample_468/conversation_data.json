    "The common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bees\". This name has been increasingly adopted in recent years to describe these small bees.\n\nThe name \"fairy bees\" was suggested on Twitter and subsequently popularized by entomologists. In a 2017 interview, entomologist Dr. Joseph Wilson mentioned that they had \"been calling them fairy bees lately,\" indicating the name was coined shortly before that time. This is supported by a 2022 forum post mentioning a rumor that the name originated on Twitter. Therefore, the name was coined around 2017.\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2017>>>"
