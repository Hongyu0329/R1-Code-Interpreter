    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Mechanism of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide reacting with potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromo group and the methyl group are *trans* to each other. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an anti-periplanar, or *trans*-diaxial, arrangement. This means both the bromine and the hydrogen atom must occupy axial positions, pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as two rapidly interconverting chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    *   **Conformation B:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\n    Conformation B is more stable because the bulky methyl group occupies the more sterically favorable equatorial position. The E2 reaction will primarily proceed from this more stable conformer where the bromine atom is axial.\n\n4.  **Product Formation:** With the bromine in an axial position (e.g., pointing down), the base must remove a β-hydrogen that is also in an axial position (pointing up).\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The hydrogen on the same carbon as the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position because the methyl group is equatorial. Therefore, this hydrogen cannot be eliminated via the E2 mechanism as it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** The adjacent carbon C6 has an axial hydrogen. This hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n    Consequently, the potassium tert-butoxide will abstract the axial hydrogen from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n5.  **Regioselectivity:** This reaction is a classic example where the stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism override Zaitsev's rule. Zaitsev's rule would predict the formation of the more substituted and more stable alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene. However, because there is no anti-periplanar hydrogen on C2, this product cannot be formed. The reaction is forced to form the less substituted alkene, 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
