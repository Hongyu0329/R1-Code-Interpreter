The comprehensive management for the patient involves immediate stabilization of her diabetes and oral trauma, followed by the fabrication of an immediate removable partial denture for aesthetic and healing purposes. The cells of interest are primarily those involved in bone and soft tissue healing, such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and fibroblasts. For long-term replacement, a cast metal (Cobalt-Chromium or Titanium) removable partial denture is recommended. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and left second premolar, with additional support from the right canine and a right molar to ensure cross-arch stabilization, which is critical given her skeletal profile.
