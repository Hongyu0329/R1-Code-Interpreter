    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can express this number in scientific notation. Let $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. We want to find the form of $x$ as $m \\times 10^n$, where $1 \\le m < 10$. The first two non-zero digits are the first two digits of $m$.\n\nFirst, we take the base-10 logarithm of $x$:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nWe need the values of $7^{13}$ and $\\log_{10}(e)$.\n$7^{13} = 96,889,010,407$\nThe value of $\\log_{10}(e)$ is approximately 0.4342944819.\n\nNow, we multiply these two values:\n$\\log_{10}(x) \\approx -96,889,010,407 \\times 0.4342944819$\n$\\log_{10}(x) \\approx -42,080,294,350.3$\n\nLet's write $\\log_{10}(x)$ with its integer and fractional parts:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = -42,080,294,351 + 0.7$\nSo, we can express $x$ as:\n$x = 10^{-42,080,294,351 + 0.7}$\n$x = 10^{0.7} \\times 10^{-42,080,294,351}$\n\nThe number of leading zeros is $42,080,294,350$. To find the first two non-zero digits, we need to calculate the value of $10^{0.7}$.\n\n$10^{0.7} = 10^{7/10} = \\sqrt{10^7} = \\sqrt{10,000,000}$\n\nWe can estimate this value. We know that $3^2 = 9$ and $3^{10} = 59049$. Also, $5^{10} = 9,765,625$. This suggests that $10^{0.7}$ is close to 5.\n\nLet's calculate $10^{0.7}$:\n$10^{0.7} \\approx 5.011872336$\n\nSo, $x \\approx 5.011872336 \\times 10^{-42,080,294,351}$.\n\nThe first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are the first two digits of 5.011872336, which are 5 and 0.\n\n<<<50>>>"
