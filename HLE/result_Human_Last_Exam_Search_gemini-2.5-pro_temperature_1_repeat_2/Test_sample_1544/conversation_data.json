    "The position is defined by the FEN string: `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`. This is an endgame scenario where White is to move.\n\n**Analysis of the Position:**\n\n*   **White's advantages:** White possesses a strong passed pawn on d6, which is only two squares away from promotion. The white queen on f2 is actively placed.\n*   **Black's advantages:** Black's queen on c5 exerts pressure and controls important squares. The black king is actively placed at c6.\n*   **White's objective:** The most direct path to victory for White is to capitalize on the passed d-pawn.\n\n**Optimal Move for White:**\n\nThe most decisive move for White is to force an exchange of queens, which will transition the game into a winning pawn endgame.\n\nThe best move is **Qxc5+**.\n\nThis move forces Black to recapture the queen, leading to two main variations:\n\n1.  If Black plays `...bxc5`, White follows up with `d7`. The passed pawn on d7 is unstoppable and will promote to a new queen on the next move, leading to a winning position for White.\n2.  If Black plays `...Kxc5`, White again plays `d7`. The black king, now on c5, is too far away to prevent the pawn from promoting.\n\nIn both scenarios, White achieves a winning endgame. Any other move by White would allow Black to create counterplay and complicate the path to victory. By forcing the queen trade, White simplifies the position into a clearly won game.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
