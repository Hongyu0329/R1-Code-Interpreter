    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThe poem in question is from the epilogue of the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" for which Voznesensky wrote the libretto. The opera tells the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807).\n\nRezanov was a key figure in the project of Russian colonization of Alaska and California. He died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning from his travels. The question from Voznesensky's poem, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" reflects the historical fact that Rezanov's original grave and its marker were destroyed during the Soviet era. The answer to this question emerged as his story gained renewed fame, and his presumed remains were eventually reburied. A new memorial was dedicated at his grave in Krasnoyarsk on October 28, 2000.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
