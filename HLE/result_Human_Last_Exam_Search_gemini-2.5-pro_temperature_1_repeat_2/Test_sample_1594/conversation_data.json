    "The buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini, located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa, form the letter 'H' when viewed from above.\n\nThe Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, with its two entrances at numbers 32 and 34, and the adjacent Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" at number 36, are housed in interconnected buildings. The schools are so close, in what is known as the \"Via dei Licei\" (the street of the high schools), that they share an internal courtyard. This architectural layout, with the two main school buildings forming the vertical bars and the connecting elements forming the horizontal bar, creates the distinct shape of the letter 'H' from an aerial perspective.\n\n<<<H>>>"
