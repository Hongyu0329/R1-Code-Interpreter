    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a specific relationship between two objects of $\\Delta$. The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. An adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that satisfy a particular compatibility condition.\n\nIn the context of posets, this adjunction is known as a Galois connection. The condition for two monotone maps $L$ and $R$ to form such a connection between posets $P$ and $Q$ is that for all $p \\in P$ and $q \\in Q$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(p) \\le q \\iff p \\le R(q)$.\n\nThis single condition is equivalent to the more general 2-categorical definition of an adjunction involving unit and counit 2-morphisms. In $\\Delta$, where the objects are the finite linear orders $[n]$, this condition has a further simplification.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For the specific structure of $[m]$, this simplifies to the condition that $L(0) = 0$. Similarly, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets), which simplifies to the condition that $R(n) = m$.\n\nTherefore, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy $L(0)=0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: \\to$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of $24$ integers:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element of the sequence. Thus, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars or multiset coefficients.\n\nWe are choosing 23 numbers (the values of $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements, with replacement, and the order in which we choose them does not matter as they will be arranged into a unique non-decreasing sequence. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\left(\\!\\!{k \\choose n}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn this case, $k=23$ (the number of items to choose) and $n=38$ (the number of distinct values available). The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThis number can be calculated as:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 4,733,328,211,432,063,680 $$\n\nAlternatively, we could count the number of right adjoint maps $R: \\to$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. This requires counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ with values in $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has 24 elements. This is a choice of 37 numbers from 24 possibilities, given by $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. By the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$, confirming the result.\n\n<<<4733328211432063680>>>"
