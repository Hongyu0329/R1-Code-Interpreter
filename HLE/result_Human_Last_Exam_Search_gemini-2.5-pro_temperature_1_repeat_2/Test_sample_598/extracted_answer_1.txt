Yes, such a pair of graphs exists. An example can be found in the class $\mathsf{srg}(28, 12, 6, 4)$, which contains the triangular graph $T(8)$ and the three Chang graphs. These four graphs are non-isomorphic and co-spectral, but they have different clique numbers, and it is known that they also have different numbers of 5-cycles.
