The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and is dependent on the specific catalytic application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a nickel content of approximately 10-12.5 wt% in Ni/CeOâ‚‚ catalysts has been shown to be effective. For water splitting, the optimal ratio varies further with the specific reaction: for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 have been found to be highly active, while for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a 1:2 Ni/Ce molar ratio has demonstrated optimal performance.
