    "### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio in Catalysis Varies by Application\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel (Ni) to cerium (Ce) in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends significantly on the specific application, such as the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting. Research indicates that different optimal ratios exist for each of these processes, influenced by the reaction conditions and the specific catalyst formulation.\n\n#### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio can vary. Studies have shown that Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with a nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt% exhibit high carbon monoxide (CO) conversion. Specifically, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni showed nearly identical, high conversion rates of CO to CO₂ at 400°C.\n\nIn the context of the reverse WGS reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been reported. Another study focusing on Ni-W-Ce mixed-metal oxide catalysts found that a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ displayed the highest catalytic activity. This highlights that the presence of other elements in the catalyst can alter the ideal Ni/Ce balance.\n\n#### Water Splitting\n\nThe optimal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting also varies depending on the specific electrochemical reaction being targeted—either the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).\n\nFor the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, a key step in water splitting, catalysts with atomic ratios of Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ and Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ have demonstrated superior performance. The enhanced activity in these catalysts is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n\nFor the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a different optimal ratio has been identified. A recent study on electrolytic water splitting using Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (which corresponds to a Ni to Ce ratio of 1:2) exhibited the best HER performance.\n\nFurthermore, a computational study investigating Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for water splitting suggested that a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** provides a more favorable adsorption energy and, consequently, better overall catalytic properties for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target reaction. For the WGS reaction, a nickel content of around 10-12.5 wt% appears effective. For water splitting, a higher nickel content (e.g., 3:1 or 1:1 Ni/Ce) seems beneficial for the OER, while a higher ceria content (1:2 Ni/Ce) is favored for the HER. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring the catalyst composition to the specific catalytic application.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and is dependent on the specific catalytic application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a nickel content of approximately 10-12.5 wt% in Ni/CeO₂ catalysts has been shown to be effective. For water splitting, the optimal ratio varies further with the specific reaction: for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ni/Ce ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 have been found to be highly active, while for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a 1:2 Ni/Ce molar ratio has demonstrated optimal performance.>>>"
