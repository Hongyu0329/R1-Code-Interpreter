    "The number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is 16.\n\nThis type of curve is known as a Lissajous curve. For a Lissajous curve with parametric equations of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a specific formula.\n\nWhen 'a' and 'b' are coprime (having no common divisors other than 1) and both are odd, the number of self-intersections is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nIn this case, a = 9 and b = 5. Both are odd integers and they are coprime. Applying the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
