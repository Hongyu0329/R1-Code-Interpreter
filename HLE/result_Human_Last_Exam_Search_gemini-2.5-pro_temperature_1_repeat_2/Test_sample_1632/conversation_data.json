    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, denoted as a(n) for an n-step walk, is a fundamental problem in combinatorial mathematics and physics. For a two-dimensional square lattice, also sometimes referred to as a Manhattan lattice, the number of self-avoiding walks has been calculated for various lengths through computational methods.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the number of possible distinct paths, a(10), is 44,100. The number of self-avoiding walks grows exponentially with the number of steps, and there is no simple formula to calculate it for any given n. The values for small n are found through direct computer enumeration.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice begins with:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n\nContinuing this sequence, the value for a(10) is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
