    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function in the nuclear criticality community is most commonly referred to as the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q,ω)*.\n\nIn the context of nuclear data and reactor physics codes, this quantity is also known as the **thermal scattering law**, or simply the **scattering law**, represented as *S(α,β)*. The parameters α and β are dimensionless variables for momentum and energy transfer, respectively, and are related to the momentum transfer *q* and energy transfer *ω*.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position *r* at a time *t*, given that another particle was at the origin at time *t*=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the collective motion and correlations within the system.\n\nIn the specific application of zero-power reactor noise analysis, the temporal Fourier transform of the neutron-neutron correlation function (a specific type of pair correlation) is known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** or **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)** when considering correlations between two different detectors. These are fundamental quantities in frequency-domain noise analysis methods. However, the term that encompasses both the spatial and temporal Fourier transform is the dynamic structure factor.\n\nIn summary, while terms like Power Spectral Density are used for the temporal Fourier transform in noise analysis, the broader and more formal term for the space-time double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function within the nuclear community is the dynamic structure factor or scattering law.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
