    "A power subgroup of a group G, denoted as G^k, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. To determine the number of distinct power subgroups for the semidihedral group of order 512, SD_512, we must analyze its structure.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 2^n, denoted SD_{2^n}, has the presentation:\n⟨r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)⟩\n\nFor the semidihedral group of order 512, we have 2^n = 512, so n = 9. The presentation is:\nSD_512 = ⟨r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127⟩\n\nThe elements of SD_512 are of the form r^i and r^i * s for 0 ≤ i < 256. A power subgroup G^k is generated by the set {g^k | g ∈ G}.\n\nThe analysis of the power subgroups G^k for different integer values of k reveals the following distinct subgroups:\n\n*   **G^k for odd k:** When k is an odd integer, the power subgroup G^k is the entire group SD_512 itself. This is because the mapping g -> g^k is a permutation of the group elements, and thus the set of k-th powers generates the whole group.\n\n*   **G^k for even k:** Any even integer k can be expressed as k = 2^j * m, where m is an odd integer and j ≥ 1. For any group G, G^k = (G^(2^j))^m. Since the power subgroups G^(2^j) are cyclic for j ≥ 1 (as shown below) and m is odd, (G^(2^j))^m = G^(2^j). Therefore, we only need to consider the power subgroups for powers of 2.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are generated by k = 2^j for j ≥ 0:\n\n*   **G^1 (j=0):** This is the entire group, SD_512.\n*   **G^2 (j=1):** The squares of the elements are of the form (r^i)^2 = r^(2i) and (r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i). The subgroup generated by these elements is ⟨r^2, r^128⟩, which simplifies to ⟨r^2⟩, a cyclic subgroup of order 128.\n*   **G^4 (j=2):** The fourth powers are (r^i)^4 = r^(4i) and (r^i*s)^4 = 1. These generate the subgroup ⟨r^4⟩, which is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n*   **G^(2^j) for j ≥ 2:** For j ≥ 2, the (2^j)-th power of any element of the form r^i*s is the identity element. Therefore, G^(2^j) is generated by {r^(i*2^j)}, which is the cyclic subgroup ⟨r^(2^j)⟩.\n\nThis pattern continues, yielding a series of distinct cyclic subgroups:\n*   G^8 = ⟨r^8⟩, of order 32\n*   G^16 = ⟨r^16⟩, of order 16\n*   G^32 = ⟨r^32⟩, of order 8\n*   G^64 = ⟨r^64⟩, of order 4\n*   G^128 = ⟨r^128⟩, of order 2\n*   G^256 = ⟨r^256⟩ = {1}, the trivial subgroup.\n\nHigher powers of 2, such as G^512, will also result in the trivial subgroup.\n\nIn summary, the distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of order 512 are:\n1.  SD_512\n2.  ⟨r^2⟩ (Cyclic group of order 128)\n3.  ⟨r^4⟩ (Cyclic group of order 64)\n4.  ⟨r^8⟩ (Cyclic group of order 32)\n5.  ⟨r^16⟩ (Cyclic group of order 16)\n6.  ⟨r^32⟩ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n7.  ⟨r^64⟩ (Cyclic group of order 4)\n8.  ⟨r^128⟩ (Cyclic group of order 2)\n9.  {1} (The trivial subgroup)\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we find there are a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
