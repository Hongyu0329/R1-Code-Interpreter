    "The problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the set S = {1, 2, ..., 823564528378596} ordered by the divisibility relation. This is a question in the field of extremal poset theory.\n\nA set that is a union of *k* antichains is also known as a *k*-Sperner family. A key property of a *k*-Sperner family is that it does not contain a chain of length *k*+1. For the divisor poset on the set {1, 2, ..., *n*}, a chain is a sequence of numbers a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ such that a₁ divides a₂, which divides a₃, and so on.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum size of a subset of {1, 2, ..., *n*} that does not contain a chain of length 21. A standard method to solve this involves partitioning the set {1, 2, ..., *n*} into disjoint chains. Any integer *x* in this range can be uniquely written as *x* = *m* * 2ᵏ, where *m* is an odd number. For a fixed odd number *m*, the set of numbers Cₘ = {*m*, 2*m*, 4*m*, ...} that are less than or equal to *n* forms a chain under the divisibility relation. The entire set {1, ..., *n*} can be partitioned into such chains, one for each odd number *m* ≤ *n*.\n\nA union of 20 antichains can have at most 20 elements from each of these disjoint chains Cₘ. Therefore, to find the size of the largest such set, we can take, from each chain Cₘ, as many elements as possible, up to a maximum of 20. The number of elements in a specific chain Cₘ is given by floor(log₂(*n*/ *m*)) + 1. Thus, for each odd number *m*, we can include min(20, floor(log₂(*n*/ *m*)) + 1) elements in our set.\n\nThe total size is the sum of these values over all odd numbers *m* from 1 to *n*. This sum can be calculated more efficiently by changing the order of summation. The total size is equal to the sum, from *j* = 1 to 20, of the number of odd integers *m* such that the chain Cₘ has at least *j* elements. A chain Cₘ has at least *j* elements if *m* ≤ *n* / 2ʲ⁻¹.\n\nThe number of odd integers less than or equal to a given value *M* is floor((*M* + 1) / 2). Applying this, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is given by the summation:\n\nSize = Σⱼ₌₁²⁰ floor( (*n* / 2ʲ⁻¹ + 1) / 2 )\n\nGiven *n* = 823564528378596, the calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   For j=1: floor((823564528378596 / 1 + 1) / 2) = 411782264189298\n*   For j=2: floor((823564528378596 / 2 + 1) / 2) = 205891132094649\n*   For j=3: floor((823564528378596 / 4 + 1) / 2) = 102945566047325\n*   ...and so on, up to j=20.\n\nSumming these 20 terms gives the final result.\n\nThe calculated sum of these terms is 823,563,742,966,258.\n\n<<<823563742966258>>>"
