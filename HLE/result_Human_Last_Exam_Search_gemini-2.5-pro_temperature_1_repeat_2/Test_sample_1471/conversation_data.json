    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\nThe first number is MMCMLXXVI.\n*   **MM** represents 2000 (1000 + 1000).\n*   **CM** represents 900 (1000 - 100).\n*   **LXX** represents 70 (50 + 10 + 10).\n*   **VI** represents 6 (5 + 1).\nAdding these values together, MMCMLXXVI is equal to 2976.\n\nThe second number is MCMXCIX.\n*   **M** represents 1000.\n*   **CM** represents 900 (1000 - 100).\n*   **XC** represents 90 (100 - 10).\n*   **IX** represents 9 (10 - 1).\nAdding these values together, MCMXCIX is equal to 1999.\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction with the modern numbers:\n2976 - 1999 = 977\n\n<<<977>>>"
