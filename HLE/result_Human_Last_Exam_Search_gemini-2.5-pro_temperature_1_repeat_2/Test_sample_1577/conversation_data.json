    "The ground space degeneracy of a topological code like the toric code is determined by the number of logical qubits it can encode, with the degeneracy being `2^k` for `k` logical qubits. The number of logical qubits is in turn determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. This topology is characterized by its genus (the number of \"handles\", denoted by `g`) and the number and type of its boundaries (holes).\n\nFor a closed surface with no holes, the ground state degeneracy is `4^g` (or `2^(2g)`). The question specifies a system with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. In the context of surface codes, \"holes\" are typically punctures on a planar surface, which is topologically equivalent to a sphere (genus `g=0`). For a sphere, the `2^(2g)` term is `2^0 = 1`, so the degeneracy comes entirely from the holes.\n\nWe need to determine how many logical qubits are introduced by each type of hole.\n1.  **Smooth (or closed) holes:** Logical operators can be defined by loops around these holes. A key result states that for a planar lattice (topologically a sphere with one initial boundary) punctured with `b` closed (smooth) holes, the code encodes `k = b` logical qubits. Therefore, `n` smooth holes contribute `n` logical qubits, giving a factor of `2^n` to the degeneracy. This is also supported by the statement that each \"puncture\" (a hole) doubles the ground-state degeneracy.\n\n2.  **Rough (or open) holes:** For rough boundaries, logical operators are typically defined by strings that connect two different rough boundaries. Let's consider a planar surface with `m` rough holes. The plane itself has an outer boundary. If this outer boundary is also rough, we have a total of `m+1` rough boundaries. We can form `m` independent logical string operators by connecting one reference boundary (e.g., the outer one) to each of the `m` inner rough holes. This set of operators defines `m` logical qubits.\n\nThe logical operators associated with smooth holes and those associated with rough holes are of different types (typically Z-type loops for smooth and X-type strings for rough) and act independently. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits contributed by each type of hole.\n\nTotal logical qubits `k` = (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes) = `n + m`.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is `2^k`, which results in `2^(n+m)`.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
