    "In a game of chess, the objective described is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of the board without any of them being able to attack one another. To determine how many edge squares would be left empty, we first need to understand the layout of a chessboard and the movement of bishops.\n\nA standard chessboard has 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The edge squares are those that form the perimeter of the board. An 8x8 board has 28 edge squares. This is calculated by summing the squares on the top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and the squares on the leftmost and rightmost files, excluding the corners which have already been counted (6 + 6 = 12), for a total of 28 squares.\n\nBishops in chess move and attack diagonally. A crucial aspect of their movement is that a bishop placed on a light-colored square can only ever occupy and attack other light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark-colored square is restricted to dark-colored squares. The 28 edge squares are evenly divided between 14 light-colored and 14 dark-colored squares.\n\nTo place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares so that none can attack each other, they must all be placed on squares of the same color. This is because bishops on squares of the same color do not share any diagonal paths. Therefore, one could place a bishop on each of the 14 light-colored edge squares, and no two bishops would be able to attack each other. The same logic applies to the 14 dark-colored edge squares.\n\nThus, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14. One common arrangement to achieve this maximum is to place seven bishops on one of the outside files (e.g., the 'a' file) and the other seven on the opposite outside file (e.g., the 'h' file).\n\nWith a total of 28 edge squares available and 14 of them occupied by bishops, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the difference between these two numbers.\n\n28 total edge squares - 14 placed bishops = 14 empty edge squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
