    "The question asks for the number of grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot that have the minimal grid number, counted up to translation and rotation.\n\nFirst, we must determine the minimal grid number for a trefoil knot. The trefoil knot, listed as 3₁ in the Alexander-Briggs notation, is the simplest non-trivial knot and has a crossing number of three. It is also an alternating knot. For alternating knots, the minimal grid number, also known as the arc index (α), is equal to its crossing number (c) plus two (α = c + 2). Therefore, the minimal grid number for the trefoil knot is 3 + 2 = 5. This means we are looking for the number of distinct 5x5 grid diagrams.\n\nThe left-handed and right-handed trefoils are mirror images of each other, and as such, they will have the same number of minimal grid diagrams. A review of knot theory literature reveals the enumeration of these diagrams. One study presents a figure that explicitly shows all the minimal grid diagrams for the right-handed trefoil knot. There are 6 such distinct diagrams shown.\n\nGiven that the number of diagrams is the same for the mirror image, the left-hand trefoil knot also has 6 minimal grid diagrams, counted up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<F>>>"
