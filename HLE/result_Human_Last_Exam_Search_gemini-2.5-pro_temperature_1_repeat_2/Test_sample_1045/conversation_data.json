    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we must first analyze the number of functions applied to each atom.\n\nFor each Carbon (C) atom, a heavy atom:\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** One contracted function is used, composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The valence orbitals are split. This means two functions are used for each valence atomic orbital. Since there is one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz), this applies to four orbitals.\n    *   The inner part uses one set of four contracted functions (one for 2s, three for 2p), each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The outer part uses another set of four functions, each consisting of a single primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** This results in 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted basis functions.\n\nFor each Hydrogen (H) atom:\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital and is split into two functions.\n    *   The inner part is a contracted function made of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The outer part is a single primitive Gaussian function.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** This gives 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2 contracted basis functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total for toluene (C7H8):\n*   **7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total contracted functions:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
