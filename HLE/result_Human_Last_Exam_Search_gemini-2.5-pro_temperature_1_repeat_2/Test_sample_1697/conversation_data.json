    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two functional groups on a benzene ring: an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and a dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at the meta position relative to the amide.\n    *   **Lithiating agent:** `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium) is a very strong base used to deprotonate weakly acidic protons, such as those on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Ligand:** `TMEDA` (Tetramethylethylenediamine) is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion. This breaks down the aggregates in which organolithium reagents often exist and increases the basicity and reactivity of the `sec-BuLi`.\n    *   **Solvent:** `THF` (Tetrahydrofuran) is a standard ether solvent for organometallic reactions.\n    *   **Electrophile:** `CH₃I` (Methyl iodide) provides a methyl group to be added to the nucleophilic site created in the first step.\n\n2.  **First Step: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**\n    *   Directed ortho-metalation is a reaction where a substituent on an aromatic ring, known as a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), directs a strong base to remove a proton from the position directly adjacent (ortho) to it. The DMG functions by coordinating to the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent, bringing the basic butyl group into proximity of the ortho proton.\n    *   In the starting material, both the N,N-diethylcarboxamide (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino (-NMe₂) groups can act as DMGs. However, the tertiary amide group is one of the most powerful directing groups for this reaction, significantly stronger than a tertiary amine group.\n    *   The -CONEt₂ group at position C1 directs lithiation to C2 and C6. The -NMe₂ group at position C3 directs lithiation to C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the amide is the stronger directing group, and both groups can direct to the C2 position, deprotonation will occur regioselectively at the C2 position. This is the position that is ortho to the strongest directing group (-CONEt₂) and meta to the weaker one (-NMe₂).\n    *   The reaction with `sec-BuLi` and `TMEDA` therefore removes the hydrogen atom at C2, creating a highly nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n3.  **Second Step: Electrophilic Quench**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate, with a negatively charged carbon at the C2 position, acts as a strong nucleophile.\n    *   It then reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a methyl group to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, is first lithiated at the C2 position due to the powerful directing effect of the adjacent amide group. The resulting aryllithium is then methylated by reaction with methyl iodide.\n\nThe final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
