    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no specific character who visits a Roman city and then describes their religious practices in a way that readers would recognize as a reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel is centered on the conflict between the Germanic Goths of the Mark and the invading Roman Empire, the Goths' knowledge of Roman cities and customs is based on reports and hearsay, not on any character's firsthand travel and observation. For example, a Wolfing warrior describes a Roman city he has heard of as a place of immense wealth and strong fortifications.\n\nThe allusion to Romulus and Remus within the narrative is more symbolic. The Wolfings venerate the wolf as their kindred emblem. Scholarly interpretations of the novel suggest that the invading Romans are depicted as appropriating this wolf symbolism, which is a clear reference to the foundational myth of Rome where the twin founders, Romulus and Remus, were suckled by a she-wolf. This thematic appropriation underscores the imperialistic nature of the Romans in the story.\n\nTherefore, the reference to Romulus and Remus is an authorial device rather than a direct account from a character within the story who has visited a Roman city.\n\n<<<No such character exists in the novel.>>>"
