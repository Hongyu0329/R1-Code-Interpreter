    "The provided SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` represents a complex acetal, specifically a type of orthoester known as a bicyclo orthoester. Adding this compound to an aqueous solution containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), a strong acid, will lead to its hydrolysis.\n\nThe hydrolysis of an acetal or ketal in acidic water breaks the molecule down into a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone) and alcohol or diol components. The overall reaction in this case is the breakdown of the starting material into three separate, more stable products.\n\nBased on the fragments present in the SMILES string, the hydrolysis products are:\n1.  **Benzaldehyde**: Derived from the `C(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` portion of the molecule.\n2.  **1,2-Propanediol**: Derived from the `CC12...` portion.\n3.  **Formaldehyde**: Derived from the `...COC...` bridge.\n\nTo determine the product with the higher molar mass, we compare the molar masses of these three resulting compounds:\n\n*   **Benzaldehyde** (C₆H₅CHO): Has a molar mass of approximately 106.12 g/mol.\n*   **1,2-Propanediol** (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH): Has a molar mass of approximately 76.10 g/mol.\n*   **Formaldehyde** (H₂CO): Has a molar mass of approximately 30.03 g/mol.\n\nComparing these values, benzaldehyde is the product with the highest molar mass.\n\n<<<O=Cc1ccccc1>>>"
