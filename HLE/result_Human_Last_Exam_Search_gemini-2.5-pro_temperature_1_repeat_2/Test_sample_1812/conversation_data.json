    "The initial question asks for the determinant of a specific matrix, which is identified as the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\). The provided matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe calculation of the determinant of this matrix is straightforward:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\nThe context provided about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" suggests a connection to the Markov equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz. The integers (x, y, z) that solve this Diophantine equation are called Markov numbers. These numbers can be arranged in a tree structure, starting from the solution (1, 1, 1). The term \"quiver\" in this context relates to cluster algebras, where a quiver is a directed graph used to define an algebraic structure. The Markov quiver is a specific quiver with 3 vertices, and it is related to the Markov equation. The adjacency matrix of a quiver is a representation of the connections between its vertices. However, for the specific matrix provided in the user's request, the determinant is 0, regardless of the underlying theory of Markov quivers.\n\n<<<0>>>"
