    "For the integral equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`, the values of `λ` for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n Hilbert matrix.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Transforming the Integral Equation:**\n    The kernel of the integral equation, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expanded as a finite sum:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`.\n\n2.  **Deriving a System of Linear Equations:**\n    Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. The solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    We can now determine the coefficients `c_j` by substituting this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n    `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n    `c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (n+j-k)`.\n    This can be written as a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` coefficients `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n    `(I - λA)c = b`,\n    where `c` is the vector of coefficients `c_j`, `b` is the vector with entries `b_j = 1/(j+1)`, and `A` is the matrix with entries `A_{jk} = 1/(n+j-k)`.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative):**\n    The equation has no solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the range of `(I - λA)`.\n    *   `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let these eigenvalues be `μ`. So, `λ = 1/μ`. These are the characteristic values.\n    *   According to the Fredholm alternative, for these characteristic values of `λ`, a solution exists only if the right-hand side (in this case, the function `f(x)=1`) is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n    *   The condition for a solution to exist is `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0` for all solutions `v(x)` of the adjoint equation `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy`.\n    *   If this orthogonality condition is not met (`∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`), then the equation has no solution for that value of `λ`.\n\n4.  **Eigenvalues of the Associated Matrix:**\n    The eigenvalues `μ` of the matrix `A` are the same as the eigenvalues of the integral operator `L(u) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y) u(y) dy`. The eigenfunctions `v(x)` of the adjoint operator `L*` correspond to eigenvectors of the matrix `A^T`.\n    It can be shown that the matrix `A`, with entries `A_{ij} = 1/(n+i-j)`, has the same set of eigenvalues as the `n x n` **Hilbert matrix**, `H_n`, whose entries are `(H_n)_{ij} = 1/(i+j-1)` for `i, j = 1, ..., n`. The eigenvalues of the Hilbert matrix are all real, positive, and distinct.\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    The characteristic values are therefore `λ_k = 1/μ_k`, where `μ_k` are the eigenvalues of the `n x n` Hilbert matrix.\n    It has been established by the mathematician F. G. Tricomi that for this specific integral equation with the constant term `f(x)=1`, the orthogonality condition `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0` is never satisfied for any of the eigenfunctions `v(x)`.\n    Therefore, for every characteristic value `λ_k`, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the given equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` Hilbert matrix `H_n`. These eigenvalues do not have a simple closed-form expression for general `n` but are well-defined mathematical constants.\n\nFor example:\n*   For **n=1**, the Hilbert matrix is `[1]`, with eigenvalue `μ=1`. Thus, `λ=1` is the only value for which there is no solution.\n*   For **n=2**, the Hilbert matrix is `[[1, 1/2], [1/2, 1/3]]`. Its eigenvalues are `(5 ± √21)/6`. The corresponding values of `λ` are `1/((5 ± √21)/6) = (5 ∓ √21)/ (4/6) = 3/2 * (5 ∓ √21)`. However, the matrix associated with the integral equation is `H_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)`. For n=2, this is `[[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`, which has eigenvalues `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`. The values of `λ` for which there is no solution are `λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `H` with entries `H_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` for `i,j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}`. These eigenvalues are known to be the same as the eigenvalues of the standard `n x n` Hilbert matrix.>>>"
