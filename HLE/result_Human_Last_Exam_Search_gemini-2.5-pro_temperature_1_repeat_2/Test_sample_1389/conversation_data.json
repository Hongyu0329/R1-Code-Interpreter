    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Model:** In this model, a vaccine provides complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest receive no protection at all and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. For instance, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would make 80% of recipients fully immune and leave the other 20% completely susceptible.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the incidence rate of the disease in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine efficacy is commonly calculated as 1 - IRR.\n\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This refers to the reduction in risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen.\n    *   In the all-or-nothing model, the \"per-exposure efficacy\" is not uniform across all vaccinated individuals. For the proportion that is fully protected, the per-exposure efficacy is 100%. For the proportion that is not protected, the per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n    *   Therefore, the *average* per-exposure efficacy for the entire vaccinated population is the proportion of people who are fully protected.\n\n*   **The Calculation:**\n    1.  Let 'p' be the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected. The remaining (1-p) proportion is fully susceptible.\n    2.  Let 'λ' be the incidence rate (or force of infection) in the unvaccinated group.\n    3.  In the vaccinated group, only the (1-p) unprotected individuals are at risk. Their incidence rate is the same as the unvaccinated group, λ.\n    4.  The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is the rate among the susceptible portion multiplied by the fraction of the group that is susceptible: (1-p) * λ.\n    5.  The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is (Incidence Rate in Vaccinated) / (Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated) = [(1-p) * λ] / λ = 1-p.\n    6.  Therefore, vaccine efficacy calculated as 1 - IRR is equal to 1 - (1-p) = p.\n\nSince 'p' represents both the proportion of people fully protected and the average per-exposure efficacy in an all-or-nothing model, the `1 - IRR` metric correctly estimates this value. This relationship holds true, particularly when the incidence rate is low and vaccine-induced immunity does not wane over time.\n\n<<<C>>>"
