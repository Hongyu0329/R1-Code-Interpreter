    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA complete classification of such groups was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". This classification reveals several specific finite groups as well as infinite families of groups that possess this property. A set S within a group G is product-free if for all elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nThe existence of infinitely many such groups is primarily due to the presence of infinite families in the classification. These families are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups (C_n):** There are several infinite families of cyclic groups `C_n` that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2. These families are typically defined by Diophantine equations relating the order of the group `n` to a parameter `k`. For instance, cyclic groups of order `n = k^2 - k + 1` for any integer `k > 2` form one such family (e.g., C_7, C_13, C_21, ...). Other examples of such families are `C_n` where `n = k^2 + 1` (e.g., C_5, C_10, C_17, ...), `n = k^2 - 1` (e.g., C_8, C_15, C_24, ...), and `n=k^2` (e.g., C_9, C_16, C_25, ...).\n\n*   **Direct Products of Cyclic Groups:** The family of groups `C_2 x C_2n` for any integer `n >= 2` also contains maximal product-free sets of size 2.\n\nIn addition to these infinite families, the classification also identifies a number of specific \"sporadic\" finite groups. Some of these include:\n\n*   **Abelian Groups:** `C_2 x C_2`, `C_3 x C_3`, `C_4`, `C_6`, and `C_8`.\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups:** The dihedral groups `D_6` (of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group `S_3`) and `D_10` (of order 10), and the quaternion groups `Q_8` (of order 8) and `Q_12` (of order 12).\n\nIt is worth noting that some of these specific groups may also belong to one of the infinite families. For example, `C_8` is in the sporadic list and is also a member of the infinite family `C_n` where `n = k^2-1` (for `k=3`).\n\nThe presence of even one of these infinite families is sufficient to conclude that the number of finite groups with maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 is not finite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
