    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system with a scalar order parameter (belonging to the Ising universality class) is calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion.\n\nThe key steps in this calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Upper Critical Dimension:** The upper critical dimension (d_c), above which mean-field theory correctly describes the critical exponents, is 4 for this type of system.\n\n2.  **Epsilon Expansion:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique that calculates critical exponents as a power series in ε = d_c - d, where d is the spatial dimension. For a system with a spatial dimension of d=3, the parameter ε is:\n    ε = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n3.  **First-Order Calculation:** To the first order in ε, the scaling exponent α for a model with an n-component order parameter is given by:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\n\n    For the specific case in question, which involves a scalar order parameter (like the Ising model), we use n=1. The formula simplifies to:\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * ε = 3 / 18 * ε = ε / 6\n\n4.  **Result for d=3:** Substituting ε = 1 into the first-order expansion formula gives the value for the specific heat exponent α:\n    α = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, as determined by the first-order epsilon expansion, is approximately 0.167.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
