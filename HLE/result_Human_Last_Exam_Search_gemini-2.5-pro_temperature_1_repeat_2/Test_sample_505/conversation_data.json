    "### Two Patches of Surface Code with Two Holes Can Host a Maximum of 10 Logical Qubits\n\nIn the landscape of quantum error correction, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded within a given physical system is a crucial metric. For two patches of surface code, each featuring two holes, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is ten. This is achieved by employing advanced techniques involving \"mixed-boundary\" holes.\n\nA standard approach to encoding logical qubits in a surface code involves creating pairs of \"closed\" holes, where each pair typically encodes a single logical qubit. Following this convention, a single patch with two closed holes would correspond to one logical qubit, and therefore two such patches would encode a total of two logical qubits. Some literature also suggests that in a planar code with *b* closed holes, it's possible to encode *b* logical qubits, which would mean two logical qubits for a single patch and four for two patches.\n\nHowever, more advanced methodologies, known as generalized surface codes, allow for a much denser packing of quantum information. These methods utilize holes with different types of boundaries, such as \"open\" and \"closed\" boundaries, within the same surface code patch. A notable example is the \"mixed diamond-hole surface code,\" where a single patch with just two of these specialized holes can encode as many as five logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, when considering the maximum potential, two patches of this advanced surface code could each encode five logical qubits. This culminates in a total of ten logical qubits for the two patches combined. The precise number of logical qubits is intricately linked to the topology of the surface, including its genus, and the specific nature and configuration of the holes and their boundaries.\n\n<<<10>>>"
