    "**The earliest securely dated record of a date by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is the \"7 Deer\" glyph, discovered at the Maya site of San Bartolo in Guatemala. This notation, corresponding to a day in the 260-day sacred calendar, dates to between 300 and 200 BCE.**\n\nThis significant archaeological find provides the most definitive evidence of a recorded date in the ancient Americas. The glyph was found on painted mural fragments excavated from the Las Pinturas pyramid complex. The discovery is crucial for understanding the development of Mesoamerican writing, science, and religion, indicating that the Maya were using this calendrical system at a very early period.\n\nWhile other artifacts have been proposed as containing earlier writing or dates, their interpretations and chronologies are subject to ongoing scholarly debate. The Cascajal Block, an Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, is a candidate for the oldest writing in the Americas, but it does not contain a recognizable calendrical date.\n\nAnother Olmec artifact, a cylinder seal from San Andrés dated to approximately 650 BCE, bears symbols that some researchers have interpreted as the day \"3 Ajaw.\" However, this interpretation is not universally accepted, with some scholars suggesting the symbols may be iconographic rather than a true date.\n\nSimilarly, Monument 3 from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote features a glyph that is interpreted as the calendrical name \"1 Earthquake.\" While initially dated to as early as 600 BCE, this dating has been contested, with more recent analyses suggesting it may date to a later period, around 100 BCE.\n\nTherefore, the \"7 Deer\" glyph from San Bartolo stands as the earliest widely accepted, directly dated evidence of a recorded date in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<7 Deer>>>"
