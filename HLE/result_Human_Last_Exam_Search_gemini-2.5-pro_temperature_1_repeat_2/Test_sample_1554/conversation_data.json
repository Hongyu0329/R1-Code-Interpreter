    "Tadeusz Pawłowski, a philosopher associated with the second generation of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals.\n\nThis conceptual breakdown is part of his broader work in semiotics and the methodology of the humanities. In his analyses, Pawłowski explored how concepts are formed and defined, particularly within the cultural sciences. His work delves into the different types of indicators that can be used to identify or characterize a phenomenon.\n\nWhile a direct English translation of his detailed decomposition is not readily available in the search results, his work, such as his 1980 book *Begriffsbildung und Definition* (Concept Formation and Definition), and his writings on the semiotic theory of culture, touch upon these distinctions. A reference in a work on affective avant-gardism explicitly lists \"symptoms, impressions, signals, accounts\" in connection with Tadeusz Pawłowski's work, pointing to his analysis of different forms of evidence and signification.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Pawłowski>>>"
