    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to find the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $d$ is $53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of the factor characters $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the factor characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We require this order to be 6.\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $n$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet $N(p, k)$ be the number of non-trivial characters modulo $p$ of order $k$. For $k>1$, this is $\\phi(k)$ if $k | (p-1)$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe need to calculate this for each prime factor of $d=53599$:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$: $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders of non-trivial characters can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    *   $N(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_2 = 13$: $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders of non-trivial characters can be 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.\n    *   $N(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_3 = 19$: $\\phi(19) = 18$. The orders of non-trivial characters can be 2, 3, 6, 9, or 18.\n    *   $N(19, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N(19, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N(19, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_4 = 31$: $\\phi(31) = 30$. The orders of non-trivial characters can be 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, or 30.\n    *   $N(31, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   $N(31, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   $N(31, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the lcm of the orders of the four characters to be 6, their orders must be divisors of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 6). Since the characters must be non-trivial, their orders can be 2, 3, or 6. Furthermore, for the lcm to be 6, there must be at least one character of order 6, or at least one of order 2 and one of order 3.\n\nLet $n_k$ be the number of characters of order $k$.\n*   $n_1=0$ (non-trivial condition).\n*   $n_2 = N(7,2) \\times N(13,2) \\times N(19,2) \\times N(31,2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$. Let's call this set $C_2$.\n*   $n_3 = N(7,3) \\times N(13,3) \\times N(19,3) \\times N(31,3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$. Let's call this set $C_3$.\n*   Let $C_{2,3}$ be the set of characters where orders can be 2 or 3. The number of such characters is $(1+2)(1+2)(1+2)(1+2) = 81$.\n*   Let $C_{2,3,6}$ be the set of characters where orders can be 2, 3, or 6. The number of such characters is $(1+2+2)(1+2+2)(1+2+2)(1+2+2) = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6, minus those that only have orders from {2,3}.\nThe number of characters with orders only from {2,3} is calculated from the set $C_{2,3}$, which is 81. This includes characters where all orders are 2 (1 case) and where all orders are 3 (16 cases), and where there is a mix of orders 2 and 3. The lcm in this mixed case is 6.\n\nLet's re-evaluate using a clearer method. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)=6$.\nThe orders $k_i$ must divide 6, so $k_i \\in \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Since characters are non-trivial, $k_i \\neq 1$.\nThe total number of choices for characters with orders dividing 6 is:\n$(N(7,2)+N(7,3)+N(7,6)) \\times (N(13,2)+N(13,3)+N(13,6)) \\times (N(19,2)+N(19,3)+N(19,6)) \\times (N(31,2)+N(31,3)+N(31,6))$\n$= (1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) \\times (1+2+2) = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis counts characters where the lcm of orders is 1, 2, 3, or 6.\nWe must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n*   lcm = 1: Not possible since characters are non-trivial.\n*   lcm = 2: All characters must have order 2. Number of ways: $N(7,2)N(13,2)N(19,2)N(31,2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   lcm = 3: All characters must have order 3. Number of ways: $N(7,3)N(13,3)N(19,3)N(31,3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with orders dividing 6, minus those with orders dividing 2, and minus those with orders dividing 3.\nNumber of characters with orders dividing 2 (i.e., order 2, since non-trivial): $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nNumber of characters with orders dividing 3 (i.e., order 3, since non-trivial): $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nTotal = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
