    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**1. Degree of the composed polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nA fixed point of $h(x)$ is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$. This can be rewritten as $h(x) - x = 0$.\nLet $P(x) = h(x) - x$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9. A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**2. Conditions on the derivatives**\n\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nLet $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$.\nThe derivatives are $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ and $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$.\n\nFor these quadratic functions to be always positive, they must be parabolas opening upwards with no real roots. This implies:\n*   The leading coefficients must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$ and $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$.\n*   The discriminants must be negative:\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThe conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n**3. Achievability of 9 fixed points**\n\nTo determine if 9 fixed points are achievable, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n\nIn our case, $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. If $P(x)$ has 9 real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\nLet's find the derivative of $P(x)$:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n\nThe roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\nLet's analyze the expression $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$:\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a composition of polynomials of degrees 2 and 3, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a product of polynomials of degree 6 and 2, so its degree is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. The equation $P'(x) = H(x) - 1 = 0$ can have at most 8 real roots.\nThis means it is possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots, which in turn means it is possible for $P(x)$ to have $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\nTo achieve 9 roots, we need to show that there exist polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the given conditions such that the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\nThis is equivalent to the 8th-degree polynomial $H(x)$ having 8 local extrema (relative to the line y=1), which requires its derivative, $H'(x)$, to have 7 distinct real roots.\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n\nLet's check the degree of $H'(x)$:\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n*   $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n*   $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n*   $f'(y)$ is degree 2.\n*   $f''(y)$ is degree 1.\n\nThe degree of the first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, is $\\text{deg}(f''\\circ g) + 2\\deg(g') = (1 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 2) = 7$.\nThe degree of the second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, is $\\text{deg}(f'\\circ g) + \\deg(g'') = (2 \\times 3) + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe leading terms do not cancel out in general. Thus, $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots. Therefore, it is possible for $H(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x)$ to have 7 local extrema, which would allow the equation $H(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct real roots.\n\nIf we can find $f$ and $g$ such that $P'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct real roots $r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_8$, these will be the locations of the local extrema of $P(x)$.\nThe values at these extrema are $P(r_i) = f(g(r_i)) - r_i$.\nWe can adjust the constant term of $f(x)$, let's say $a_0$. Let $f_c(x) = f(x) + c$. This does not change $f'(x)$, so $H(x)$ and the locations of the extrema $r_i$ remain unchanged. However, the function $P(x)$ becomes $P_c(x) = P(x) + c$. By choosing a suitable value for $c$, we can shift the graph of $P(x)$ vertically to ensure that the values at the local extrema alternate in sign: $P_c(r_1)>0$, $P_c(r_2)<0$, $P_c(r_3)>0$, and so on. This configuration guarantees that $P_c(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\nSince it is mathematically possible to construct such polynomials, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n"
