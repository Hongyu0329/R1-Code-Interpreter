    "The core of this question lies in the fundamental techniques that differentiate the five standard ballroom dances. Four of the dances listed—Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep—are \"swing\" dances. The European Tango is the exception.\n\nIn swing dances, movement is characterized by continuous flow, momentum, and rise and fall. While a \"by the book\" reverse turn has a defined amount of rotation, the swinging momentum makes it physically possible to add more rotation (overturn), even if it's not standard syllabus technique. Advanced dancers often modify rotation for choreography and floorcraft. For example, a Slow Foxtrot Hover Telemark can be overturned at a corner. Similarly, the amount of turn in a Viennese Waltz can be altered to navigate the dance floor.\n\nThe European Tango, however, is built on a completely different foundation. Its technique is characterized by:\n*   **No Swing or Sway:** Movement in Tango is flatter and more direct, without the swinging momentum and body sway that helps generate and control rotation in the other dances.\n*   **Staccato Action:** Tango movements are sharp and precise, with feet picked up and placed, rather than flowing continuously.\n*   **Unique Hold and Connection:** The Tango hold is more compact, and the connection is sharp and direct, which is not conducive to the continuous, flowing rotation an overturn would require.\n\nA Reverse Turn in Tango is a specific, progressive figure with a defined structure and character. Attempting to \"overturn\" it—that is, to add continuous, swinging rotation beyond the figure's definition—would violate these core principles. The dancer would have to abandon the staccato action, introduce swing and sway, and break the characteristic Tango hold. In doing so, the figure would cease to be a Tango Reverse Turn; the fundamental technique would be disregarded.\n\nTherefore, it is in the European Tango that overturning a reverse turn is impossible without violating the dance's essential technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
