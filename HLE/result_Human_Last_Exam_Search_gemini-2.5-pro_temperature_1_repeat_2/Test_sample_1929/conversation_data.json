    "The reaction between butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a cycloaddition product. While the Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition, is common between dienes and alkenes, the reaction with highly fluorinated alkenes like 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is more complex.\n\nIn this specific case, the reaction can yield two types of products:\n*   **A [2+2] cycloaddition product:** This pathway is often favored kinetically, especially with fluoroalkenes. The reaction proceeds through a diradical intermediate to form a four-membered ring. The major product observed is **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane**.\n*   **A [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) product:** This reaction pathway forms a more thermodynamically stable six-membered ring. The product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. This product is typically formed as a minor product or under conditions of thermodynamic control (such as higher temperatures).\n\nTherefore, while both reactions are possible, studies indicate that the kinetically favored [2+2] cycloaddition is the predominant pathway, making 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane the primary product under standard conditions.\n\n<<<The primary product is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoro-3-vinylcyclobutane, formed via a [2+2] cycloaddition. The [4+2] Diels-Alder adduct, 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene, can also be formed as a minor product.>>>"
