In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k such that G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where the poles of G_0 directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.
