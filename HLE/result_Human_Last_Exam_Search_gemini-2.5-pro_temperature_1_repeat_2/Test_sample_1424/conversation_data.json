    "### Bare Green's Function's Dependence on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum space representation of G₀.\n\nThe bare Green's function describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system. Its functional form is typically expressed as the inverse of the difference between the frequency (or energy) of the particle and its corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space is given by:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sign(ϵ_k - μ))***\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum k. This term encapsulates the energy dispersion of the particle.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which sets the reference energy level (the Fermi energy at zero temperature). The term ξ_k = ϵ_k - μ is often used to denote the energy relative to the chemical potential.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal term (with δ → 0⁺) that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of the Green's function. The sign of this infinitesimal term depends on whether the state k is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThe key aspect of this functional dependence is that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, for a given momentum k, G₀(k, ω) diverges when ω approaches ϵ_k. This divergence signifies a stable, single-particle excitation with energy ϵ_k.\n\nIn a more general matrix notation, where the basis states are the eigenstates of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the bare Green's function matrix is diagonal, with each diagonal element corresponding to a specific single-particle state *i* with energy eigenvalue ϵᵢ:\n\n***G₀,ij(ω) = δᵢⱼ / (ω - ϵᵢ)***\n\nHere, δᵢⱼ is the Kronecker delta, indicating that in the absence of interactions, a particle in a state *i* will only propagate in that same state.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is that G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and ϵ_k. The set of all ϵ_k values for different momenta k defines the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function, which in turn characterizes the energy spectrum of the non-interacting system.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k such that G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency ω and ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where the poles of G_0 directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k.>>>"
