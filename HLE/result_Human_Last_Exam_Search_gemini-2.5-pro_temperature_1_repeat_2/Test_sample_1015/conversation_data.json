    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. This difference is a manifestation of the core principles that differentiate the two ballet techniques.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and strong torso. The technique prioritizes proper alignment and the coordinated use of the entire body, with a focus on stability originating from a strong back and core. This principle of a square torso generally extends to movements like cambré derrière, where the hips are expected to remain aligned with the shoulders.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for its distinctive lines and creation of length, which often involves a departure from strict, squared-off positions. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style is an open arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is lifted and opened towards the audience to create the illusion of a longer line. This technique often incorporates swaying hips. Since a cambré derrière can be executed from an arabesque or a similar position, this fundamental difference in hip placement is a key differentiator. The Balanchine approach encourages a more dynamic, three-dimensional spiral from the waist up, which includes this open hip position.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend are also stylistic distinctions between the two methods, the deliberate opening of the hip in the Balanchine technique is a fundamental departure from the Vaganova emphasis on a squared torso and is the most significant difference in the execution of a cambré derrière. The Balanchine style is characterized by its speed and athleticism, as well as deep backbends, with George Balanchine himself reportedly encouraging dancers to \"lean more…bend more\". The Vaganova method, while also demanding flexibility, focuses on a more controlled and expressive movement quality. Arm and head positions also differ, with Vaganova emphasizing graceful, coordinated port de bras and head movements and Balanchine at times using more unconventional and asymmetrical arm placements. However, the hip placement is the most foundational and distinguishing difference in this specific movement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
