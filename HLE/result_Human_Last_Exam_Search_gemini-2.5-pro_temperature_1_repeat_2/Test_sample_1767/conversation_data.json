    "### The Chern Number of the Junction is 0\n\nWhen two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction itself is 0.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by an integer topological invariant known as the Chern number (C). This number dictates the quantity of chiral edge states—conducting channels that exist at the boundary of the material. These edge states are topologically protected, meaning they are robust against certain types of disorder.\n\nAccording to the bulk-boundary correspondence principle, chiral edge states also form at the interface between two materials with different Chern numbers. The number of these conducting channels at the junction is determined by the absolute difference between the Chern numbers of the two adjacent regions, denoted as |C₁ - C₂|.\n\nIn the scenario presented, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1 (C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1). Therefore, the number of chiral edge states at the junction is:\n\n|C₁ - C₂| = |1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis result signifies that no new topologically protected conducting channels are formed at the interface. The entire combined system effectively behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1, but the junction itself is topologically trivial. This is supported by studies of topological junctions which indicate that when the Chern numbers of the adjacent domains are identical, no new edge states are expected at the interface.\n\n<<<0>>>"
