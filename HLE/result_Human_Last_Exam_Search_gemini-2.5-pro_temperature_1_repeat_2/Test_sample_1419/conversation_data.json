    "The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is found by calculating the beta function of the coupling constant and identifying its non-trivial zero. The calculation is performed in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, where ϵ is a small parameter.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling constant, commonly denoted as g or u, in the ϕ⁴ theory is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\nwhere B is a constant that depends on the normalization of the coupling constant and the fields. For the O(N) model, a common form of the constant is B = (N+8)/(8π²). For the single-component ϕ⁴ theory (N=1), this gives B = 9/(8π²).\n\nHowever, different conventions for the coupling constant in the Lagrangian (e.g., u/4! φ⁴, u/4 φ⁴, or u/2 φ⁴) lead to different numerical factors in the beta function. A widely used result in literature, for a coupling 'g' in the interaction term gφ⁴/4!, gives the beta function as:\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (3g²)/(16π²)\n\nThe fixed point coupling, g*, is found by setting the beta function to zero, β(g*) = 0. This gives a non-trivial fixed point (for g* ≠ 0):\n-ϵg* + (3g*²)/(16π²) = 0\ng* = (16π²ϵ)/3\n\nThis result shows that the fixed point coupling is of order ϵ. This non-trivial fixed point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The existence of this fixed point is crucial for understanding the universal scaling behavior of systems at their critical point.\n\nAnother common convention uses a coupling constant λ, leading to a fixed point value of λ* = (8π²ε)/3. The difference in the numerical factor is due to the different normalization of the coupling constant.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²ε)/3>>>"
