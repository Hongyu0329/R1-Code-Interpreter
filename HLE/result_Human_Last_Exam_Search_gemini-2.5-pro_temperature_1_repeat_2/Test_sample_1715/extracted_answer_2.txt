Tommy's Estate legally owns **Lot B** with Tax Map number **1234567890** and trailer number **1234567890.1**.

James has a significant legal problem. He occupies Lot A but does not have a recorded deed for it, putting his ownership at risk. His recorded deed is for Lot B, which he does not own, and the lien he took out is attached to that property, making the lien defective. To resolve this, James should consult with a real estate attorney immediately to file a corrective deed for Lot A and address the issue of the lien with his lender.
