    "Based on the information available, there is no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950.\n\nThroughout its long history, the square has undergone several significant transformations. In the 15th century, Pope Eugenius IV ordered the removal of a maze of sheds and small shops that had encroached upon the Pantheon. Later, in 1575, the fountain in the center of the piazza, the Fontana del Pantheon, was constructed. This was followed by the addition of the Egyptian obelisk to the fountain in 1711 under Pope Clement XI.\n\nOne of the most notable removals of an architectural feature occurred in 1883, when the two small bell towers on the Pantheon, often derisively called the \"ass's ears,\" were demolished. These had been added in the 17th century. There were also plans in the 19th century to enlarge the piazza, which would have involved the demolition of some surrounding buildings, but these plans were never fully realized.\n\nWhile historical records detail these and other changes, such as the removal of a fish and vegetable market at the end of the 19th century, there is no mention of a specific architectural element being removed by the city administration in 1950.\n\n<<<I am unable to find any information about a unique architectural feature that was removed from Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. Historical records detail other modifications to the square at different times, but none coincide with the year specified in your query.>>>"
