    "The reflection group of type H3 is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. The Coxeter number (h) for H3 is 10.\n\nAn element of a reflection group is considered \"regular\" if it possesses a \"regular eigenvector,\" which is a vector not located on any of the group's reflection hyperplanes. A significant result in the theory of reflection groups states that for an irreducible, well-generated group like H3, the elements that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue that is a primitive h-th root of unity are precisely the Coxeter elements of the group.\n\nThe question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10. Since the Coxeter number for H3 is 10, an eigenvalue of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity. Therefore, the elements satisfying the condition are the Coxeter elements of H3.\n\nTo find the number of these elements, we can determine the size of the conjugacy class of Coxeter elements. For an irreducible finite Coxeter group, the following holds:\n*   All Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other, forming a single conjugacy class.\n*   The centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself.\n*   The order of a Coxeter element is equal to the Coxeter number, which is 10 for H3.\n\nThe number of elements in a conjugacy class is the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of any element in that class.\n\nGiven:\n*   The order of the H3 group is 120.\n*   The order of the centralizer of a Coxeter element is the order of the element itself, which is 10.\n\nTherefore, the number of Coxeter elements is:\nNumber of elements = (Order of H3 group) / (Order of the centralizer of a Coxeter element) = 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nThere are 12 elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<12>>>"
