    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. An induced subgraph on a set of vertices C is a clique if the subgraph is a complete graph.\n\nLet S be the set of integers k such that there exists an induced subgraph of G that is a clique of size k. We want to find the maximum possible size of S.\n\nLet ω(G) be the clique number of G, which is the size of the largest clique in the graph. If a graph G contains a clique of size ω(G), let's call the set of its vertices C_max. Any subset of C_max with j vertices will also form a clique. The subgraph induced by this j-vertex subset is also a complete graph.\n\nThis means that if a graph has a clique of size k, it necessarily has induced subgraphs that are cliques for all sizes from 1 to k. Consequently, the set of all possible clique sizes in a graph G is {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number, ω(G).\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. For any graph G with n vertices, the clique number ω(G) cannot exceed n. In our case, n = 128, so the maximum possible clique number is 128.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted as K_128. In K_128, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Therefore, any subset of k vertices forms a clique of size k. This means that for K_128, there are induced subgraphs that are cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n\nFor the complete graph K_128, the set of clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of different clique sizes is 128. Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
