    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient.\n *\n * Problem Constraints:\n * - Two strings of the same length.\n * - String length is between 1 and 100, inclusive.\n * - Strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n *\n * Memory Efficiency Strategy:\n * 1. Read the first string into a buffer. This is unavoidable as we need to\n *    compare its characters against the second string's characters. The maximum\n *    length is 100, so a buffer of 101 bytes (for the null terminator) is required.\n * 2. Read the second string one character at a time, avoiding the need for a\n *    second large buffer.\n * 3. Use the smallest possible data types for variables. A 'char' (1 byte) is\n *    sufficient for a loop counter up to 100, saving memory compared to a\n *    standard 'int' (typically 4 bytes).\n * 4. Perform comparisons directly without storing intermediate results (like the\n *    lowercase versions of characters) in extra variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer for the first string. 100 chars + 1 null terminator = 101 bytes.\n    // This is the largest and only array needed.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // A loop counter. 'char' is used instead of 'int' because the maximum\n    // string length (100) fits within the range of a char.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to store a single character from the second string.\n    char c2;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Loop until the end of the first string is reached. Since both strings are\n    // guaranteed to have the same length, this loop correctly iterates over both.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read one character of the second string. The leading space in \" %c\"\n        // is critical; it consumes any whitespace (like the newline character\n        // between the two inputs) before reading the next non-whitespace character.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters from both strings.\n        // Casting to (unsigned char) is a safe practice for ctype functions.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit immediately once the lexicographical order is determined.\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit immediately.\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character index.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables. On a typical system, the sizes are as follows:\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: This is an array of 101 characters. Since `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, this array consumes **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char i;`**: This variable is used as a loop counter. A `char` consumes **1 byte**.\n*   **`char c2;`**: This variable holds a single character from the second string. A `char` consumes **1 byte**.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` is:\nm = (size of s1) + (size of i) + (size of c2)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
