    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion depends on the specific basis chosen to represent the terms. However, a standard and basis-independent measure is the number of linearly independent coefficients, which is equal to the dimension of the degree 10 component of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\nThis dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n`l_n(d) = 1/d * sum_{k|d} mu(k) * n^(d/k)`\nwhere:\n*   `d` is the order (degree), which is 10 in this case.\n*   `n` is the number of generators, which is 2 for the standard BCH expansion of log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>).\n*   `mu(k)` is the Möbius function.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors of `d`.\n\nThe divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The values of the Möbius function are:\n*   `mu(1) = 1`\n*   `mu(2) = -1`\n*   `mu(5) = -1`\n*   `mu(10) = mu(2*5) = (-1)^2 = 1`\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`l_2(10) = 1/10 * (mu(1)*2^(10/1) + mu(2)*2^(10/2) + mu(5)*2^(10/5) + mu(10)*2^(10/10))`\n`l_2(10) = 1/10 * (1 * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1)`\n`l_2(10) = 1/10 * (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)`\n`l_2(10) = 1/10 * (990)`\n`l_2(10) = 99`\n\nThus, there are 99 linearly independent coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\n\nIt is worth noting that in specific bases, the number of *nonzero* coefficients can be smaller. For example, in the Lyndon basis, there are systematic zeros for even-degree terms. For degree 10, it has been shown that there are 44 vanishing coefficients, leaving 55 non-zero coefficients. Conversely, in other bases, such as a Hall basis, nearly all of the 99 coefficients are non-zero. The number 99 represents the total number of independent terms at this order.\n\n<<<99>>>"
