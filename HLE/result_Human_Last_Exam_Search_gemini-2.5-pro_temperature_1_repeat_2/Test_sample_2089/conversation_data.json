    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is **Midnight Cowboy**.\n\nIn the poignant final scene of the 1969 film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is on a bus with his friend Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), who is seriously ill. As they head to Florida, a concerned Joe tells Ratso he's a \"great-looking stud.\" After a moment, Ratso quietly says, \"Thank you.\" This is his last line in the film. Shortly after, Joe realizes that Ratso has passed away in his sleep during the journey, thus sealing his tragic fate.\n\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three: Best Picture, Best Director for John Schlesinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman received nominations for Best Actor for their roles.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
